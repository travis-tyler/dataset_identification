For this research, first-generation college students were generally defined as those individuals who were the first in their family to attend an institution of higher education (Ghazzawi & Jagannathan, 2011). Knowledge generated from this study led to the development of suggested practices for college admissions professionals as well as educators who support low-income, first-generation African American students to be shared with practitioners both locally and nationally. This chapter begins with a statement of the problem, along with evidence from the literature that supports prior studies on this topic. The significance of the study is discussed next, drawing connections to potential beneficiaries of the work, followed by the research question and sub-questions. Finally, the theoretical framework that serves as a lens for the study is introduced and explained."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "Nationwide, students from underrepresented populations often lack the financial means to fund their college education. Elliot and Friedline (2013) assert that 54% of African American students at four-year colleges and universities seek out loans as the main source to fund their education. Students who are not provided guidance about how to best navigate the federal financial-aid process may be less willing to pursue a college degree due to fear and uncertainty regarding how they will pay their loans (McKinney & Novak, 2012). Baker, Andrews, and McDaniel (2017) write that within higher education, race and socioeconomic status cause a gap in who can and cannot attend college. The authors write that \"minority students [are] less likely to attend postsecondary education [and] less likely to attend highly selective institutions when they do enroll\" (Baker, Andrews, & McDaniel, 2017, p. 2). Parents become a vital part of an individual's college choice given that many students rely on parents to provide guidance through the application and aid processes (Elliott, Brenneman, Carney, & Robbins, 2015). In a study conducted by Elliot et al. (2015), the authors found that parents of first-generation college students supported and encouraged their children to attend college but were not able to provide them guidance or assistance with the process. The literature discusses how students perceive the aid process, as well as how their expectations of financial aid informs their academic achievement, college enrollment, and college choice (Perna & Steele, 2011). How students perceive the financial-aid process can lead to misinformation or misunderstanding about financial-aid opportunities, which can close the doors to a college degree very early on in a student's academic career. If, in middle school or high school, students are not given enough support with understanding this process, they may begin to lose motivation to succeed, or, when faced with the decision to apply to college, they may select an institution which is below their academic ability (Reddick, Welton, Alsandor, Denyszyn, & Platt, 2011). Therefore, this study sought to understand how low-income, firstgeneration African American students who attend college analyzed information and found support when navigating the college-admissions process, as well as how these individuals weighed the costs and benefits of attending college."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Research Question", "text": "The rationale for this study was the researcher's interest in expanding the understanding of how information and outreach can be utilized to better support and guide low-income, firstgeneration African American high-school students through the college-admissions process to close the gap on who does and does not attend college. Elliot and Friedline (2013) conducted a study to determine the cost burden and the role of race and income on college enrollments. Using a longitudinal study, they concluded that African American students are the least likely population to have family assist them with paying the costs associated with college (Elliott & Friedline, 2013). African American students are not attending college at the same rate as their White counterparts, which has a negative impact on global, national, and local levels (Baber & Graham, 2015;Jerrim, Chmielewski, & Parker, 2015). When qualified high-school graduates obtain a college degree, doors are opened for them in terms of job opportunities and future earnings. In 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for African Americans with a bachelor's degree is far lower than those with a high-school diploma only; 5.2 percent versus 17.2 percent respectively (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015). Additionally, the median weekly earnings for those with only a high-school diploma was $668 per week while those with a bachelor's degree earned $1,193, a $525 per week difference (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015). When individuals are not supported with the information they need to pursue a bachelor's degree, society misses out on their knowledge and contributions. Baber and Graham (2015) write that economic trends mean that \"two-thirds of all jobs in the United States will require a postsecondary degree by 2018\" (p. 6). If this population of students is not educated in high school about the benefits of college and provided guidance about the financial-aid system, they are robbed of a degree that will assist them with finding a job within a competitive market. As tuition costs continue to rise and state appropriations to colleges in the form of aid decreases, students have to make the difficult choice between taking on debt to pursue a degree or forgoing a college degree and entering directly into the workforce (Baker, Andrews, & McDaniel, 2017). In addition to the economic benefits of a college degree, individuals who are unable to attend college are not exposed to opportunities to expand one's thinking and personal growth (Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016). The development that occurs on college campuses, both inside and outside of classrooms provides students with personal knowledge and ideals, which effects how they contribute as a citizen. In 2008, the American College Personal Association (ACPA) updated the 1994 Student Learning Imperative (SLI) which describes the benefits of attending college in terms of the personal and cognitive development of an individual. As listed in the 2008 SLI, the hallmarks of a college-educated person are: \"(a) complex cognitive skills such as reflection and critical thinking; (b) an ability to apply knowledge to practical problems encountered in one's vocation, family, or other areas of life; (c) an understanding and appreciation of human differences; (d) practical competence skills (e.g., decision making, conflict resolution); and (e) a coherent integrated sense of identity, self-esteem, confidence, integrity, aesthetic sensibilities, and civic responsibility\" (The Student Learning Imperative, 2008, p. 1). At the national level, implications of this study could shine a light on the inequality and inequity that currently exist in the federal financial-aid program as well as on the cost to attend both public and private institutions. The problem does not just lie in a student's ability to attend college but also in the access for them to attend the college of their choice. It is problematic when a student has the academic achievements to attend a given college, but their inability to finance their education or navigate the federal financial-aid process keeps them from attending. In a 2013 study, economists Eleanor Dillon and Jeffrey Smith found evidence that some highachieving, low-income students are more likely to attend a college ranked below their academic ability due in part to financial constraints. Families who are not educated about the financial-aid process and the costs and benefits associated with attending college are not able to support and guide their children about obtaining a college degree, and this can cause doors to remain closed for these students and future generations (Fack & Grenet, 2015). The focus of this study was low-income, first-generation African American students, as research has shown that these individuals typically possess the least amount of knowledge about the college admission process, specifically compared to their White counterparts (Perna & Steele, 2011). As a result of the outcomes of this research, college admissions offices and high-school guidance counselors may become better informed about the benefits of outreach programs and additional support programs for those students who lack guidance through the admissions process. Families of these students can be offered greater tools and knowledge to allow them to support their students through the admissions process and better understand the financial-aid process (Ghazzawi & Jaannathan, 2011). Ultimately, it should be society's goal to assist students in feeling a greater confidence as they begin considering a college degree."}, {"section_title": "Positionality", "text": "Using Machi and McEvoy's (2012) writing as a guide, I reflected on my positionality as it relates to my chosen problem of practice. The first step in creating a problem of practice is discovering an issue or interest that one may wish to further explore. Machi and McEvoy (2012) state that \"personal interest comes from an individual's need to know more about a specific subject\" (p.15). I have been a student-affairs professional for fourteen years, and during that time I have been interested in the rising cost of higher education and how those rising costs effect college accessibility. When selecting a research topic, it is important to address an issue or need that is relevant to the larger academic community (Machi & McEvoy, 2012). My experiences, exposure to this topic, and interests led me to pursue this topic through research. Socioeconomic status. I grew up in a suburb of Boston that many would view as uppermiddle class. My father's salary allowed my mother to not have to work outside the home, and we lived comfortably. When I was researching colleges, my family and I never spoke about tuition costs or financial aid; they simply wanted me to find a college where I would be happy and gain a solid education. The college I attended was a small, private, moderately priced college in Massachusetts, and my family and I didn't need to apply for financial aid. I recognize that my experiences with funding my college degree are very different from the individuals who I wish to research. As a researcher, this can affect my ability to truly understand the problem, because going to college was never a hesitation for me; therefore, I cannot adequately articulate the struggles of financing one's education (Briscoe, 2005). I have never filled out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, but I have read literature about the difficulty that many face while navigating this process. Briscoe (2005) would argue that the ability to \"perceive, understand, and represent the lives\" (p. 25) of those who have had this experience will be more difficult given my lived experiences. High-school support. I attended public high school. Although my high school was not nationally ranked, it would be safe to say that the administration and faculty provided a solid education and adequately prepared students for a college degree. Upon more reflection, I think that it was expected that everyone in my high school would attend college. Welton and Martinez (2013) write that \"high schools bear a considerable amount of the responsibility to ensure that students receive the necessary supports and complete the necessary tasks to be able to access and be ready for college \" (p. 198). My high school guidance counselor met with me regularly to discuss my plans for college and provided me with information about institutions. I also recall faculty speaking to my classmates and me about the SATs and being there to support us when preparing for the exam. Race. I am White. It would be na\u00efve to not recognize my race and the role that it played in my ability to obtain a college education. There is privilege regarding access to information and resources regarding college enrollment as a White individual. While in high school and attending college visits, no one ever questioned my intellectual and financial ability to attend college. It was always assumed by my teachers, family, and fellow students that I would. This is a part of my White privilege. Role as a scholar-practitioner. My life experiences place me in the category of the privileged few who did not worry about the cost of a degree, and my work experiences expose me to the struggle and stress that rising college tuition and room and board costs have created. I can sympathize with those who struggle to finance their degrees but my life experiences do not allow me to empathize with them. My interest in this research subject stemmed from seeing students who are academically qualified yet struggling to pay for tuition. My career has been spent at private institutions that have ranged from moderately to high priced. A common characteristic of these institutions is a small population of African American students. In my current role, I often see our African American students struggle more in balancing coursework with financial and personal responsibilities outside of campus than other populations."}, {"section_title": "Research Problem and Research Questions", "text": "Due to a lack of education while in high school about how the costs of college weigh against personal and future earnings benefits of pursuing a degree, low-income, first-generation African American students are attending college at a lower rate than their White counterparts (Lim, Heckman, Letkiewicz, & Montalto, 2014). There are a variety of reasons why this population is represented in lower numbers in higher education. These reasons include parental understanding and involvement, support and resources within high school, lack of financial support, and a systemic bias (Perna & Steele, 2011). To explore a lack of representation in college of low-income, first-generation African American students and ultimately contribute to the increase in enrollment of this population, the following research question and sub-questions were explored."}, {"section_title": "Overarching Research Questions", "text": "The purpose of this study was to discover what information and support existed for low-income, first-generation African American students which led them to make the decision to attend college.

In a 1981 text, Hillel Einhorn and Robin Hogarth, from the Center for Decision Research at the University of Chicago, described Behavioral Decision Theory. Einhorn and Hogarth developed a theory which compared optimal decisions against human judgment. First the authors defined optimality as \"decisions or judgments that maximize or minimize some explicit and measurable criterion (e.g. profits, errors, time) conditional on certain environmental assumptions and a specified time horizon\" (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981, p. 55). The importance of this definition is that it highlights the conditional nature of optimality, meaning that internal and external factors can affect our ability to make an optimal decision. The following sections describe how Einhorn and Hogarth see optimal decisions play out in a variety of environments. Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) write that for most people, decision-making is a complex process which involves multiple goals or criteria, and in some cases these criteria can be in conflict. When faced with conflict, an individual must make the best decision they can with the information they have available to them. An individual may begin the decision-making process with one goal in mind, but as time progresses and additional goals are developed, some can conflict with the original goal; therefore, the optimal decision-making process is delayed (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) described how the environment and the space in which a decision exists can affect the outcome. In addition, the authors state that individuals will seek aids or experts when making decisions if the stakes are high enough. Einhorn and Hogarth's point is predicated on any given individual knowing what they don't know, as well as being aware that others know what they need to know. Individuals need to be in a place where they understand what information is missing to help them decide and from where or whom they can obtain that information. Einhorn and Hogarth also write about the role that biology has in decision making, citing the example of biological limitations having an impact on decisionmaking. How and in what environment individuals are raised can have an impact on their ability to make an optimal decision when faced with competing criteria and goals."}, {"section_title": "Task v. Optimal Model of Task", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Environment v. Problem Space", "text": "An important aspect of Behavioral Decision Theory is context, referring to both the formal structure and the context of the task (decision) (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). The authors describe the context as an important aspect of Behavioral Decision Theory because it provides the meaning that is vital to decision-making. Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) write that an aspect of context is \"what the person brings to the task in the way of prior experience via learning, and biological limitations on attention, memory, and the like, that affect learning\" (p. 61). In other words, personal experience as well as one's ability to process and understand information becomes a vital component of behavioral decision-making."}, {"section_title": "Critics of Behavioral Decision Theory", "text": "A critique of Einhorn and Hogarth's Behavioral Decision Theory centers around the concept of ambiguity, or more specifically, how individuals deal with ambiguity when making behavioral decisions. In Einhorn and Hogarth's theory, there is a tendency by an individual to shy away from risk when ambiguity exists (Main, 1990;Highhouse & Hause, 1995). Einhorn and Hogarth noted that individuals deal with ambiguity in numerous ways, which also accounts for differing levels of risk aversion (Highhouse & Hause, 1995). Another critique of Behavioral Decision Theory is that Einhorn and Hogarth do not consider individuals who gravitate towards risk and how this can affect behavior (Main, 1990;Highhouse & Hause, 1995). Highhouse and Hause (1995) posit that individuals may make a decision because there is a high level of risk which the individual feels would be more beneficial for their goals. A secondary critique of Behavioral Decision Theory stems from the idea of cues in decision-making. Decisions are made in part by how various cues and pieces of information influence the decision maker (Williams, 1985). Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) found that an increase in cues resulted in the decrease of decision-making consistency. In contract, Beverly Anderson (1977) found that there was no change in decision-making consistency as the number of cues increased (Williams, 1985). Additionally, Stuart Oskamp (1965) found that decision makers were more confident in their choices with the more information they had (Williams, 1985). The critiques of Anderson and Oskamp demonstrate a breakdown in how much information is important when making a decision. Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) write about the importance of information and the ability for an individual to acquire and understand information. Acquisition is the ability to seek out information and store it for use throughout the decision-making process (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). Central to the ability to acquire information is the ability to pay attention to details as individuals decipher and understand problems. The authors note that the ability to pay attention is enhanced if an individual has a familiarity with the subject matter, meaning a better understanding of what information will be most valuable in reaching the optimal decision. One way to better understand what information will be most helpful in making any given decision is redundancy or repeated exposure to information (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). The authors note that most individuals are exposed to information over time and therefore must have the capability to hold onto information for future decision-making processes."}, {"section_title": "Rationale for Behavioral Decision Theory", "text": "At the heart of Behavioral Decision Theory is the comparison of costs and benefits (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). The authors write that the existence of costs and benefits in decision-making indicates the existing conflict. When an individual must weigh the costs and benefits associated with a decision, they are doing so knowing that they are compromising one for the other. At some point in the decision-making process, the good outweighs the bad and an individual is able to decide (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). In addition to costs and benefits, an individual must contend with the unknown, which can include information they do not have or future changes in their environment that they cannot predict (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981). This researcher selected Behavioral Decision Theory due to the focus on information and how it informs decision-making. For the purposes of this study, information was in the form of brochures, websites, explanations of college processes, and speaking with campus administrators to better understand the cost and benefits of college as well as the application process. Information, and the ability to both acquire and understand it, was central to the researcher's ability to answer the overarching research question. Behavioral Decision Theory speaks to an individual's ability to acquire information, and in this study, the researcher hoped to understand how low-income, first-generation African American students acquire and how they understand information. The researcher hoped that by understanding the process by which the participants understood information about college, administrators can better equip themselves with knowledge about how to recruit and matriculate low-income, first-generation African American individuals."}, {"section_title": "Applying Behavioral Decision Theory to This Study", "text": "In reviewing Behavioral Decision Theory, the researcher found many correlations between decision-making and context and choice. First, Einhorn and Hogarth write about individuals needing to make a decision that may conflict with their goals. Low-income, firstgeneration African American students must determine if and where they will attend college using the information and support around them while also understanding the impact that their decision will have financially on both themselves and their family. Behavioral Decision Theory also indicates that individuals will use the information around them to make decisions and will seek out information to help them with that process. The literature shows that low-income, firstgeneration African American students may not have enough exposure to this information due a lack of knowledge by both themselves and their family, and when they are able to access this information, they may not know how to utilize it. Repeated exposure to information is important to being able to retain it and use it for the future. This study resulted in a better understanding about whether those low-income, first-generation African American college students who chose to attend college were exposed to information and support and how that exposure occurred. Einhorn and Hogarth's theoretical framework provided guidance to the researcher as the phenomena of information and support was further explored."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": "Perna's College Choice Model (2006) is derived from the concepts of decision-making and choice as described by Einhorn and Hogarth's theory (1981). This section further describes Perna's conceptual model and relates Perna's conceptual model to the study. Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) Three-Phase Model; Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith's (1989) economic model on human capital investment; and Paulsen's (1990) sociological model on status attainment as she developed her conceptual model. Perna viewed Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith's work as a starting point for her model regarding college choice. Laura Perna's College Choice model was utilized to conduct a study on low-income, first-generation African American student decision-making regarding college attendance. Perna's model assumes that an individual is influenced by multiple internal and external contexts. This model includes individual context; school and community context; highereducation context; and social, economic, and policy context. These varying contexts will be discussed later in this chapter. It is the impact of these internal and external contexts that were utilized throughout the research process. Participants in this research study were asked about personal influences (i.e. family, high-school guidance counselors) who contributed to their decision to attend college. Through a review of the literature, there is evidence that merit-aid and financial-aid programs can affect an individual's ability to attend college (Davis, Green-Derry, & Jones, 2013;Monks, 2014). Participants in this study were asked to share their experiences with admissions and financial-aid policies and how those areas affected their decision about where to attend college."}, {"section_title": "Perna reviewed", "text": "There were two critiques of Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith's model that Perna wished to address through her conceptual model. Perna noted that studies using Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith's model employed quantitative analytical techniques while research indicates that researchers are adopting more qualitative approaches. More importantly, Perna recognized that the model did not focus on a specific population when looking at college choice, and therefore was limited in its ability to be used to analyze how differing populations are affected by their environment as it pertains to the decision to attend college. Perna (2006) writes that \"although traditional human capital approaches for conceptualizing the criteria that individuals consider and the effects of costs and benefits on student college-choice behavior, they are insufficient for understanding all sources of observed differences in college choice across family income and racial/ethnic groups\" (p. 110). College choice-specifically the decision to attend college-has many implications on an individual and society. Perna (2006) writes that among the societal benefits of higher education are increased national income and productivity, increased state workforce productivity, and increased economic activity in the community in which a higher-education institution is located, as well as lower crime rates, greater community services, and improved educational outcomes for future generations (p. 103). At the personal level, those who attend college experience more fulfilling work environments, better health, more informed purchases, and a lower probability of unemployment (Perna, 2006, p. 106). When an individual who is otherwise qualified to attend college makes the decision not to, the personal and societal implications can be great. Given the individual and societal benefits of attending college, why do some choose to attend college and others do not? This study identified what factored into low-income, first-generation African American students' decisions to attend college and if these students had specific information and support to assist them in understanding the individual and societal benefits of a college education. Perna's model was a guide, and it was helpful to understand what factors can influence a person's decision to attend college."}, {"section_title": "Perna's Four Layers", "text": "Perna's model is comprised of four layers or contexts. At the center of this conceptual model is the assumption that an individual's decision about attending college is influenced by their habitus, or system of values and beliefs in which they are embedded, and that the collegechoice process is different for various groups of students. The College Choice Model was designed to address the gaps that exist in policy interventions with a hope to address disparities in college access that often do not consider the culture and circumstances of a given group. The model's Layer 1 reflects how an individual's habitus, or embodied dispositions, such as gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status factor into their college choice process. This layer includes a familiarity with the college process and knowledge about the costs and benefits of a college degree. First-generation college students typically do not have the family knowledge to assist them in understanding and navigating the college-admissions process as well as the federal financial-aid process (Ghazzawi & Jagannathan, 2011). Layer 2 moves beyond the individual and into the school and community context. This layer speaks to the availability and type of information an individual has, and how social structures can either \"facilitate or impede upon student college choice\" (Perna, 2006, p. 117). This layer includes the availability of information and guidance from teachers, counselors, and peers, and the trust between a student and those responsible for imparting information about the college process. Layer 3 recognizes the role that higher education plays in college choice. Higher-education institutions are a source of information for students and families when they visit states, cities, and school districts to recruit students. How they decide where to visit has an impact. Colleges and universities also determine who will and will not attend their institution, which gives them profound influence over college access (Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). Finally, Layer 4 examines the changes in economics, demographics, and policy that can affects an individual's college choice. This layer could include an increase in the unemployment rate, an economic recession, or policy changes in the federal financial-aid program. In summary, this model reveals that there are a variety of factors that determine one's college choice."}, {"section_title": "Critics of the College Choice Model", "text": "Through a review of the literature, very few critiques of Perna's College Choice Model (2006) were identified. Much of the literature concludes that Perna's model is sound in judgment and useful when researching college choice, although some limitations to this model were found. Tierney and Venegas (2009) write that \"although these concepts actively describe the factors affecting student thinking about postsecondary education, they have changed the underlying premises of the intellectual framework of college choice and financial aid access very little\" (p. 371). Tierney and Venegas argue that financial aid is the prominent factor in an individual's decision to attend college; therefore, the other contexts have less of an impact on decisionmaking. In Radford's (2009) study, Perna's College Choice Model was used as a guide in the creation of a new framework called the College Destination Process. Radford (2009) feels that Perna's use of \"the different layers of factors that are influential in college choice\" is a useful starting point for understanding college choice (p. 9). Radford (2009) went onto to write that Perna's model did not provide a framework for understanding why a student chooses a certain college. Radford (2009) felt this was limiting in truly being able to understand the context by which an individual chooses to attend college."}, {"section_title": "Rationale for Using the College Choice Model", "text": "Several frameworks have been used to better understand college decision-making behaviors. Pierre Bourdieu developed social and capital theories to better examine educational inequities (Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). However, Bourdieu's model is deficient in understanding the decision-making behaviors of people of color and those of low-income status (Reddick et al., 2011). Bourdieu's model also focuses on the influence of social networks towards attainment and does not provide understanding about how other factors (economy, public policy, and higher education itself) can affect decision-making (Mwangi, 2015). In addition to Bourdieu's model, Hossler and Gallagher (1987) developed a model considered for this research. Hossler and Gallagher (1987) developed a three-phase model of college choice (Daun-Barnett & Das, 2013). Hossler and Gallagher's model suggests that students make their decision about college based on the information available to them (Daun- Barnett & Das, 2013). After understanding the information, the student will decide if the costs of obtaining a degree are outweighed by the benefits. One component of Hossler and Gallagher's model is parental influence on the decision-making process, which can be problematic when conducting a study about first-generation college-choice behaviors (Daun- Barnett & Das, 2013). Ultimately, Perna's College Choice Model (2006) was selected to help guide this research and the rationale for doing so is described in the next section. Perna's use of the four layers helped to understand the college decision-making process for low-income, first-generation African American students. African American students account for a smaller representation of all races enrolled in college due, in part, to their inability to hold the amount of economic, human, cultural, and social capital necessary while navigating the college enrollment process (Perna, 2006). In this study, the hope was that through the conclusions derived from one-on-one interviews, the research findings would assist practitioners in gaining insight into what factors could assist this population in attending college at a greater rate. Practitioners in high-school counseling offices and college-admissions offices can develop strategies to assist African American students with understanding the costs and benefits of attending college and the information available to them in making the decision to attend. Perna acknowledges that her model is useful to better understand the decision-making process of a specific population, as was planned in this study. The layers within Perna's model provide guidance for the varying aspects that can influence a person's decision about if and where to attend college, and the model was used in this study to parse out how varying factors intersect. Perna (2006) suggests that future research should examine the ways in which race and ethnicity intersect with gender, income, and socioeconomic status to influence college choice. Information is an important piece of the decision to attend college (Oreopoulos & Dunn, 2013). This information can be related to the admissions process, the financial-aid process, or academic choices while in high school. Perna (2006) writes that many \"prospective students are poorly informed about both the costs and the economic benefits of an investment in higher education\" (p. 109) and that the lower enrollment of African Americans and Hispanics in college may be due to this lack of information. The goal of this study was to conduct interviews with low-income, first-generation African American students to learn what information was presented to them, when it was presented, by whom it was presented, and how this information played a role in their decision-making."}, {"section_title": "Applying Theory to This Study", "text": "Perna's model can be used with both a quantitative or qualitative analytical approach. When using a qualitative approach, Perna suggests that the researcher use group interviews, case studies, or life history as ways to gather information about college choice. Perna (2006) writes that qualitative approaches are \"especially useful for discovering theoretical propositions to explain student-college-choice process, developing in-depth understanding of student-collegechoice processes for particular students, and understanding the influence of the context setting on student college choice\" (p. 123). For the purposes of this study, a qualitative approach was used by conducting one-on-one interviews with a limited number of college students at a four-year private institution in the Greater Boston area. Perna's model was a useful guide in the creation of questions for the interviews. Perna describes the factors that contribute to one's decision to attend college, which include academic preparation, academic achievement, family income, financial aid, expected benefits, and expected costs. These concepts were helpful to guide interview questions that allowed for dialogue about what components contributed to each student's decision to enroll in college. For example, the literature states that being offered financial aid is an important predictor of college enrollment; therefore, the interviews included questions about each student's understanding of the financial-aid process and how the receipt of aid (if any) contributed to their decision not only to attend, but where (Elliot & Friedline, 2013). Perna (2006) suggests that the College Choice Model should be used to guide the examination of \"the experiences of more narrowly defined populations\" and the \"effectiveness of policies and programs that are designed to promote college access and choice\" (p. 145). The goal of this study was to accomplish these two suggestions by asking why low-income, firstgeneration African American college students made the decision to attend college; what information, policies, and programs currently exist; and what could be created to facilitate this process. Einhorn and Hogarth's Decision-Making Theory (1981) speaks to how individuals acquire and understand the information which they receive during the college-exploration process. By examining these phenomena closely, the researcher hopes to understand the breadth of information that was provided to low-income, first-generation African American college students and what support existed while these individuals navigated the decision-making process."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Einhorn and Hogarth's theory assisted the researcher in this study by providing context for the importance of the availability of information and an individual's ability to store and understand that information throughout the decision-making process. The goal of this study was to find the connection between the experiences of a small number of low-income, first-generation African American students in their college-decision process with the hope that similarities in experience could lead to policy and programmatic changes at the high-school and college level. To better understand the impact of this problem, the next section will review the current existing literature. The following chapter includes literature about college costs and financial-aid programs; low-income, first-generation African American parental involvement; and existing outreach programs and the effect they have on college enrollment.\nThe literature indicates the impact that college has on one's ability to increase their social capital as well as their socioeconomic status. After reviewing the impact that a college degree has on social mobility and societal contributions, the literature shows that low-income, firstgeneration African American students are underrepresented in higher education. As a result, these students are not exposed to the college environment, which impacts mobility and societal influence. After understanding the impact that a college degree can have one's life, it is important to begin to understand some of the barriers that may prevent individuals from attending college, specifically the financial barriers.\nThe perception that one will receive financial aid, whether it is from the federal government or through private loans, influences an individual's academic achievement in high school, college enrollment, and choice of college (Perna & Steele, 2011). The type of aid also has an effect of student's persistence once they enter college (Terriquez & Gurabtz, 2014). Monks 2014cites the College Board's 2011 Trends in Student Aid, which reveals that a majority of public four-year college students leave college with some level of student debt, the average of which is close to $22,000. Financial-aid programs that focus on financial need instead of being solely based on academic achievement will better serve those who are unable to attend the college of their choice (or any college) due to a lack of financial resources. In addition, students from lower-achieving high schools may not receive the same level of care and attention during their education, which could result in being overlooked during the financial-aid disbursement process. Colleges may look to recruit those students with higher overall academic achievement in their high schools. This places students who are unable to attend these high schools at a disadvantage in the admissions process as well as in the merit-aid process. When colleges use merit aid to recruit and retain only high-achieving students from affluent areas and high-performing high schools, they lose sight of the need for more access and more doors to be opened for other qualified students. After looking more closely, the literature reveals why low-income, first-generation African American students are less likely than their White counterparts to attend college.\nThe literature reveals how important knowledge and understanding of the college application and financial-aid process is to degree attainment. As the costs of a college degree continue to rise, some financial aid is necessary for most students to be able to afford to attend (Long, 2010). First-generation students tend to lack the support from family and community, not only in terms of understanding the college application process, but also in determining how the costs of a degree can be worth the future benefits. African American students face several barriers which prevent them from pursuing a degree, which further widens the gap of who does and does not attend college. To best work toward remedying this current structure, it is important to first understand the factors that contribute to a student's decision to attend college. As the literature also suggests, it would be beneficial to better educate these students' families and support systems, so they have the knowledge and understanding of the language around the college application and financial-aid processes. By empowering these students and families with information, we can hope that the enrollment gap will decrease, and more opportunities will exist for students of color, particularly African American students. Financial-aid programs that are easy to understand with easy applications will increase access for a broad spectrum of students. Some students lack accurate information about highereducation costs and financial aid. Long (2010) noted that a lack of information, combined with the complexity of the financial aid process, has a significant impact on how many low-and moderate-income students can enroll in college. Some educators have recognized that there are challenges when applying for college and have developed strategies to try to remedy this challenge. Through the literature, those associated with the college admissions process (i.e. high school guidance counselors, college Admissions offices) can learn about innovative ways to provide more information to high school students and their families. The research shows us that access to information that is useful and easy to understand can better equip first-generation African American students with what they need to make the decision to attend college. To lessen the gap between White and African American students attending college, it is important to open more doors allowing these students to share their experience and knowledge with the world both during and after their college years.\nCollege access is a systemic problem. There are a variety of factors that have brought us to a place where low-income, first-generation African American students are disproportionality represented in colleges and universities. The literature indicates that the cost to attend college is increasing at a considerable rate. These increases are a result of decreased Federal and state appropriations and rising operational costs at many colleges and universities throughout the United States. College and universities are forced to make financial decisions about how they will spend money, and at times this can result in less financial-aid funding. Over time, financial aid has shifted from being used to offset the cost of attendance and moved toward being a recruitment tool for admissions offices. Need-based aid has often been replaced with meritbased aid, which is shown to be advantageous to more affluent students who have access to higher-achieving high schools, a wealth of support and resources, and encouragement to participate in college-preparatory programs. When a student is faced with the decision of whether to attend college or where to attend college, those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds tend to prioritize affordability over choice. When making the decision to attend college, students look to those around them for support and guidance. Students from homes or communities with a low rate of college attendance will likely find the application and financial-aid process more difficult to navigate than those communities where these processes are more familiar. Families and communities who are knowledgeable about these processes will be able to provide greater guidance, which will increase the likelihood that a student will pursue a college education. African American students tend to be more averse to taking on debt, and therefore they may not make any attempt to learn about aid programs and financial assistance. As a society, it is important that we develop ways to share knowledge and educate all students about the benefits of a college degree. This can be done through technology, more support within high schools, and/or more intentional outreach to low-income neighborhoods. As the literature indicates, a college degree helps with social mobility as well as creates more engaged citizens. College inequity is example of the discrimination toward African American people that exists within our society. History has shown that doors can be opened through government programs and innovate practices, but there is still much to be done to provide more opportunity to all students, regardless of race.\nUsing a case study as the method of research, the researcher hoped to understand the information and support utilized by low-income, first-generation African American individuals while participating in the college decision-making process. The experience of choosing to attend college and the information and support that existed during that process were studied using qualitative analysis. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a semi-structured model which allowed the researcher to expand upon responses and learn from the individuals. The data was then analyzed and reviewed alongside the artifacts collected from the study site. The researcher read the data multiple times, taking notes during the interview process, developing themes within each participant's interview, and then connecting those themes to other participants and the collected artifacts. The researcher built rapport with the participants by giving them time for each interview and ensuring accuracy of interpretation by sharing the themes with the participants. The researcher hoped that because of this study, college and universities are better able to understand what information and support are needed by lowincome, first-generation African American students to encourage their matriculation into higher education. These methods were used to gather and analyze the data that will be reviewed in the following chapter.\nSupport, guidance, and advocacy were important components of the college decision making process for the student participants in this study. As first-generation individuals, they lacked the knowledge to navigate the admission process. These students relied on the support of their high school guidance counselors and other resources to help them through the admissions process and financial aid process. These students all described having difficulty explaining the admissions process to their family. Upon review of the information provided to the researcher, it is concluded that these students need someone to help them find their voice and gain understanding about how to find the best college for them. There is also more that can be done to support the families of these students, so they feel better equipped to partner with their student through the admissions process.\nThe researcher gained an understanding of how cost factors into decision making for the student population researched in this study. The cost of attendance and the size of the financial aid and scholarship package were key factors in where these students chose to attend. The students in this study all concluded that they selected Wyman College because of the financial discount that they received as well as their financial aid package. There was also a strong sense among this group of students that tuition costs are an unknown and more education should be done to provide students with the overall financial picture for their time in college. For the admissions office staff, it was clear how important the relationships between the admissions office and other offices on campus are, as they are necessary to be able to support and guide students through this process. The admissions office staff noted how valuable the partnership is between their office and the financial services office to provide attention to each student who is trying to make the best academic and financial decision for their college education.\nIn speaking with the student participants it was clear that they believe that a college degree means movement forward and upward. These students all hope that a college degree will allow them more financial security, and it was often said that they wanted the ability to take care of their family in return for the sacrifice their family made for their education. The students selected majors that they felt would help people and society and ones that they hoped with provide them upward social mobility and security. The impact of being low-income and firstgeneration includes stress and a desire to excel. These students see themselves as the means to changing the future for their current and future families. That desire to excel is a lot to bear for these students, and for some that pressure results in keeping their stress internal which can create a feeling of isolation.\nTo answer the overarching research question-\"What information was made available to first-generation African American students from low-income families that contributed to their decision to attend college?\"-the researcher used case study methodology to identify the connections and gaps between the resources and support provided by Wyman College and how the student participants received those resources and support. An analysis of individual interviews, the focus group with members of the admissions office staff, and a review of select documents provided the researcher a clear picture of how low-income, first-generation African American students navigate the college decision making process using the resources and support available to them. The student participants provided the researcher with great insight into the struggle to understand the college admissions process and how a lack of individual and family understanding can further cloud the process. The admissions office staff spoke about initiatives and programs to help support this specific student population, but there seems to be a disconnect between what the admissions office offers and what is still unknown by low-income, firstgeneration students. Common unknowns are the application process and the cost of attendance. The researcher observed that many of the struggles and frustrations experienced by the student participants align with the literature previously described in an earlier chapter. The following chapter will make further connections between the literature and the research findings. That chapter will be organized by three major findings: College Partnerships with Local High Schools; Family Outreach and Involvement; and Financial Guidance. Each of these will be explored through the lens of the research questions, the literature review, and theoretical and conceptual frameworks. This will be followed by recommendations for practice and implications for further research.\nA consistent theme among the findings outlined in this chapter is the need for partnerships. Low-income, first-generation African American college students need more support to understand the college-admissions process and to determine how they will pay for college. If college is seen as a societal good-one that allows for upward social mobility and increased financial security-then higher education institutions and high schools need stronger partnerships to ensure understanding and access. The students who participated in this study all spoke about an underlying disconnect between the support they received at their high school and the support they received at home. The literature states that family support is a vital component of the college-search process and that engaging families more will produce more opportunities for students who might otherwise not attend college. High schools and colleges would be better served by closing this gap. This can be done through workshops, individual meetings, college site visits, and partnerships with other external agencies that support student access. The next section will speak in greater detail about some practices that could be developed to lessen the gap and increase more partnerships between high schools and colleges."}, {"section_title": "Chapter Two: Literature Review Introduction", "text": "For a variety of reasons, low-income, first-generation African American students tend to not have the appropriate access to information about the financial aid process or the support at home to understand the benefits of pursuing a college degree (Baber & Graham, 2015). This literature review addressed the impact on individuals and on society of not attending college. Then the literature review addressed the difference between need-based and merit-based aid and the effect of obtaining one versus the other has on college choice. Finally, more specific information was reviewed regarding the barriers of enrollment for low-income, first generation African American students."}, {"section_title": "The Impact of a College Degree", "text": "In 2010, while giving a speech at the University of Texas at Austin, President Barack Obama stated, \"It's an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have gone to college.\" President Obama (2010) then went on to state that \"education is an economic issue when nearly eight in 10 new jobs will require workforce training or a higher education by the end of this decade.\" President Obama was speaking to the importance of a college degree for social mobility and financial security, urging colleges and universities to provide more opportunities for degree attainment. A college degree provides individuals the opportunity to earn higher wages over a lifetime, and creates lower unemployment rates, better health, higher marriage rates, and increased civic engagement (Rose, 2013). The literature provides a picture of not only the impact of a college degree on social mobility but also on one's contributions to society and personal wellness."}, {"section_title": "Social Mobility", "text": "Higher education has a direct impact on one's social mobility within society (Sawhill, 2014;Javine, 2013;Terriquez & Guarantz, 2014;McLendon & Perna, 2014). Those with a college degree are more likely to be employed over their lifetime (Ghazzawi & Jagannathan, 2011). Higher education is important if society hopes to decrease the income inequality that exists within the United States (McLendon & Perna, 2014). Individuals with a bachelor's degree earn over $830,800 more in lifetime income compared to those with only a high-school diploma (Daly & Begali, 2014). A component of this variation in lifetime earnings is due in part to a college graduate's ability to enter the workforce more easily than those without a degree (Castleman, Owen, & Page, 2016). In addition, those with a college degree experience fewer and shorter periods of unemployment and are able recover more quickly if laid-off (Hout, 2012). In the United States, the unemployment rate for African Americans is higher than any other race within the population who have not completed high school and highest (matching American Indian/Alaska Native) for those who have completed high school (Suh, 2014). Webber (2016) conducted a study to determine if the cost of a college degree is worth it to an individual, given the need to repay loans after graduation. Webber analyzed the data from lifecycle earning simulation to better understand lifetime earnings for those with a college degree compared to those without one. The sources of data in this study include the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 and1997 waves (NLSY79 andNLSY97); the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS); select March Current Population Surveys (CPS) and the 1993 and 2003 waves of the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). Webber's (2016) conclusions were based on estimates using the simulation, plus innate ability, student debt, and major choice as the factors to determine future earnings. Webber (2016) found that attending college is financially beneficial for many of the scenarios run through the simulation. The implications of Webber's study include the importance of accessibility to information for those considering a college degree. Webber (2016) found cases wherein selected major of study impacted future earnings, and therefore, the author stresses the importance of transparency and availability of information, especially to low-income students. Rose (2013) noted that college-educated individuals typically have higher salaries than those without a degree because a degree signals to potential employers that an individual possesses a set of competencies necessary for the job. College graduates are also more likely to rise to managerial positions, which have higher salaries (Rose, 2013). In addition to the earnings that a college graduate receives while employed, these individuals often have greater financial security when they reach retirement age (Rose, 2013). Individuals with only a high school diploma have approximately one quarter of the savings by the age of 50 compared to those with a bachelor's degree (Rose, 2013). Abel and Deitz (2014) argue that overall, with rising tuition costs and falling wages, the impact of a college degree on earnings has decreased in significance for college educated individuals as they are working to pay off student debt with less earnings. However, Abel and Deitz (2014) go on to write that earnings for those without a degree are falling at an even faster pace, which means that a college degree is still beneficial for overall financial security. Brand and Xie (2010) conducted a study to determine who benefits most from a college degree. The authors used a behavioral model to review the current and future earnings for individuals with a college degree. Brand and Xie (2010) used two cohort model datasets to better understand earnings: The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY) and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study 1957 (WLS). Through a review of the literature and the studies, Brand and Xie (2010) found that college graduates are more likely to come from families with educated parents who have a higher income and live in a home with fewer siblings. Broken down by gender, the authors concluded that college-educated men earn a great deal more over their lifetime compared to those without a college degree (Brand & Xie, 2010). A significant finding from this study was that individuals who complete their college degree with parents who did not complete college will benefit more from their degree than those graduates with one or both parents who did complete college. The implications of this study include that potential social mobility exists when a person who is first in their family to attend college receives their degree.\nPaula's mother instilled in her at a very young age the importance of education. Paula considered staying in her home state of Connecticut for college and attend a community college, but with her mother's push she knew that a degree from a four-year college would be better for her long-term goals. Paula described college as being \"the only way out,\" meaning that a high school diploma is not enough for future financial security. When asked to further expand on college being the only way out, Paula stated, \"I guess [it is] the only way to be successful.\" Lynn describes college as a \"great way to be successful.\" Her hope is to make millions of dollars and spoil her mother who has worked so hard to get her to college. Lynn voiced her frustration about the need for a college degree to have opportunities, describing the finish line as being moved farther and farther away. The researcher asked Lucy to talk about her motivation for attending college. Lucy responded that she wants \"to get a job where I'm able to live comfortably, and make sure my parents are well off too.\" She described the financial struggles that she and her family had growing up. Janessa's description of the importance of a college degree provides a great summary of the theme of social mobility. Janessa stated that she has seen \"people go to college and they live in houses and have families and they feel content in life.\" She talked about college being part of a progression towards something more."}, {"section_title": "Personal and Societal Impact", "text": "In addition to the financial implications associated with a college education there are multiple personal implications that effect individuals and society. Abel and Deitz (2014) write that a college degree provides the ability to obtain aptitudes and skills that result in an oftenenhanced set of abilities. Hout (2012) studied the data regarding the social and economic returns of a college education in the United States. Hout (2012) learned more about the impact that college has on society, stating that higher education \"stands between the home environment of childhood and adult achievement\" as well as \"collectively and simultaneously produces new knowledge\" (p. 395). Hout's findings show that the benefits of college on the individual is personal growth, while in society there are benefits when citizens possess knowledge and innovation. Individuals who obtain a college degree tend to volunteer at a greater rate and more often participate in local, state, and federal elections (Hout, 2012;Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016;Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). Hout (2012) writes that individuals with a college degree are stronger workers, life partners, and citizens. Hout (2012) accounted for these increases in work and citizenship because being educated in school is more effective than learning information and skills outside of college. Individuals who do not attend college are able to learn skills and receive information that is helpful in their careers, but this is not usually done in the organized manner that it is found in a college environment (Hout, 2012). A specific example, given by Hout, is that the college environment provides an opportunity for one to gain skills in gathering facts and making sound arguments. Baber and Graham (2015) write that for African Americans, the level of incarceration is higher for those with less educational attainment. Two percent of African Americans with an associate degree are incarcerated, which compares to eight percent of high-school graduates (Baber & Graham, 2015). Schafer, Wilkinson, and Ferraro's (2013) study found that college graduates are less likely to divorce, as well as experience physical or emotional abuse, than those who did not attend college. Individuals with a college degree have better birth outcomes and levels of school readiness for their children (Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016). Those who are college-educated also make better decisions about their personal health (Long, 2010). College graduates are healthier than those who do not earn a college degree partly because they are exposed to education and resources that promote good health (Hout, 2012;Schafer et al., 2013). Ideally, college attendance increases an individual's self-control and decision-making skills, which can lead to behaviors that better benefit one's personal health (Schafer et al., 2013). There is a correlation between socioeconomic class and personal health, which as described previously, can result in those with higher earnings having better health outcomes over their lifetime (Schafer et al., 2013). In their study, Schafer et al. (2013) found that college graduates have lower rates of hypertension, heart problems, and mortality than those without a college degree. It is important to note that the authors found that the most benefit concerning health for college graduates was found in those who were raised in low-and middle-income households as they may not have received the same access and education about personal health as their more financially affluent counterparts were growing up (Schafer et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "The Cost to Attend", "text": "College costs have been a topic of conversation over recent years as the number of students incurring elevated levels of student-loan debt has been on the rise (Elliot & Friedline, 2012;Monks, 2014). In this section, the literature was reviewed to better understand what contributes to the cost of college and how financial aid impacts costs for an individual student. Financial aid was developed to provide more opportunity for students who were not able to attend college due to the financial burden (McKinney & Novak, 2012). The literature also reveals who pays for college as it relates to those who receive scholarships, those families who can support their student financially, and others who must take on debt to fund their college education."}, {"section_title": "What Contributes to College Costs", "text": "Institutional governing bodies must determine how to best allocate available resources (Migliore, 2012). Educational quality is determined by institutional governance, as boards must balance fiduciary responsibility and the effectiveness of resources on overall student learning and the achievement of the organization mission (Migliore, 2012). A decision on how to use endowment money and operating funds may result in an institution's greater reliance on tuition dollars for daily operations, and therefore these decisions can influence who is able to attend college due to an ability or inability to provide financial aid (Delaney, 2014). Additionally, cost can be used as a competitive factor; therefore, college and university governing boards must be strategic when determining how to use institutional funds to attract students. The highereducation industry uses a business model which identifies a college education as a good which can be purchased (Migliore, 2012). The business model signifies how and why certain financial decisions are made by institutional decision makers. Colleges and universities are a business which provide a good or service to a consumer (Migliore, 2012). Institutional governing bodies must determine how to best attract students to their institution. Attracting students can be accomplished using financial cost to attend and incentives such as tuition discounting in the form of merit aid to reduce high tuition costs. In a 2014 study, James Monks examined student debt through the lens of state aid, tuition, and financial-aid polices. As a part of the study, Monks reviewed the enrollment patterns of colleges and universities. Monks's (2014) data set included the 2011 Annual Survey of College and the 2011 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data. Monks (2014) found that an institution can use its discount rate to positively affect revenue generation while holding tuition costs constant. Financially stable institutions have the power to control who can attend their institution using cost and discounting methods (Monks, 2014). College discount rates can be reduced when colleges seek out additional outside scholarship opportunities and admit a more affluent student body (Monks, 2014). Institutions' decision-making bodies can play a key role in who is able to attend their college and who is shut out. Each year, senior leadership decides how much students will be charged for tuition, fees, room, and board (Monks, 2014). As state appropriations for colleges decrease, especially for public institutions, institutional decision-makers must determine how to meet increased operating costs (Conner & Rabovsky, 2011). Colleges that have small endowments typically rely on tuition dollars to fund projects, pay salaries, and meet many of their other financial needs (Monks, 2014;Delaney, 2014). Public institutions may resort to increasing fees to offset additional operating costs. In public universities, the decrease in state-sponsored grants resulted in higher student-debt levels for graduates (Monks, 2014). Conner and Rabovsky (2011) argue that public support for higher education is important to increasing access and improving equity for those who attend. State policies that decrease funding of institutions will disproportional deny access to low-income and minority populations. An institution's brand is important for maintaining financial health. Governing boards within higher education consider the institution's brand as an intangible asset of great value to the institution (Migliore, 2012). The ability to maintain a desirable brand requires resources, including financial, human, and facilities. Institutions must be comfortable with how much they are willing and able to allocate towards maintaining that brand. The costs to maintain the brand can include marketing, recruiting, upkeep of athletic facilities, use of technology, and funding dedicated to research and development (Migliore, 2012). These factors must be considered when determining tuition and tuition discounting through merit-aid awards. Looking further into a college's designation of money towards financial aid for students, Doyle (2010) studied the impact financial aid had on not only whether a student attends college but also which college they choose to attend. Financial-aid professionals can use merit aid to influence a student's choice of which college to attend by creating a financially appealing package. Colleges and universities can use this type of aid to discount tuition for a student, and in some cases, drastically decrease the amount of debt that a student will accumulate while earning their degree. Doyle's (2010) hypothesis is that colleges and universities use \"funds to 'buy' a certain kind of students\" (p. 794). Colleges and universities can use need-based aid to assist students in paying their bill, while merit aid can be used to entice a student to select their institution. Doyle (2010) concluded that over the years, colleges and universities have become more responsive to students' academic success while not giving the same increased attention to students' financial need."}, {"section_title": "How Financial Aid Impacts Costs and Enrollment", "text": "The 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act resulted in a greater use of loans over grants (Elliot & Friedline, 2013;Monks, 2014). The increase is the use of loans combined with the rising cost of tuition during this time caused a greater disparity between who was able to afford a college education and who could not (Perna &Steele, 2011;Jerrim, Chmielewski, & Parker, 2015). There was a growing concern by families that they would not be able to fund a college education, resulting in the federal government increasing the minimum amount of a Pell Grant. Davis, Green-Derry, and Jones (2013) argue that middle-and high-income families have greater financial and cultural capital, and these populations are more positively impacted by student-aid policies. The value of the Federal Pell Grant to those who most needed this funding decreased while tuition costs increased. These factors contributed to the increasing gap that exists between the cost of higher education and the ability to fund one's education. Baker, Andrews, and McDaniel (2017) write \"financial aid may have a stronger influence on the enrollment decisions of students who would not otherwise attend college, including lowsocioeconomic status, older, and minority students\" (p. 4). Need-based aid has no relationship to pre-college academic success, meaning that the size of the aid package is not based on standardized test scores (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013;Doyle, 2010). Students who receive need-based aid have been shown to be more successful in college than those who have not received need-based aid, which has been linked to their motivation to seek out funding and complete the necessary aid applications (Castleman & Long, 2016). Long (2010) asserts that need-based aid has a greater impact on increasing access for low-income students over other forms of aid. Over the past decade, the amount of dispersed need-based aid has not kept pace with the rising costs of attending college (Monks, 2014). In addition, the disbursement of need-based is not consistent among the states, which results in inequality throughout the United States (Delaney, 2014). This results in students who cannot afford college being unable to receive the financial support that they need to pay for it. Castleman and Long (2016) used a regression-discontinuity strategy to examine the effects of the Florida Student Access Grant on college access, persistence, and graduation. The data set was used to capture the college enrollment and completion records for low-income high school seniors. The authors found that an additional grant award of $1,000 increased the probability of student retention to the second semester of their first year of college by 3.3 percentage points. The implications of this are that it takes only a slight increase in the amount of grant aid provided to a student to have a significant impact on their ability to obtain a degree. Financial-aid professionals often use a high-tuition, high-aid perspective, meaning that tuition increases should be followed by increases to need-based aid. Doyle wanted to understand if merit-aid programs were overshadowing need-based financial aid. Doyle (2010) concluded that merit aid does not impact the funding of need-based aid at the state level. However, Doyle writes that \"as merit aid programs continue to grow and evolve, and as states continue to struggle with financing higher education, it may yet well be that existing need-based aid programs will be de-funded or eliminated outright\" (Doyle, 2010, p. 412). The implications of Doyle's findings are that merit-aid programs are more attractive for colleges and universities as a recruitment tool which could have effects on college access. Doyle (2010) suggested that if this is the path that aid is taking, then state policymakers should look to broaden the way that merit aid is awarded to maximize the number of qualified high-school graduates who attend college. Fack and Grenet (2015) used a regression-discontinuity methodology to learn the impact of need-based grants on the applicants' higher-education projection. The authors support the importance of grants on college persistence. Fack and Grenet (2015) found that students who receive grants are 3.7 percent more likely to enroll for a second year. It is important for students from low-income backgrounds to move past the initial fear that they will not be able to pay for college and seek out opportunities for financial support. Fack and Grenet (2015) assert that lowincome students may underestimate their ability to graduate or may be skeptical about the benefits of a college degree on their future. The authors write that \"low-income students might underestimate their chances of graduating or be more averse to uncertainty in returns\" (Fack & Grenet, 2015, p. 31). This fear and uncertainty can prevent individuals who are not aware of the support that exists and do not have the support within their family group to pursue a college education."}, {"section_title": "Who Pays to Attend College?", "text": "College affordability is hard hit when states decrease funding toward need-based aid, as the burden to pay for college falls on the student. Lim, et al. (2014) assert that finances are of great concern for college students and three in five first-year students worry about how they will pay for college. As tuition costs increase, students and families are asked to contribute a greater amount to those costs, whether it be through personal savings or loans (Delaney, 2014). After reviewing the trends in college costs and household income from the 1980s to 2011, Delaney (2014) saw a dramatic increase in a family's financial contribution to their student's education. By 2011, the average cost of attendance as a percentage of median household income was 33.5%, which rose from 16.4% in 1984 (Delaney, 2014, p. 58). State appropriations to higher education have been cut at a greater rate than other budget categories. When appropriations for higher education decrease, colleges and universities must respond with increased tuition and fees. The effect of higher tuition and less aid has the greatest impact on minority and lowincome students (Delaney, 2014). During the 2015-2016 academic year, federal loans accounted for 33% of all undergraduate financial aid, compared to 23% of institutional grants and 15% of Pell Grants (Baker, Andrews, & McDaniel, 2017). To meet the financial demand of college, the literature indicates that many students have looked to credit cards to pay for their tuition (Javine, 2013). Long's (2010) study found that the possibility of needing to borrow money to pay for a college education discourages enrollment, especially from low-income and underrepresented groups (p. 36). Toutkoushian and Shafiq (2010) conducted a data analysis to determine if states could shift their focus away from state appropriations towards college and instead direct monies towards the funding of need-based aid programs. The goal of the study was to learn more about the use of need-based aid over the use of appropriations when trying to achieve institutional goals (Toutkoushian & Shafiq, 2010). States have the choice to provide appropriations to colleges and universities, allowing the institutions to use those funds as they see fit, or states could instead direct those appropriations toward need-based aid programs (Toutkoushian & Shafiq, 2010). The authors argued that state appropriations to colleges can benefit all students, as the funds could be used by the institution to improve programs or facilities, while funding directed towards need-based aid programs will only benefit the population of students who meet the criteria to receive financial assistance. Toutkoushian and Shafiq (2010) concluded that more students would have access to higher education if there were a greater reliance on need-based aid systems opposed to reliance on appropriations. In fact, the findings suggest that colleges and universities are using state appropriations to fund merit-aid programs, therefore widening the gap of who can and cannot attend college (Toutkoushian & Shafiq, 2010). African American students tend to borrow more money over the course of their education than their White counterparts (Jackson & Reynolds, 2013;Baker, Andrews, & McDaniel, 2017). This increase in borrowing can have numerous implications, including an inability to complete the degree or defaulting on loans. Baker, Andrews, and McDaniel (2017) cite the difference in borrowing across race and socioeconomic background, writing that 27% African American bachelor's degree students borrow $30,000 or more, higher than any other group. Jackson and Reynolds (2013) used the Beginning Postsecondary Student Study (BSSE) to understand loan accumulation. The study focused on non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black students attending four-year institutions, specifically those who planned to complete their degree in four years. Jackson and Reynolds (2013) found that African American students take on greater debt and are at a greater risk to default on loans. Almost one-third of African American college students who took out federal loans did not complete their degree and defaulted on their loans, which is compared to nine percent of White students (Jackson & Reynolds, 2013). In contrast, the authors also concluded that African American students who have federal loans are more likely to complete their degree. African American men, first-generation students, and students from low-income families are more likely than any other population to default on their loans after completing their degree (Baker, Andrews, & McDaniel, 2017). The implication of this is that loans do have a positive effect on matriculation, but in comparison to White students there are greater risks for African American students. Flores and Shepard (2014) used a difference-in-difference model to investigate how the deregulation of tuition impacts enrollment of racial/ethnic minority students and low-income students. Their research was specific to public research institutions in Texas. The authors compared the enrollments at these public institutions against similar institutions across the country that also experienced the deregulation of tuition. The authors concluded that as price can affect each college-going population differently, the availability of financial aid remains to be a reliable way to increase college enrollment (Flores & Shepard, 2014). States and institutions should be mindful of how the deregulation of tuition affects disadvantaged students and should develop policies that help to mitigate the burden to pay (Flores & Shepard, 2014). Reducing the burden can be accomplished through need-based financial aid programs that allow for decreased cost burdens for these students and their families. A key finding as it relates to first-generation African American students was that as prices increased, this group shifted their thinking. They no longer felt that the cost to attend college was worth the financial commitment (Flores & Shepard, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Low-Income, First-Generation African American Students", "text": "College enrollment among low-income African American students tends to be in lessselective, open-enrollment institutions (Elliot & Friedline, 2013). Selective institutions often see lower retention rates among African American students than other race populations on campus (Conner & Rabovsky, 2011). Connor and Tabovsky (2011) cite that from 1975-2001, fewer than 46% of African Americans completed their degree within six years, compared to a 64% completion rate for White students. Conner and Rabovsky (2011) noted that both African Americans and students from low-income families base their decision to pursue a college degree on the receipt of merit aid."}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Enrollment", "text": "The barriers to enrollment for low-income, first generation African American students begins before they reach college age. Martinez and Welton (2014) cite reasons why students of color are disproportionality enrolling in college compared to their White counterparts. Lowincome students of color are less likely to be placed in high-level courses while in high school, which can impede their ability to receive merit-aid. School counselors can play a significant role in a student's access to higher education. Martinez and Welton (2014) find that many lowincome African American students attend high schools where support and information provided by counselors are lacking. In some cases, the authors found that African American students are more likely than other race populations to be steered towards trade school, community college, or employment after high school instead of to a college or university (Martinez & Welton, 2014). The decisions are in part because the ratio of student to counselor at these high schools is too high and does not allow for the attention needed to guide these students towards higher education. In a separate writing, Welton and Martinez (2014) view this issue from a culturalcapital lens, acknowledging that since marginalized communities are historically denied access to college, they are not receiving the information that would connect them to the appropriate college-preparatory resources. When an individual attends college, they can bring back information that they have learned about the process to their families and the community in which they live. Individuals who complete college have the experience to help others understand the benefits of college preparatory programs as well as assist in navigating the application and financial-aid processes. African American men have disproportionate rates of failure as it relates to graduating from high school and entering college (Elliot et al., 2015). Dyce, Albold, and Long (2013) write that \"first-generation, minority, and low-income students often lack the resources necessary in the pipeline to college resulting in the derailment of aspirations for a college degree\" (p. 152). A student's family income is a contributing factor to their ability to attend college, and children in families earning under $25,000 have less than a six percent chance of earning a college degree (Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). Sawhill (2014) stated that well-qualified students from low-income families are less likely to attend college compared to less-qualified students from high-income households. The literature indicates that access to information that is accurate and helpful regarding attending and paying for college is not consistent for all populations (McKinney & Novak, 2012). Debt can be a roadblock for many who are looking to pursue a college degree. First-generation students tend to receive little to no financial support from their families (Javine, 2013). This population also has less knowledge than those who had one of more parent attend college about actual tuition costs, financial-aid opportunities, and the admission process (Oreopoulus & Dunn, 2013). Even when these students do qualify for loans, the gap between what they must pay and what they can afford may still be too great. Knight-Diop (2010) conducted a study at Denver High School, located in New York City, to understand the structure within the school that promotes college attendance at a predominately Black high school. At the time of the study, 60% of students were Black and 81% of the overall population was eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (Knight-Diop, 2010). The author conducted semi-structured interviews, focus groups, student surveys, and observations. The author observed a culture of college-going at Denver High School. One notable observation was the creation of a house structure within the high school. Denver High School created smaller tracked communities to provide more institutional and interpersonal support which included a designated guidance counselor, a house coordinator, and a family assistant (Knight-Diop, 2010). There is also an emphasis on peer support and co-curricular activities (Knight-Diop, 2010). The author's findings included an understanding about how care and equitable distribution of college information and advising can have a significant impact on the rate of college-going for African American students. Brown, Wohn, and Ellison (2016) conducted one-on-one interviews with high-school students from urban and rural schools in Michigan. The purpose of their study was to understand how these students use the Internet to learn about college. They hoped to understand where students accessed their information, how they interpreted this information, and how this research translated in their decision about whether to apply to college. The authors' findings show that the students in the sample could find information about college on the Internet. Brown, Wohn, and Ellison (2016) further found that first-generation and low-income students lacked the digital literacy to be able to interpret the information in a manner that would benefit them in their college planning. To remedy this, the authors suggest that institutions may want to use multiple social-media outlets to provide information to potential students. In addition, it would beneficial for educators to offer experiences to students that would increase their ability to interpret the information they find on the Internet and translate it into actionable steps for moving forward. Daun-Barnett and Das (2013) explored how the Internet and access to information can improve accessibility and college choice. The authors used a multiple case-study approach to examine the content of college-access Web tools. Daun-Barnett and Das (2013) selected three Web portals using both the information on the site and the corresponding documents that are made available. Using the college-choice model, the authors found that the most effective college-access tools include features that connect students with their parents. In addition, students benefit from being provided information about how college costs and aid packages weigh against their future career plans. When students are educated on the long-term benefits of obtaining a college degree, they may reconsider the financial burden that exists while they pursue that degree. Daun-Barnett and Das (2013) write that the quantity of information about college is only useful if an individual can understand it and trust its accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Aid and College Choice", "text": "In terms of accessibility, students from low-income families are less likely to enroll in college compared to those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and studies show that as college tuition rates increase, student enrollment from low-income households decreases (Elliot & Friedline, 2013;Long, 2010). Students from low-income families tend to be more reluctant to borrow money and prefer work-study awards as a form of financial aid. Long (2010) asserts that students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds are reluctant to incur the debt associated with obtaining a college education. Elliot and Friedline (2013) conducted a study to determine the cost burden and the role of race and income on college enrollment. One of the questions they studied in their research investigated whether minority and low-income students are more likely to be asked to pay most of their college expenses. Through a longitudinal study, they concluded that African American students are the least likely, compared to other races, to have family assistance with paying the costs associated with college (Elliott & Friedline, 2013). Families from low-income backgrounds typically do not have money available to pay for their student's college enrollment after all other family expenses are accounted for. To further look at this disparity, Elliot and Friedline (2013) assert that 54% of African American students at four-year colleges and universities seek out loans as the main source to fund their education. Their data shows that the vast majority of African American students choose to attend two-year colleges where the overall cost burden is lower or choose not to attend college at all (Elliot & Friedline, 2013). Jerrim, Chmielewski, and Parker (2015) found that \"low SES students' lack of knowledge of college costs, rather than an actual lack of affordability, is driving the low proportion of disadvantaged students enrolled\" (p. 21). In their study, these authors hypothesized that high-socioeconomic-status students would be more likely to attend top-tier institutions than their low-socioeconomic-status peers even when academic achievement is controlled. The unique part of their study was that the authors compared information from multiple countries. By reviewing existing data, the authors concluded that while academic achievement is important in college pursuits, students from a high socioeconomic status are at a substantial advantage when applying to high-status institutions because of their access to information and support. The implication of Jerrim, Chmielewski, and Parker's study is that closing the achievement gap will not successfully open more doors for high-achieving students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Terriquez and Gurantz (2014) wanted to understand how financial considerations affect a student's path to and through college. The authors conducted telephone surveys of more than 2,200 randomly selected youth aged 18 to 26 in California. Their findings indicate that students who reported financial difficulty with paying for college were 2.7 times more likely to not obtain their degree (Terriquez & Gurantz, 2014, p. 5). In addition, the authors found that access to financial aid greatly increased a student's ability to remain in college and complete their degree. The authors also found that existing vulnerabilities for students, related to their ability to complete college, include individual and family financial challenges, room and board costs, and the rising cost of college tuition (Terriquez & Gurantz, 2014). These findings support that students who are provided information about and access to financial aid will benefit from not only the ability to attend college but also the skills they need to persist. In addition, students who are better educated about the financial support available to them while in college may be better able to complete their program. Cheslock, Hughes, Cardelle, & Heller (2018) presented research findings about institutional aid and its impact on student need at the 2010 Annual Conference of the Association for the Study of Higher Education. They asserted that institutional grants are the largest source of aid to undergraduate students and are primarily awarded as merit aid and not need-based aid (Cheslock et al., 2018). By using data from the -2008 could analyze how the gap of unmet need is filled through institutional aid and other sources. Cheslock et al. (2018) describe unmet need as the gap that exists between the cost to attend and the availability of financial aid. They conclude that students who have a higher amount of unmet need are often those who are forced to seek out financial aid to cover the cost of college. Students at private institutions or who attend out-of-state public institutions have the highest amount of unmet need because these two types of institutions tend to be more expensive. The expense to attend these types of institutions means that students who have a lower Expected Family Contribution (EFC) may shy away from applying to private and out-of-state colleges due to the possible increased need to take out loans. Alon (2011) conducted a study to determine how need-based aid affects college persistence. The study used a sample of students at four-year institutions to determine how aid affects a student's ability to persist through and obtain a college degree. Alon (2011) concludedthat any type of aid can increase a student's likelihood of persistence. Alon (2011) asserts that the advantages of need-based aid for low-income students is immensely greater than the effect that aid has on higher-class students as it relates to their ability to stay enrolled in college. Alon's findings suggest that if the government and colleges focused more financial resources on low-and middle-income students, the likelihood of persistence could greatly improve, and students from more affluent backgrounds do not necessarily need aid to increase persistence. The Pell Grant and other aid models are necessary to reduce the cost of attendance for students from low-income families to enter college and complete their degree (Sawhill & Goldrick-Rab, 2014). More financial assistance for low-income students would allow these individuals to work less, focus more on their studies, and have a greater ability to overcome financial obstacles. Alon (2011) concludes that a more equitable distribution of financial aid can increase economic equality by low-income students the opportunity to change their socioeconomic status as well as provide these individuals with a greater standing in society. Additionally, greater access to financial aid will increase the number of bachelor's degree recipients in the United States which creates more engaged citizens contributing to the social and economic growth of society (Alon, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Family Support", "text": "African American students rely more heavily on financial aid and student employment than their White counterparts due to a lower level of family support in funding their education (Javine, 2013). Elliot and Friedline (2013) compared African American students to other racial/ethnic groups and found that African Americans have the lowest probability of receiving financial support from family to attend college. To learn more about the effect of the cost burden to attend college, Elliot and Friedline (2013) studied a cohort of tenth-grade students. Among the questions posed to this cohort was how important low costs are when choosing a college. Students were also asked to speak to support within their household as it related to both financial support and knowledge about the college-admissions process. Elliot and Friedline (2013) found that students who have positive college expectations are more likely to have their family support them financially. Regarding African American students, the authors found that those who attend two-year colleges are less likely to complete a degree, which indicates that it is not just a matter of whether you attend college but where you attend. Parental involvement in the college planning process has a direct correlation to the likelihood that African American students from low-income communities will attend college (Hallet & Griffen, 2015). Even though these parents may aspire for their child to attend college, they tend to lack awareness about how to navigate the many requirements to attend college, which includes the college application and the financial-aid process (Hallet & Griffen, 2015). First-generation students usually do not have the family knowledge and support about the application and financial aid process which can cause these students to become lost in the complexity of these systems (Hallet & Griffen, 2015). The authors conducted a qualitative case study to better understand the connection between college enrollment and parent involvement. The study captured data over a three-year period in an urban Northern California community. Hallet and Griffen 2015found that parents from low-income backgrounds aspired for their children to be successful, but parents felt disempowered to provide knowledge and support to their child as they navigated the process. Parents and their children would benefit from detailed and easily understood information about financial aid, and this information should be provided to them as early as middle school. Mwangi 2015used qualitative metasynthesis to interpret literature surrounding the role of family and community in college access. The studies that Mwangi consulted were published between 2000 and 2012. Through review if these studies, Mwangi found that students perceived their parents, and at times their high school, as having the greatest impact on their college choice process. The research indicates that the community in which a student lives can be an equally valuable resource to help guide the student through the college process. If there is a member of the community who has knowledge and experience, there can be an increase in college participation levels. Knowledgeable community members can provide support to the families of students when a family lacks enough understanding to support their child. Using human capital theory, Laura Perna and Patricia Steele studied the perceptions and expectations of high-school students on financial aid. Perna and Steele (2011) used information from 15 case studies of high-school students in five states to derive how knowledgeable highschool seniors were about financial aid. Findings indicated that a minority of students and their parents have an accurate understanding of college costs and the financial aid repayment process (Perna & Steele, 2011). Students and parents were asked to estimate the price of college attendance, and many of the respondents were hesitant, which indicated to Perna and Steele a lack of confidence and background knowledge to make an educated estimate. Knowledge about financial aid seemed to be partially contingent on state; of the five states selected for the study, two appeared to supply more information to students about financial-aid policies, which provided these students with more knowledge and resources. Perna and Steele (2011) concluded by stating that, for the most part, students can improve their academic achievement but are mostly unable to change their financial need. McKinney and Novak (2012) found that students who had a greater understanding of the FAFSA were more likely to complete the FAFSA form early, which in turn may result in more appealing financial-aid packages. They found that students who are predisposed to not apply to college due to family background or lack of knowledge are unable to truly grasp the cost of attending college. When a prospective student does not apply to college, they are therefore not provided the opportunity to apply for financial aid, which results in these individuals never learning what their true costs would be to attend. Once a student enters college, those who applied for financial aid through the FAFSA increase their chances of persisting to their second semester of college (McKinney & Novak, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "The Effect of Information and Support", "text": "Dyce, Albold, and Long (2013) conducted a study to review how students and their families prepare for college. The study was conducted in a Southeastern state, and data was collected from ninth-grade students and their parents at Noble Academy (a pseudonym). Noble Academy serves academically promising high-school students who have significant financial needs and/or no family history of college. The author notes that the students who attend Noble Academy are typically those who are underrepresented in higher education. At the time of this study, 32% of the students were African American, 27% were White, 30% were Latino/a, 9% were multiracial, and 2% were Native or Asian American (Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). The students and their parents were provided with questionnaires. Noble Academy includes a rigid program with the expectation that their students excel academically, and it is practice at the school to never use the word \"if.\" The staff at Noble Academy is committed to building trusting relationships with the students and their families. This approach allows students and families to see the benefits of academic achievement and allows them to consider college as a possibility. The results of the study showed that families understood how critical obtaining a college degree was for social mobility, and the inability to support their student financially did not deter them from supporting their student academically. Because of this research, the authors concluded that support for college access must be offered to students and their families throughout their highschool years (Dyce, Albold, & Long, 2013). Noble Academy has been able to demonstrate that strong relationships with low-income, first-generation students and their families can help to close the gap and make a college education within reach. McKillip, Rawls, and Barry (2012) reviewed the role that high-school counselors have on college attainment. High-school students who reported a high level of interaction with their guidance counselor were more likely to enroll in four-year institutions compared to those with fewer interactions attending two-year intuitions or not enrolling at all. The interactions between high-school counselors and students included assistance with completing applications and financial-aid forms, help with writing essays, and/or participation in college visits. Students who attend high schools in well-funded school districts are more likely to receive this type of assistance. McKillip et al. (2012) assert that when families do not have enough or adequate information to help their students, high-school counselors then become the primary source of information. Students without \"social capital\" do not have access to information and support to navigate a complicated and costly process (McKillip et al., 2012). In the context of college access, McKillip et al. (2012) define social capital as relations between people, such as the close ties among family members, community residents, and religious affiliates, all whom can provide guidance and information through the college decision making process. Those who possess little to no social capital will lack this guidance, therefore, having greater difficulty in navigating the college application process. Higher education could learn from this study and could provide better outreach and support to high schools in low-income communities that lack the human and financial resources to serve students. When students and families are better exposed to information about college financing, they are more likely to benefit from aid programs (Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016;Ghazzawi & Jagannathan, 2011). McKinney and Novak (2012) urge institutions to use proactive strategies to communicate with students about available financial support prior to their arrival on campus. It is important that outreach programs are designed to inform first-generation, low-income, and minority students about their college options to help them understand that higher education is attainable (Ghazzawi & Jagannathan, 2011). McKinney and Novak (2012) offer suggestions, such as presentations at local high schools or college fairs and reminder emails to students about where they can receive assistance with completing their FAFSA to increase the number of students who seek out aid. Oreopoulos and Dunn (2013) studied the importance of information when making the decision to attend college. The authors suggest that there are inexpensive and highly effective ways to promote higher education. The study was conducted in Toronto, Canada, at five public high schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Participants were asked to complete a series of surveys for the authors to understand the participants' perception of the college-application process. A small sample was also shown a video that further explained resources for financial assistance to pay for college. The results of the study indicate that online information has a large effect on students' understanding of the expected rate of return from obtaining a college degree. The students who were shown the video were seven percentage points more likely to believe that they were eligible for grant aid. In addition, the students who were given access to the video were more likely to seek out additional assistance and request college information. The overall conclusion was that access to information increases a student's likelihood to take the steps towards obtaining a college degree (Oreopoulos & Dunn, 2013). Students who exhibit help-seeking behaviors are more likely to attend and persist in college. In a study conducted by Lim et al. (2014), the authors used a cognitive approach to better understand students' financial help-seeking behavior. They found that students attending four-year private institutions and two-year public institutions were more likely to seek help compared to those at four-year public institutions. In addition, African American students met with financial professionals at a rate 80% higher than White students. Colleges and universities that offer a financial-literary course found that students who participated in the course were almost 2.5 times more likely to seek financial assistance. What can be learned from this study is that colleges and universities cannot assume that college enrollment means that a student has the appropriate level of financial understanding. College and universities would be wise to offer courses and workshops to assist students in their understanding of finance, which may increase their likelihood to seek out financial assistance from administration."}, {"section_title": "Chapter Three: Research Methodology and Design", "text": "The purpose of this study was to discover what information and support exists for lowincome, first-generation African American students which led them to make the decision to attend college. The central question that this study asked was: \"What information was made available to first-generation African American students from low-income families that contributed to their decision to attend college?\" Secondary to the central research question, the following sub-questions were explored through this study: \"How do first-generation African American students from low-income families weigh the costs associated with college attendance against the future benefits of earning a degree?\"; \"How can college admissions offices be more proactive in their work to educate lowincome, first-generation African American students and their families on college costs and aid opportunities with the hope to support more of these students in their matriculating?\"; and finally \"What factors contribute to where low-income, first-generation African American students apply to college and where they choose to matriculate?\" The central research questions were examined using a qualitative research approach, specifically through a case study. Creswell (2009) defined qualitative research as an exploration and understanding of the way that individuals or groups experience a social or human problem. A case-study approach was selected for this study to allow the researcher to go deep into the central and sub-questions to learn what works and what does not with the enrollment of this population. The aim of this study was to understand the individual experiences of the participants and then extrapolate them to inform practice, in the hope of increasing this population's presence within higher education. Corcoran, Walker, and Wals (2004) describe case studies as involving description, explanation, evaluation, and prediction of phenomena and involve the study of individuals within their regular environment. The purpose of this chapter is to explain the method by which these questions were answered and how the data collected was analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative Research Approach", "text": "Qualitative research methodology began in the early 1900s at the University of Chicago under the work of George Herbert Mead (Jovanovic, 2011). Jovanovic (2011) writes about the ethnographic roots of qualitative research and refers to the study of culture and language. In Creswell, Hanson, Plano, & Morales's (2007) article, the authors discussed which criteria should be used when selecting a qualitative research process. The authors write that \"researchers should begin their inquiry process with philosophical assumptions about the nature of reality (ontology)\", \"how they know what is known (epistemology)\", and \"the nature in which their writing emerges\" (Creswell et al., 2007, p. 238). Qualitative researches use various interpretative paradigms to address assumptions (such as positivist, post-positivist, or constructivist) (Creswell et al., 2007). The constructivist paradigm believes in pluralist, interpretive, open-ended, and contextualized perspectives (Creswell et al., 2007). \"Contextualized\" means that the perspective is sensitive to place and situation. Qualities of this paradigm are thick, rich descriptions and prolonged engagement with the research site and/or topic. Qualitative research is used to identify a research question that will be analyzed using data collected through the research process (Creswell et al., 2007). The collected data leads the researcher to a better understanding of a single concept (Creswell et al., 2007). Qualitative research has been in and out of favor by researchers throughout history but gained resurgence in the 1960s as a way to better interpret the behaviors of changing demographics within society (Jovanovic, 2011). More specifically, qualitative research became the means to understand the human experience in hopes of bettering the lives of those who were not a part of dominant groups (for example: women, young people, non-white people) (Jovanovic, 2011). In qualitative research methods, the researcher serves as the mechanism by which phenomena are analyzed, using the words and experiences of the participants (Creswell, 2009). An effective qualitative study includes rigorous data collection which occurs when the researcher spends adequate time with the participants, adequate time with the data, and understands their own experience and how it can impact their interpretation of the information (Creswell, 2009). Qualitative research occurs through a variety of methods, including narrative research, case studies, grounded theory, and phenomenology (Creswell et al., 2007). For the purposes of this study, the researcher used a case study research methodology, described in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Case Study Methodology", "text": "A case study is defined as an in-depth study of a single unit where the researcher hopes to apply what is learned to a larger population (Gerring, 2004). Yin (2014) writes that case study methodology should be utilized when the goal is to answer \"how\" and \"why\" questions about an event or phenomenon. Typical characteristics of a case study include that it is qualitative, small, and the researcher takes on the role of observer and investigates a single phenomenon (Gerring, 2004). A key characteristic of this type of methodology is that the researcher uses a single unit of study to describe the features of a broader set of units (Gerring, 2004). Harland (2014) writes that the benefit of case-study methodology is the careful reflection by the researcher as new ideas are integrated into the researcher's thinking about the phenomenon. The ideal approach to a case study is the use of qualitative data, although a mixed-method approach can be utilized if it assists in answering the research questions (Harland, 2014;Pearson, Albon, & Hubball, 2015). Scholars have suggested differing typologies for case-study methodology. Pearson, Albon, and Hubball (2015) write about the work of Stake (1995) who suggests three types of study (intrinsic, instrumental, and collective). Intrinsic case studies involve a case given to the researcher; instrumental case studies are selected for their ability to contribute to a general understanding of a phenomenon; and collective case studies are an extension of instrumental case studies with two or more cases selected for review. For the purposes of this study, the researcher employed an instrumental case-study approach with the use of one site to explore a phenomenon. Yin (2014) suggests three types of case studies based on the study's purpose. Exploratory case studies are pilot studies to inform future research; descriptive case studies provide a thorough, contextualized description of a phenomenon; and explanatory case studies shed light on factors leading to an event. The researcher used an explanatory approach to determine the factors that lead to the enrollment or non-enrollment of low-income, first-generation African American college students. There is not a distinct endpoint for a case study though it is recommended that the researcher continue their work until data saturation is reached and no more learning comes from the analysis and writing (Harland, 2014). Harland (2014) writes that quality case-study research brings the reader of the study as close as possible to the described experience, which requires imagination and creativity. The researcher should carefully review the data collected to support claims being made, and the study should have impact on the field or the practice (Harland, 2014). Through case-study methodology, the researcher considers not only the voice of the interviewed individuals but also the relevant groups studied and the interaction between them (Corcoran, Walker & Wals, 2004). Harland (2014) noted that a successful case study will explain to the reader what needs to be considered before contemplating change. In terms of this study, the researcher hoped that that through this work, colleges and universities will better understand how to educate and recruit low-income, first-generation African American students to increase access for this population to higher education."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "To answer the research questions, interviews were conducted using Einhorn and Hogarth's Behavioral Decision Theory (1981) as well as Perna's College Choice Model (2006) as a framework for the interview protocol. In preparation for the IRB process, a site was selected to recruit and interview all participants. The site was selected due to its proximity to the researcher, which allowed for in-person interviews. To select a study site, the researcher looked at the composition of the student population related to race and diversity of majors. In addition, the researcher requested information from the college regarding Pell Grant recipients, to better understand the socioeconomic diversity of the student population. The study's recruitment material specified that participants must be first-generation students. This was clarified with each participant by asking them a series of initial questions about their family history regarding higher-education attendance. These factors led to the selection of Wyman College (pseudonym) to conduct this study, as the goal was to interview current students who identify as low-income, first-generation, and African American. The researcher worked with the administration at the institution to send a notification to current students seeking their involvement in this study. The invitation to participate in the study was sent to 346 students who met the study criteria of identifying as African American and receiving a Pell Grant. Individuals who were interested in participating were asked to contact the researcher. Once individuals were identified, they were sent the informed-consent form as well as a copy of the questions they would be asked. The researcher also worked with a designated contact in the Office of Admissions at Wyman College to gain access to documents used in the admissions process and set up a group interview with those directly connected to the recruitment process. The following section describes the collection and analysis process in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Research Site", "text": "The researcher chose Wyman College as the research site. Wyman College was founded in 1879. It is a private, independent college located just outside of Boston. Roughly 99% of the first time, full time students receive financial aid. The average need-based aid scholarship/grant for the Class of 2022 entering class was $27,843. The tuition at Wyman College for the 2018-2019 academic year was $54,905, which includes tuition, room and board, and fees. Enrollment at Wyman College is roughly 2,000 students, with 78% being identified as white and 22% as non-White. Of that 22%, 12% identify as African American. Roughly 25-30% of students are first generation. Undergraduate majors at Wyman College include general education, criminal justice, communication, business and accounting, nursing, among others."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Student participants of the study were asked to partake in a single one-on-one interview at a location of their choosing. If additional information or clarification of information was needed, the researcher requested to meet with the participant for a second interview. In addition, the researcher met with members of the admissions office as a group to better understand the recruitment practices for low-income, first-generation African American students. Lastly, the researcher reviewed artifacts-those documents used in the recruitment and admissions process-to understand what information they provide to students and their families as those students navigated the college decision process. The interview protocol was developed using Einhorn and Hogarth's Behavioral Decision Theory (1981) and Perna's College Choice Model (2006) as a guide. Perna's model contains four layers or contexts: habitus; school and community; higher education; and social, economic, and policy (Perna, 2006). Under each of these layers, there exists a list of areas that fall under that layer. For example, listed under school and community context (layer 2), Perna speaks to availability of resources, types of resources, and structural supports and barriers. Questions were developed under each of these layers as well as the corresponding items listed within them. The researcher framed the conversation with the participants around this model. Participants were asked to share their experience with the college search process, the support that they received during the process, and what factors contributed to their decision to attend college. Participants were also asked to share their knowledge and understanding of political and social factors that contribute to an individual's ability to attend college. When meeting with admissions office staff, the researcher asked about the recruitment practices for low-income, first-generation African American students. Admissions office staff was asked if there is different information or practices with this group of students compared to their White counterparts on campus. The researcher also asked the admissions office staff about their perceptions as to why low-income, first-generation African American students are not attending Wyman College in greater numbers. The researcher also inquired about the rate at which this population applies and ultimately matriculates at the college."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "The use of semi-structured interviews, supplemented by additional real-world data, allows a researcher to gain understanding of complicated, real-life situations (Noor, 2008). Semistructured interviews are viewed as the ideal method for a case study (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). Yin (1998) writes that interviews are essential to case-study research and should be the primary data source. The interview process should be collaborative, emphasizing that the participants are the primary experts (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). It is important to use open-ended questions and an interview style that is nondirective, allowing each participant to tell their story and for the researcher to ask each participant to expand upon an idea or concept (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim before being analyzed for themes and drawing conclusions (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). During the data-collection process, it is important for the researcher to make notes directly after the interviews and memo their experience with the process. Collecting case-study data can be time consuming; therefore, the researcher should prepare themselves by obtaining sufficient background information about the case-study site (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). Case studies allow for the use of a variety of data sources, including interviews, archived data, survey data, and observations (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007). Outside of the interviews, the researcher should consider what artifacts (documents, brochures, presentations) should be collected to fully understand the phenomena at the study site (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998). Case-study data should be documented and cataloged as it is received to assist in the researcher's analysis and for potential future replication of the study (Yin, 1994). Artifacts should be organized in a manner that best reflects the major areas or themes within the study (Darke, Shanks, & Broadbent, 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "Data analysis begins by listening, transcribing, reading, and coding the recorded interviews and observational data which then leads to the development of themes and sifting through the data (Chowdhury, 2015). The researcher transcribed the recordings using the services of Otter. Chowdhury (2015) writes that within qualitative data analysis, the researcher must use a range of analytical strategies: literal, interpretive, and reflexive approaches. A literal approach is an analytical process that focuses on the exact use of the language or grammatical structure of the interview; the interpretive approach is concerned with making sense of a participant's experiences; and the reflexive approach attempts to focus attention on the researcher and their contribution to the data because of their experiences. The researcher will employ these methods of analysis by confirming with the participants the researcher's understanding of the data and reflecting on the researcher's knowledge and experience with the topic to create a robust data set to answer the research questions. Coding is an important part of the analysis process (Miles, Huberman, & Salda\u00f1a, 2014;Basit, 2003). The data should be coded to develop themes or the links between the ideas and concepts (Basit, 2003). In addition to the data, the researcher can also use their notes and memos to reflect on the interview experience (Basit, 2003). Basit (2003) writes that, \"no amount of routine analytical work will produce new theoretical insights without the application of disciplinary knowledge and creative imagination\" (p. 145). The researcher must balance their knowledge of the subject matter while being able to think outside of the box and allowing for new ideas and possibilities to enter their analysis (Basit, 2003). For this research study, after transcription, data was coded by hand to develop themes. Basit (2003) writes, \"the user must still create the categories, do the segmenting and coding, and decide what to retrieve and collate\" (p. 145). The researcher spent adequate time understanding the data prior to coding so that themes and connects were not overlooked."}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Quality Qualitative Research", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethical Considerations", "text": "To learn more about the information and support utilized by low-income, first-generation African American students, individuals were interviewed, and their responses were recorded and coded. In research that involves people and their lived experiences, a researcher must consider the ethical issues that may arise (Creswell, 2009). Ohler (2001) provides seven steps a researcher should consider when evaluating the ethics of research. These steps include \"1) value in terms of the knowledge extracted and applied from the research, 2) scientific validity reflecting the methodology, 3) selection of subjects, 4) risk-benefit ratio, 5) independent review of the research, 6) informed consent, and 7) respect for the enrolled subjects.\" (Ohler, 2001, p. 241). The next section will describe these steps and how they were considered within this study. Ohler's (2001) first step speaks to the need for research methods to be valid, have clear objectives, and use reliable practices. Invalid research can pose a risk to the subjects (Ohler, 2001). Research methodology should be reviewed by those with the credentials and expertise to critique and provide guidance to the researcher, and IRB protocols should be met to protect the research subjects (Ohler, 2001). The development of this study was completed under the advisement of faculty in the Northeastern University College of Professional Studies program. Upon approval of the research proposal, the Northeastern University Institutional Research Board (IRB) reviewed the research protocol prior to the study being conducted. In addition, the researcher received approval by the host institution. Respect of the subjects is significant when conducting a research study (Ohler, 2001;Creswell et al., 2007;Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Selection of subjects should consider gender and race, as defined by the study, and ensure that all participants are treated equally (Ohler, 2001). Through this study, the researcher hoped to better understand the experiences of low-income, first-generation African American college students; therefore, the choice of participants was narrowed to meet all the criteria. To show respect for participants, the researcher considered how data was collected, managed, analyzed, and stored, to protect the privacy of the subjects (Ohler, 2001). Participants were also given the opportunity to withdraw from the study without fear of being penalized (Ohler, 2001, Creswell et al., 2007. Informed consent is vital to producing a research study that respects the participants (Ohler, 2001). Participants must understand the \"purpose of the study, methods, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the research\" (Ohler, 2001, p. 241). The consent form should be educational, informative, and understandable (Ohler, 2001). An informed-consent form was reviewed will all participants prior to the first interview and was revisited at the start of each interview. To maintain confidentiality and privacy of the participants, names and identifying features were excluded from the writing (Creswell et al., 2007;Corbin & Strauss, 2008). For this study, participants needed to meet the basic criteria: low familial income, first in their family to attend college, and self-identification as African American. The names of all participants were protected by using pseudonyms as this is considered best practice when conducting research. Privacy was also important, given that quotes were included verbatim through the analysis process. To maintain privacy and ensure accuracy, participants were provided the opportunity to review any comments used in the study (Creswell et al., 2007). To produce a study that is sound and credible, the researcher sought consent from participants, showed them respect throughout the research process, and minimized any risk associated with the study (Creswell et al., 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Credibility", "text": "Cope (2013) refers to credibility as the truth of the data and the interpretation and representation of them by the researcher. Credibility is enhanced when the researcher verifies the research findings with the participants (Creswell, 2009;Cope, 2013). In qualitative studies, the findings are considered credible if the descriptions of human experience are immediately recognized by individuals who share the same experience (Cope, 2013). Cope (2013) offers strategies to enhance the credibility of the research. To support the credibility of findings, the researcher should demonstrate engagement with the data and participants, develop methods of observation, and create an audit trail (Cope, 2013). First, as a researcher, it is important to build rapport with the participants. Rapport can be built through communication and by providing adequate time for interviews. The researcher should create a trusting and respectful environment with the goal to provide the participant a place where they can be open and honest (Cope, 2013). Engagement also provides the researcher the opportunity to get to know the participants, therefore being better able to connect the participants' experiences to the study (Cope, 2013). An additional strategy posed by Cope (2013) is reflexivity, or the awareness of the researcher's values, background, and previous experience with the topic of the study. Research bias can affect the credibility of the study; therefore, it is important for a researcher to understand their positionality as well as the lens by which they view the area of study. Throughout the process, the researcher would be wise to maintain an audit trail to acknowledge moments of bias or assumptions that may affect the analysis of the data (Creswell & Miller, 2000;Cope, 2013). An audit trail consists of a collection of materials and notes used throughout the research process that documents the researcher's process, decisions, and assumptions (Creswell & Miller, 2000;Cope, 2013). Member checking is an additional strategy recommended by Cope (2013) in enhancing credibility of a qualitative study. At completion of data analysis, the researcher \"communicates a summary of the themes that emerged and requests feedback or member check from the participants\" (Cope, 2013, p. 90). Through this process, the researcher can validate the findings and ensure that they have accurately interpreted the words of the participants (Cope, 2013). Credibility was reached in this study by conducting the interviews on the participants' home campus to allow them comfort in the environment. The time allotted for interviews provided the participants with adequate time to be reflective and thoughtful in their responses. Participants were given adequate notice of interviews and follow-up after interviews to ensure that they understood the process. At the completion of each interview, the researcher created a journal entry with impressions of the interview as well as notes for further inquiry. Finally, upon the completion of data analysis and development of themes, participants were provided the opportunity to review the material for accuracy and to provide participants with assurance that they were not being misrepresented."}, {"section_title": "Transferability", "text": "Cope (2013) refers to transferability as findings that can be applied to other settings or groups. A qualitative study has met this criterion \"if the results have meaning to individuals not involved in the study and readers can associate the results with their own experiences\" (Cope, 2013, p. 89). In describing the study and relaying the findings, the researcher should provide a context for others that allows the reader to assess the findings' capability to fit within a different context (Cope, 2013). Cope (2013) writes that the \"criterion of transferability is dependent on the aim of the qualitative study and may only be relevant if the intent of the research is to make generalizations about the subject or phenomenon\" (p. 89). Transferability can be achieved using thick descriptions and quotes from participants that allow the reader to understand the context and findings of the study (Creswell, 2009;Cope, 2013). Creswell and Miller (2000) write that the purpose of thick description \"is that it creates verisimilitude, statements that produce for the readers the feeling that they have experienced, or could experience, the events being described in the study\" (p. 129). Results are viewed as more credible by the reader when they are comprehensive and provide a variety of detailed perspectives (Creswell et al., 2007). To provide thick, comprehensive descriptions, the researcher must spend time with the data but even before that, they must spend time with each participant to understand their perspectives and understanding on the area of the study (Creswell, 2009). Creswell and Miller (2000) write that, \"rich description also enables readers to make decisions about the applicability of the findings to other settings or similar contexts\" (p. 129). To achieve transferability in this study, the researcher created a timeline for data collection and data analysis that allows for a meaningful understanding of the data. The researcher used subsequent interviews to follow up on misunderstood or confusing information to clarify and fully understand the participants' experiences. By having a deep understanding of the data, the researcher hoped to create a picture in readers' heads that allows them to fully understand the experiences of low-income, first-generation African American students as they experience the college decision making process."}, {"section_title": "Self-Reflexivity and Transparency", "text": "Cox (2012) writes that, \"Whether novice or veteran, qualitative researchers are well served by critical self-assessment from the point that they choose a problem to study\" (p. 132). In other words, a researcher must understand their positionality and their own experiences with the problem being studied. Cox (2012) goes onto write that, \"Clarifying one's motivations and assumptions from the outset increases the likelihood of viewing the issues in a new and generative way\" (p. 132). The researcher must enter the study without an intended hope for the outcome but instead a dedication to letting the data dictate the results (Cox, 2012). All researchers must understand how their background and experiences will affect the lens by which they conduct a study. The participants for this study were from low-income homes, which is not something that the researcher has experienced. The participants were firstgeneration college students, a characteristic that the researcher shares with them, but since the researcher's socioeconomic status growing up was not low-income, the researcher had more opportunities than most of the study's participants. Finally, the researcher is White, and has been sheltered from the systemic and obvious bias that exists for the African American community in the United States. Wilding and Whiteford (2005) write that, \"the researcher as an individual, complete with values, opinions, biases, feelings, brings an experimental world to the research process\" (p. 98). As a researcher, it is imperative that these values, opinions, biases, and feelings, such as those listed previously, are reflected throughout the research process to allow clarity and understanding of the data."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "With any researcher study, limitations can exist with the process as well as the outcome. Regarding this study, limitations can occur through the selection of the conceptual framework as well as the methodology. Einhorn and Hogarth's Behavioral Decision Theory (1981) as well as Perna's College Choice Model (2006) were selected for this study due to the applicability to many populations, as well as the depth of the layers. The research questions were designed to reflect these layers. As a researcher, it is important that the research questions are well thought out and adequately speak to the problem as well as the conceptual model. The model assists in guiding the study and a limitation can exist when the model does not account for all that the researcher hoped to accomplish. In this case, the researcher hoped to increase the number of college access points for low-income, first-generation African American students who are currently underrepresented in higher education. A possible limitation of this study was who was represented in the study. As the researcher began this process, it was unknown how many participants would be available and what the gender identity would be of those individuals. These unknowns limit the true understanding of the phenomenon. In addition, the researcher selected a very specific population when choosing to study the experiences of African American students. Therefore, the researcher did not have the opportunity to understand the experiences of other groups of students who are underrepresented in higher education. Pearson, Albon, and Hubbell (2015) caution that a limitation of case-study research is the extent to which the findings are generalizable and transferable to other settings. The researcher hoped to develop means for increased college enrollment for low-income, first-generation African American students, but the findings that result from interviewing students at one college may not be transferable to other institutions. Each institution has their own processes and resources for recruiting students, which means that the findings or recommendations from this study may not be as broadly applicable as the researcher hopes. Flyvbjerg (2006) writes that case studies can often be biased towards verification, meaning that they can be developed to confirm a researcher's preconceived notions about the phenomenon. The author goes on to write that the risk of bias exists in all research work, and that the researcher must be aware of this limitation throughout the process (Flyvbjerg, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter Four: Findings and Analysis", "text": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand what information and support exists for low-income, first-generation African American students that led them to make the decision to attend college. The study focused on an overarching research question: \"What information was made available to first-generation African American students from low-income families that contributed to their decision to attend college?\" The following sub-questions also guided the research: \u2022 How do first-generation African American students from low-income families weigh the costs associated with college attendance against the future benefits of earning a degree? \u2022 How can college admissions offices be more proactive in their work to educate lowincome, first-generation African American students and families about college costs and financial-aid opportunities with the hope that more of these students will matriculate? \u2022 What factors contribute to where low-income, first-generation African American students apply to college and where they choose to matriculate? A case study was used as the research method, which involved a focus group of admissions staff, individual interviews with currently enrolled students, and an analysis of a variety of documents from the study site. This chapter will focus on the study's findings and the analysis of the collected data. The chapter will begin with a summary of the individual interviews and the admissions office focus group and will be followed by descriptions of the themes that emerged from the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Participant Biographies", "text": "The researcher completed interviews with four students who met the study criteria. The study site-Wyman College-provided a list of 346 students who were Pell eligible (low-income) and who self-identify as African American. A recruitment letter was sent to these individuals inviting them to participate in the study. Students who were interested were provided an electronic copy of the Informed Consent Form as well as the questions they would be asked during the interview. The researcher was able to meet with five students, all female of varying years and majors. One student was excluded from the study because she did not meet the study criteria. The researcher recognized that a limitation of this analysis was that all the participants identified as female. Much of the literature reviewed for this study did not distinguish differences between female-and male-identified low-income, first-generation African American students in regard to resources and support. The researcher could not present possible similarities and differences between gender in this study due to an absence of male participants. Janessa. Janessa is a first-year student from New Hampshire majoring in biology. She attended a high school in what she describes as an urban environment. There were roughly 2,000 students in her high school and 359 in her graduating class. Janessa met with guidance counselors and teachers at her high school to assist her with college planning. She indicated that for those students who played a sport in high school, like she did, coaches were also helpful in understanding the college process. Each student in Janessa's high school was required to meet with a guidance counselor two times during the year, and after that it was voluntary. These meetings allowed Janessa to learn more about the financial aid process and pick the colleges that she would apply to. During high school, Janessa lived with her mother and younger brother. Janessa's mother did not finish high school. Janessa is funding college through scholarships, a Pell Grant, and a Parent Plus Loan which Janessa is expected to pay back when she completes her degree. Janessa described her experience with the college-admissions process as difficult to navigate. She felt that she was unable to use her mother as a resource since her mother lacked experience with applying to college. Janessa used the assistance of her guidance counselor as well as her aunt, who had attended college, to better understand the application process. The guidance counselors at Janessa's high school assisted her in setting up the Common Application and understanding the requirements of the application. Janessa experienced additional stress when it came time to complete financial aid forms. Janessa completed that process by herself and asked her mother for documents but had no other assistance with completing the forms. Janessa described the overall experience as stressful, especially when trying to determine how she would pay for college. Janessa weighed the costs of staying in state or attending a college outside of New Hampshire. In the end, with the scholarships she received from Wyman College, she was able to go to college out of state and live on campus. Although Janessa was excited about the amount of money she was given by Wyman College in the form of scholarships, she was still not prepared for the overall price to attend. She described the experience of receiving her first tuition, room, and board bill as overwhelming. Lucy. Lucy is a sophomore, majoring in sociology and minoring in communications. Lucy attended a high school in Boston designed to prepare students for college. Lucy's high school offered workshops and other programs to help students prepare for the college application process and for filling out FAFSA forms. Lucy was able to meet with a member of the guidance department to work on her admissions essay, and these meetings took place at least once a week. Lucy was one of seventy-five graduates in her senior class. During high school, Lucy lived with her mother and father. Lucy's mother attended a trade school and now works in the medical field. Her father is disabled and not currently employed. Neither parent has a college degree, and Lucy's older sister attended a community college for less than one semester before dropping out. Lucy is a Red Sox scholar, an honor awarded to students during the spring of their seventh-grade year. In addition to the scholarship from the Red Sox, Lucy's guidance counselor assisted her in applying for other scholarships, which provided her with the ability to afford the cost of college. Lucy's father saved money for Lucy's college education and that savings combined with the money Lucy earned from summer jobs covered the costs not met by her scholarships. Lucy described a conversation with her guidance counselor who told her not to think about the tuition costs when applying to college, but Lucy really struggled with that advice, knowing that her family could not afford the price. Initially, Lucy intended to enroll in a community college and then transfer to a four-year college but was discouraged from doing so by her mother. Lucy commented that when she first saw the tuition for Wyman College, she was surprised. Even with her scholarships, she was not expecting the total to be so expensive, and she was equally not prepared for the cost to increase each year. Due to rising costs, Lucy made the decision to move home and commute for her sophomore year. Paula. Paula is a sophomore from Connecticut majoring in psychology. Paula attended a public high school in an urban area with roughly 2,000 students. Her high school has a program called Health Academy, which allows students to explore careers in medical fields, which Paula took advantage of her senior year. The career center at Paula's high school assisted students with selecting colleges to apply to, seeking scholarships, and filling out financial-aid forms. The career center also invited guest speakers from different colleges to talk about the application process. These programs were optional for students, and Paula chose to participate in as many as she could, and she met with someone in the center on a regular basis. When Paula is not on campus, she lives at home with her mother and has no siblings. Paula's mother has a high-school diploma and currently works as a dietary supervisor at a mental health hospital. Paula stated that her mother instilled the idea of attending college in her at a very young age, and it was always the expectation that Paula would get her bachelor's degree. Given Paula and her mother's financial situation, the cost of attendance played a very big role in where she applied to college. Paula chose Wyman College because of the scholarship she received but cited that it is still a struggle to cover the tuition due to her mother's poor credit. Even with the career center's assistance, Paula described the process of applying for financial aid as very hard, because she was only able to get her mother's assistance with gathering the necessary documentation to complete the FAFSA, but not with the actual form. Paula cited that even after accounting for her scholarship, there was sticker shock when she saw her first tuition bill. She was not expecting college to cost as much as it did, and she wished that reality had been better communicated during the acceptance process. In addition, the increase in tuition each year is something that Paula had not anticipated, and it continues to be a struggle for her and her mother. Paula is funding her education through scholarships, a personal loan, and her mother's Parent Plus Loan, which Paula will be expected to pay back. Lynn. Lynn is a first-student majoring in biology. She attended high school in an upperclass suburban community through the METCO program. This program is grant funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and assists students in expanding their educational opportunities by providing transport to students to attend high school in another district. There is a great contrast in the economic and racial makeup of the high school which Lynn attended and her home within Boston. The first difference is that her school was predominantly white, and her community is comprised of African Americans. While in high school, Lynn lived at home with her mother. She also had three siblings: one passed away a few years ago, another is in the Air Force, and the third works for a hospital IT department. Lynn's brother attended college for one semester. Her mother has a high-school diploma and is currently a police officer. Lynn stated that her desire to attend college came from her mother who has always encouraged her to get a bachelor's degree. Lynn stated that the cost of college led her to believe that she would not be able to attend, but her mother wanted her to apply and to live on campus no matter where she went. At first Lynn planned to attend a community college and then transfer to a four-year college, but after receiving a scholarship from Wyman College, her plans changed. Lynn's education is funded through scholarships and her mother, who uses her earnings and took out a loan. Her mother takes on extra shifts and the family cuts back on many extras, such as eating out, to cover the cost of tuition, room, and board. Throughout the college application process, Lynn found support from guidance counselors at her high school. Lynn stated that the guidance counselors would sit with her, look at college options, and ensure that all the correct paperwork was submitted. Lynn stated that she also utilized guidance counselors to speak with her mother to better explain the college application process to her."}, {"section_title": "Office of Admissions Focus Group", "text": "The researcher conducted a focus group with members of the admissions office at Wyman College. The group included the associate vice president and dean of undergraduate admissions, the director of admissions, the senior enrollment representative, the director of operations, two admissions counselors, and the assistant director of international and transfer students. The purpose of the focus group was to understand enrollment practices for lowincome, first-generation African American students, specifically how these students are supported throughout the application and acceptance process. When asked about the mission of the admissions office, it was stated that the mission was to recruit and enroll students who they believe they can support to be successful and go out into the world and represent Wyman College in a positive way. The admissions staff described the demographics at Wyman College as being mostly students from New England states, with roughly 75% from Massachusetts. The international student population is roughly forty to fifty students out of the overall 2,000 enrollment total. In terms of gender, Wyman College is roughly evenly split male-to female-identified students. Between 75% and 78% of the students at Wyman College identify as White with the remaining 22% being students of color. The largest group within the underrepresented student population is African American, which accounts for close to 12% of the student body. The staff stated that there are good number of students who are Pell Grant eligible and roughly 35% of the overall student population identify as are first-generation. Due to the proximity of the college to a major city, they find that many students commute, and of those commuting students, many are firstgeneration and Pell Grant recipients. Academically, Wyman College is seeing an increase in average GPA and SAT scores with each incoming class. The entering class in 2018 had an average GPA of 3.12 and SAT score of 1080. The admissions staff noted that Wyman College recently went SAT-optional in their admissions process, so their reported average is of only those who submitted their scores. The associate vice president described Wyman College's 2010 strategic plan, which resulted in a focus on diversity and recruitment. The college began to give more attention to the recruitment of international students and the support they need on campus to be successful. An unanticipated result of this increased attention was better support systems in place for the recruitment of underrepresented domestic students. These supports included the development of a pathways program for underrepresented students and the creation of the office of diversity and inclusion. In addition, the admissions office began printing admissions material in Spanish to allow for better access to information about the college to a broader spectrum of people. The pathways program, called RISE, was developed to support underrepresented students in their first year of college by matching them with upper-class mentors and providing shared experiences on and off campus. The admissions office explained that the RISE program is discussed during recruitment efforts when meeting with students from underrepresented populations. When asked about specific recruitment practices for African American students, the admissions staff noted that many community-based organizations and local high schools reach out to their office to arrange campus visits for their students. The staff noted that they are seeing a trend of these visits starting earlier in a student's high-school career, at times during ninth and tenth grade. In terms of messaging, they approach all students with the same information but tend to include an additional focus on what a staff member termed a \"holistic approach\" to admissions with groups of underrepresented students. This approach includes a greater focus on the non-academic components of applications, such as work experience, obligations at home, and out-of-classroom activities. The admissions staff cited that for underrepresented students, GPA and SAT requirements can create apprehensive feelings about applying, so they try to speak to the non-academic reasons that someone is a good applicant for Wyman College. Counselors also devote time when meeting with students from underrepresented populations to discussing merit scholarships and other financial resources to pay for college. One staff member noted that they also use these visits to be honest with students that although they are need-blind in their aid, they are not able to meet 100% of any student's financial need, and therefore students must be prepared to fill the financial gap. For those students who are low-income, the admissions staff commented that they spend time providing information about other more affordable options, such as two years at a community college and then transferring in to work toward their bachelor's. For these students, the admissions staff also refers students to the student financial services office at Wyman College, and staff there sit with students and their families to offer financial planning. The admissions staff at Wyman College strives to ensure that all incoming students know exactly what their cost will be when deciding to attend. They accomplish this through the acceptance letter and by providing one-on-one attention to any prospective student who visits campus to better understand the financial bottom line. One admissions staff member stated that they are transparent about the cost of attendance, including direct and indirect costs as well as sharing information about loans and payment plans. The admissions office at Wyman College strives to ensure that students and families are comfortable with their financial picture before submitting their deposit to attend. They are also not afraid to have hard conversations with prospective students and families who they believe will not be able to afford the costs. The researcher then engaged the focus group in a conversation about the recruitment of first-generation students. A staff member described the recruitment messaging as the same as those who are not first-generation. The difference with those who are first-generation is that there tends to be more one-on-one time spent with these individuals. Applicants who are firstgeneration tend to call the office more often, at times multiple times a week. The staff may need to get into greater detail about the admissions process as well as the financial requirements to attend. They also spend more time interacting with the families of first-generation students, answering questions they have about the application process. Many times, these interactions include connecting family members to other resources on campus to address their questions and concerns. To better assist families, Wyman College offers sessions during two scheduled Accepted Students Days. These sessions are designed to help understand the transition to college and provide increased knowledge of opportunities to assist with paying for a student's education."}, {"section_title": "Documents", "text": "The researcher reviewed a variety of documents provided by Wyman College to better understand the resources and support provided to low-income, first-generation African American students. These documents included several admissions documents that highlight the resources offered at Wyman College. In addition, the researcher observed a sample financial aid letter. Within these documents, the researcher was looking for information that would support a student's decision to attend Wyman College from a lens of someone who is first-generation and low-income. The researcher focused on information that explained process and highlighted costs. Two of the admissions documents included information about costs, highlighting the percentage of first-year students who receive financial aid and the dollar amount of scholarships awarded annually. On the last page of these documents, there was a breakdown of tuition and financial aid for attendance. These included the cost for room and board and sites to visit to search for scholarships. A notable attribute of the document is that it clearly outlines the tuition, fees, room, and board costs for the academic year. The researcher could also easily determine the range of merit aid awarded to students, though that range was vast ($2,000 to $30,000 per year). The researcher saw this range as problematic for first-generation students, because there was no indication of how these monies are awarded or the amount of the average award. The researcher felt that someone who was trying to understand the costs of college could be misled by the large range with no further description or explanation. The researcher also paid close attention to the fine print on these documents. Particularly, the researcher looked at terms or concepts that may be unfamiliar to someone who has little to no experience with the college environment. Some of these terms included \"co-curricular,\" \"standard multiple occupancy room,\" and \"traditional full-time students.\" What would these terms mean to someone who is first-generation? The researcher also reviewed a sample financial aid award letter (Appendix F) through the lens of a low-income, first-generation student while thinking about the themes that emerged from the student interviews. Overall, the researcher viewed this document as clear and understandable. The direct and indirect costs were outlined in the letter, which allows the student to better prepare for the costs that do not directly relate to academics and housing. The letter appropriately reminded the student to be mindful of these direct and indirect costs and recommended that students compare the Wyman College financial aid letter to those of other schools they are accepted to. The letter also clearly outlined the financial aid award package, broken down by the amount of aid by type (scholarships, grants, and loans) with an explanation of what each type means. There is also a definition of Estimated Family Contribution (EFC), which allows the student to understand how the aid package was determined. Next, the total cost of attendance (tuition, room, board, and fees) is shown with the financial aid award subtracted, which allows the student to see their estimated cost for the first semester. The letter clearly states that the numbers are a yearly cost estimate and may change depending on the type of room selected for housing. The researcher felt that the financial aid letter was transparent and provided adequate definitions for the student. Wyman College also included clear information about who the student should contact if they had any questions about the financial aid letter. Overall, there were many positive observations from the researcher's review of the documents. The brochures contained a lot of information about the educational and out-ofclassroom opportunities at Wyman College. Information about the costs associated with attendance were in only two of the brochures observed, and in both cases this information was on the last page. The researcher considered the pros and cons of this information being in the back of the document versus more up front. It was important to note, as the researcher reviewed these documents, that they are being used to attract students to Wyman College, and therefore it makes sense that the educational opportunities are highlighted before the costs. One of the criticisms of the documents was that nowhere within the brochures or the letters was there text that indicated that the documents were available in other languages. When the researcher met with the admissions office, the staff said that they saw translated documents as helpful to the families of first-generation students to understand more about Wyman College. The absence of information about how to have documents translated led the researcher to wonder whether families would assume this service is offered and how they would know to reach out to the staff at Wyman College. After reviewing and coding the transcripts from the individual and group interviews and reflecting on the observations of the documents, the researcher developed a series of themes that relate to the research questions. The following sections describe each of those and any subordinate themes. Table 1 displays the alignment between the student participants and the derived themes. Table 1 Student Participant and Theme Alignment An 'X' indicates that the participant identified with the theme."}, {"section_title": "Janessa", "text": "Lynn Admissions Office Support n/a n/a n/a n/a Advocate and Mentors Outside the Home Theme One: Support Navigating the Admissions Process The students who participated in the study all grew up in households where one or more parent completed high school, but no parent attended college. When asked about working with their family through the college application process, they all stated that it was difficult at times to communicate with their family during their college admissions experience. McCarron and Inkelas's 2006 study found that the inclusion of parents in the educational process not only boosts students' higher education aspirations but also reduces the culture shock associated with the transition to college. One theme derived from the data the researcher collected is that a lack of understanding of the college admissions process by parents of first-generation students has an impact on the application process."}, {"section_title": "Student Communication with Family", "text": "The researcher asked each of the participants to speak about communicating with their family throughout the college decision making process. There were a variety of experiences, but a common theme that these students experienced was an inability to successfully translate what they were being told by high school guidance counselors to their family. Lucy shared that her father attended college visits with her and that he saved money to assist her with tuition. Lucy spoke with her mother about attending a community college first to save money and then transferring to a four-year institution, but her mother discouraged her from making that decision. Most of the conversations that Lucy had with her parents about college were not about the type of school she would attend or her major; instead her conversations focused on the financial aid package and the cost to attend. Lynn described her experience communicating with her mother this way: \"There'd be things I'd like to try to explain to her like, this is the process I need to go through, and she wouldn't understand, and I wouldn't totally understand either.\" To assist with communication, Lynn would often ask her guidance counselor to call her mother while Lynn was in the office so that processes could be explained to her and her mother at the same time. Lynn stated that they approached the college application and decision-making process in a very step-by-step manner, taking each piece one at a time so she and her mother could understand it. Of most difficulty for Lynn's mother was understanding housing and what it entails to live on campus. Paula's experience with her family was the outlier of the group. When asked about her experience communicating with her mother, Paula quickly responded that her mother was not involved in her college search process. Paula stated that her mother was not really involved and that, \"She wanted me to do it myself because I am an adult.\" Paula used resources at her high school to help her through the process and involved her mother very little. Similar to Lynn's sentiments, Paula described the entire process as very hard as she needed to not only understand how to apply but also the mechanisms that exist to help her pay for college."}, {"section_title": "Admissions Office Support", "text": "The admissions office staff described their efforts to educate and communicate with the families of prospective students. Wyman College hosts two Accepted Students Days for prospective students and their families. Within the program, there are sessions geared towards families to help them understand the cost of a Wyman College education as well as what Wyman has to offer. Many of the students in the study stated that they attended one of these events and their family members attended the programs geared towards families. The admissions office staff also mentioned the written materials given to prospective students and families and the shift toward offering these in other languages, especially Spanish. The researcher asked the staff of the admissions office how they have addressed the use of jargon or terms in their materials that may be unknown to those who are not familiar with the college application process. The admission office staff admitted that this is something that they have not addressed and would like to make a priority in the future. Admissions staff spoke about their work with first-generation students and families as they navigate and understand the college application process. The largest difference between working with first-generation students and families as opposed to their counterparts is the amount of communication. Admissions staff may speak with a first-generation prospective student once a week or multiple times a week to provide them support as they apply to Wyman College. Admissions Office staff at Wyman College also participate in panels across the greater Boston area to help educate families about the college admissions process, and this may happen as early as the student's junior year of high school. The admissions office staff explained the importance of the relationships they have across campus, because many times they refer students and family members to other offices for additional support. Some examples of this included academic affairs to discuss academic support and housing to speak more about living on campus. Collaboration with offices across campus is valuable in terms of provided resources and support to those students who have little to no experience with college."}, {"section_title": "Advocate and Mentors Outside the Home", "text": "A recurring theme throughout this research was the assistance from high school staff and counselors on the college application process. McKillip, Rawls, and Barry (2012) studied the impact that high school guidance counselors have on a student's decision to attend college. The assistance provided by guidance counselors, including completion of applications and financial aid forms, is particularly beneficial to first-generation students who do not have this type of support at home. The importance of these interactions with guidance counselors was highlighted throughout the researcher's interviews with the students at Wyman College. The students in the study all indicated that they received assistance from someone at their high school as they navigated the college application and acceptance process. Terms that were often used when speaking about guidance counselor support were \"advocate\" and \"mentor.\" Lynn stated that, \"Those were the people that really advocated for me and making sure that I went to college,\" as she referred to the METCO Coordinator at her high school. For Lynn, these individuals also instilled in her a desire to attend college and helped her understand what the college experience would be like. Paula referenced the assistance of members of the career center at her high school. Paula stated that they helped students by exposing them to resources that would assist them in the college application process, such as guest speakers who came to her school to talk about college. Paula took advantage of these resources and support by attending weekly meetings with someone from the career center. Lucy met with her guidance counselor weekly at times, and many of those sessions were used to assist Lucy with writing her college essays. Lucy recalled receiving assistance from her guidance counselor when completing the common application, used for all the colleges she applied to. Lucy's described this experience as having someone who would \"go over the different steps into getting admitted.\" Janessa spoke about the guidance counselors at her high school assisting her with paying the application fees, so she could apply to multiple schools. Lucy spoke a lot about the need for support outside the home, specifically at school, as a first-generation student navigates the college decision-making process. Lucy stated that lowincome, African American families who have no college experience at home \"are embarrassed about\" their lack of knowledge, and as she described, being poor. She spoke about the need for more diversity programs to support African American students and providing a space for these students to feel comfortable talking about their current situation and their academic goals. Lucy closed her interview by saying that low-income, first-generation African American students \"have the intelligence, but they don't have the courage to really speak up\" to ask for support and additional resources."}, {"section_title": "Theme Two: Understanding of Cost", "text": "College costs involve many factors: tuition, room, board, fees, and books/supplies. Many students, specifically those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, make college decisions based solely on the cost to attend. In this study, the researcher inquired about the impact that the cost of attendance had on the participants' decision to attend Wyman College. The students were asked to speak about their understanding of the cost of attendance and how they approached the financial aid process. The researcher also asked the admissions office staff to speak about how they help students understand the cost of attendance and if their messaging is different for those who are first-generation and/or come from a low-income household."}, {"section_title": "Understanding Tuition Bills", "text": "The researcher observed the contents of a typical financial aid letter for a student at Wyman College. The researcher concluded that the financial letter was clear and provided the student a detailed understanding of the cost for tuition. The observations of the researcher are not in line with the feedback from the study participants regarding cost awareness. The researcher asked the student participants to speak about their experience with understanding how much it would cost for them to attend Wyman College. Lucy stated that she had no idea how much she would be expected to pay after deducting her scholarship. She went onto state that she was surprised to learn that the cost of tuition would rise each year. She felt that this increase was never explained to her during the decision-making process. Paula's comments were similar to Lucy's regarding the rise of tuition each year. Paula stated that she was unaware that tuition would increase each year and when she was placed in a single room, she was unaware that it would cost more. Paula stated that she wished that the \"people of Wyman would have told us more about that\" and the \"first time you kind of figured things through when you got your first bill.\" Lynn concurred with the other participants when she stated that she did not realize the actual cost to attend Wyman College until she got to campus. Janessa recalled coming home from high school with information about the college application process, and that she and her mother had no idea what to make of the information. Janessa often relied on the assistance of her aunt who had some experience with college to help her and her mother understand. The admissions office staff was asked to describe how they help students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds and first-generation, to understand the tuition bill. A staff member stated that they often connect students with a member of the student financial services office since they are better able to explain the cost of attendance and the impact of financial aid. One admissions office staff member stated that, \"One of the things I think we do a really good job at is beginning to have those conversations very early in the process, so there are no surprises.\" Admissions counselors often direct prospective students and families to student financial services if they learn through their interactions with the student and family that there are financial concerns. Admissions also offers a session about tuition payment options and financial aid at Accepted Students Days. The admissions office staff described the tuition bill as being clear, listing both the direct and indirect costs of attendance, which is something the researcher observed while reviewed the documents. An admissions office staff member stated that, \"The habits we've tried to get into in this office is really encouraging families to make sure that they feel comfortable with what the financial aid picture is going to be before they send in their enrollment deposit.\""}, {"section_title": "Navigating Financial Aid", "text": "Each of the students who participated in the study completed the FAFSA form with the hope that they would receive financial aid. A consistent response about the process of applying for financial aid was that it was confusing and cumbersome. The student experience varied when it involved gathering the necessary documents to complete the FAFSA forms. Paula was easily able to work with her mother to get tax documents and other information she needed for the forms. Lynn described applying for financial aid as \"frustrating\" the first time she needed do it. She describes that this frustration came from not understanding what she was doing. Lynn's process with the FAFSA form was more complicated because she and her mother needed to communicate with the IRS for copies of tax documents that were required for the form. Later in the conversation, Lynn described an interaction she had with the student financial services office at Wyman College when she asked for help with how to pay her tuition. Lynn remarked that the person she spoke to \"was white, and she, like, she looked at me like I was stupid.\" This left Lynn feeling a strong lack of support from the administration at Wyman College. Lucy completed the FAFSA forms without assistance from her family and instead looked to her guidance counselor to assist with the process, citing that her parents had no understanding of what to do. Lucy found the FAFSA process depressing, stating that the forms ask for every piece of information about you, and in the end, you see how very little you have financially. Janessa recalled that her experience with the financial aid application process was stressful. She described having to go back and forth between her mother and her high school to complete the forms since she need information from her mother."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Scholarships on College Choice", "text": "The students who participated in the study all chose Wyman College because of the amount of money they received through financial aid. When asked about the role that cost played into the college decision-making process, there were many overlapping ideas. Paula stated that cost \"played a very big role\" as she relies on scholarships and loans to pay for her schooling. Paula was interested in Wyman College from the beginning but cited the financial aid package as what confirmed her decision to attend. Lynn never thought that college would be a possibility given her financial situation, coupled with her insecurity about her intellectual ability to attend. Lynn commented that college is \"way too much money and like, you know, so it's, it's just a lot of things that made me believe I shouldn't be here.\" Like others who participated in this study, Lynn planned to attend Bunker Hill Community College, but after receiving her financial aid package from Wyman College, she decided to attend Wyman. For Lynn, the deciding factor was the scholarship she received. Just as the other participants mentioned in their interviews, Lucy's decision to attend Wyman College was based on the scholarship she received. Lucy applied to many of the state universities in Massachusetts and was awarded the most aid by Wyman College. Janessa applied to a state school in her home state of New Hampshire, but after receiving her financial aid package from Wyman College, it made more fiscal sense to attend Wyman. When asked about the deciding factor to attend Wyman, Janessa simply stated that is was the money.

Lynn commented that her favorite subjects are math and science, and she has a strong interest in television shows about forensic science, which led to her choose a career that she feels is \"very cool.\" Lucy originally chose communications as her major at Wyman College but quickly felt that her chosen major would not allow for many job opportunities in the future. Lucy switched her major to sociology because she enjoys social work and the ability to help others. She spoke of personal experience with seeing an aunt struggle with alcohol abuse and an uncle who she described as abusive, and she wants a career that helps people better their lives.

She described being first-generation as exciting but also said there is a great deal of pressure to be perfect and make the experience look easy to her family. Paula stated that her \"family expects me to succeed\" and that creates a lot of pressure. After her first semester of college, Paula returned home and realized that there was not a future for her in her hometown, and this has propelled her to value her education even more. Lynn's comments about why she chose to attend college mirrored Paula's. Lynn stated that her mother instilled the idea of attending college from a young age. Lynn's mother has always been a big advocate of college for future success. Lucy described a conversation she had with her parents wherein they encouraged her to attend college because they did not want to see her struggle as they did and told her that they saw a college degree as a means for change. Lucy described the pressure that she feels to be successful while at Wyman College to create more opportunities for herself and to take care of her family. Lucy spoke about the support that she must find on campus as a first-generation student.

The overarching research question-\"What information was made available to firstgeneration African American students from low-income families that contributed to their decision to attend college?\"-was analyzed using a qualitative approach, utilizing a case study methodology at a private, four-year, liberal arts institution in Greater Boston. The literature reviewed for this study described the many factors that make the college-admissions process more difficult for this population, which includes a lack of understanding of the college process and lack of knowledge and support in the home. The researcher used a case-study approach to understand how colleges can better support and guide students through the complicated admissions process and what support and guidance a group of college-going students utilized during their admissions process. A case-study approach allowed the researcher to study multiple facets of the college decision-making process, from the perspective of students and of an academic institution. The theoretical framework applied to this study was Einhorn and Hogarth's Behavioral Decision Theory (1981) which was coupled with a conceptual framework, specifically Laura Perna's College Choice Model (2006). By using these theoretical and conceptual frameworks, the researcher was able to better understand how resources and support are used within the college decision-making process. The focus of this study was on low-income, first-generation African American students. The literature described the difficulties these students experienced during their individual college decision-making processes due to a lack of financial and personal support. This chapter is organized by three major themes: college partnerships with local high schools; family outreach and involvement; and financial guidance. Findings under each of the themes will be discussed in relation to and with a focus on the chosen theoretical and conceptual frameworks. The current literature described in an earlier chapter will be evaluated in terms of how it supports or contradicts the study's findings. Next, implications of the study's findings on future practice will be discussed. Additionally, the chapter will include suggested areas for further research and inquiry based on this study. In closing, the researcher will discuss implications for personal professional practice."}, {"section_title": "College Partnerships with Local High Schools", "text": "The findings under the theme of college partnerships with local high schools revealed the importance of college and university staff members using their knowledge and experience to reach more high-school students as they enter the college-search process. Through conversations with the student participants, the researcher was able to better understand how the guidance and support from high school staff members impacts a student's understanding of the collegeadmissions process and the student's decision about where to attend. A positive outcome of college partnerships with high schools is that the more knowledgeable and resourceful the high school staff is, the more eligible college students there are for colleges and universities. Therefore, it is beneficial for colleges and universities to provide support and resources to high schools, so students can encounter information early in their high-school career to ensure they are prepared and well equipped to navigate the college decision-making process later. Knowledge and guidance align with Einhorn and Hogarth's theoretical framework, as it is this information and support that allow students to make an educated decision about where to attend college. Einhorn and Hogarth's (1981) Behavioral Decision Theory speaks to the need for information, the ability to understand that information, and help from experts or aids when making a decision. Each of these factors, described in Einhorn and Hogarth's theoretical framework, can be seen in this research study. The students who participated in the study spoke about a lack of access to and understanding of information when navigating the admissions process and ultimately making the decision about where they would attend college. They each spoke about an inability for them and their family members to understand what was required throughout the process and the reliance they had on high-school counselors and coaches to help manage the college-application process. Perna's (2006) conceptual framework, which is broken into four layers, speaks about how familiarity with the college process and knowledge about the costs of attendance will impact if and where an individual attends college. Layer Two speaks to the school and community context and how the availability and type of knowledge provided to an individual has an impact on their college-going. Through these frameworks, it became clear to the researcher that information and knowledge are vital to college-going rates of all populations, but particularly to those who have less access to resources and support. High-school counselors are on the frontline of the college decision-making process as they work with students to select and apply to colleges. Students who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and are first in their family to attend college are more likely to need additional resources and support as they have a disadvantage in terms of prior information and knowledge. As revealed in an earlier chapter, low-income, first-generation African American students lack cultural capital compared to their White counterparts as it relates to access and support (Welton & Martinez, 2004). The study's student participants all relied on support and advice from their guidance counselors when deciding where they should attend college. Colleges would be better served if they found ways to collaborate with high-school guidance counselors in their mission to assist high-school students with meeting the goal of attending college. As described by the Wyman College admissions office, they attend local high-school events to talk about what one can expect from the admissions process. The area surrounding Wyman College contains many low-income households and has much racial diversity. Wyman College staff's practices can close the gap for those who are new to the college-admissions process by allowing for more exposure to information and support. Supporting the efforts of high-school guidance counselors by going into high schools to speak with students and families about the college-admissions process should include a discussion about college costs and financial aid. This finding of the study aligns with the researched presented by McKinney and Novak (2012) who found that the number of presentations at local high schools increases the number of students who seek out aid. As described in the literature, students from low-income backgrounds, students who are firstgeneration, and those who identify as African American are less likely to seek out aid due to fear of debt and a lack of understanding about the aid process (Long, 2010;Elliot & Friedline, 2013). Throughout the literature, it was noted that lack of knowledge was a barrier for enrollment, specifically for African American men. Martinez and Welton (2014) found that many low-income African American students attend high schools where support and guidance from high-school staff is lacking. By supporting the efforts of high-school guidance counselors, especially of understaffed high schools, the pipeline could be strengthened between K-12 and higher education. Diop (2010) wrote that the equitable distribution of information about college and adequate advisement can make drastic difference in college-going for African American students. If high schools in low-income areas don't have resources to provide adequate support to their students, colleges can serve in that role by providing workshops for students. Einhorn and Hogarth's (1981) Behavioral Decision Theory tells us that information is key to decision making, and collaboration with local high schools can provide more support, resources, and guidance for students when deciding if they will attend college. A vital component of these stronger connections with local high schools is more intentional outreach with families, which will be explored in more detail through the next finding."}, {"section_title": "Family Outreach and Involvement", "text": "Families are an important part of the college-going process for all populations, but as the literature indicates, students who identify as low-income and first-generation often lack family support due to a lack of experience and knowledge. A second finding of this study is the importance of building connections with the families of students, especially those families who are sending their first student to college. As Long (2010) writes, first-generation students tend to lack support from their family and community as they engage in the college-application process. The study's student participants all spoke about the struggles they had with communicating with their family about the college process and how at times this made it difficult to make decisions. The admissions office at Wyman College indicated that first-generation students typically require more attention, and on average these students or family members call the admissions office more frequently than those who have college experience. McKillip et al. (2012) write about the cultural capital that is missing for students from low-income, first-generation backgrounds, which can be a disadvantage as they embark on the college-admissions process and as they try to understand and utilize financial aid. Einhorn and Hogarth's (1981) Behavioral Decision Theory speaks to the environment, or the space in which decisions are made. This environment includes the experts and aids who surround the decision maker. Individuals seek out the advice of others when having to make a choice. Einhorn and Hogarth (1981) write about high-risk, high-stress choices and the impact that environment can have on individuals. The students in this study did not have experts or aids in the home and needed to rely on others (or on themselves) for guidance. In conversations with the students, they each spoke about the pressure and stress that exists with being a firstgeneration student and that they see their college degree as advancement for the entire family. This pressure was very present for these students as they engaged in the college-application process. The lack of support at home coupled with the pressure to make the right decision for the future of their family created a complex environment for low-income, first-generation students. Partnering with families is of great importance if colleges and universities want to open more doors for underserved populations. Mwangi (2015) study found that families can have the greatest impact on a student's decision about if and where they will attend college. Many families are not equipped with enough information to support their student during the collegeapplication process. This finding can be an extension of the previous one, as much of this outreach can be done during high school. Layer One of Perna's College Choice Model (2006) speaks the impact of an individual's habitus has on their college decision making. Perna writes about the impact that gender, race, socioeconomic status, and familiarity with the college-going process has on a person's decision about if and where to attend college. As seen in the analysis of this study's student interviews, family knowledge and support was lacking in the students' homes. This is reinforced by the literature, specifically the research of Hallet and Griffen (2015), who found that parental involvement in the college process has a direct correlation to the likelihood that African American students from low-income communities will attend college. Mwangi's (2015) research indicates that parents can have the greatest impact within the college-choice process, and therefore effort should be made to educate families whenever possible. Wyman College recently began offering their college materials in Spanish, which provides more information to a larger population, but this could be expanded further by offering materials in a variety of languages. It would be equally important to ensure that brochures and other materials are clear and written in a transparent manner for new users. Hallet and Griffen (2015) found that families of first-generation students felt disempowered and unable to be involved in the process with their student. Colleges would be able to better serve more populations by empowering families with the knowledge to support their students. Efforts to better inform families should include the college-admissions process and financial guidance, which will be described in the next finding."}, {"section_title": "Financial Guidance", "text": "The study participants all spoke about the role that finances and aid had on decision making. The Wyman College admissions office staff spoke about the need to be transparent with students and families regarding the cost to attend, including both direct and indirect costs. The admissions office staff mentioned that better communication with some families is necessary to ensure that everyone understands the cost of attending the college. The students who participated in the study felt that they were unaware of the cost of attendance and both they and their families found this confusing. As the researcher analyzed the data, this gap became quite evident. Cost of attendance also includes access to and understanding of information regarding financial aid, especially need-based aid opportunities. Long's (2010) research indicates that access to need-based aid has a greater impact on the enrollment of low-income students. Castleman and Long (2016) wrote that the impact of a small increase in financial aid (no more than $1,000) can greatly impact someone's decision to attend college. The researcher concluded that more needs to be done to support students and their families in understanding the cost to attend and available avenues to offset those costs. As stated in previous findings, the theoretical framework used for this study stresses the importance of having information in making decisions. There is also a need for people to have a full understanding of information to make informed decisions. Page and Scott-Clayton (2016) wrote that when students and families are exposed to information about college financing, they are more likely to benefit from aid programs. Information about the indirect and direct costs of attendance and the long-term cost of attendance are vital to providing an overall picture for students and families about the cost of obtaining a degree. As seen through the experience of Wyman College's admissions office staff, families of low-income, first-generation students require more attention and information as it relates to cost to attend. McKinney and Novak (2012) wrote about the importance for college staff to be present in high schools and at college fairs to speak to families about college costs and assist them in understanding the FAFSA process. Looking at financial guidance through the lens of the Perna's conceptual model, the researcher saw a correlation between financial knowledge and Layers One, Two, and Three. Layer One speaks to the student's home demographics, Layer Two speaks to the availability of information within high school, and Layer Three speaks to the recruitment practices of colleges and universities. Each of these layers plays a role in the amount and type of information that a student and family have as they embark on the college decision-making process. The researcher concludes that Layers Two (high school) and Three (college and universities) need to bridge the gap between what information is provided to students and families as they engage in the admissions process. With the knowledge that students from low-income backgrounds are more reluctant to take on debt, and are therefore less likely to seek out aid, high schools and colleges can better partner to inform students about debt, repayment, and how this impacts the overall cost of attendance (Long, 2010). College costs were a great point of stress for the study's student participants and was an area that they each felt the lack of support at home when trying to figure out the cost to attend. High schools and colleges can better serve all populations by increasing the availability of information and ensuring that there are resources available to students and families to understand that information."}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Practice", "text": "This study aimed to highlight the resources and support that assist low-income, firstgeneration African American students in their decision-making regarding college attendance. Low-income, first-generation African American students are not attending college at the same rate as their White counterparts due in part to a lack of knowledge about the college-going process. The researcher hopes that by filling the gaps of misinformation and misunderstood information, more eligible high-school graduates who identify as low-income, first-generation, and African American will have more access to higher education. It has become clear through this study that this population lacks knowledge about the college-application and college-going processes and is not able to gain much support from family members. This section will discuss empirically grounded recommendations for higher education staff members to consider to better serve low-income, first-generation African American students as they engage in the college process. Specifically, the researcher will utilize the findings of this study to develop actual practices for colleges and universities to increase access and opportunity. High School Liaisons. Support and information are important components of a student's college-search process. The researcher suggests that college and universities work with high schools to create a liaison program. In some areas of the country, colleges and universities are sparse in number, and there could be many high schools nearby campus, so there may be a need to do this in a group setting. But in many other parts of the country, there is a lot of opportunity for colleges to better support the efforts of high-school guidance counselors. Colleges and universities should consider partnering with local high schools to provide workshops and individual meetings with students and families to answer questions about the college-application process and financing a college education. The focus of this type of partnership could be with school systems that serve low-income households, since the research states that these communities typically lack adequate financial and human resources to assist students. Colleges and universities would therefore give back to the communities where they are located by serving in a liaison role. In this recommendation, the relationship with students, families, and guidance counselors would not serve as a recruitment tool for colleges, but instead would exist as an effort to provide more resources and support. College administrators can help to fill the gaps in these secondary schools by creating partnerships or memorandums of understanding with high schools in low-income areas to provide workshops and guidance to students, families, and guidance staff. The researcher argues that there is an importance for college and university staff to begin outreach early in a student's high school career and ensure that outreach is consistent throughout the enrollment and matriculation process. Colleges and universities should develop online and in-person resources for families to meet them where they are and to accommodate work schedules and family commitments. This would involve more work and likely more personnel, but the result would be more families and students who feel empowered to make college-going decisions. Colleges and universities should work more closely with high schools within their community to offer financial-literacy programs for students and families or to find external resources for students and families to develop financial plans for college. The researcher considered some of the obstacles to this recommendation, the first being that not every college-application process is the same, but it could be argued that there are enough similarities that foundational information could be provided. Colleges tend to have similar admissions processes and the FAFSA is used nationwide, so a college liaison would be able to provide enough information to guide high-school students through the general process. The researcher also recognizes that these efforts would create an additional personnel cost for colleges that may not translate into matriculated students. This is a significant obstacle to this practice recommendation, but for many underserved areas, there could be opportunity to partner with multiple colleges to decrease the burden on any one college's staff. Colleges and universities have the expertise to assist high-school guidance counselors in their efforts to educate students and families about the admissions process. Higher education in general would be well served if more was done to close the gap between the institutions trying to help send students to college and the institutions who are trying to recruit students. Colleges and universities would be better served by identifying ways to better support families and students during the college process. College staffs' expertise about the admissions and financial-aid processes can be useful to families as they support their children. College staffs and high school guidance counselors should find more opportunities to reach out to families through a variety of touchpoints. Families may need access to individual meetings or workshops after hours or on weekends to accommodate work schedules."}, {"section_title": "Recruitment practices.", "text": "A consistent message from the study's student participants was a lack of understanding about the expectations of applying to college and for financial aid. Admission offices typically have each admissions counselor work with a specific population and/or area of the country. For those who are working in communities where there is a high concentration of low-income and first-generation students, the researcher suggests that more time and energy be placed on recruitment efforts. Admission offices should consider assigning multiple people to some communities to allow for more individualized attention. Admissions staff assigned to these communities should be given access to translators or a translation system to convert materials and for easier communication with families. Admissions offices should also consider starting the recruitment cycle sooner in these communities to allow more time for students and families to understand process and gather necessary documents for applications and the FAFSA form. A specific recommendation regarding recruitment practices would be the inclusion of alumni from the high schools to participate in visits with the admissions staff. It was evident from the students who participated in the study that there is a lack of confidence in their ability to be enrolled in college. After review of the literature, the researcher assumes that this feeling is shared by many high school students who come from low socio-economic households, are the first to consider college, and identify as African American. These students are unable to see themselves as being \"college-material.\" By bringing students who graduated from these high schools to speak with current students, those high school students may begin to see themselves as college students. The alumni can assist in providing the resources and support that they may have lacked by speaking about the admissions process, the worries of paying the bill, and how to best communicate with family members who do not understand the admissions process. The researcher recommends included current students in the recruitment process to add an additional layer of support. Additionally, admissions offices should consider sending a member of the financial services office to these communities with the admissions counselor to provide more one-on-one opportunities for students and families to understand college costs. As admissions staff members build relationships with prospective students, they will hopefully be able to identify those students and families who lack a full understanding of cost and aid opportunities. Financial services staff should attend community visits with the admissions counselor to provide individual and group support to students and families and to provide information from an expert in that area, which also removes the barrier of family members needing to travel to campus. The literature and the theoretical framework describe how more information and a greater understanding of that information is of value to decision making. For low-income, firstgeneration students, access to resources and support is essential to their college-going experience and a team approach could provide a more informative and meaningful recruitment process. Literature. Recruitment documents, whether they are in print or online, should be written from the lens of a first-generation student. As the researcher observed the documents collected as a part of this case study, there were both strengths and weaknesses. The researcher observed a great deal of information about the student experience and academic support on campus. From the perspective of a first-generation student, the cost of attendance and option for aid were not as clear. Colleges would be well served to enhance these documents and/or provide additional documents to more clearly define costs and opportunities for financial aid. Additionally, these documents should be readily available in the most largely spoken languages in the United States, minimally Spanish, and available for translation to other languages upon request. Well-written and clear literature can serve as a guide for conversations with students and families. Admissions counselors can use the documents to walk through the college application and financial-aid process to help ensure that students and families understand expectations and requirements. To ensure that information is clear and understandable, the researcher suggests that admissions office officials meet with current students and ask them to review the documents and describe what information was helpful and confusing during their search process. The students who were interviewed through this study all felt unprepared for the cost of attendance beyond their financial-aid package and for future semesters on campus. Documents could be created for students to individually show them their cost to attend as well as projected costs for the future. It would need to be clear that this information would be an estimate, but it would hopefully provide these students and families with the tools they need to save for future semesters."}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Further Research", "text": "The purpose of this research study was to understand the impact that resources and support have on the college-going of low-income, first-generation African American students. Through the review of the literature and interviews with student participants, the researcher was led to consider other possibilities for exploring college access inequality. Suggested further research includes a more systemic understanding of the disadvantages faced by low-income, first-generation African American students outside of information and resources. These disadvantages begin at a young age and include access to quality education and tutoring. As the researcher engaged with the student participants, they spoke about their high-school experience and being at schools that did not challenge them academically. These students desired greater academic challenges and exposure to knowledge and experiences unknown to them. Further research could provide an understanding of how systemic racism and classism restrict many students of color from receiving an education that is equal to or better than their White counterparts. Additionally, as the researcher engaged with student participants, they each spoke about their individual struggles with being African American at a Predominately White Institution (PWI). They specifically spoke about the acts of racism that they have experienced, and, in some cases, that have caused them to disengage from campus activities. More research could be conducted to understand how to best support underrepresented populations at academic institutions through their curricular and co-curricular endeavors, specifically for those students who identify as low-income and first-generation. How do these markers and experiences impact their college experience? Additionally, the student participants each spoke about how cost of attendance and their financial-aid award were the determining factors in choosing Wyman College. It would be of interest to the researcher to understand more about how these students reflect on their decision as they progress through their degree and after they graduate. Given the lack of institutional fit they each described, would they still choose cost of attendance over fit if given the opportunity to do it again? Lastly, the researcher suggests that there is a need for a greater understanding about the role that colleges play in providing resources and support to matriculated low-income, firstgeneration African American students as it relates to finances and future earnings. The students in the study all selected majors that they stated would provide financial security and upward social mobility. A longitudinal qualitative study would provide some insight on the level of comfort students have with college finances and ability to pay back loans as they progress though their studies and after graduation. Are colleges and universities providing an adequate amount of financial literacy to students from low-income backgrounds or do colleges simply hope that they can \"catch up\" to their White counterparts? To increase access and opportunity for low-income, first-generation African American students, it is vital for research to continue about how to best support these students through their K-12 education and well into their college journey."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Personal Practice", "text": "This study took the researcher on a path of self-reflection. Entering this study, the researcher was wary of their ability to understand the student experience as it was drastically different than the researcher's personal experience. The researcher has no understanding of financial stress or the inability to communicate with others about the college-going process. As the research journey unfolded, the researcher understood how impactful their experience was to their everyday work in student affairs and to their overall understanding of higher education. Data tells us that the number of college-ready high-school graduates will decrease in the coming decade due to lower birth rates, which will mean that colleges will be competing for a smaller group of eligible students. Additionally, future college-ready graduates will be comprised largely of Hispanic and African American students due to changing demographics. The literature is clear that higher education is failing these populations by not providing them with resources and support to earn a college degree and therefore, the contributing to this population's inability to increase their social mobility. As a student affairs professional, the researcher is now equipped with an understanding of the student experience and can determine ways to be an advocate on campus. Using the information learned from this study to work with colleagues in admissions about the needs of this population and providing research-based outcomes for opportunities could open more doors for low-income, first-generation African American students. As a higher-education professional, the researcher is more aware of the systemic inequalities that exist within colleges and universities. The conversations with the student participants provided a glimpse into the isolation and stress felt by students from low-income backgrounds who are the first in their family to attend college. The researcher hopes that through this work, greater opportunities can be developed on campus for first-generation students to assist them with their transition to college. Additionally, the researcher's work has always had a focus on providing support and opportunity for students while they are in college, and this study renewed a desire to do more and to serve students in the best ways possible. From this research, it became clear that opportunity is not equal, and for some, college graduation can feel far away and unattainable. As a professional working with students, the researcher can have an impact on that experience. The researcher looks forward to sharing what has been learned through this research to make an impact on the field and on higher education. I agree to take part in this research.
