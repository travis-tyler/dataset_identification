[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common and highly heritable with many genes and gene variants associated with AD in one or more studies, including APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54. However, the genetic backgrounds for normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in terms of changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b2 1-42 , T-tau, and P-tau 181P , have not been clearly delineated. We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better define the genetic backgrounds to these three states in relation to CSF levels. Methods: Subjects were participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The GWAS dataset consisted of 818 participants (mainly Caucasian) genotyped using the Illumina Human Genome 610 Quad BeadChips. This sample included 410 subjects (119 Normal, 115 MCI and 176 AD) with measurements of CSF A\u03b2 1-"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. An estimated 10 percent of Americans over the age of 65 and half of those over age 85 have AD. More than 4.5 million Americans currently suffer from the disease. In autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, age of onset < 60 years), three susceptible genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) have been identified [1, 2] . Lateonset AD (LOAD) has~80% heritability, and is strongly associated with apolipoprotein E (APOE) [3] . APOE has three major alleles (\u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54) that have different effects on the risk of LOAD, with \u03b54 having between 10 and 30 times of risk of developing AD by 75 years of age [4] .\nIn addition, several genetic studies have identified putative susceptible loci and genetic variants, including sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) [5, 6] , death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) [7] , ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1) [8] , adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter 1, subfamily A (ABCA1) [9] , and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) [10] . Besides these findings, a large meta-analysis from the AlzGene database [11] reported 598 potential AD-susceptibility genes. For the past few years, genome-wide genotyping association studies brought considerable success by reporting new susceptible loci for AD such as Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) [12] [13] [14] [15] . Recently two groups published the two largest LOAD GWAS [16, 17] ; Harold et al. [16] reported the association of SNPs in clusterin (CLU) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and Lambert et al. [17] reported association of clusterin (CLU) with LOAD and additionally reported a novel association with complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (CR1). These new findings have provided valuable insights in the genetics, neuropathologic mechanisms and pathways associated with AD.\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) components \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2 ), total tau protein (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau 181P ) are biomarkers for AD and can be used to aid in diagnosis and to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD [18, 19] . These biomarkers can potentially be used in future applications to predict the development of MCI in cognitively normal subjects, progression to AD in MCI patients, and to monitor AD progression [20] [21] [22] [23] . These biomarkers may also be used to reveal genes that are important in AD pathogenesis. In the present study, we assessed the several putative AD genes associated with CSF biomarkers that were identified from major public GWAS dataset for Alzheimer's disease, the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). This initiative is the most comprehensive effort to identify neuroimaging measures and biomarkers associated with cognitive and functional changes in healthy elderly people and in people who have MCI and AD [24] . The ADNI data is useful for researchers who are searching for genes that contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, which currently affects more than 4.5 million people in the United States alone. We also investigated possible associations of CSF biomarkers (A\u03b2 1-42 , T-tau, and P-tau 181P ) with the number of APOE \u03b54 allele, age and APOE genotype in order to improve the characterization of the CSF biomarkers and genome-wide SNP genotyping data from the ADNI cohort. This is the first genome-wide association study to use these AD-related biomarkers to identify genes critical the pathogenesis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ ADNI.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principle Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the researchapproximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.

All samples had genotyping call rate > 95% and were retained. We then examined population stratification by visual inspection using the first two dimensions from principal components analysis, using SmartPCA from EIGENSTRAT http://genepath. med.harvard.edu/~reich/Software.htm [26, 27] . Selfreported ethnicity and racial identities for ADNI subjects were used to highlight samples in the PCA plot and are summarized in Additional file 2. 390 samples were retained after SmartPCA excluded 20 samples as outliers. We computed the top five principal component coordinates using SmartPCA to correct for stratification in association analysis. SmartPCA removed all but one of the Asian samples and retained Black/African Americans (Additional file 3); Visual inspection suggests that the first principal component (PC0), which explains the most variance in the data, separates the Caucasians and nonCaucasians reasonably well (setting threshold PC0 < = 0.01 can exclude all non-Caucasians). Finally, we excluded 52 non-Caucasian samples as outliers; the genomic control variance inflation factor \u03bb was 1.00983, suggesting minimal population admixture in the final sample used for association analysis.

The association analysis used a full linear model comprising three genetic effects: additive effects of allele dosage (ADD), dominance deviation from additivity (DOMDEV) (negative means the allele is recessive), and 2-df joint test of both additive and dominance (GENO_2DF). In addition, we used age (of being recruited by the study) and APOE \u03b54 genotype (number of APOE \u03b54 allele; 0, 1, 2) as covariates after removing outliers.

Several genetic studies have identified those genes as putative susceptible loci and genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease [34, 35] . However, close examination of nearby SNPs showed rs2899472 and rs2075650 were not supported by nearby SNPs in LD (nearby SNPs in LD are all nonsignificant). Because APOE genotypes are strongly associated with AD and TOMM40 is physically close to APOE, we focused on SNPs from adjusted results that consider APOE genotype and age. Here, we found 10 SNPs significantly associated with CSF biomarker level of A\u03b2 1-42 , 3 SNPs from T-tau, and 2 SNPs from P-tau 181P at 10 -6 significance level in normal subjects ( Figure 1 ). In addition, we found 1 SNP significantly associated with CSF biomarker level of A\u03b2 1-42 , 3 SNPs from T-tau, and 2 SNPs from P-tau 181P at 10 -6 significance level in MCI subjects ( Figure 2) . No SNPs were found at 10 -6 significance level in AD subjects (Figure 3 ).

Again, close examination of SNPs in LD with rs2899472 (CYP19A1) did not support rs2899472. The SNP rs1022442 was in close to genome-wide significance, supported by nearby SNPs (Figure 4) , and NCAM2 (neural cell adhesion molecule 2) gene was reported as a genetic factor related to the progression of AD in the Japanese population [36] . The A\u03b2 1-42 level grouped by the SNP rs1022442 genotype over all three cohorts (normal, MCI and AD) supports our finding ( Figure 5 ). Boxplots of A\u03b2 1-42 levels in normal subjects stratified by rs1022442 genotype showed significant differences between AA, AB and BB. Previous study indicated an increased risk associated with rs2899472 in AD patients, which was amplified in APOE \u03b54 carriers in their study [35] .

NCAM2 (Ensemble: ENSG00000154654, OMIM: 602040;) is a 541Kb gene at 21q21.1 with no known alternative spicing forms. Novartis SymAtlas human tissue survey shows the gene (Affymetrix probeset ID 205669_at) is ubiquitously expressed and is highly expressed in cardiac myocytes, Abbreviations: SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; ADD, additive effects of allele dosage; DOMDEV, dominance deviation from additivity, rather specifying that a particular allele is dominant or recessive; GENO_2DF, a 2 df joint test of both additive and dominance; A1, tested allele (minor allele); BETA, regression coefficient; STAT, coefficient t-statistic.\nblood cells, and appendix. Among neuronal tissues NCAM2 has higher expression levels in prefrontal cortex, superior cervical ganglion, and hypothalamus. The transcript (Ensembl: ENST00000400546) consists of 18 exons and encodes a 93 k-Da, 835-residue plasma membrane protein (NP_004531.2). The NCAM2 protein architecture includes 5 IgC2 (Immunoglobulin C-2 type) domains followed by two FN3 (fibronectin type 3) domains and a transmembrane domain. The gene is conserved in chimpanzee, dog, cow, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and fruit fly; the eight-domain protein architecture is also conserved in all these organisms except for cow which has only four IgC2 domains. Little is known about NCAM2 except that the protein interacts with prion protein [40] and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) [41] , is involved in neuron adhesion and fasciculation of neurons, and may be involved in AD [36] , prion disease, and Down syndrome [42, 43] . It is interesting to note that we found no significant association in APOE (rs769451, chr19: 50102751, p = 0.6682 for association with A\u03b2 1-42 level in normal subjects), but a SNP with strong association in the nearby TOMM40 (intronic SNP rs2075650, chr19:50087459, p = 3.03 \u00d7 10 -7 for association with A\u03b2 1-42 level in normal subjects), when age and the number of APOE e4 alleles were not included in the regression. The TOMM40 gene is related to how easily molecules can get into and out of the surface of the mitochondria, the energy center of cells. This gene is a transporter of proteins across the mitochondrial membrane, and Sortillin-related receptor, which functions to partition amyloid precursor protein away from \u03b2-secretase and -secretase [44] . This is consistent with observations that levels are reduced in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and MCI [44] [45] [46] . The TOMM40 gene has been reported in numerous studies in the study of AD genetics; for example, Yu et al. [47] reported possibility that loci in the TOMM40 gene may have a less effect on the risk for LOAD in Caucasians [47] , and recently Roses et al. [48] found evidence supporting a poly-T polymorphism (rs10524523, chr19:50094889) in TOMM40 affecting the AD age of onset in two independent clinical cohorts. The potential association of TOMM40 and A\u03b2 1-42 may be how the gene affects the risk and onset age of AD and should be further investigated. The CYP19A1 gene is localized on chromosome 15q21.2 and spans 123 kb. This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Cytochrome P450 aromatase is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of androgens, such as testosterone, to oestrogens, which act as sex steroid hormones but also function during growth and differentiation. There are high levels of expression in both the gonads and the brain [35] . Huang et al. [35] indicated an increased risk associated with SNP rs2899472 in the total number of AD patients, which was amplified in APOE \u03b54 carriers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our analysis of the ADNI genome-wide association study identified several putative loci that are in genetic association with A\u03b2 1-42 , T-tau and P-tau 181P levels in cerebrospinal fluids. In particular an intronic SNP rs1022442 of gene NCAM2 is close to genome-wide significance in association with A\u03b2 1-42 in normal subjects. Although the gene is poorly characterized in the literature, prior studies have implicated roles of NCAM2 in prion disease, Down syndrome, and AD. Our findings suggest NCAM2 could be part of the pathway on the pathogenesis of senile plaques in human brains with AD.\nWith only 119 normal subjects and 410 overall, the GWAS dataset is clearly underpowered. The most significant associations were identified using normal subjects since the variances of the CSF biomarker levels are much smaller in MCI and AD subjects due to dementia. Nonetheless, increasing the number of CSF biomarker measurements is challenging especially for normal subjects. An alternative that will substantially increase the sample size is to examine protein levels in blood instead of CSF, given levels of these proteins in blood are informative about AD pathology or prognosis [49] . Our analysis clearly demonstrates that quantitative trait linkage of biomarkers via genome-wide screening can reveal additional insights into the mechanism that connects known genetic factors to the disease [50] . Moving along this path requires further efforts by the research community towards larger sample size and accrual of additional biomarkers in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders."}, {"section_title": "Additional material", "text": "Additional file 1: Demographic, clinical and biomarker data for each subject group before removing 20 outliers (n = 410: Normal, MCI and AD).
