[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Geochemical cycling of the redox-sensitive trace elements arsenic (As) and vanadium (V) was examined in shallow pore waters from a marsh in an interdistributary embayment of the lower Mississippi River Delta. In particular, we explore how redox changes with depth and distance from the Mississippi River affect As and V cycling in the marsh pore waters. Previous geophysical surveys and radon mass balance calculations suggested that Myrtle Grove Canal and the bordering marsh receive fresh groundwater, derived in large part from seepage of the Mississippi River, which subsequently mixes with brackish waters of Barataria Bay. Additionally, the redox geochemistry of pore waters in the wetlands is affected by Fe and S cycling in the shallow subsurface (0-20 cm). Sediments with high organic matter content undergo SO 4 2 \u2212 reduction, a process ubiquitous in the shallow subsurface but largely absent at greater depths (~3 m). Instead, at depth, in the absence of organic-rich sediments, Fe concentrations are elevated, suggesting that reduction of Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides buffers redox conditions. Arsenic and V cycling in the shallow subsurface are decoupled from their behavior at depth, where both V and As appear to be removed from solution by either diffusion or adsorption onto, or coprecipitation with, authigenic minerals within the deeper aquifer sediments. Pore water As concentrations are greatest in the shallow subsurface (e.g., up to 315 nmol kg \u2212 1 in the top~20 cm of the sediment) but decrease with depth, reaching values < 30 nmol kg \u2212 1 at depths between 3 and 4 m. Vanadium concentrations appear to be tightly coupled to Fe cycling in the shallow subsurface, but at depth, V may be adsorbed to clay or sedimentary organic matter (SOM). Diffusive fluxes are calculated to examine the export of trace elements from the shallow marsh pore waters to the overlying canal water that floods the marsh. The computed fluxes suggest that the shallow sediment serves as a source of Fe, Mn, and As to the surface waters, whereas the sediments act as a sink for V. Iron and Mn fluxes are substantial, ranging from 50 to 30,000 and 770 to 4300 nmol cm \u2212 2 yr \u2212 1 , respectively, whereas As fluxes are much less, ranging from 2.1 to 17 nmol cm \u2212 2 yr \u2212 1 . Vanadium fluxes range from 3.0 nmol cm \u2212 2 yr \u2212 1 directed into the sediment to 1.7 nmol cm \u2212 2 yr \u2212 1 directed out of the sediment"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "1. Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Biogeochemistry and hydrology of coastal wetlands", "text": "The hydrology of coastal wetlands is complex and incorporates mixing of numerous hydrologic reservoirs, including surface waters and groundwaters (Fagherazzi et al., 2013; Sanders et al., 2015) . Additionally, chemical constituents (e.g., carbon, nutrients, metals) of shallow and deep pore waters flowing through wetlands may be substantially different than those of the surface estuary owing to input from terrestrial aquifers, adsorption/desorption reactions with mineral surfaces within the sediments, and biogeochemical reactions that occur where groundwater with enriched reduced species (e.g., Fe 2 + , Mn 2 + , HS \u2212 Biogeochemical reactions occurring in the STE may immobilize solutes within, or release solutes from, sediments into pore water, thus potentially altering the flux of solutes to the ocean (Berner, 1980; Moore, 1999; Cable et al., 1996; Charette and Sholkovitz, 2006; Santos et al., 2011) . For example, water discharged from the STE may act as a source of nutrients (Slomp and Van Cappellen, 2004; Paytan et al., 2006) , silica , carbon (Cai et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2006) , and iron (Windom et al., 2006; Charette et al., 2007) and may also affect the mass balance of oceanic tracers, such as Nd and its isotopes (Johannesson and Burdige, 2007; Johannesson et al., 2011; Chevis et al., 2015a) or Sr (Basu et al., 2001; Charette and Sholkovitz, 2006) to the coastal ocean. Moreover, studies of a number of redoxsensitive trace elements (e.g., Mo, U, V, Fe, Hg, As) demonstrate that the STE can serve as a source or sink of these trace elements depending on the geologic setting and dominant biogeochemical reactions occurring in the STE (e.g., Windom and Niencheski, 2003; Bone et al., 2006; Swarzenski and Baskaran, 2007; Gonneea et al., 2014; . For example, the STE may serve as a sink for uranium when oxidized marine water recirculates through reducing sediments , or as a source of uranium when coastal aquifer materials are enriched in uranium (e.g., phosphatic desposits; Swarzenski and Baskaran, 2007) . Many of these redox-sensitive trace elements (e.g., Mo, U, Re, V) are important as paleo-redox tracers of past ocean chemistry, and hence, understanding the coastal processes that control their fluxes and cycling is essential for interpreting chemical signatures in ancient marine rocks (e.g., Trefry and Metz, 1989; Rimmer, 2004; Morford et al., 2005; Tribovillard et al., 2006) .\nFlow of pore water through the STE of coastal wetlands is further complicated by Fe, S, and organic matter cycling within the marsh environment (Stumpp et al., 2014) . Whereas burial of carbon is important in Louisiana marshes, where deposition rates can reach 1 cm yr \u2212 1 in environments like those discussed in this paper (DeLaune et al., 2003; Kirman et al., 2016) , much of the primary productivity in a marsh is subjected to either remineralization or erosion from the marsh to the coast (Fagherazzi et al., 2013) . Marshes in many Louisiana estuaries are net erosional (Couvillion et al., 2011; Wilson and Allison, 2008) , with organic material both recycled in the estuary and exported to the coast (Bianchi et al., 2011a) . In salt marshes, the majority of the organic matter remineralization occurs in the top 20 cm of the sediment where the system is sensitive to changes in tides, rainfall, temperature, and vegetation growth (Lord and Church, 1983; Hunt et al., 1997; B\u00e1ez-Cazull et al., 2008) . Organic matter remineralization in sediments occurs during anaerobic respiration whereby microbes utilize oxidants for energy in order to conserve the most energy per mole of organic carbon consumed such that the energetic favorability of the oxidants (electron acceptors) decreases as follows: O 2 > Mn (IV) O 2~N O 3 \u2212 > Fe (III) O 2 > SO 4 2 \u2212 (Froelich et al., 1979) . However, the specific electron acceptor used by microbes to oxidize organic matter during anaerobic respiration, as well as the depth of reduction, varies as a function of the sediment organic matter content, diffusive flux of oxygen, physical heterogeneity in the subsurface from roots, bioturbation by benthic animals, and the supply of possible oxidants (Aller, 1982; Craven et al., 1986; Gaillard et al., 1989; Shaw et al., 1990; Burdige, 1993) . In salt marshes, sulfate reduction is commonly responsible for as much as 90% of the organic matter remineralization, with iron and manganese reduction playing relatively minor roles when compared to sulfate reduction (Gaillard et al., 1989; Burdige, 1993; Carey and Taillefert, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Arsenic and vanadium geochemistry", "text": "Arsenic is a highly toxic element, with increasing toxicity from organic As to inorganic arsenate and inorganic arsenite (B'hymer and Caruso, 2004) . Arsenate is chemically similar to phosphate and therefore is a competitive inhibitor, leading to uptake of arsenate by phytoplankton in P-limited waters (Hellweger et al., 2003; Duan et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2010) . Similarly, although V is essential to biota at low concentrations, at higher concentrations V(V) impedes the functionality of Na + /K + -dependent ATPase, and consequently, can be detrimental to organisms (Cantley and Aisen, 1979) . Arsenic in natural waters exists predominantly in the As(III) and As(V) redox states, occurring as oxyanions, oxythioanions, or in organic compounds such as methylated species and organosugars (Cullen and Reimer, 1989; Webster, 1990; Planer-Friedrich et al., 2007; Helz and Tossell, 2008) . Arsenic in groundwater systems has been studied extensively in conjunction with Fe and Mn cycling owing to the prevalence of As contamination in Holocene deltaic aquifers undergoing reductive dissolution of Fe(III)/Mn(IV)oxides/oxyhydroxides (e.g., Nickson et al., 1998; Fendorf et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2016) . However, in systems with elevated dissolved sulfide, formation of thioarsenates will also influence arsenic cycling (Hollibaugh et al., 2005; Wallschl\u00e4ger and Stadey, 2007; Planer-Friedrich et al., 2008) . Thus, further study of arsenic in sulfidic wetland environments is warranted.\nVanadium is a lithophilic element that predominantly exists in natural waters as oxyanions of V(V) and oxycations of V(IV), although V(III) can exist in extremely reducing environments (Goldschmidt, 1954; Wanty and Goldhaber, 1992 \nO 2 + , which predominates in many reducing waters, is particle reactive and commonly adsorbs to clays and organic matter (McBride, 1979; Breit and Wanty, 1991; Wanty and Goldhaber, 1992) . Vanadium geochemistry has also been explored in terrestrial aquifers (Fiorentino et al., 2007; Wright and Belitz, 2010; Pourret et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2014) as well as in the ocean (Jeandel et al., 1987; Middelburg et al., 1988) , but studies of its cycling in the coastal zone are fewer (Beck et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2010; . The hydrologic and geochemical dynamics of salt marsh systems are known to exert important controls on trace metal cycling in shallow pore waters, which may change diurnally or seasonally and be largely decoupled from deeper pore waters (Beck et al., 2008) . In this contribution, we focus on As and V cycling because of their redox sensitivity, potential role as environmental contaminants, and importance in biological cycles. We use the current understanding of V and As redox-sensitivity and speciation controls to investigate their cycling in a coastal wetland where groundwater predominantly sourced from the Mississippi River mixes with brackish water from Barataria Bay (Kim, 2015) . We examine how As and V concentrations vary within the context of marsh hydrology and predominant redox processes. Although we focus on a marsh in the Mississippi River Delta, the implications of this study shed light on the complexities of trace element cycling in wetlands of other major river delta systems."}, {"section_title": "Study site", "text": "The Myrtle Grove study site is located in the Barataria Basin, an interdistributary basin within the larger Mississippi River Delta that is constrained by the Mississippi River to the east, Bayou Lafourche to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south ( Fig. 1 ; Breaux, 2015; Kim, 2015) . Barataria Basin encompasses a region of about 6300 km 2 (Park, 2002; Inoue et al., 2008) . Myrtle Grove Canal (MG) is a~20 km long north-south oriented canal in the southern portion of Barataria Basin extending from~1 km south of the Mississippi River to the head of Barataria Bay (Fig. 1) . Surface water salinities range from~4 in the northern portion of the canal proximal to the Mississippi River t\u00f5 8 closer to the Bay (Table 1) . With the gradual increase in salinity from north to south along the canal, the vegetation also changes from predominantly Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata at the head of the canal in the brackish marsh to Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus closest to the Bay in the salt marsh (CRMS, 2015; lacoast.gov/ crms) . The sediment throughout the marsh is similar to other brackishsalt marsh systems, consisting of predominantly porous organic matter in the top~50 cm that becomes chiefly sandy or silty loams with depth (Hughes et al., 1998; Breaux, 2015; O'Connor and Moffett, 2015) . The tides at Barataria Pass are diurnal, typical of the Gulf of Mexico, and reach a maximum tidal range of~0.6 m. Flushing times of Barataria Bay are estimated to be 13-19 days (Li et al., 2011) . The greatest water level fluctuations and hydrological exchanges occur during the passages of cold fronts, which occur on a~weekly basis from October to April (Li et al., 2011) .\nBarataria Basin receives freshwater from rainfall, artificial river diversions, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and surface runoff (Das et al., 2010; Bianchi et al., 2011b) . Additionally, groundwater may be supplied to Barataria Basin through buried paleochannels driven by differences in hydraulic head between the Mississippi River and marshes (Kolker et al., 2013; Breaux, 2015; Kim, 2015) .\nLand loss in this part of the delta is substantial owing to a combination of subsidence, sea level rise, dredging, flood control levees, and movement on listric normal faults (Couvillion et al., 2011; Day et al., 2007; Kolker et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2016) . As such, anthropogenic freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River have been constructed to supplement rainfall and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway as freshwater sources to the basin and deliver sediment to the subsiding wetlands ( Fig. 1 ; Das et al., 2010 Das et al., , 2012 master-plan). Consequently, understanding the hydrology and geochemistry of the Myrtle Grove region is critical to predicting the utility and effect of any potential future river diversion in the area. The two sample sites, MG-5 and MG-1, differ in their proximity to the Mississippi River and vegetation type (Fig. 1) . Site MG-5 is located 2.75 km from the Mississippi River (~1.75 km from the head of MG), and the short core taken for pore water extraction (Section 3.3) at this site was collected from a tidal flat that was separated from Myrtle Grove Canal by~50 m of a brackish marsh (salinity~4 ). During the April 2014 sampling the tidal flat was exposed to the atmosphere, whereas during the September 2014 sampling, the tidal flat was flooded with water. As a consequence of the marsh flooding, the short core was collected from an exposed portion of the tidal flat bank. MG-1, which is 15 km from the Mississippi River, is vegetated by Spartina alterniflora, which is indicative of the greater salinity (up to 9 ) of the marsh at this location (Fig. 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hydrological measurements", "text": "We compiled hydrologic data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS), and our own monitoring stations to evaluate the important variables affecting water level and salinity within the marsh (waterdata.usgs.gov; tide- sandcurrents.noaa.gov; lacoast.gov/crms). The CRMS maintains two stations proximal to our study site that record the marsh water level on a daily basis ( Fig. 1 ; CRMS-0276, CRMS-0237). A NOAA tidal station provided hourly tidal level at Grand Isle, a barrier island located at the southern boundary of Barataria Bay (Fig. 1) . The river stage was reported daily from a gauging station at Belle Chasse maintained by the USGS. Additionally, CTD divers were installed in our piezometers (see Section 3.2. below) to record hourly water level and temperature for the period between May 27 and September 24, 2014. A fast Fourier transform function was used in Matlab (vR2015b) to convert these time series data to frequency in order to identify the most dominant periods in the hydrologic data (Menke and Menke, 2012; O'Connor and Moffett, 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Sampling", "text": "Piezometers at sites MG-1 and MG-5 at Myrtle Grove were installed to depths of~3-4 m in the marsh on the eastern edge of the Myrtle Grove Canal in April 2014 after extraction of sediment cores from the same locations (Fig. 1) . Sediment cores were extracted using vibracoring techniques and were processed for grain size analysis and loss on ignition (Breaux, 2015) . Immediately after core withdrawal, the piezometers were emplaced and packed with sand (Quikrete\u00ae All-Purpose Sand). Piezometers were constructed from PVC pipes connected to a PVC Well Point that contained a 0.91 m screened interval. Prior to sample collection, piezometers were developed by pumping to dryness. Hereafter, we will refer to water collected from the piezometers as groundwaters to differentiate between the shallow pore waters extracted from the shallow sediment cores that are described below.\nPiezometer and surface water sampling surveys at Myrtle Grove Canal were conducted during April and September 2014. Sampling equipment, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE) sample bottles and Teflon\u00ae tubing, were rigorously cleaned prior to use following trace-metal clean procedures as described previously (e.g., Johannesson et al., 2004) . Pore waters were pumped from each piezometer using a peristaltic pump with Teflon\u00ae tubing attached to a 0.45-\u03bcm Gelman Sciences (polysulfone ether membrane) in-line filter capsule after rinsing the HDPE sample bottle three times with the filtered sample water. Surface water samples were similarly collected from just below the water surface of the canal proximal to each piezometer.

We did not observe active bioturbation by benthic animals within Myrtle Grove sediments, and although roots are present throughout the marsh, their effect is to increase porosity, which is accounted for in the diffusion equation. Additionally, Kim (2015) used Rn measurements to investigate advection between marsh sediments and canal water, which was deemed to be negligible. Therefore, the advective-dispersive equation simplifies to the diffusion equation. Diffusive fluxes of trace elements from shallow Myrtle Grove pore waters were therefore calculated using Fick's first law of diffusion:\nin which \u03c6 is the porosity, D s is the bulk sedimentary diffusion coefficient (m 2 sec -1 ), and \u2202 C/\u2202z is the concentration gradient, which is approximated by \u0394C/\u0394z (Berner, 1980; Burdige, 2006) (Table 2) .

In contrast, water levels in piezometers MG-1 and MG-5 are only weakly positively related to the tidal fluctuations ( Fig. 2D ; MG-1, R 2 = 0.25, p < 0.005; MG-5, R 2 = 0.11, p < 0.005). The temperature in the deep pore waters increases over the observation period, from May 27 to September, 24, 2014 (Fig. 2E ). Fourier analysis of the pressure head time series data indicates that the predominant period in pore water level is~14 days, or half a lunar cycle. The daily tidal variability (24 h period) is apparent at MG-1, which is closest to Barataria Bay but is substantially muted at MG-5, which is proximal to the river (Fig. 3A, B, C) . The dominant period for the river stage is approximately 1 year (Fig. 3D) .\nFourier analysis indicates that water level variation in the marsh most closely corresponds to tidal cycles, suggesting that water levels in the Myrtle Grove region are largely controlled by tidal forcing (Figs. 2,  3 ). This analysis is consistent with a conceptual groundwater model developed for Pintail Island, located in the Wax Lake Delta~140 km to the west of our study site, where local groundwater responded most closely to tidal level, with the magnitude of the response depending on distance from the shore (O'Connor and Moffett, 2015). We note that although the tides influence the water level variability more strongly than other factors, the absolute level of water in the marsh (i.e., whether or not the marsh is flooded) is more relevant to redox processes affecting trace element concentrations. Kolker et al. (2013) suggested that river stage drives the flow of groundwater to the coastal bays in the lower Mississippi River Delta. At Myrtle Grove Canal, the salinity of the surface waters is less in April than in September, and combined with continuous resistivity profiling, there is evidence to support a riverderived terrestrial groundwater flux at the head of Myrtle Grove Canal, the magnitude of which is greater when river stage is high (Table 1; Breaux, 2015; Kim, 2015) . Additionally, the annual cycle in the height of Canal water inundation over the marsh corresponds with the annual variability of the river stage, exhibiting markedly lower water levels in the late summer ( Fig. 2A, D) . Water levels in this region are also strongly affected by meteorological processes, including cold fronts that occur weekly from October to April, which causes water level fluctuations of about 0.5 m on top of existing tides. The stage of the canal, therefore, will be influenced by a combination of groundwater discharge, wind-driven coastal set-up, and tides."}, {"section_title": "Pore water profiles", "text": "The trace element (i.e., Fe, Mn, As, and V) and dissolved S(\u2212 II) concentrations of the surface waters, shallow pore waters, and deep groundwaters for sites MG-1 and MG-5 are presented in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, along with porosity and loss on ignition (LOI) data from Breaux (2015) . We assume that the surface waters collected from Myrtle Grove Canal are representative of the water flooding the marsh. Again, the shallow pore waters were extracted from the organic-rich, \"spongy\" sediments in the upper marsh, whereas the deeper groundwaters are from the mineral-rich sediments between 3 and 4 m depth below the surface.

More specifically, the shallow pore water dissolved S(\u2212 II) concentrations are 1-3 orders of magnitude greater than in the deeper groundwaters. The pore water S(\u2212 II) profiles from the MG-1 and MG-5 sites display multiple peaks in each core and exhibit seasonal differences (Figs. 4, 5) . For example, in shallow pore waters from the MG-1 site, S(\u2212II) concentrations are close to 2 orders of magnitude higher in April than September (average 256 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 vs. 4.95 \u03bcmol kg ). The total dissolved Fe (passed through < 0.45 \u03bcm pore-size filters) concentrations of the surface waters are < 1 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 for both seasons at both locations (Table 1) . At the MG-1 site near Barataria Bay, the Fe concentrations are much greater in September than in April, ; measured May 2013).

The V concentrations of Myrtle Grove surface waters, shallow pore waters, and deep pore waters all range from 10 to 60 nmol kg \u2212 1 and increase between April and September, except for the V concentration of deep groundwaters at the MG-1 site, which decreases over the summer (Table 1) . The subsurface peak in V concentrations generally corresponds to the depth where the subsurface Fe concentration peak occurs in the shallow pore water profiles at each site (Figs. 4, 5 ). Arsenic concentrations of Myrtle Grove Canal surface waters are, on average, similar to the As concentration we measured in the Mississippi River (14.6 nmol kg ; Shiller and Mao, 1999) .

Vanadium fluxes are listed first assuming all V exists as vanadyl and second assuming vanadate. was flooded in September, the pore water dissolved S(\u2212 II) concentrations are > 10 times higher than in the pore water obtained when the marsh was exposed to the atmosphere, suggesting that in the absence of vegetation, tidal flooding strongly influences the shallow subsurface redox chemistry by limiting the supply of atmospheric oxygen to the shallow pore waters and initiating consumption of other electron acceptors (Miley and Kiene, 2004) . In contrast to the MG-5 site, MG-1 had higher pore water S(\u2212II) concentrations and lower water levels in April 2014 than in September 2014 (Figs. 4, 5 ; Table 1 ). We note that such seasonal differences in pore water S(\u2212II) concentration are contrary to what other studies have reported for seasonal S(\u2212 II) variability based on Spartina alterniflora physiology (e.g., Krairapanond et al., 1992; Sundby et al., 2003) . For example, towards the late summer and early autumn, when the growth of Spartina alterniflora slows, the flow of oxygen to the roots ceases and anaerobic decomposition begins (Sundby et al., 2003) . Additionally, the higher temperatures in September as compared to April (28.1\u00b0C measured at MG-1 in September vs. 22.7\u00b0C in April) are expected to be more favorable for generating higher SO 4 2 \u2212 reduction rates, and hence S (\u2212 II) production (Krairapanond et al., 1992; DeLaune et al., 2002; Miley and Kiene, 2004) . Furthermore, Mohajerin et al. (2016) observed greater sulfide concentrations in August than in April in the upper 5 cm of pore waters collected from marsh sediments in Terrebonne Bay to the southwest of Myrtle Grove (Fig. 1) . Hence, to account for the higher pore water S(\u2212 II) concentrations that were observed at the MG-1 site in April compared to September, we suggest that the seasonal differences in S(\u2212 II) concentrations at MG-1 are likely a result of removal of S(\u2212 II) through mineral precipitation or oxidation (Canfield, 1989; Morford et al., 2005; Beck et al., 2008) . Dissolved S(\u2212II) concentrations are dictated not only by rates of SO 4 2 \u2212 reduction but also by reactive iron in the system because dissolved S(\u2212II) reacts rapidly with Fe(II) to form Fe sulfide minerals (e.g., Rickard, 2006; Burton et al., 2011 \nwhere log K FeS = \u2212 3.5 for mackinawite (Delany and Lundeen, 1990; Rickard, 2006; Burton et al., 2011) . The Fe 2 + concentrations of shallow pore waters at the MG-1 site are > 400 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 in September, and the pH is~6.6. According to Eq. (3), if all the dissolved Fe(II) in shallow pore waters at MG-1 is able to react with dissolved S(\u2212 II), only 0.8 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 S(\u2212 II) should exist in solution. Observed pore water S (\u2212 II) concentrations at MG-1 in September range from < 1 t\u00f5 9 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 , and S(\u2212II) concentrations are lowest where the Fe concentrations are the highest (Fig. 4) . Therefore, excess Fe appears to regulate the partitioning of S(\u2212 II) between dissolved and solid phases in these marsh pore waters. Indeed, geochemical modeling indicates that mackinawite is nearly saturated to over-saturated in pore waters in both April and September at both sites (Fig. 6) . Dissolved Fe concentrations are influenced not only by dissolved S (\u2212 II) but also by vegetation in the shallow subsurface (Kostka and Luther, 1995) . Whereas the pore water Fe concentrations at site MG-5, which lacks vegetation, are less variable over the course of our sampling campaign (0.5-7 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 ), Fe concentrations in the shallow pore waters at site MG-1, which is vegetated, increase by > 100-fold between April and September (Figs. 4, 5 ). Higher Fe concentrations have been observed in pore waters collected from sediments beneath vegetated marsh sites as compared to unvegetated sites during both spring and summer months (Kostka and Luther, 1995) . Iron complexation with dissolved organic compounds is common in coastal waters and acts to increase its overall solubility, both by increasing the stability of Fe(III) in the aqueous phase and by ligand-induced reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) (Luther et al., 1992 (Luther et al., , 1996 ; Steinmann and Shotyk, 1997; Rose and Waite, 2003) . During times of high marsh productivity, Spartina alterniflora produces organic chelates that can react with solid phase Fe(III)-oxides to form Fe(III) organic complexes or reductively dissolve Fe minerals and release dissolved Fe(II), thereby increasing the effective solubility of iron (Luther et al., 1992) . Therefore, as long as organic ligands are produced such that dissolved Fe concentrations are in excess of dissolved sulfide, observed Fe concentrations can still be elevated.\nIn contrast to the shallow pore waters the deep groundwaters have relatively low dissolved S(\u2212 II) concentrations and elevated Fe concentrations (Figs. 4, 5 ). This change with depth reflects the different mineralogy/composition between the shallow and deep sediments. Whereas the shallow sediments have abundant labile organic matter to fuel sulfate reduction, the deeper sediments are more mineral rich, and the low dissolved S(\u2212II) and elevated Fe concentrations suggest that redox conditions are buffered by Fe(III) reduction in the deeper groundwaters."}, {"section_title": "Arsenic cycling", "text": "Arsenic concentrations in shallow pore waters from the MG-1 site are elevated 20 to 60 fold over the As concentrations in the underlying deeper groundwaters, 3-4 m below (Table 1) . We hypothesize that the depth variation in As concentrations is related to Fe and S chemistry, in particular, iron sulfide mineral precipitation and As complexation with dissolved sulfide. Mackinawite is generally the first iron sulfide mineral to precipitate in sulfidic waters, although with time, it is commonly converted to more stable pyrite (e.g., Schoonen and Barnes, 1991a; Schoonen and Barnes, 1991b; Kirk et al., 2010 ). Mackinawite appears to play an important role in As cycling in the shallow sulfidic waters. Specifically, mackinawite precipitation decreases the amount of available dissolved S(\u2212 II) that can react with As(III), thereby inhibiting orpiment and/or realgar precipitation ( Fig. 6 ; O 'Day et al., 2004; Kirk et al., 2010) . Second, As only adsorbs weakly onto mackinawite, which is therefore less capable of sequestering As than pyrite, which sequesters As by co-precipitation (Schoonen and Barnes, 1991a; Wolthers et al., 2005; Kirk et al., 2010; Burton et al., 2013) . Furthermore, mackinawite transformation to pyrite is kinetically slower in the presence of high As and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (Wilkin and Ford, 2006; Wolthers et al., 2007; Kirk et al., 2010) . Using loss on ignition as a proxy for sedimentary organic matter (SOM), the data suggest that SOM likely decreases with depth at both MG-1 and MG-5 sites (Figs. 4, 5) . The greater As and putative SOM concentrations at the top of the core therefore suggests a positive feedback mechanism whereby formation of pyrite may be slower in the shallow subsurface. At depth, indicative of greater time for Fe-S minerals to form pyrite, As concentrations concurrently decrease (Figs. 4, 5) . This suggests that, in addition to diffusion out of the shallow pore waters, As may be lost from solution owing to coprecipitation with pyrite at depth. More work is clearly needed to quantify pyritization rates and to understand As in solid phases at Myrtle Grove.\nDissolved S(\u2212II) in Myrtle Grove pore waters can also react with As species in solution, forming thioarsenate and possible thioarsenite species (Rochette et al., 2000; Planer-Friedrich et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2013) . Formation of thioarsenate species appears to increase the mobility of As in solution, and even in low sulfide waters (< 10 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 ), thioarsenate species can account for a substantial portion of total aqueous As ( Van der Weijden et al., 1990; O'Day et al., 2004; Bostick et al., 2005; Stauder et al., 2005; Helz and Tossell, 2008; Kirk et al., 2010; Burton et al., 2013; Couture et al., 2013) . In April, the pore waters at MG-1 exhibited high dissolved S(\u2212II) concentrations (i.e., S(\u2212 II) = 85-457 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 ), and geochemical modeling indicates thioarsenate and thioarsenite species may have been present in these pore waters (Fig. 7) . Conversely, for the lower sulfide concentrations measured in September pore waters from MG-1 (i.e., S(\u2212II) < 10 \u03bcmol kg \u2212 1 ), the arsenite oxyanion is predicted to be the dominant As(III) species, although any As(V) should have occurred as thioarse-nate species (Fig. 7) . Consequently, we suggest that the statistically significant higher As concentrations measured in MG-1 shallow pore waters in April (220 \u00b1 71.7 nmol kg \u2212 1 ) compared to September (152 \u00b1 42.8 nmol kg\n) reflect, in part, the difference in predicted aqueous speciation of As and the potentially greater preference of thioarsenate species for the aqueous phase as compared to arsenate (ttest, p < 0.05; Table 1 ).\nFinally, it is important to note that As is positively correlated with Mn in pore waters from both cores and that the relationship is significant for pore waters collected in September from both cores (MG-1 September R 2 = 0.54, p = 0.06; MG-5 September R 2 = 0.94, p = 0.0001). Dissolved arsenic concentrations in natural waters are commonly associated with dissolved Fe concentrations (Sullivan and Aller, 1996; Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Chaillou et al., 2003) . Yet, in this system, the Mn concentrations of the pore waters are generally comparable to those of Fe. Therefore, in the shallow sediments at Myrtle Grove, As may be adsorbed to Mn mineral surfaces during times of oxygen penetration into the shallow subsurface. When conditions change to sulfidic anoxic, reductive dissolution of Mn oxides will occur, releasing As into solution, which may then form aqueous thioarsenate and/or thioarsenite complexes (Fig. 8) . . Predicted mineral saturation states for Fe-and As-sulfide species in the surface waters, shallow pore waters, and deep pore waters. Because SO 4 2 \u2212 measurements are necessary to calculate pyrite and greigite saturation, no pyrite or greigite saturation indices are available for the shallow pore waters. The saturation indices were calculated using Geochemist's Workbench\u00ae (Bethke, 2008) , which employs the B-dot model to calculate activity coefficients for dissolved ions (Helgeson, 1969) . The B-dot model is an extension of the Debye-Huckel theory, and is valid for predicting activity coefficients of ions in solutions of ionic strengths up to 1 m (Zhu and Anderson, 2002; Bethke, 2008 "}, {"section_title": "Vanadium cycling", "text": "Under iron-and sulfate-reducing conditions, such as those observed in Myrtle Grove shallow pore waters and deeper groundwaters, V should exist as a V(IV) or potentially V(III) species (Wehrli and Stumm, 1989; Wright and Belitz, 2010) . These redox states are generally less soluble compared to V(V), the predominant redox state in oxidized surface waters (Wanty and Goldhaber, 1992; Wright et al., 2014) . Nonetheless, V concentrations do not vary systematically with depth at Myrtle Grove (Figs. 4, 5 ). In the shallow pore waters, the V peak corresponds closely with that of Fe, and V and Fe are significantly correlated, suggesting that similar geochemical processes control their aqueous concentrations (R 2 = 0.50; p < 0.005). Given the high organic matter content of the shallow sediments (> 80%), it is likely that dissolved organic matter complexes with aqueous V, thereby increasing its solubility in a manner similar to that of Fe (Beck et al., 2008; Pourret et al., 2012) . Even in groundwaters with low dissolved organic carbon, V solubility may be enhanced through complexation with DOC . A comparison of Fe and V in the deeper groundwaters, however, reveals that, although the V trend generally follows that of Fe, the magnitude is much less. More specifically, the Fe concentrations of the deep groundwater are up to 30 times greater than in the average pore water concentrations, whereas the increase in V is much less (up to 2.7 times). Therefore, although Fe and V behave very similarly in the shallow subsurface, their concentrations are decoupled at depth. The disconnect between Fe and V behavior at depth may reflect their different reactivities to sulfur. Elevated Fe concentrations at depth are indicative of Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide reduction to more soluble Fe (II), and without elevated S(\u2212II) concentrations, Fe mobility will increase (e.g., Luther et al., 1992) . Because V does not positively covary with Fe in deep pore waters (~3-4 m), V may not be initially adsorbed/desorbed to Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides at depth (e.g., Hem, 1977; Peacock and Sherman, 2004) . Alternatively, V may initially adsorb to Fe/Mn oxides/hydroxides and upon reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides, V may be released to solution and subse- Fig. 7 .

In addition to Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides, V may adsorb to humics or more weakly to clays (McBride, 1978; McBride, 1979; Wanty and Goldhaber, 1992) . Whereas the surficial sediments have abundant labile organic matter, the deeper sediments likely contain more recalcitrant organic matter less susceptible to degradation. Therefore, V may be associated with the solid phase organic matter at depth as opposed to forming the dissolved organic complexes in the shallow pore waters."}, {"section_title": "Diffusive pore water fluxes of trace elements", "text": "Positive fluxes of Mn, Fe, and As suggest that the coastal marsh pore waters act as a source of these trace elements to the coastal bay waters (Table 3) . These results are consistent with observations that positive diffusive fluxes of Fe, Mn, and As from sediments occur under reducing conditions, and the fluxes are similar to those at other sites (Table 4; Li et al., 2014) . Of the elements studied in Myrtle Grove marsh pore waters, Fe concentrations vary the most through time and space, reflecting the coupling of Fe and S cycling and the dependence of aqueous Fe concentrations on iron sulfide mineral precipitation. Although V concentrations of pore waters from Myrtle Grove appear to be coupled to Fe cycling, diffusive fluxes of V are directed into the sediments. The negative V fluxes represent the greater V concentrations in Myrtle Grove surface waters compared to pore water concentrations (Tables 1, 3) . The fluxes reported here represent maximum estimates because we have calculated the diffusive flux of solutes. The real magnitudes are dependent upon the frequency with which the marsh is flooded and subsequently flushed (Santos-Echeand\u00eda et al., 2010) . The enriched water must be flushed from the marsh before reprecipitation of iron oxides or iron sulfides occurs. A portion of the diffusive flux may therefore be recirculated at the sediment-water interface (Chaillou et al., 2003) . From the time series analysis of the hydrologic variables, it is likely that the marsh is flooded more frequently during the spring, which would suggest that diffusive fluxes are more relevant during this time.\nTo consider the significance of these trace element (i.e., As, V) diffusive fluxes from the sediments to the overlying water column within Barataria Bay, a comparison with estimated reservoir fluxes is useful. Previous work separated hydrologic fluxes into (Q in ) and out of (Q out ) Barataria Bay, and the pertinent values are summarized in Table 5 (Kolker et al., 2013) . If we assume that the concentrations of As and V in the water column of Barataria Bay can be considered to represent a balance between the fluxes of both trace elements transported into the bay from the Gulf of Mexico (i.e., the tidal prism), surface water runoff, submarine groundwater discharge, input from the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion, meteoric precipitation over the marsh, and diffusive fluxes, and assuming the Bay is under steady-state conditions, then, TM] rain is the trace metal concentration of the rain, which is considered negligible given the low concentration in rain and orders of magnitude lower flux of rain compared to the other fluxes, and Q SGD is the flux of submarine groundwater discharge to Barataria Bay (Kolker et al., 2013) . Q out represents the flux exiting the bay on the ebb tide and is determined from a salinity balance, such that \nin which Q in is the flux from the tidal prism and the salinities of the flood and ebb tides are 25 and 15, respectively (Kolker et al., 2013) . The Q out flux is therefore 3.83 \u00d7 10 8 m 3 day \u2212 1\n.The diffusive flux considers the maximum and minimum flux estimates for the trace metals. The diffusive fluxes of As and V from Table 3 are multiplied by the area of the bay to yield a range of 3.3 \u00d7 10 10 to 2.7 \u00d7 10 11 nmol day \u2212 1 directed out of the sediments for As and a range of 4.7 \u00d7 10 10 nmol day \u2212 1 directed into the sediments to 2.7 \u00d7 10 10 nmol day \u2212 1 directed out of the sediments for V. Eq. (4) can therefore be solved for the As and V concentrations in Barataria Bay, which are computed to range from 1.48 \u00d7 10 4 to 1.53 \u00d7 10 4 nmol m \u2212 3 for As and 3.29 \u00d7 10 4 to 3.31 \u00d7 10 4 nmol m \u2212 3\nfor V. The range is determined by computing the sum with and without the DPFD and accounting for both the minimum and maximum estimates of the diffusive fluxes. The computed V concentration range for Barataria Bay is less than the concentration of the Gulf and greater than the concentration in Myrtle Grove Canal, which is consistent with the results of the diffusive fluxes that suggest that the marsh at Myrtle Grove serves as a sink for V. The As concentration of seawater and of Myrtle Grove Canal are very similar, and the estimated As concentration range of Barataria Bay is within the range of these two reservoirs.\nBecause the uncertainty of this estimate is likely greater than the variation between the As concentrations of the reservoirs, it is difficult to conclude whether the diffusive fluxes contribute substantially to either. However, the upper end of the estimated As concentration for Barataria Bay is slightly greater than either reservoir, which is consistent with a diffusive input from the sediments."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "\u2022 River stage and subsequent groundwater discharge at the head of Myrtle Grove drives long-term (annual) variation in water level, whereas tidal variation appears to be the strongest hydrologic force affecting Myrtle Grove pore waters on shorter time scales.
