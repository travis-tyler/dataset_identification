[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The serotonin transporter length polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) short allele (5-HTTLPR-s) has been associated with differential susceptibility for anxiety and depression in multiple psychiatric disorders. 5-HTTLPR-s modifies the serotonergic systems that support emotion and behavioral regulation by reducing gene expression, which slows the reuptake of serotonin, and is associated with distinct morphological and functional effects. Serotonergic systems are also shown to be dysfunctional in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disease characterized by marked socioemotional dysfunction. However, studies of 5-HTTLPR-s effects in bvFTD have been inconsistent. Our objective was to investigate the patterns of gray matter volume by 5-HTTLPR-s genotype in both healthy older controls and bvFTD patients. We performed voxel-based morphometry of 179 cognitively normal older adults and 24 bvFTD cases to determine brain changes associated with dose (0/1/2) of 5-HTTLPR-s allele. 5-HTTLPR-s frequency did not differ between controls and bvFTD. We found a significant interaction effect whereby carrying more 5-HTTLPR-s alleles in bvFTD was associated with smaller volume in left inferior frontal gyrus (T = 4.86, P FWE = 0.03) and larger volume in right temporal lobe (T = 5.01, P FWE = 0.01). These results suggest that the 5-HTTLPR-s allele differentially influences brain morphology in bvFTD. We propose that patients with bvFTD and 5-HTTLPR-s have altered volumes in regions that support socioemotional behavior, which may be a developmental or disease-related compensation for altered serotonergic activity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. bvFTD is characterized by marked socioemotional dysfunction and progressive changes in behavior and personality, including disinhibition, social inappropriateness, empathy deficits, and reckless or impulsive actions (Rascovsky et al., 2007) . There are both genetic and sporadic forms of bvFTD, and up to 40% of individuals have a family history of dementia or other related neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorder (Rohrer et al., 2009; Woolley et al., 2011) . Patients with bvFTD often receive early misdiagnoses of psychiatric disorders such as depression or bipolar given behavioral symptoms such as apathy, irritability, compulsions, euphoria and dietary changes (Woolley et al., 2011) . Since a clinical hallmark of bvFTD is change in emotion, it is possible that genetic variation that modifies the development or function of the neuroanatomical substrates of emotion could also impact disease processes. The effect of neuromodulatory genetic variation on neurodegenerative processes can inform our understanding of biological mechanisms of disease and highlight potential therapeutic targets.\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) was originally identified in 1948 as the brain substance that caused peripheral vasoconstriction (Rapport et al., 1948 ) and has since been described for its diverse roles as a neurotransmitter, affecting a broad range of behaviors including food intake, sensory processing, motor activity, cognition and emotion (reviewed in Canli and Lesch, 2007) . Serotonin has been studied widely as a modulator of emotional reactivity, particularly in the context of anxiety, aggression and impulse control where regulating behavior by tuning brain reactivity to negative stimuli is critical for NeuroImage: Clinical 9 (2015) [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] maintaining a balance between adaptive and maladaptive reactions. It is mainly synthesized in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the midbrain. Serotonergic neurons project throughout cortical and subcortical regions, and prominent terminals include the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum (Lucki, 1998) .\nThe serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) is responsible for recycling serotonin from the synaptic cleft to the presynaptic neuron, terminating its effects and enabling its reuse (Murphy et al., 2004) . A length polymorphism in its gene promoter (5-HTTLPR) results in differing levels of transporter expression. The 'long' allele is more common, and the 'short' allele (5-HTTLPR-s) is associated with reduced gene and protein expression. This results in less efficient transporter function: serotonin remains in the synapse longer and is recycled more slowly, resulting in a net reduction in circulating serotonin (Heils et al., 1996) . It has been proposed that this net reduction in circulating serotonin has important downstream effects in the circuitry between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and dorsal raphe (Jasinska et al., 2012) .\nThe 5-HTTLPR-s allele is widely studied and has been associated with risk for multiple psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression (Caspi et al., 2010; Gallinat et al., 2008; Homberg and Lesch, 2011) , an effect that may be stronger in the context of a negative life event (Caspi et al., 2003) . It has been suggested that 5-HTTLPR-s may exert its risk effects by impacting brain morphology (Gallinat et al., 2008; Jedema et al., 2010) , and that heightened neural activity in individuals with lower circulating serotonin levels may both increase emotional reactivity (Dannlowski et al., 2010; Homberg and Lesch, 2011) and improve cognition (Homberg and Lesch, 2011) . In addition to associations with increased negative emotion (Gyurak et al., 2013) , 5-HTTLPR-s has also been associated with increased positive emotion (Gyurak et al., 2013; Haase et al., 2015) . These findings are consistent with the idea that this functional polymorphism results in overall increased levels of reactivity regardless of emotional valence. In the healthy brain, 5-HTTLPR-s has been associated with reduced volume in the middle frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus, anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala in healthy subjects (Gallinat et al., 2008) . bvFTD is associated with degeneration of these and other paralimbic structures, as well as serotonergic neuron loss. However, studies of 5-HTTLPR-s association with FTD risk have been inconsistent (Albani et al., 2008; Borroni et al., 2010; Lorenzi et al., 2010) .\nGiven that it reduces circulating serotonin levels and is associated with volume loss in frontal and limbic brain regions, 5-HTTLPR-s could be a risk factor for bvFTD, at least in the sense that it might exacerbate symptoms or progression. Conversely, since 5-HTTLPR-s is associated with heightened emotional reactivity, it may bolster the otherwise blunted emotional responsiveness in patients with bvFTD. In this study we sought to characterize the effects of 5-HTTLPR-s on neurodegeneration in bvFTD by addressing two questions: 1) Is 5-HTTLPR-s associated with similar or different patterns of gray matter volume in healthy older controls and patients with bvFTD? 2) Do these genotype-associated brain regions relate to neuropsychiatric symptomatology?"}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Two hundred three participants (179 healthy controls and 24 individuals with bvFTD) participated in the present study.

The control cohort3s ages ranged from 49 to 87 years (mean 68.5 years). The patient cohort ranged from 29 to 83 years of age (mean 60.6 years). There were two individuals, aged 29 and 34, who were included in the bvFTD cohort. Both were pathologically diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with FUS pathology and were negative for FUS mutations. The next youngest individual after these two was 47 years old. In order to test whether the inclusion of these two younger individuals influenced our main and/or secondary findings, all analyses were performed with the two youngest individuals removed. We found that our findings were consistent irrespective of the inclusion or exclusion of these two individuals and therefore chose to report findings from the larger cohort in order to maximize the patient sample size.\nThere were no significant differences in age, education, or sex between 5-HTTLPR-s dosage groups, though scanner type did differ across genotypes (P = 0.02; Table 1 ).

In a subset of the cohort, the volume of these regions correlated with less severe behavioral symptoms including apathy, hyperactivity/disinhibition, affect and psychosis. Genotype-specific differences in baseline brain volume may underlie this effect.\nThe amygdala is located in MTL and is well characterized as redirecting attention towards personally salient cues, triggering quick enactment of physiological and behavioral changes in response to emotional material (Adolphs, 2008) and modulating the encoding of emotional memories (Davis and Whalen, 2001; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005) . The IFG is involved in cognitive control of emotional information (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Ochsner et al., 2002) , acting upon amygdala to moderate behavioral response during cognitive reappraisal of emotion information (Wager et al., 2008) .\nAlthough traditionally studied as risk variant for psychiatric disease, there may be some benefits to carrying the 5-HTTLPR-s allele. Specifically, carriers of this allele are generally considered more sensitive to their environment -both emotionally (Beevers et al., 2010) and physiologically (Papousek et al., 2013) . Although heightened sensitivity to both self and others can be detrimental in the context of negative life experiences (Caspi et al., 2003) or other significant stressors (Belsky et al., 2009) , it can also be beneficial for prosocial situations that require attention to emotional cues (Bakermans-Kranenburg and van Ijzendoorn, 2008; Cents et al., 2014; Mileva-Seitz et al., 2011) . Increased selfmonitoring can also improve cognitive functioning (Homberg and Lesch, 2011) . Because of this, some argue that the gene should not be considered a \"risk\" gene, but rather a \"plasticity\" gene, which makes an individual3s behavior more modifiable in response to environmental factors (van IJzendoorn et al., 2012) . Jasinska and colleagues proposed that this sensitivity stems from the short allele3s influence on the dynamics of serotonergic activity in the brain (Jasinska et al., 2012) .\nGiven this framework, there are two distinct hypotheses that could explain the mechanism by which 5-HTTLPR genotypes affect brain atrophy in bvFTD. The first is that altered levels and function of 5-HTT modify the way the brain atrophies in bvFTD, such that after disease onset there arises differential patterns of degeneration based on the ability of serotonergic transmission to adapt to pathological processes occurring in the brain. The second is that 5-HTTLPR genotype may alter neurodevelopment, such that the brain is structured differently and thus functions in an altered state throughout life and is primed to respond to both environmental and pathological stresses in different ways. The latter developmental theory has been proposed previously (Hariri et al., 2006; Jonassen and Landr\u00f8, 2014) , and puts forth a model by which genetic differences in corticolimbic reactivity predispose individuals to affective illnesses such as depression and anxiety in the context of stressful events (Hariri et al., 2006) . Because of the critical roles serotonin plays in regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity, it would make sense that life-long differences in 5-HTT efficiency could result in differential neural circuitry that responds to stimuli and injury with varying capacity. The latter neurodevelopmental model is supported by literature in the rhesus macaque -which carries a functional ortholog of the 5- Summary of regression analyses by region of interest.

Adjusted volume plotted by CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) in bvFTD patients by dose of 5-HTTLPR-s allele. In R MTL, baseline is higher with more alleles (significant difference in intercepts but not slopes, P = 0.03). In L IFG, baseline is lower with more risk alleles (P = 0.0002).\nHTTLPR-s variant -that suggests the polymorphism exerts a developmental effect on cortical structures, rather than causing a specific difference in serotonergic signaling (Jedema et al., 2010) . Mice lacking 5-HTT also support this model, demonstrating altered neuronal architecture and cortical function that results in lasting emotional abnormalities (Hariri et al., 2006) . In the context of bvFTD, we venture to speculate that neurodevelopmental differences due to 5-HTTLPR-s extend beyond an individual3s response to the external environment to the internal, physiological environment. Perhaps, the same mechanistic processes underlying genotype-specific susceptibility to environmental impacts is also applicable in neurodegenerative disease. Individuals carrying the 'sensitivity' allele could be uniquely resilient or vulnerable to neurodegenerative processes in different areas of the brain, thereby promoting an adaptive preservation of emotional experience despite pathological changes in corticolimbic brain regions. Conceptually, this framework which links 5-HTTLPR-s to neurodegeneration in bvFTD may also apply to behavior as previously posited by the theory of \"behavioral reserve\" (Premi et al., 2013) . 5-HTTLPR-s status could potentially confer unique resilience to behavioral deficits in bvFTD and represent a route towards future therapeutic interventions. The laterality of the bvFTD \u00d7 5-HTTLPR-s dose interaction effects, with greater volume in R MTL and lower volume in L IFG, are intriguing in the context of emotion generation and regulation, respectively, since bvFTD is characterized by deficits in both. Greater atrophy of R MTL has been associated with more disinhibition -a component of the hyperactivity syndrome scale -in bvFTD (Rosen et al., 2005; Zamboni et al., 2008) . The L IFG has been identified previously as a regulator in the reappraisal of positive emotions (Grecucci et al., 2013; Sturm et al., 2015) . Our VBM results propose reduced capacity to regulate emotion in the left hemisphere and greater capacity to generate emotion in the right hemisphere in 5-HTTLPR-s carriers with bvFTD. Although more emotion generation and less emotion regulation could contribute to disinhibition, it could also be advantageous in the context of bvFTD where patients progressively lose emotional responsiveness. Smaller volume in these regions was also associated with higher apathy in bvFTD, however, which suggests that this pattern of brain atrophy may relate to affective symptom severity and disease progression in bvFTD more broadly.\nThis study3s findings are strengthened by its use of a clinically wellcharacterized cohort and multiple information modalities to study the effects of 5-HTTLPR-s in bvFTD. Limitations of the present study include its use of MR images from multiple scanners, age difference between the control and bvFTD groups, limited size of the overall cohort, and limited neuropsychiatric syndrome data. To minimize the impact of using MR images from different scanners, we included scan-type as a covariate in all analyses. Other groups have found that combining scans from multiple scanners can provide robust results (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2007; Stonnington et al., 2008) . Similarly, we included age as a covariate in all analyses to control for age differences between healthy controls and bvFTD. Likewise, we only included the 29 and 34 year-old individuals in the bvFTD cohort after obtaining pathological confirmation of each individual3s clinical diagnosis. Although we strove to maximize the number of individuals in our study, we were unable to detect morphological differences by genotype that survived permutation testing at a threshold of P FWE b 0.05 within the control and bvFTD groups separately, limiting our ability to further dissect the genotype-disease interaction. Others have identified differences by 5-HTTLPR-s, primarily in younger healthy adults (Jonassen and Landr\u00f8, 2014) ; it is possible that aging minimizes these differences due to normal cortical thinning, making them difficult to detect in whole brain analysis in elderly populations. Although plotting individuals by disease severity is an imperfect proxy for identifying genotype-specific changes in atrophy over time, our data suggest that 5-HTTLPR-s dose alters baseline volume in L IFG and R MTL. Studies of longitudinal change in bvFTD patients are required to confirm this observation directly."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, our study suggests that variation in the serotonin transporter modifies atrophy of brain regions critical for emotion regulation and generation in patients with bvFTD. This study provides unique insight into the genetic modifiers of a devastating neurodegenerative disease and extends associations between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric disease to a degenerative condition characterized by emotional dysfunction. To better understand the effects of 5-HTTLPR-s in bvFTD, future studies will need to replicate this finding in an independent, larger, cohort. Additionally, longitudinal analyses may clarify whether the effects of 5-HTTPLR-s reflect baseline differences in volume rather than differences in serotonergic signaling. Taken together, these results support the notion that 5-HTTLPR genotype modifies the brain3s response to neurodegenerative insult and promotes increased emotionality.\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found online at http://doi.dx.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2015.07.017.
