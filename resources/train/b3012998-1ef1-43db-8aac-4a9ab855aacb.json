Brain atrophy associated with normal aging may affect tES current delivery to the brain. Computational models have been employed to compute predicted tES current inside the brain. This study is the largest study that uses computational models to investigate tES field distribution in healthy older adults.\nMethods: Individualized head models from 587 healthy older adults (mean=73.9years, 51-95 years) were constructed to create field maps. Two electrode montages (F3-F4, M1-SO) with 2mA input current were modeled using ROAST with modified codes. A customized template of healthy older adults, the UFAB-587, was created from the same dataset and used to warp individual brains into the same space. Warped models were analyzed to determine the relationship between computed field measures, brain atrophy and age.\nMain results: Computed field measures were inversely correlated with brain atrophy (R 2 =0.0829, p=1.14e-12). Field pattern showed negative correlation with age in brain sub-regions including part of DLPFC and precentral gyrus. Mediation analysis revealed that the negative correlation between age and current density is partially mediated by brain-to-CSF ratio.\nComputed field measures showed decreasing amount of tES current reaching the brain with increasing atrophy.

These efforts include exploring intervention strategies targeting brain function to maintain independent living in the aging population. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has emerged as an attractive treatment to remediate age-related decline in cognitive and motor functions [1] [2] [3] . Conventional tES delivers mild electrical current (typically 1-2mA) via a pair of large electrodes (e.g., ~35cm 2 area) placed on scalp at locations based on desired target brain regions. Prior research shows that while tES has potential for impacting motor and cognitive functions in older adults [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , individual responses to tES application vary significantly. This variability can depend, in part, on different amounts of current reaching the brain across participants due to inter-individual anatomical differences despite using the same standardized electrode montage. Further, direct measurements of electrical current in-vivo is difficult and thus pose a challenge to quantify current dose in the brain for optimizing stimulation effects. Therefore, finite element modeling (FEM) based computational studies have been employed to predict electrical current distribution in the human head during stimulation [9] [10] [11] [12] . Individual head models are typically converted from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images following a standard modeling workflow [13] . Prior research shows that variation in brain anatomy e.g., gyrus morphology have considerable effects on modeled field measures in the brain, and thus warrant the need for individualized head models [12, 14, 15] .\nInitial modeling validation studies suggest that predicted field measures and reconstructed in-vivo tissue conductivity values computed using FEM are comparable to empirical values [16] [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, FEM continues to be considered as an acceptable tool to indirectly measure electric current distribution in the brain during tES.\nPrior research studies suggest that computed field measures in the brain change with increasing age, and these changes are associated with structural changes in the brain (i.e., brain atrophy). Laakso et al. [20] conducted tES FEM studies in 24 adult males (mean age=38.63, range =21-55 years) using 1mA C3-Fp2 (M1-SO) montage and reported a significant negative effect of age on peak electric field due to the positive correlation between age and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, as a measure of brain atrophy.\nMahdavi et al. [21] reported decreased field measures in the brain with increasing brain atrophy in three head models (young-healthy, elder-healthy, elder-MCI) and increasing field measures in CSF from the younger to elder, both in healthy and MCI group [21] . Thomas et al. [22] computed field measures in five head models representing five decades of life (ages=42, 54, 66, 75, and 85), using conventional and highdefinition electrode montages located in F3-F4 and M1-SO. They found a decreasing peak field strength from 42 to 75 years old and an increasing trend from 75-85 years old in target gyri. While previous studies observed similar trends of decreasing magnitudes in both electric field and current density with increasing age, these studies were performed in small cohorts (mean n=10.7+11.6 subjects). Therefore, computational models in a larger cohort of older adults are needed to provide a more comprehensive insight on whether age-related effects e.g., brain atrophy can alter the amount of current delivered to the brain.\nIn this paper, we present the largest tES FEM study in 587 older adults with ages ranging from 51 to 95 years old. Stimulation of 2mA using two conventional electrode montages was modeled to evaluate age effects on modeled field measures. Computed current density and electric field strength were assessed in brain regions only (gray and white matter). Brain atrophy was quantified as brain ratio which was the ratio of the individual brain volumes relative to their intracranial volumes. We hypothesize that predicted field measures are indicative of the structural changes of the aging brain, which can be useful for current dose determination in future tES studies involving aging populations."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "T1-weighted images of 587 older adults (age range=51-95 years; mean age=73.9 years, 325 females, 262 males) sourced from a variety of study were converted into individual models. 300 participants were sourced from the Center for Cognitive Aging and Memory (CAM) database at the University of Florida, where 161 participants were screened using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS-III) and 139 participants were screened using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for cognitively healthy.

The UFAB-587 produces a better representation of older adult brain morphology (such as enlarged lateral ventricles and larger gaps between gyri curvature) than the ICBM-152 template sourced from young adults and, in turn, produced a more accurate correlation of field measures versus age. Voxel-wise analysis performed using the ICBM-152 template without restricting current values in the brain only yielded an opposite trend (Appendix C), with an increase in current strength with age. The opposing trend was likely caused by incorrect tissue assignments (CSF erroneously included in regions that appear as brain in young adults), underlining the importance in excluding field measures outside of gray and white matter prior to group analyses. This partial volume and boundary tissue effect is further exacerbated when considering that CSF conductivity is high in comparison to gray/white matter conductivity (see Table 3 ). Therefore, CSF contamination artificially inflated field measures in presumed gray/white matter structures and CSF regions were excluded in group-level analysis post-registration to the UFAB-587 template. We also performed another voxel-wise analysis using a more restricted analysis mask based on the UFAB-587 template (Appendix D) to further eliminate possible CSF contamination. Further, since the rate of brain atrophy might vary across gender [39] , we performed voxel-wise analysis by adding gender as a predictor (Appendix B). We found the location of significant clusters remain within the same regions as the default mask when applying a more restricted mask and including gender as a predictor, and thus deeming the voxel-wise analyses results reported in Figure 8-9 and Table 4 -7 as valid."}, {"section_title": "Model implication on tES application in older adults", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field measure and age", "text": "Correlations between age and field measure exist locally in brain sub-regions rather than globally.\nWe found no correlation between age and median current density computed in the whole brain ( Figure   7A ). However, voxel-wise analyses (Figure 8 ) produced positive or negative correlation between age and median J in specific brain sub-regions. This finding implies that significant changes of current dose in the brain does not happen globally, but rather in more localized regions within the brain. For example, qualitative analyses from heatmaps showed that J decreased in the temporal/insula boundary and the precuneus region from the youngest to oldest group. This decrease was confirmed in voxel-wise analyses showing a significant negative relationship (FDR p<0.05) between age and J in Cluster B(R 2 F3-F4 =0.074,\n.083) and E(R 2 F3-F4 =0.077, R 2 C3-Fp2 =0.096). Therefore, a subregion analysis may be required to assess the subtle changes of varying current dose in the aging brain.\nVoxel-wise analyses indicated that the sub-brain regions with significant negative correlation of field measures and age might reflect the location of brain atrophy. Figure 6 shows a decrease in field strength in the frontal lobe for both electrode placements. This observation was further supported by voxel-wise analysis as reported in Figure 8 that illustrates the location of clusters with significant relationship between age and median J. The location of significant clusters might be indicative of the brain regions that experience the most atrophy across age. For example, Cluster D with the largest effect size (R 2 F3-F4 =0.118, R 2 C3-Fp2 =0.111) located in the frontal region (Figure 9 ), which has been reported as the most prone region to decline with normal aging [21, 40, 41] . Further, the positive relationship with brain ratio and current density (Figure 4) implied that there was less current reaching the brain tissues with more atrophy. This observation agrees with previous modeling studies that were performed using various conductivity values assigned to WM and GM, and concluded the critical role of CSF volume in current delivery to the aging brain due to atrophy [20] [21] [22] . Brain tissue loss due to atrophy is replaced by CSF, causing an increase of CSF content within the brain cavity. CSF is a better conductor than brain tissue and thus the electrical current reaching the brain cavity is \"shunted\" around the CSF, causing less current to enter the brain."}, {"section_title": "Field measure and electrode montage", "text": "Adjusting current dose in the aging brain might be necessary to ensure sufficient amount of current reaching target brain regions. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the precentral gyrus are commonly presumed target ROIs for stimulation using F3-F4 and M1-SO (C3-Fp2) montage, respectively [1] . We found a non-significant relationship between age and median J (Appendix F) when using predetermined ROIs restricted to the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus, probably because the presumed target ROIs were too broad and brain atrophy occurs non-uniformly within these ROIs. Our voxel-wise analyses were able to identify location where age had the most effect e.g., brain atrophy on Js in both montages (Appendix B). For instance, we found a significant negative relationship (FDR p<0.05)\nin Cluster D (R 2 F3-F4 =0.118, R 2 C3-Fp2 =0.111 that is partially within the superior frontal gyrus, which encompasses DLPFC, a target brain region for F3-F4 montage. Furthermore, Cluster E (R 2 F3-F4 =0.077, R 2 C3-Fp2 =0.096) is located in the precentral/postcentral gyrus boundary where the motor strip lies and thus a typical target ROI for M1-SO (C3-Fp2) montage.

For a mediation analysis to be valid, a correlation of brain ratio versus age, brain ratio versus J, and age versus J need to exist. Brain ratio showed a declining trend with increasing age (R 2 =0.1162, p=1.17e-17) indicating that brain atrophy increased with normal aging ( Figure 4A ) and was primarily driven by GM volume loss ( Figure 4B, C) , which agrees with observations reported in the literature [42] [43] [44] . Since the interaction between age, brain ratio and current density might be difficult to disentangle, we performed a mediation analysis by testing GM, WM, and CSF volume ratio separately as mediator variables. The partial mediation effect of brain ratio on age versus J implies that the negative correlation of age and J is partially contributed by brain ratio.

The larger range of current dose needed for F3-F4 in Figure 7B implies that the frontal region (target region for F3-F4) is more prone to decline compared to the motor strip (target region for C3-Fp2), which agrees with the literature [41] . The color distribution in Figure 7B also illustrates that individuals with more atrophy (smaller bran ratio) are likely to require more current compared to those with less atrophy (larger brain ratio).
