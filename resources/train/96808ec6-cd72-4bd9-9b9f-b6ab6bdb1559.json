[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generates contrasts with primary sensitivity to local T1 properties (with lesser T2 and PD contributions). The observed signal intensity is determined by these local properties and the sequence parameters of the acquisition. In common practice, a range of acceptable parameters is used to ensure \"similar\" contrast across scanners used for any particular study (e.g., the ADNI standard MPRAGE). However, different studies may use different ranges of parameters and report the derived data as simply \"T1-weighted\". Physics and imaging authors pay strong heed to the specifics of the imaging sequences, but image processing authors have historically been more lax. Herein, we consider three T1-weighted sequences acquired the same underlying protocol (MPRAGE) and vendor (Philips), but \"normal study-to-study variation\" in parameters. We show that the gray matter/white matter/cerebrospinal fluid contrast is subtly but systemically different between these images and yields systemically different measurements of brain volume. The problem derives from the visually apparent boundary shifts, which would also be seen by a human rater. We present and evaluate two solutions to produce consistent segmentation results across imaging protocols. First, we propose to acquire multiple sequences on a subset of the data and use the multi-modal imaging as atlases to segment target images any of the available sequences. Second (if additional imaging is not available), we propose to synthesize atlases of the target imaging sequence and use the synthesized atlases in place of atlas imaging data. Both approaches significantly improve consistency of target labeling."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "T1-weighted MRI derives contrast from the local T1, T2, and Proton Density (PD) of the imaging subject. The signal intensity is then read out as a function of those tissue characteristics and the sequence definition. In some cases, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), very strict sequence definitions are available to insure data consistency [1] . On the other hand, many studies consider cross-site, scanner, or sequence analyses but do not necessarily consider the effect those changes may have on the imaging [2] . Further, perceived anatomic differences may be visually present both to humans and automated techniques, derived from the subtle changes in the imaging sequence parameters ( Figure 1 ). Thus these changes may result in systematic differences in study results depending on the sequence used and the techniques used for analyzing and processing the data.\nTo quantitatively investigate this problem, we begin with a simple assumption that a particular algorithm has been accepted as sufficiently accurate for a single T1-weighted MRI acquisition. Specifically, we assume that the multimethod of Asman et al [3, 4] with the widely used BrianCOLOR atlases is representative of an ADNI compliant 3T MPRAGE (herein \"TI -891\"). Note that this specific assumption has been made by others, e.g., [5] . We then look at two other, similar 3T MPRAGE sequences with slightly different acquisition parameters, but that were also designed and used for research into whole-segmentation (herein, \"TI -624\" and \"TI -927\" with details to follow).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First we describe the data acquisition sequences used for both application and validation. Second, we propose a solution using our acquired dataset as atlas with comparable sequences for segmentation. Third, we present a quantitative solution to the problem of varying sequence acquisitions where we Inversion Time: 624   Inversion Time: 891  Inversion Time: 927 start from the foundational signal equations defining MPRAGE signal and we synthesize new atlas images better matching the contrast of our target images. We validate both of these methods against a reference segmentation and show that both presented techniques show significant improvement when using atlases of the same sequence when compared to atlases of differing sequences."}, {"section_title": "METHODS AND THEORY", "text": "This section is organized as follows.

Each subject was scanned with three unique sequences on a single trip into the scanner. All scans were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva MRI (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a 32-channel receive coil. The first acquisition sequence was an MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI with TR/TE/TI/flip angle 7.9/3.65/927ms/5\u00b0. The second acquisition sequence was an MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI with TR/TE/TI/flip angle -8.2/3.7/891ms/8\u00b0. The third acquisition sequence was an MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI with TR/TE/TI/flip angle -8.9/4.6/624ms/8\u00b0. For the remained of this work we refer to these different sequences by their inversion time (TI -927, TI -891, and TI -624 respectively), and we note that the second acquisition fits within the ADNI standards for an MPRAGE sequence [1] . After acquisition, for each subject TI -927 and TI -624 were rigidly registered to TI -891 with NiftyReg to create a consistent space [6] ."}, {"section_title": "Image Synthesis", "text": "The goal of image synthesis is to generate new atlases with pulse sequence parameters more closely related to the target image than the target image.

To estimate ( ) we begin with a Dual Spin Echo sequence which has signal is defined as [8] \nwhere ( ) is the signal from the th echo time at voxel , is the scanner gain for the Dual Echo sequence, and is the echo time for the th echo. If we assume is significantly greater than , which is standard practice for Dual Echo sequences, the component of the signal effected by ( ) approaches 1 and the equation reduces to\nfrom which we can solve for ( ) as\nwhich is the slope of the log-fit of the echo times. From this solution we solve for ( ) by\nwhich is simply a constant factor times ( ). With a solution for ( ) we can now solve for the remaining parameters in (1). First we solve for as\nwhere is simply since neither parameter needs to be explicitly solved for. Thus can be solved as\nThough this equation still contains the parameter ( ) we simply use the median intensity of the gray matter, white matter, and csf with known T1-relaxation values for these regions to estimate the gain and take the average gain from those estimates [9] . To estimate the T1-relaxation, since in typical T1-weighted imaging is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds and and are typically on the order of milliseconds for 3T T1-weighted sequences, we assume that ( ) \u2248 ( ) and thus we solve for ( ) in closed form as follows from (1)\nFor simplicity we define\nfor the remainder of the derivation.

All images were bias corrected with the N4 bias correction algorithm as a preprocessing step [11] . 10 subjects with T2-relaxation times most closely matching the known times for gray matter and what matter were selected for synthesis [9] . Synthetic images were generated on the selected images to match the three acquired atlas sets (TI -624, TI -891, and TI -927).

We show significant perceived differences in structural information between scans of the same subject under different MRI sequence parameters. We then show that, if using structural information consistent with a target sequence variant and atlases of a sequence more similar to a target sequence, that segmentation results are more parsimonious with the expectation than is we use atlases of an alternate variant. We also consider synthesizing atlas images of the ideal sequence variant from the underlying biological signals of T1-weighted MRI. We show that by generating synthetic atlases more similar to the target image we are segmenting that we typically produce segmentation volumes more parsimonious with the target volume. "}]
