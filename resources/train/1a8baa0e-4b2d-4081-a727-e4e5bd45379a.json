Salmonellosis, illnesses caused by Salmonella species, are the most commonly reported foodborne disease with more than an estimated 1 million illnesses each year (Scallan et al., 2011). Most infections are due to contact with contaminated food products because bacteria are naturally occurring in the gut of food-animals, such as poultry, pigs, and cattle. As a result, salmonellosis is a Public Health priority for government, food industry, Public Health advocates, and health educators. However, salmonellosis is recognized as difficult to control due to Salmonella's ability to survive under a wide range of conditions and dynamic interactions between foods. Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) is one of the top 2 reported Salmonella serotypes in humans, accounting for 15% to 20% of illnesses (Crim, 2014). Although a certain level of contamination is unavoidable in raw meat, raw poultry, and shell eggs available in the marketplace, there are federal regulations set for contamination levels on foods as well as consumer education efforts. Despite these efforts, in the past 15 years S. enteritidis incidence rates have not declined (Crim, 2014) and vary across the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013a). The stubborn incidence of salmonellosis throughout the population in the United States reflects the challenge in reducing individual exposure to contaminated foods and suggests that there are population-level differences in exposure to contaminated foods. A major challenge with developing strategies to reduce salmonellosis is capturing foods and behaviors between individuals and food. No studies of salmonellosis target the home environment even though that is where approximately 90% percent of salmonellosis are believed to occur (Crim, 2014). Furthermore, previous salmonellosis studies focused on the ill individual and their consumption of select foods. This approach makes two assumptions about food exposure and salmonellosis that are known to be incomplete. First, households are composed of multiple individuals that share a common space and it is not reasonable to expect that all household members have the same knowledge regarding food-related behaviors or know every component of food they consume. As a result, individual-level studies are unable to capture the complete picture of risky behaviors or exposure to high risk foods that lead to Salmonella infection and limit the data needed to refine Public Health efforts. In every household there are individuals, called \"head-of-household (HOH),\" who are responsible for all food-related decisions, such as the type and quantity of foods brought into the home, how food is stored, and how food is prepared. Thus, the HOH has more complete data on direct and indirect at-home exposures affecting all household members. Second, focusing on select foods overlooks the fact that Salmonella can withstand a range of environments and contaminate foods and surfaces, known as cross-contamination. Public health studies target shell eggs and raw poultry products because initial epidemiological S. enteritidis studies identified shell eggs as a risk factor for human illnesses (Mishu et al., 1994;Mohle-Boetani et al., 1998;Passaro et al., 1996;St Louis et al., 1988). However, cross-contamination likely plays a significant role in spreading Salmonella at home since high-risk foods are common and any food that shares the same space with contaminated foods has the potential to be the proximal source of illness. This enables individuals to become infected without direct contact with the originally contaminated food. As a result, the dynamic nature of food interactions in the home implies that there is likely a substantial amount of information from food exposure at the consumer level that is not captured under current methodologies used in salmonellosis studies. The gap in the literature may explain why the overall rate of S. enteritidis illness in the United States has not continued to decrease (Crim, 2014). As a result, a clear understanding of the household relationship with foods is likely critical to developing successful public health strategies and improve study design. The relationship between the amount of high risk foods to low risk foods in the home may help identify if that is a component to the geographical difference between rates of illness. This leads to the question, is the relative amount of risky foods in the home associated with S. enteritidis illnesses? Households with similar HOH and household attributes tend to cluster in geographic areas, as seen in the development of enclaves. Thus, the exposure to foods of different risk levels is likely to be similar within populations in a particular area. This suggests that a study of exposure to foods between geographic units can provide a foundation to improve study design of foodborne disease studies as well as targeted and specific health education materials. No study is known to exist that assesses the risk of exposure at the household level. Whether or not a food item is considered risky is based upon host relationship between Salmonella and food animal, and effective ways to control pathogen growth. This is important because the choices the HOH makes in regards to both foods and food-related behaviors affect all household members through direct and indirect food exposure since all household members share common food-related spaces (eg., kitchen, pantry). This is in part because there are a large number of foods that could potentially be in a household, and there are multiple reasonable and common approaches to manipulate food at-home over similar time frames (eg., preparation of shell eggs includes fried, boiled, scrambled, poached, over easy for direct consumption or used as a binder in baking efforts). Data that contains the state and amount of every food item as it enters the home may be used to determine the relative amount of risk the household members are exposed to when comparing the amount of high risk to low risk foods. Most food in the home is obtained from purchases made at a stand-alone retail store, known as grocery purchases. Grocery purchase data has never been used in in a study of salmonellosis, but a dataset that contains detailed information on all groceries purchased by a household may be the easiest attainable complete source of food information available. The amount of each food purchased is the maximum amount of food that is exposed to each household member. Therefore, household-level grocery purchase data that contains the quantity of each food and detailed information on how food is processed and sold at retail, can be used to identify the risk of household members. (Figure 1) This is the first foodborne disease study to use grocery purchase data to identify if there is an association between foods in the home and rates of S. enteritidis illnesses between unique geographic areas throughout the United States. Findings may provide key insights into foods that are commonly available together in a household which can imply potential sources of improper or unsafe food handling behaviors that may be more prevalent in certain populations. The results can provide a deeper understanding of sporadic illnesses which can inform and help to develop targeted and specific Public Health efforts that reduce salmonellosis in the population.  (9). The food purchase decisions (7) make up the foods in the home which determine the risk score, which is the ratio of the quantity of high risk foods to low risk foods. Individual exposure to contaminated food products that lead to risk of S. enteritidis infection (10) occurs through FHBs (8) or food consumption (9). Changes at the population level can influence risk of Salmonella enteritidis infections in households over time, such as shifts in food purchases (7) which alter the foods available for purchase (6) or if changes to the distribution of the household makeup in the population (4) alter the distribution of grocery store types (5) in a geographic area which then affects individual household makeup (3).Dotted lines indicate feedback loops that are included for illustrative purposes and as a reminder that this is a dynamic process over time, even though this study is a static snapshot examining a three-year period.  contact with an infected animal or contaminated food product since Salmonella naturally resides in the intestinal tract of birds, rodents, livestock, and domestic fowl (Rabsch et al., 2002). Thus, food and salmonellosis are inter-related. Symptoms of non-typhi salmonellosis, including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, can last up to 14 days and leads to approximately 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths per year (Scallan et al., 2011). Infections have been identified as a risk factor for additional sequela long after the initial illness has been resolved, such as reactive arthritis (Taggart & Bell, 1989) or irritable bowel syndrome (Cremon et al., 2014). Severe outcomes are more likely to occur among the elderly (\u226565 years) (P. L. Chen et al., 2012;Cummings, Sorvillo, & Kuo, 2010;Gradel et al., 2008), infants (<12 months) (Cummings et al., 2010;Sirinavin, Jayanetra, & Thakkinstian, 1999), immunocompromised (Ramos et al., 1994), men (Cummings et al., 2010), Asians (Cummings et al., 2010), and Blacks (Cummings et al., 2010) indicating vulnerable subgroups. The populationadjusted incidence rate of non-typhi salmonellosis has ranged from 15 to 16 cases per 100,000 persons each year since 1996 1 which is higher than the Healthy People 2020 goal (11.4 per 100,000 persons) (Franco, Hsu, & Simonne, 2010). However, salmonellosis is considered underreported and the actual number of illnesses is estimated at over 1 million persons per year (Scallan et al.,1 Data reported by FoodNet and presented on \" Table 2b. Incidence * of culture-confirmed bacterial and laboratoryconfirmed parasitic infections, and postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) by year and pathogen, Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), United States, 1996-2014\" (http://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/trends/2014/number-of-infections-by-year-1996-2014.html#table2b) 2011). This updates the incidence rate of non-typhi salmonellosis to approximately 356 illnesses per 100,000 persons. Salmonellosis also poses an economic burden with over an estimated $4 billion US annually in direct and indirect costs (Frenzen et al., 1999;Scharff, 2012). The majority of non-typhi salmonellosis cases are likely due to food that went through the food supply. The United States food system is mostly centralized, and the pathway to consumer exposure is known as the farm-to-fork continuum (Figure 2). Salmonellosis is complicated because meat, poultry, and eggs, which are the most likely original source of food contamination, are common food items. According to Economic Research Service within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-ERS) 2 , approximately 250 shell eggs, more than 50 pounds of edible chicken, and approximately 100 pounds of edible red meat were consumed per person per year since 2000. As a result, it is not realistic to remove food-animals and food-animal products from the food supply. Control and Prevention (CDC), collaborate with state and local health departments to monitor food-related illnesses as well as work with the food industry to improve food safety in order to reduce human illnesses. Despite concerted efforts, ranging from federal regulations of pathogen load on food products to consumer education, the rate of salmonellosis has remained relatively stable over the past two decades (Crim, 2014). The ongoing challenges in identifying a practical and reasonable approach that would reduce salmonellosis in the population is a priority to organizations concerned with food safety. However, the dynamic and complex disease pathway likely contributes to gaps in the literature which limited intervention development and prevented continued declines. The top 10 Salmonella serotypes account for approximately 60% of reported isolates in humans. Epidemiological studies have noted serotype-specific differences in the distribution of population-adjusted incidence rates by socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors (Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2012;Guo et al., 2011;Jones et al., 2008;Whitney et al., 2015). As a result, serotype-specific studies may be the key to developing focused strategies."}, {"section_title": "SALMONELLA ENTERITIDIS (S. ENTERITIDIS)", "text": "One of the most commonly reported Salmonella serotypes is Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) which accounts for approximately 20% of all reported Salmonella isolates in humans each year according to the FoodNet, a nationally representative population-based active surveillance program. S. enteritidis is a significant public health issue because declines in illnesses that were noted from 1987 to 1998 (Olsen et al., 2001) have not continued. These early declines have been attributed to increased public awareness and government oversight. More recent data has shown that the rate of illness has significantly increased, compared to a 1996 to 1998 baseline (76% increase, confidence interval 45% to 113%) and a 2004 to 2006 baseline (36% increase, confidence interval 17% to 57%) (Crim, 2014), with higher increases seen among children <5 years, elderly \u226560 years, and states classified in the Southern United States (Chai et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Studies of S. enteritidis identified individual and social characteristics associated with", "text": "illnesses. There was a positive association between S. enteritidis and high socio-economic status (Simonsen, Frisch, & Ethelberg, 2008), Black race (Arshad et al., 2007), Hispanic ethnicity (Arshad et al., 2007), and children <5 years (Arshad et al., 2007;Banatvala, Cramp, Jones, & Feldman, 1999;Younus, Wilkins, Arshad, Rahbar, & Saeed, 2006). Unmarried adults with no partner, living with children, number of children in a household, and having a foreign-born parent were associated with a lower risk of S. enteritidis infection (Simonsen et al., 2008). Origin of parentage was the first characteristic examined in an epidemiological study of salmonellosis that references the importance of underlying household dynamics between household members, since the influence of parental origin impacts household members' behaviors and relationship with food (Savage, Fisher, & Birch, 2007). Studies of characteristics that were not found to be associated with S. enteritidis, including number of years of education (Simonsen et al., 2008), residence in a rural area (Younus et al., 2006), and gender (Younus et al., 2006), may be because these studies were conducted in populations outside the United States or in selected states, and the population may not be sufficiently varied to identify an association with these characteristics. Surveillance reports indicated that the incidence rate of S. enteritidis varied by county (range: 0.01 to >2.2 cases per 100,000 persons) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013b) and state (range: 1.6 to 7 cases per 100,000 persons) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013b) suggesting that there was variation between community-level characteristics associated with S. enteritidis across the United States. Additionally, the multi-level characteristics that have been associated with S. enteritidis have led to an interest in group level analysis of geographic units as a way to better understand disease rates. A study by Chang et.al. found that county-level estimates of socio-demographic characteristics were associated with the incidence of salmonellosis and also recommended serotype specific studies (Chang, Groseclose, Zaidi, & Braden, 2009). There have been three ecological studies that specifically analyzed S. enteritidis and found significant associations between high incidence rates and areas with high socio-economic status (Banatvala et al., 1999;Varga et al., 2013;Whitney et al., 2015), number children in the home (Varga et al., 2013), and high proportion of non-Whites (Varga et al., 2013). Only 1 study was conducted in the United States, among illnesses reported in Connecticut (Whitney et al., 2015). This suggests that there is still research that needs to be done in nationally representative studies of geographic units to uncover community-level characteristics associated with S. enteritidis. Although non-food related exposures, such as international travel (Marcus et al., 2007;Tighe et al., 2012) and contact with birds or reptiles (Aiken, Lane, & Adak, 2010;Marcus et al., 2007) have been associated with S. enteritidis, exposure to contaminated food products is considered the source of most infections. In particular, chicken and eggs are considered the primary vehicle for infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013a; Chai et al., 2012;Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2012;Gu, Vieira, Hoekstra, Griffin, & Cole, 2015;Guo et al., 2011;Hald, Vose, Wegener, & Koupeev, 2004). This is because food-animals are the original host of S. enteritidis. There are two federal agencies, Food Safety and Inspection Service within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-FSIS) 3 and Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA-CFSAN) 4 , tasked with food safety in the United States. Current federal laws do not consider Salmonella an adulterant in raw meat, raw poultry, or shell eggs, meaning its presence is accepted and does not disqualify the food products containing it from being available and sold in the marketplace. USDA-FSIS found that less than 2% of the FSIS' adjusted volume-weighted for raw product commodities 5 are positive for S. enteritidis (Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2012). As expected, microbiologic tests found that raw products were contaminated with S. enteritidis at retail (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013b; Melendez et al., 2010;National Antimicrobial Monitoring System, 2011), the first point in the food supply where food is accessible to consumers. This means that contaminated food products are in the food supply and all consumers are at risk for infection. While USDA-FSIS and FDA-CFSAN can request product recalls from the marketplace, strong epidemiological evidence linking contaminated food products to illness is required. This only occurs as a result of outbreaks, two or more cases of the same illness from a common food source, when there are resources available to launch a full scale investigation. However, <10% of illnesses are estimated to be part of a recognized outbreak (Crim, 2014;Scallan et al., 2011). The majority of non-outbreak cases, known as sporadic cases, are believed to be acquired in the home since that is where over 65% of food interactions occur (Hamrick, Andrews, Guthrie, Hopkins, & McClelland, 2011). Thus, the lack of sustained declines in S. enteritidis illnesses suggests that efforts to reduce salmonellosis should focus on food exposures in the home."}, {"section_title": "HOME ENVIRONMENT", "text": "Homes are designed with central locations for food storage and preparation. Approximately 72% of the population resides in a home with other people. 6 Therefore, an assumption is that all individuals in the household are exposed to all food in the home. However, an analysis of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 7 found that 34% of individuals do not prepare their own food and 14% prepare food half the time (Hamrick et al., 2011). As a result, a large proportion of the population are likely to be unaware of their true food exposures. However, within each home there are designated individuals in each household, head-ofhousehold (HOH), who serve as a gatekeeper for food. The HOH is the primary person responsible for all food-related aspects such as where it is obtained, what is obtained, how it is stored, and how it is prepared. Thus, the HOH has the most comprehensive knowledge regarding all household members' direct and indirect interactions with food. A limitation of previous salmonellosis studies was that they interviewed the ill people only and the study questionnaire was conducted at the point-of-consumption. Food data collection methods in previous studies of salmonellosis are subject to measurement and reporting biases since only the ill 8 person was interviewed and the studies depended upon individual recall. The difference between analyzing a HOH instead of ill cases only was demonstrated during the 2008 Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak when the only study that found an association with peppers, which was determined to be the source of contamination, was conducted among HOHs (Barton Behravesh et al., 2011). Thus, the HOH is likely an underutilized resource that may provide unique insight into sporadic salmonellosis that would not be otherwise captured. However, household-level studies are challenging because of dynamic and complex pathway toward infection. This is primarily because Salmonella is able to withstand stressful environments. Only a combination of time and temperature can reduce the amount of Salmonella to non-detectable levels (Angelotti, Foter, & Lewis, 1961a;Doyle & Mazzotta, 2000). This is important because Salmonella is able to contaminate other foods, also known as crosscontamination. Cross-contamination can occur when contaminated foods come into contact with foods or surfaces that are not properly cleaned (Figure 3) (Jensen, Friedrich, Harris, Danyluk, & Schaffner, 2013;Kuda, Shibata, Takahashi, & Kimura, 2015;Pouillot, Hoelzer, Ramirez, deGraft-Hanson, & Dennis, 2014;Roccato et al., 2015;Sreedharan, Schneider, & Danyluk, 2014). Outbreaks of S. enteritidis illnesses have been linked to a range of contaminated foods including 7 Survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Sample of nationally representative households 8 Adult proxy were used for ill persons who were not able to be interviewed bean sprouts 9 , pine nuts 10 , shell eggs 11 , frozen raw chicken containing foods 12 , and fresh raw ground beef 13 . A study of every identified S. enteritidis outbreak in humans from 1998 to 2010 found that all 10 food commodities (eggs, fish, crustaceans, dairy, beef, poultry, poultry, fruitsnuts, leafy vegetables, sprouts, and vine-stalk vegetables) were associated with S. enteritidis (Painter et al., 2013). As a result, any food can theoretically be the most proximal vehicle of infection. Despite the role of cross-contamination in Salmonella infections, a limitation of previous salmonellosis studies is that the study questionnaire focused on select foods which overlooks the dynamic interactions between foods that lead to infection. This is complicated because there are no policies, regulations, or active food safety education in place for the home environment. As a result, there are no social constraints around behaviors in the home. Observational studies of consumers in their own kitchen found that food safety failures were common despite a large proportion of the population knowing proper behaviors (Abbot, Byrd-Bredbenner, Schaffner, Bruhn, & Blalock, 2009;Anderson, Shuster, Hansen, Levy, & Volk, 2004). Additionally, behaviors can change with each food interaction and every individual is exposed to food an estimated 4-6 times per day, totaling approximately 3 hours (Hamrick et al., 2011). As a result, the availability of contaminated foods in the home determines the underlying risk of disease, thus potentially leading to human illness (Angelotti, Foter, & Lewis, 1961b;Das, Gurakan, & Bayindirli, 2006;Franco et al., 2010;Thanissery & Smith, 2014). Thus, if there are no contaminated foods in the home, cross-contamination is a moot point. However, high risk foods are common in the home. In the 2006-2007 FoodNet population survey, 28% of respondents reported consuming any product with raw eggs and 65% of respondents reported consuming any chicken prepared at home (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2006-2007). Furthermore, the number and amount of foods individuals are exposed to vary between populations; there are multi-level factors that are important in understanding the variety and amount of foods in the home which determine the individual risk to foods in the home. Studies of socio-demographic characteristics associated with Food Consumption or Food Diets in the home were reviewed along with Food Choice because consumption, diet, and choice attempt to describe the spectrum of food exposure. Food Choice, Food Consumption, and Food Diets were found to vary by poverty status (Bove & Olson, 2006;Grimm, Foltz, Blanck, & Scanlon, 2012), social class (Harrington et al., 2011), household income (Ni Mhurchu et al., 2013;Worsley, Blasche, Ball, & Crawford, 2003), household size (Harnack, Story, Martinson, Neumark-Sztainer, & Stang, 1998), marital status (Eng, Kawachi, Fitzmaurice, & Rimm, 2005;Harrington et al., 2011;Mancino & Newman, 2007), HOH gender (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2006-2007;Harnack et al., 1998;Otnes, 2001;Song, Simon, & Patel, 2014;Worsley et al., 2003), race (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2006-2007;Song et al., 2014), HOH age (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2006-2007;Drewnowski & Shultz, 2001;Harnack et al., 1998;Worsley et al., 2003), HOH education level (Harrington et al., 2011;Ricciuto, Tarasuk, & Yatchew, 2006;Turrell & Kavanagh, 2006), HOH employment level (Bove & Olson, 2006), age of household members (Ricciuto et al., 2006), alcohol consumption and smoking status (Harrington et al., 2011), and geography (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2006-2007). While there is an expectation that the presence of children will influence food choice, a study that looked at diet behavior in new parents did not find any association (Laroche, Wallace, Snetselaar, Hillis, & Steffen) which may be due to the age of the children in the study. As a result, information on the state of the food item as well as the amount is necessary to determine risk between populations. A ratio between the amount of high risk to low risk foods individuals are exposed to can account for both food diversity and differential amounts of food between individuals."}, {"section_title": "GROCERY PURCHASES", "text": "Grocery data is a potentially valuable source of food data because it is the primary source of food in the home. Approximately 75% of food that was reported consumed in the United States in the 2005-2006 survey cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was from food obtained from a grocery store, mail-order purchase, or caught or grown by someone the consumer knows (Todd, 2014). Of the three food sources, it is likely that the majority of food is obtained from grocery stores. Foods from grocery stores are purchased as raw ready-to-eat (eg., apple), raw not ready-to-eat (eg., fresh meat), processed not ready to eat (eg., frozen pizza), or processed ready-to-eat (eg., potato chips). Detailed grocery data provides the quantity and description of each food item necessary to determine risk of food contamination from food brought into the home. For example, the risk of already cooked chicken is different from the risk of raw chicken. As a result, grocery data provides detailed data on foods in the home that are not available from self-report methods and are not as affected by recall issues that impact pointof-consumption studies if they are reported as the food enters the home."}, {"section_title": "ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "Ecological analysis of food exposure and salmonellosis may provide unique insight in the role that both community and individual level factors play in geographic variation of disease rates. Community-level analysis is possible if the population variation within a community is smaller than the variation between communities. Variation between communities exist because communities throughout the United States develop as explained by the social capital theory, which is the collective groupings of individuals based on shared ideas, behaviors, decisions, and characteristics. Studies have found that social capital creates a community structure, which can have an effect on behaviors and health (Aslund, Starrin, & Nilsson, 2010;Bolin, Lindgren, Lindstrom, & Nystedt, 2003;Morland, Wing, Diez Roux, & Poole, 2002;Treuhaft). This explains the development of geographically homogeneous areas, like an ethnic enclave, that are unevenly distributed throughout the United States. Although there is variation within communities, at a population level, there is likely more heterogeneity in food exposure between populations. The same multi-level individual, HOH, and household characteristics which inform community development also determine the foods in the home (Byrd-Bredbenner et al., 2007;Fein, Lando, Levy, Teisl, & Noblet, 2011;Meer & Misner, 2000;Patil, Cates, & Morales, 2005;Roseman & Kurzynske, 2006;Shiferaw et al., 2012;Shiferaw et al., 2000;Wardle et al., 2004;Yang et al., 1998 "}, {"section_title": "Homescan data structure", "text": "Homescan consists of 4 datasets that contain data on food purchases and 1 dataset that contains demographic information about the household and persons within the household.

For example, 1 pack that contains 5 sticks of Wrigley's spearmint gum has a different UPC than a package that consists of 12 packs that each contains 5 sticks of Wrigley's spearmint gum, where the food product is gum, brand is Wrigley's, size is sticks, and package type is pack. The random-weight panel is composed of all foods with a retailer specific code. These foods are ones where the purchase-amount is determined by the customer, such as bulk bin items, loose fruits and vegetables, and items from the deli-case. Food items reported as a single observation are identical in every dimension and purchased on the same day (Figure 7). Together, both panels represent all foods available for sale at a retail store. From 2004 to 2006, an annual average of 7,043 households participate in both panels (range: 6,544 -7,419 households).

Internet notices are sent to e-mail addresses and appear on web page advertisements. Certain web pages are specifically targeted to improve recruitment of groups that are typically difficult to maintain, such as young, single, low-income, and ethnic households. Direct mail is used to target households that do not have internet service; Nielsen obtained name and address information from companies with contact and demographic data of households. Households that respond to the initial solicitation are required to answer a series of demographic questions to determine eligibility. All eligible households are entered into a central pool for up to 24 months 20 . Nielsen maintains contact with these households by sending out surveys and questionnaires each month. Homescan uses a distance algorithm to select households from the central pool to participate in the panel. Households are selected based on how closely their demographic profile matches gaps in county-level demographic distribution of already participating households. Homescan constructs the population distribution from demographic data purchased from Claritas, Inc. The demographic data consists of 9 household characteristics: household size, household income, headof-household age, female head-of-household education, male head-of-household education, children in home, race, ethnicity, and head-of-household employment. Homescan updates the household-specific projection-factor each year by using an iterative proportion fitting procedure using household responses to the 9 demographic variables. Households are assigned a householdspecific projection-factor for each panel that they participate in because the number of households in each panel varies. However, this study only used the household-specific projection factor calculated for the random-weight panel because all households that are enrolled in the randomweight panel also participated in the UPC panel and were included in this analysis. Households that enter the Homescan panel are enrolled for 12 consecutive months and then are required to renew their participation for subsequent years. Households that voluntarily decide to exit the panel before 12 consecutive months have passed or do not adequately report purchase activity 21 were excluded from the analyzed dataset.

Households also enter data regarding the number of packages (Quantity of the package type) and the number of multipacks (Quantity of the package encompassing the Quantity of food) purchased for each unique food item. Food data is saved in an online database that households are able to edit and enter information about random-weight food purchases. The online database is uploaded to Nielsen on a weekly basis. Nielsen performs cleaning routines to complete a product description that describes the food product. USDA-ERS also assigns codes called Product Modules to describe groupings of food items.

"}, {"section_title": "POPULATION-LEVEL ANALYSIS", "text": "The population-adjusted rate of S. enteritidis illnesses >6 years was identified as a confounder because it is the only covariate that was significantly associated with both S. enteritidis illnesses and Homescan market risk score. The Homescan region score was included as a factor to account for larger geographic groupings. After adjusting for confounders there was not an association between Homescan market risk score and the population-adjusted rate of S. enteritidis illnesses (p-value = 0.42)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This is the first study to examine the relationship between all foods in the home and S. enteritidis infections, or any foodborne disease, in the United States. Population-based householdreported grocery purchase data collected from 2004 to 2006 was used to determine, quantify, and compare individual, household, and geographic risk to high risk foods throughout the United States. The results indicated that exposure to high risk foods varied between Homescan market population, but not by Homescan region. This suggests that the populations in some Homescan markets purchase more high risk foods than the population in other Homescan markets. However, this study was unable to find an association between S. enteritidis illnesses and exposure to high risk foods in the home at Homescan region and Homescan market. The use of a household risk is a novel use of food data, and relationship with S. enteritidis illnesses warrants further attention. The benefit of a risk score as opposed to studying only the amount of high risk foods is that it puts into perspective the relationship between all foods in the home. This is important, because of the inter-relationships between foods. The lack of an association may be due to the size of the Homescan markets which may minimize the heterogeneity between analytic units. Future ecological studies should consider county and county-equivalents as geographic units in order to conduct ecological studies among population in smaller geographic areas. While no association was found between illnesses and high risk food exposure, the diversity in high-risk food scores at a population level suggests that there may be HOH behaviors in the home that are the source of differential rates of disease. This would have a direct bearing on whether the most efficient use of limited resources available for food safety would be more effective on upstream changes to the food supply such as in the form of increased testing or regulation of grocery stores, or be spent on developing better consumer education materials by targeting specific populations. Current education approaches are fairly broad (eg., cook foods thoroughly, avoid cross contamination) and have not resulted in lasting behavioral changes because the population may not comprehend the importance of food safety behaviors (Medeiros, Chen, Hillers, & Kendall, 2008) since proper behaviors are not necessarily part of the household norm. This supports growing interest in improving food safety education measures (Sivaramalingam et al., 2015) by providing a framework to focus food safety efforts, both in developing materials and conducting studies. Population-specific messaging may be more effective in changing behaviors since the language and materials can be targeted to specific constructs that are of particular relevance to the population (Abbot et al., 2009;Byrd-Bredbenner et al., 2007;G. Chen, Kendall, Hillers, & Medeiros, 2010;Medeiros et al., 2008;Quinlan, 2013;Scheule, 2004). Grocery data is a novel approach to capturing and analyzing food data for foodborne disease studies. Homescan was used because it was the only available data source that contained the full range of foods in the home. Homescan provides a unique opportunity to appreciate the complexity of at-home food exposure that would otherwise be unexplored in other data collection strategies. The level of detail, on the state of the food, in the dataset provided a way to understand the variation and complexity of food diversity available in grocery stores throughout the United States that is not available in any other dataset. There are several strengths to using grocery purchase data as a proxy for at-home food exposure. First, the level of detail in grocery data allows the ability to determine the risk level of every observation. The flexibility may make this a powerful tool for studying other foodborne diseases which allows specific foods of interest to be noted. Second, the detail of grocery data overcomes the need to differentiate the level of preparation of different food products that affects risk of exposure to contaminated products. Third, multiple hypothesis of different food interactions can be tested. As a result, Homescan provided a unique opportunity to describe variability in at-home food exposure which had not been done before. Homescan data was collected from the HOH and provided a baseline for at-home food exposure for all household members. This approach may be less likely to be subject to measurement errors that are more likely to occur from data reported by other household members who may not be responsible for food purchases. The sample size is larger than other studies, that collect food data at the consumer level, which supports analysis for subgroups, and the level of detail in Homescan fills a data gap for studies of diseases that have an association with the state of food item, such as foodborne diseases (Dwyer et al., 2003). This is unique compared to other nationally representative data collection strategies at the individual level (eg., NHANES).  Table A6). The largest differences between Homescan population and United States population was HOH gender which may be due to individual interpretation of HOH status for the purposes of food-related activities versus overall perception of HOH since there may be gender differences in household roles (Hilton & Haldeman, 1991). There were 5 households reported to Homescan that were not included in food-related analysis. The 68 projection factor for each household represented <1% of the population in their respective Homescan markets and overall population. Their exclusion likely did not affect the final results. These results suggest that the strategies employed by Homescan in ensuring that typically underrepresented populations -underserved, minorities, and women -were enrolled with similar success to efforts used by the United States Census Bureau to include these individuals. This was important in ensuring that the risk score is representative of the overall Homescan population. As a result, the food data collected were likely not biased towards a particular population more than the food data collected in other nationally representative studies. Thus, future studies can utilize Homescan to identify food-related differences in smaller populations that may be pertinent to understanding risk to contaminated food products and risky behaviors. The risk score is dependent on the quality of the grocery purchase data since the amount of each food item purchased is used to determine the ratio of high risk foods to low risk foods. While Food Categories were not narrow enough to identify data quality issues, Food Groups were able to detect data anomalies and the affected Purchase-Variables were edited to increase confidence in the data quality. Furthermore, Food Groups helped determine a reasonable unit for observations reported with Count. The uncertainty surrounding this assumption is unknown, but a standard of reasonableness was applied to each decision in order to minimize potential errors. Another data issue that was addressed in this study is the identification of outliers. The typical definition used to define outliers in food-related studies, 3 times the interquartile range, may not be appropriate for grocery purchase data. Human ability to process and consume food is more narrow than what households purchase, which are constrained by availability, cost, and space to contain food. As a result, the distribution of the Observation Purchase-Weight is heavily skewed; evaluations of observations at the right hand of the tail revealed reasonable product purchase amounts, such as the difference between offerings at warehouse stores versus convenience stores. The inconsistencies found within the observations of food were not noted in previous uses of Homescan data. This may be due to grouping parameters used in previous studies that were not capable of detecting data quality issues, observations of foods that were not described, or not analyzing observations from the Random-Weight panel which is where data issues occurred. While caution should be used when analyzing the data it does not detract from the overall utility of Homescan. Similar to all food-related data collected from consumers, data accuracy is a concern. There are multiple data sources that serve as proxies for national amounts of food consumption or food intake. These data sources report national estimates of food at different points along the farm-tofork continuum and are collected using different methodologies. For example, data reported in the USDA-ERS Food Availability (Per-Capita) Data System is calculated from data reported by farms, processing plants, and import/exports, while data reported in NHANES is collected as individual consumption over 2 nonconsecutive 24-hour periods. However, Homescan is the only dataset that reports quantities of food at the point-of-retail from the consumer perspective. Due to food losses at different points along the farm-to-fork continuum (eg., spoilage or waste), the estimates reported in each dataset are not expected to be equal. Furthermore, publically available reports of estimates from USDA-ERS 51 and NHANES 52 were not comparable to Homescan because descriptions of food groupings and quantities between each dataset were not consistent with each other or the Food Categories created from Homescan data. Furthermore, analysts of these other data sources did not recommend manipulating these data sources into a format that would allow for 51 http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-(per-capita)-data-system/.aspx comparisons. However, pricing data reported to Homescan was compared to pricing reports from retailers and found that the data quality of self-reported data was similar to other economic data sets (Einav, Leibtag, & Nevo, 2008;Zhen, Taylor, Muth, & Leibtag, 2009). Although cost was not analyzed in this study, the consistency of the data suggests that the Measurement-Variables were of similar quality. While the overall data quality was determined to be consistent, the analysis suggested that there may be non-random errors in Homescan data by age, race, education level, and male employment status. However, these differences were no worse than accuracy concerns facing other food-related datasets (Dwyer et al., 2003). Awareness of these issues tempers the conclusions, but does not detract from the utility of Homescan as a data source. Though we were unable to determine if the quality of data would be different if any adult reported grocery data, it is likely that the HOH would be most invested in data reporting, and it is reasonable to expect that entering food data is built into household food-behaviors since the HOH reports grocery data on a regular basis. Although participation in Homescan is a burden, participants were compensated for their time and were made aware of the expectations. Additionally, the use of a UPC scanner, scale, and access to an online database reduced the burden on the HOH. Furthermore, 74% of households participated for more than 1 year suggesting that households were willing to invest the time and effort to participate in a study of this magnitude. Although risk score has never been described prior to this study, a review of the distribution The identification and distribution of the Homescan market risk score is sensitive to shifts in food relationships. There was overall consistency from year-to-year on the estimated Homescan population exposed to each Food Category and population-weighted per-capita total annual Purchase-Weight. However, this study used data from multiple years because there were not enough households that participated in each Homescan market in a year to accurately represent the food variability of the population. This was reflected in Homescan market year-to-year variation in the percent of population exposed and per-capita total annual Purchase-Weight for certain Food Categories. Based on previous reports of food trends, it may take several decades for shifts in food behaviors to become apparent, depending on the food (Smith, Ng, & Popkin, 2013;United States Department of Agriculture, 2003;Wells, March 2008). The distribution of the population among quintiles in food purchase patterns, from studies representative of the United States population, would also indicate shifts in food purchasing behavior. As a result, future studies should be cautious that the food purchase behaviors identified from the population in this study are consistent with future study populations. This study used Homescan data from 2004 to 2006 because it is the only time period that food data from the UPC panel and Random-Weight panel were reported. A secondary analysis conducted as part of this study with only the UPC panel found that the risk scores differed without the inclusion of the Random-Weight panel. This is likely due to the disproportionate amount of low risk and high risk foods that are more commonly purchased as part of the Random-Weight panel compared to the UPC panel. This indicated that the data from the Random-Weight panel was important to our understanding. As a result, it is necessary that any future study that collects observations of food directly from grocery stores includes both random-weight and UPC foods in order to accurately reflect and describe at-home food exposure. There were several limitations to the Salmonella data. First, NSSS does not distinguish outbreak, travel, and domestically-acquired sporadic cases from each other. Although sporadic infections make up approximately 90% of salmonellosis, there may be population-level differences in the distribution of domestically-acquired sporadic illnesses (Johnson et al., 2011;Kendall et al., 2012). Second, although salmonellosis is nationally notifiable, there is evidence that there are geographic differences in the quality of data reporting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013b). Third, there were 7,373 Salmonella cases that had an unknown serotype (4,418 cases) or could not be matched to a Homescan market (2,955 cases) because zipcode data was not available. Finally, NSSS is a passive surveillance system and differences in health care seeking behaviors may result certain populations being underreported (Scallan et al., 2006). These limitations may lead to incorrectly estimating the magnitude of geographic variation in disease rates which affect the observed ecologic relationships. These limitations may result in less specific associations between risk score and S. enteritidis illnesses. Variations in the geographic distribution of illnesses may be the result of environmental and social characteristics that are not detected at an individual-level. As a result, ecological studies are of growing interest to the foodborne disease literature because they include individual and community-level factors. Furthermore, ecological studies can help improve our understanding of exposure pathways and identify targets of food safety measures that will result in decreases in the population (Koopman & Longini, 1994) since there is evidence that the risk of access to contaminated food products has an environmental component that can be addressed at the structural level (Darcey & Quinlan, 2011;Quinlan, 2013). Previous ecological studies used county or countyequivalents as the geographical unit, which may identify greater heterogeneity between sociodemographic characteristics than between Homescan markets. This study used Homescan market as a unit of analysis because that was the smallest common unit that matched to illness data. Of the 3 socio-demographic factors previously associated with S. enteritidis in an ecological study only poverty was a similar finding from this study, with household size and level of rurality being new findings from this study (Banatvala et al., 1999;Varga et al., 2013;Whitney et al., 2015). The identification of additional socio-demographic variables associated with S. enteritidis may be due to the increased population since previous ecologic studies were conducted in smaller geographic areas. Although the location of households that participate in Homescan is unknown, households are distributed geographically in densely population areas and are assumed to be representative of the entire population. While standardized age-rates were tested in the model with no change to the results, as with ecological studies, there may be other unexplored within-group confounders, and information bias could introduce errors. Furthermore, rurality was obtained from USDA-ERS so it was not linked to households. We used the data under the assumption that the Homescan market risk score would not be substantially affected by any population not well represented in Homescan."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Previous studies of food or salmonellosis have not accounted for the diversity of foods in the home which make up universe of food exposure in the home.
