Such reconstructions play a key role in resolving past tropical climate changes, as continuous, high-resolution paleoclimate archives are relatively rare in the tropics. Stalagmite \u03b4 18 O records, in particular, have been used to probe hydroclimate variability over the last hundred years (Treble et al., 2005; Frappier et al., 2007) , the last glacial cycle (Dykoski et al., 2005; Partin et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2009) , and the last million years (Wang et al., 2001; Meckler et al., 2012) .\nDespite robust observations of the amount effect across tropical latitudes, the climatic controls on rainfall \u03b4 18 O at any given site remain highly uncertain as numerous processes contribute to rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability. Rayleigh distillation, whereby cumulative fractionation during condensation and rainout leaves the residual atmospheric vapor depleted in \u03b4 18 O, has long been recognized as a first-order mechanism driving the amount effect and rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability (Dansgaard, 1964; Rozanski et al., 1993) . The Rayleigh mechanism operates both locally, in the case of rainfall \u03b4 18 O fractionation across a single rainfall event (e.g. Celle-Jeanton et al., 2004) and regionally, when considering the progressive vapor depletion of air parcels transiting through a region of enhanced precipitation (e.g. Cobb et al., 2007; Vimeux et al., 2011) .\nSeveral post-condensation processes also likely contribute to the observed amount effect relationship. For one, the evaporation of falling raindrops causes the residual rainfall to be relatively enriched-a process that is maximized in arid regions and during dry seasons (Dansgaard, 1964; Stewart, 1975; Gat, 1996; Lee and Fung, 2008; Risi et al., 2008a) . In regions characterized by strong convection, the recycling of water vapor within the convective cell drives rainfall \u03b4 18 O lower during episodes of intense convection (Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996; Lawrence et al., 2004; Risi et al., 2008a Risi et al., , 2008b . Numerous studies have identified additional processes, such as atmospheric mixing and/or changes in moisture sources and trajectories, that contribute to rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability at tropical and subtropical sites (Aggarwal et al., 2004; Cobb et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007; Breitenbach et al., 2010 , Gao et al., 2011 .\nPrevious studies have referred to the amount effect in describing fractionation processes that act strictly locally (e.g. Vuille et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009; LeGrande and Schmidt, 2009 ) as well as fractionation processes that integrate across larger spatial scales and longer time periods (e.g. Cobb et al., 2007; Risi et al., 2008b; Kurita et al., 2009 Kurita et al., , 2011 Tremoy et al., 2012) . For the sake of clarity, we will differentiate between a \"local\" versus \"regional\" amount effect in our study, based on the inferred spatial scale of the fractionation mechanism in question.\nIsotope-equipped general circulation models (GCMs) allow for the systematic investigation of the various dynamics regulating rainfall isotopic composition (Joussaume et al., 1984; Jouzel et al., 1987; Hoffmann et al., 1998; Noone and Simmonds, 2002; Schmidt et al., 2007; Tindall et al., 2009; Risi et al., 2010) . Agreement between observations and model output has improved as models incorporate processes such as post-condensation raindrop re-evaporation and convective mixing (Field et al., 2010) and as higher spatial resolution affords more realistic model topographies and better representations of weather systems (Vimeux et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2011) . Recent studies using isotope-equipped GCMs find that the dominant drivers of rainfall isotopic variability vary from region to region (Lee et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2010; Conroy et al., in press) , with modeled \u03b4"}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "O values reflecting the net sum of often competing processes (Field et al., 2010) . Models also reveal that the relationship between climate and rainfall \u03b4 18 O at a given site may vary with time period (e.g. LeGrande and Schmidt, 2009) .\nThe dearth of high-resolution rainfall \u03b4\nO isotope timeseries throughout the tropics makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of fractionation mechanisms that emerge in isotope-equipped model simulations. Most rainfall \u03b4 18 O studies rely on the International Atomic Energy Agency-Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation database (IAEA-GNIP; International Atomic Energy Agency, 2006) . As this network is comprised almost exclusively of monthly averaged rainfall \u03b4 18 O data, such studies are limited to investigating seasonal and longer timescales. As a result, relatively little is known about rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability on daily to intraseasonal (30-90 day) timescales and its connection to dominant intraseasonal climate modes, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO; Madden and Julian, 1972; Zhang, 2005 (Dansgaard, 1964) ) and hereafter referred to as 'd-excess.' There is no GNIP station on Borneo, so our study represents an important addition to the rainfall \u03b4\nO data archive, while informing the climatic interpretation of numerous stalagmite \u03b4\nO-based paleoclimate records from our site Meckler et al., 2012; Carolin et al., under review) .\nO and \u03b4D were measured at the Georgia Institute of Technology via cavity ring-down spectroscopy (Picarro L1102-i water isotope analyzer). To calibrate the isotopic composition of the rainfall samples, three internal water standards, each calibrated against NIST-VSMOW, NIST-GISP, and NIST-SLAP, were analyzed at the beginning and end of each analysis. An internal water standard was analyzed after every nine rainfall samples to monitor instrument drift. Memory corrections were applied to each measurement based on empirical, instrument-specific memory coefficients. \nO and d-excess across the March 7, 2010 rainfall event are shown in Fig. 1A . Over a 1-h period, rainfall \u03b4\nO ranges from \u22121.5\u2030 to \u00fe0.8\u2030, and \u03b4D ranges from \u00fe1.8\u2030 to \u00fe10\u2030 (not shown), with the highest isotopic values observed in the first minutes of the event. Rainfall isotope values reach their lowest values after fifteen minutes and then gradually increase thereafter, following a \"V-shaped\" progression documented at higher latitude sites (Rindsberger et al., 1990; Celle-Jeanton et al., 2004) . Increasing rainfall intensity kinetic fractionation (Dansgaard, 1964; Gat, 1996; Risi et al., 2010) , and both rainfall \u03b4 18 O (R\u00bc \u22120.98) and rainfall intensity (R\u00bc0.80) suggest that the partial re-evaporation of falling raindrops likely drives the amount effect during this event. When raindrops undergo evaporation in low relative humidity conditions, the dexcess value of the evaporate increases, leaving the raindrops with lower d-excess, as seen mostly in the beginning of the March 7th event (Fig. 1A) . Further support for post-condensation evaporation is provided by the relatively low slope (\u223c4) for rainfall \u03b4D vs. \u03b4 18 O variations for this event (Fig. 2) , which is typical of evaporation and differs appreciably from the equilibrium \u03b4D/\u03b4 18 O slope of 8 associated with the global meteoric water line (GMWL; Dansgaard, 1964) . These data support a central role for postcondensation evaporation during the March 7th convective event, whereby a raindrop is isotopically enriched during its transit from cloud to ground. Such a mechanism also explains the occurrence of several positive rainfall \u03b4\n18 O values during this event. Together, these results strongly suggest that post-condensation evaporative processes drive the observed \"local\" amount effect, and rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability in general, during this convective event. Our results provide further observational support for recent studies of an idealized microphysical model (Lee and Fung, 2008) and a single column model (Risi et al., 2008a) , which both suggest that post-condensation evaporation is an important contributor to the amount effect within individual rainfall events. Additional highresolution sampling of water isotopes across discrete convective events is needed, however, to confirm whether these results are representative of precipitation events at our site.\nO that previous studies have observed (Risi et al., 2008b; Vimeux et al., 2011) and modeled (Sturm et al., 2007; Risi et al., 2008a) . It should be noted that a simple 8-day lag of local Mulu precipitation (as opposed to an 8-day integration of Mulu precipitation) is not correlated to daily Mulu rainfall \u03b4\nO values (R \u00bc \u22120.07), indicating that a simple lag relationship is not responsible for these observations. The time-integrative nature of Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O is also illustrated by high auto-correlation of the \u03b4 18 O timeseries (R AC \u00bc0.45) compared with that for local Mulu precipitation (R AC \u00bc0.23). We hypothesize that the week-long 'memory' of rainfall \u03b4 18 O may reflect an approximately week-long atmospheric residence time of water vapor at Mulu.\nO minima occur in June-July and November-January, and two relative maxima occur in February-April and August-October. It is important to note that removing potential ENSO influences from the 5-yr rainfall \u03b4 18 O timeseries does not alter the rainfall \u03b4 18 O seasonal cycle (Fig. 8) (Fig. 8) . Regional winds are relatively weak during these times, as the ITCZ transits directly over northern Borneo. We hypothesize that during these seasons, the adjoining sea surface is the dominant source of water vapor to Mulu, providing for shorter water vapor trajectories and therefore less cumulative isotopic fractionation. A detailed investigation of the causes of seasonal variations in Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O, however, is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. (Table S3) . Local Mulu precipitation amount is characterized by lower correlations to ENSO indices (e.g. R \u00bc\u22120.50, p o 0.1 for NI\u00d1O4; Fig. 9F ). These findings strongly suggest that, compared to Mulu precipitation, Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O is a better tracer of ENSO variability, owing to its time-and space-integrative properties.\nRegression maps of Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O and basin-scale precipitation (Fig. 10A) and OLR (Fig. 10B ) reveal significant correlations that extend from the western to central Pacific. The spatial pattern of these correlations strongly resembles the first EOF of global precipitation, which is attributed to ENSO variability (e.g. Fig. 1 of Furtado et al., 2009 ). These results support the existence of a strong \"regional\" amount effect associated with ENSO variability, whereby regionally suppressed convection in the western Pacific leads to higher rainfall isotopes during El Ni\u00f1o conditions, and vice versa during La Ni\u00f1a events. It is worth noting that these statistically robust relationships were extracted from a time series that contained only one \"strong\" ENSO event (i.e. the 2010/2011 La Ni\u00f1a), thus underscoring the sensitivity of rainfall \u03b4 18 O at our site to small/moderate changes in the ENSO state.\nIn contrast to Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O, which closely tracks basinscale ocean-atmosphere interactions associated with ENSO, Mulu precipitation amount is correlated to regional precipitation in a much smaller area (Figs. 10C, D) . The fact that Mulu rainfall \u03b4\nO is more sensitive than Mulu precipitation amount to basin-scale ENSO variability indicates that the rainfall \u03b4 18 O-ENSO relationship is primarily transmitted through regional-scale, rather than local, convective activity. In other words, interannual variations in the overall convective state of the WPWP imprint water vapor with an isotopic ENSO signal prior to the vapor's arrival at northern Borneo, while ENSO-related changes in convective activity at our site may subsequently serve to amplify the far-field ENSO signal in rainfall \u03b4 18 O.\nO is inversely related to precipitation variability, consistent with the tropical amount effect. While we find evidence for a \"local\" amount effect across a single convective event, we demonstrate that rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability on diurnal to interannual timescales at Mulu is tied to a \"regional\" amount effect.\nWithin an individual storm, we find evidence that local processes, specifically below-cloud evaporation of falling raindrops, cause the observed inverse correlation between rainfall \u03b4 18 O and precipitation rate. This relationship arises because the degree of kinetic fractionation during the evaporation of a raindrop depends on the humidity of the atmosphere through which it falls, with higher humidity suppressing evaporative enrichment (Dansgaard, 1964; Stewart, 1975) . The response of rainfall \u03b4\nO to changes in the efficiency of below-cloud evaporation is essentially instantaneous at the intra-storm timescale. These findings provide observational confirmation of numerical modeling results invoking post-condensation evaporative enrichment as a primary control on rainfall isotopes during individual precipitation events (Lee and Fung, 2008; Risi et al., 2008a) . At the diurnal timescale, several lines of evidence suggest that isotopic fractionation associated with the \"local\" amount effect is dwarfed by \u03b4 18 O variations that reflect regional convective activity. For one, our results indicate that post-condensation evaporation of falling raindrops, which amounts to fractionations of \u223c1-2\u2030 within the March 7, 2010 convective event, is relatively small compared to day-to-day rainfall \u03b4\nO variations of \u223c2-10\u2030. Indeed, previous observational and GCM-based studies also find that local post-condensation evaporation has relatively little impact on rainfall \u03b4\n18 O values on daily and longer timescales in wet tropical regions (Kurita et al., 2009; Breitenbach et al., 2010; Field et al., 2010) . Secondly, the weak correlation between daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O and daily Mulu precipitation amount further suggests that local rainout has relatively little impact on cumulative daily Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O values. Similarly weak correlations between daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O and local precipitation amount are also observed at other tropical and subtropical sites (e.g. Yamanaka et al., 2004; Risi et al., 2008b , Kurita et al., 2009 , Breitenbach et al., 2010 Vimeux et al., 2011) .\nThe weak daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O-precipitation relationship can be attributed to the time-and space-integrative properties of rainfall \u03b4 18 O, illustrated by the high correlation between daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O and regional precipitation amount averaged over the preceding week (Fig. 4D) . The 5-8-day vapor residence time that we observe at Mulu suggests that isotopic signals persist within the atmospheric vapor above Mulu for several days. These findings are consistent with those of studies at other tropical sites, which explain the time-integrative behavior of rainfall \u03b4 18 O via a repeated atmospheric vapor recycling process, in which lowlevel vapor depleted by earlier convective activity is fed into successive convective systems (Risi et al., 2008a (Risi et al., , 2008b Vimeux et al., 2011) . In this way, the isotopic composition of the recycled water vapor -and that of the resultant rainfall -reflects the cumulative intensity of the previous days' convective activity, thus causing daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O to be poorly correlated with daily precipitation amount. Taken together, these results suggest that diurnal rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability at our site is more dependent on the isotopic composition of the water vapor from which it condenses than the local fractionation processes that occur during individual rainfall events. The space-integrative property of daily Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O, illustrated by the strong correlations between Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O and regional precipitation amount in Fig. 4C and D, suggests that Mulu vapor \u03b4\nO is also significantly influenced by regional-scale convective processes. This is further supported by Fig. 5 , which shows that correlations between daily gridded TRMM precipitation amount and daily Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O are far more regionally extensive than they are for daily Mulu precipitation amount.\nThe large multi-day rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion events observed at Mulu typically coincide with the passage of mesoscale convective systems associated with the MJO (Fig. 7) . We infer that these largescale convective systems deliver anomalously depleted water vapor \u03b4 18 O to Mulu, thus resulting in depleted rainfall \u03b4 O occurs towards the end of the passage of a regional convective system rather than at the onset (Figs. 6 and 7) . Risi et al. (2008b) similarly observe a multi-day delay in maximum rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion with respect to the onset of enhanced convective activity associated with the monsoon in west Africa. In our case, maximum rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion occurs after \u223c3-4 days of above-average local precipitation. As water vapor residence times are 5-8 days at our site, this relatively rapid depletion suggests that additional vapor fractionation occurs as a result of on-site convective activity. Thus, the largest, sharpest rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletions observed in our timeseries can be ascribed to two processes: (1) regionally-enhanced convection associated with the MJO delivers already depleted water vapor to Gunung Mulu, and (2) intense local convective activity distills the vapor pool over a period of several days, amplifying the advected negative isotopic anomaly. In this way, Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O variations on intraseasonal timescales reflect contributions from both regional and local convective activity.\nThe close relationship between regional hydrology and Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O is most evident on interannual timescales, when weak to moderate El Ni\u00f1o events are associated with significantly higher rainfall \u03b4 18 O at Mulu, and vice versa during La Ni\u00f1a events. In this context, it is striking that Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O is a better indicator than local Mulu precipitation of basin-scale atmospheric circulation on interannual timescales. This reinforces the notion that water vapor \u03b4 18 O has an integrating effect, averaging the convective activity experienced during its transport history through both space and time. As such, the ENSO signal captured by Mulu rainfall \u03b4\nO reflects the sensitivity of Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O to regional climatic conditions on monthly timescales.\nO variability from nearby sites may indeed be highly correlated due to the integrative properties of rainfall \u03b4 18 O. This explains why stalagmite \u03b4 18 O records from caves that are hundreds of kilometers apart reflect the same regional-scale hydroclimate influences (e.g. Yuan et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2001 ). Likewise, well-reproduced cave stalagmite records from a single site can be interpreted as robust indicators of regional-scale hydroclimate variability (e.g. Partin et al., 2007) .\nWhen considering how to relate rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability to stalagmite calcite \u03b4 18 O variability, one must keep in mind that several processes mediate the cloud-to-calcite transformation of rainfall \u03b4\nO signals. First, the infiltration of rainwaters through the karst environment inevitably leads to some measure of signal attenuation from mixing, as well as signal delay depending on water residence times in the karst. In comparing several Mulu dripwater \u03b4 18 O timeseries with rainfall \u03b4 18 O timeseries, Cobb et al. (2007) argue for dripwater residence times of 2-3 months, based on the preservation of a weak seasonal cycle in dripwater \u03b4 18 O. However, owing to logistical difficulties in collecting timeseries of dripwater \u03b4 18 O from slow to ultra-slow drips that typically form stalagmites, residence time estimates for the most relevant drips remain poorly constrained. A new 5-yr-long timeseries of dripwater \u03b4 18 O from both fast and slow Mulu drips will help quantify groundwater transit times across a broad range of drip environments (Moerman et al., 2012) . A complementary approach involves pursuing a \"calibration\" of annual to sub-annual stalagmite \u03b4 18 O with climatic timeseries over the 20th century. The latter approach requires unusually fast-growing stalagmites and small chronological errors afforded by either annual layer counting and/or many U/Th dates (e.g. Black contour lines indicate 95% significance regions as determined by the student's t-test using effective degrees of freedom (Bretherton et al., 1999) .

(2009) with a north-south transect from southeast Asia to Indonesia. Such an approach could be used to investigate changes in the zonal convective gradient across the equatorial tropical Pacific. Networks such as these would provide important benchmarks for newly available paleoclimate simulations of coupled GCMs, some of which are equipped with water isotope modules (e.g. LeGrande et al., 2006; Sturm et al., 2010; Risi et al., 2010) . Such data-model comparisons provide an opportunity to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of global climate change on decadal to millennial timescales and how well these processes are represented in state-of-the-art climate models."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site description", "text": "Gunung Mulu National Park receives over 5 m of precipitation annually, which exhibits significant intraseasonal (30-90 days) and interannual variability. The vast majority of this precipitation is delivered by discrete convective events that typically occur in the afternoon. Since northern Borneo lies within the migration path of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) year-round, seasonal variations in precipitation at Mulu are weak. As a result, the climate of northern Borneo is primarily controlled by intraseasonal and interannual precipitation variability associated with the MJO and ENSO respectively, with strong ENSO phases producing annual precipitation anomalies of up to 750% (Bell and Halpert, 1998) . During El Nino events, anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SST) in the eastern and central tropical Pacific pull the center of deep atmospheric convection east of the Maritime continent (Rasmusson and Wallace, 1983) , decreasing convection across the WPWP (Fig. S1 ). Conversely, convective activity in the WPWP increases during La Ni\u00f1a events.

For the daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O collection (N \u00bc1203), rainfall was collected in a splayed-bottom rain gauge (Casella model M114003; 254 mm diameter; \u223c1 m above ground level) at the Mulu Meteorological Station headquartered at Mulu Airport (4.051N, 114.811E) and transferred to glass vials, leaving no headspace when precipitation amounts allowed, each morning at 8:00AM MYT. Precipitation amounts were logged at the same time-we refer to this timeseries as 'local Mulu precipitation' hereafter. Rainfall aliquots collected between July 2006 and February 2010 were stored in 4 mL glass vials with polyseal screw caps and sealed with parafilm. Aliquots collected from March 2010 onwards were stored in 3 mL glass serum vials and sealed with rubber stoppers and crimped aluminum closures, which provided a superior seal than the screw caps.\nThe use of an open-air rain gauge raises the possibility of isotopic enrichment of the rainfall samples by evaporation over the course of the day. To assess the impact of evaporative enrichment on rainfall isotopic values and to develop guidelines for identifying potentially affected samples, several quality control assessments were performed (see Supplemental Section for details). Based on the findings of these assessments, rainfall samples associated with precipitation amounts less than 1.6 mm were excluded from the final dataset. Evaporation within a vial with headspace represents another source of post-deposition enrichment. As a result, samples stored in vials that were less than 4/5 full were also excluded from the final dataset. Together, this resulted in the exclusion of 176 samples. An additional 23 samples collected in December 2006 were excluded due to documented sampling errors by Mulu personnel. In total, 199 rainfall \u03b4 18 O samples were excluded from the final dataset tally (N \u00bc 1004). The exclusion of these samples did not significantly alter the variability of the 5-yr timeseries (Fig. S5) .\nWe also conducted detailed rainfall sampling across a single precipitation event on March 7, 2010 at Camp 5 (4.141N, 114.891E), located approximately 12 km NE of Gunung Mulu National Park headquarters. Rainfall \u03b4 18 O samples were collected manually at one to four minute intervals (depending on rainfall intensity) throughout the event, for a total of 19 samples. The event lasted for approximately one hour, including a 20-min break in rainfall. Lacking any way to quantitatively measure rainfall rates at the remote field camp, we recorded relative rainfall intensity at the time of each sample collection, where '1' represented a light drizzle and '10' represented the heaviest of downpours.

Overall, however, the Mulu LMWL is indistinguishable from the GMWL, indicating that local post-condensation evaporation has minimal impact on cumulative daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O (Fig. 2 ).

The resulting 'depletion events' are marked by triangles along the upper x-axis of Fig. 3. A composite of the eighteen rainfall \u03b4 The systematic relationships between Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O, local Mulu precipitation, and OLR across the large rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion events imply that they share a common origin. Indeed, a Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of OLR confirms that the rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion events occur during or immediately after the passage of organized regional convective activity from west to east (Fig. 7) . The spatio-temporal signature of these OLR anomalies strongly resembles that of the MJO. Indeed, the majority of rainfall \u03b4 18 O depletion events do coincide with defined active (i.e. wet) phases of the MJO (Table S1 ). We conclude that the MJO strongly influences the intraseasonal variability of Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O and contributes to a \"regional\" amount effect relationship at intraseasonal timescales, as inferred by Cobb et al. (2007) . In this case, the \"regional\" amount effect derives from the advection of depleted water vapor from regions to the west (upstream) of Mulu. O values reveal a weak semi-annual seasonal cycle with an amplitude of \u223c2-3\u2030 that accounts for roughly 20% of the total variance in monthly rainfall \u03b4 18 O (Fig. 8) .

As such, any changes over time in the background state of regional-scale hydrology, such as variability in the strength and/or location of deep convection in the WPWP, would likely impact rainfall \u03b4 18 O at Mulu. More generally, the ability of rainfall 18 O to integrate regional convective activity across space and time makes it a much better indicator of large-scale hydrology than local precipitation amount, which contains much more noise. Therefore, while precipitation variability from nearby sites may be poorly correlated (Dayem et al., 2010) , rainfall \u03b4"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our analyses demonstrate that the inverse relationship between rainfall \u03b4 18 O and precipitation amount, known as the amount effect, is a strong control on the oxygen isotopic composition of rainfall in northern Borneo over the majority of the timescales examined. Studying a single precipitation event at high temporal resolution, we find evidence for local fractionation processes driving intra-storm rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability, whereas the majority of diurnal to interannual rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability originates from regional-scale hydrological processes. Daily rainfall \u03b4 18 O variations best reflect cumulative regional precipitation occurring over the preceding week. Intraseasonal rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability, which is particularly large at our site with up to \u223c16\u2030 shifts, is closely associated with the MJO -the dominant mode of intraseasonal climatic variability in the tropics -and exhibits influences from both local and farfield fractionation processes. Interannual rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability at Mulu is significantly correlated to ENSO, whereby a basinscale reorganization of atmospheric circulation patterns during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events affects regional convective activity and in turn the regional isotopic composition of the atmospheric water vapor. In this context, Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O is superior to local Mulu precipitation amount as a proxy for ENSO variability.\nOur study documents a robust amount effect relationship between regional precipitation and Mulu rainfall \u03b4 18 O that is most evident at intraseasonal and interannual timescales. Our results lend strong support to the interpretation of \u03b4 18 O-based reconstructions from northern Borneo stalagmites as regional hydroclimate proxies, with significant influences from intraseasonal and interannual variability, and to a lesser extent, seasonal variability. More generally, our study illustrates that the processes governing the climate-rainfall \u03b4 18 O relationship are space-and timedependent. As such, our results support the generation of multiyear, daily-resolved timeseries of rainfall isotopes in order to identify the dynamical controls on rainfall \u03b4 18 O variability at sites where accurate interpretations of paleoclimate \u03b4 18 O reconstructions are especially critical."}]
