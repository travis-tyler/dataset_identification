Compared with the common APOE \u03b53 allele, \u03b54 increases the risk and lowers the age at onset (AAO) of AD in a dose-dependent fashion whereas the \u03b52 allele confers a protective benefit. 1, 2 Although the frequency of \u03b54 varies among different ethnic groups, the \u03b54/AD association is evident in diverse populations, 3 with a few notable exceptions. [4] [5] [6] The strength of the association is greatly influenced by age and sex. 3 Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly reported association signals in APOE and genes in its vicinity, [7] [8] [9] but the evidence favoring additional AD risk variants in this region is much weaker after accounting for the strong linkage disequilibrium that extends over 3 Mb including these other proposed AD loci. 8 Nonetheless, interest in this region remains high because several of these genes have a plausible role in AD pathogenesis.\nRoses et al 10 reported an association between a variable length poly-T polymorphism (\"poly-T\") at rs10524523 in the gene encoding the channel-forming subunit of the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOMM40) and risk for and AAO of AD. These investigators used an evolutionary network approach to build phylogenies that provided evidence of selection for variable lengths of the poly-T repeats between cases and controls. The number of poly-T repeats at the rs10524523 locus were grouped into 3 alleles consisting of short (s) (\u03fd21), long (l) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) , and very long (v) (\u054630). Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the APOE \u03b54 allele tracks with the l allele, whereas the APOE \u03b53 allele tracks with the s and v alleles. The l allele was associated with a 7-year earlier AAO of AD in a small sample (N=34) of APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 subjects. Support for an independent role of TOMM40 in AD was obtained from a study showing association of the v/v genotype with lower performance on learning and lower gray matter volume among 117 APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 adults. 11 A more recent study of this polymorphism in a much larger sample failed to confirm the original findings after adjusting for the effect of APOE \u03b54. 12 In this study, we conducted a comprehensive association study of AD with markers in the APOE region using data from nearly 23 000 subjects assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) for a GWAS that identified several new AD risk loci. 8 We also evaluated association with the TOMM40 poly-T polymorphism by direct genotyping of 1256 AD cases and 1605 controls and by analysis in the entire GWAS data set of several poly-T proxy single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY POPULATION", "text": "The primary sample used was 15 GWAS data sets assembled by the ADGC.

This assay used a polymerase chain reaction primer set (Ch19_50094815-F: VIC-GCTGACCTCAAGCTGTCCTC that labeled with VIC fluorescent dye and Ch19_50095061-R: GGAGGGACAGGGAAAGAAAA) to amplify a 247-base pair fragment from each subject's genomic DNA. For each polymerase chain reaction, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 12\u00b5M primers, 3.75 \u00b5L of Qiagen HotStarTaq Master Mix (Qiagen), and 1mM magnesium chloride were mixed together with a final volume of 7.5 \u00b5L.

Precise length of the amplified fragments was acquired through an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and processed with ABI GeneMapper version 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). To increase calling accuracy of poly-T counts of each fragment, we also cloned the same genomic fragments of 4 control poly-T variants (ie, 13xT, 16xT, 22xT, and 35xT) into a DNA vector (pBluescript; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used them as internal controls to create bins for fragment size standards. Integrity of the bins was further validated by genotyping poly-T inserts from plasmid combinations (eg, 16 plus 22, 16 plus 35, and 22 plus 35). Spacing of the bins was then fine-tuned accordingly. Typically, each allele was associated with a series of peaks and the highest peak in the series was assigned as the allele of interest. Thus, homozygous and heterozygous individuals will have either 1 or 2 alleles, respectively. The final calling of poly-T counts was then determined via manual inspection and cross-checking of the electropherograms.\nAs a check on genotyping accuracy, we genotyped 352 samples from the NIA Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study included in a previous study of the poly-T polymorphism. 12 There were no discrepancies between the 2 laboratories in calling the s, l, and v alleles. In addition, there was complete agreement in the genotypes for 90 ADNI subjects included in this and the Cruchaga et al 12 studies.

We also tested genotype models assigning v/v as the reference genotype. Linear regression was used to test association of poly-T with AAO in the case sample. Models for AD risk included covariates for population substructure within data sets, age (AAO or age at death if deceased and AAO unknown in cases; age at last examination or death in controls), and sex. Population substructure and sex were included in models for AAO. The influence of APOE on the associations with poly-T was evaluated in 2 ways. In the first approach, an additive model with a term for the number of APOE \u03b54 alleles (0, 1, or 2) was added to the models. Significant SNPs were further evaluated in models including APOE genotype as a covariate and randomeffects models allowing for heterogeneity of the association among data sets. In the second approach, models were evaluated in APOE genotype subgroups; conversely, we assessed the effect of the APOE \u03b54 allele within the poly-T subgroups. To capture information about association with poly-T in other ADGC data sets, we tested association with genotyped SNPs that were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2 \u05460.8) with rs10524523. All regression analyses were conducted using the R statistical package in each data set separately, and the results were meta-analyzed using an inverse-variance method as implemented in the package METAL. 20 The respective influences of the APOE and poly-T loci on AAO were also evaluated by comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves derived using R for subgroups of AD cases defined by APOE and poly-T genotypes.

The mean AAO in the ACT cohort was about 12 years higher (83.8 years) than that in the ADC (71.2 years) and ADNI (71.7 years) cohorts. The distribution of the poly-T lengths within each APOE genotype subgroup was comparable with the corresponding distributions reported in the original study, 10 and these patterns were similar across data sets (eFigure 1, http: //www.archneurol.com). Nearly all subjects with the s/s or s/v genotypes had APOE genotypes \u03b53/\u03b53 or \u03b52/\u03b53 (eTable 1). Similarly, there was a very high correlation between heterozygosity for the \u03b54 and l alleles, and nearly all l homozygotes were homozygous for \u03b54 (Figure 1) .\nWithout adjustment for APOE \u03b54, the poly-T l allele was significantly associated with increased AD risk (metaanalysis P value [meta-P] = 3.9 \u03eb 10 \u221233 ), whereas the other alleles were protective (meta-P value: s = 5.9 \u03eb 10 \u22128 and v = 1.9 \u03eb 10 \u22128 ) ( Table 2 and eTable 2). The dosage of the l allele was associated with an increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% CI, 2.39-3.36), while those of the s and v alleles were protective (s: OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61-0.79; v: OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.78). However, the effect of the l allele on AD risk was greatly diminished after adjustment for the APOE \u03b54 allele (meta-P = .02; OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.09-2.65) and not significant in the \u03b53/\u03b53 subgroup (meta-P = .45), suggesting that risk of AD is influenced directly and specifically by APOE geno- type and not the poly-T genotype. The apparent lack of association of \u03b54 with AD risk in the l-negative subgroup and l with AD in the \u03b54-negative subgroup is explained by the observation that virtually all persons with the \u03b54 allele also had the l allele. Thus, because very few AD cases and controls had \u03b54 but not the l allele, these particular association tests have very little power. Analogously, there was evidence of significant association of the l allele with AAO in the combined sample (meta-P = 1.0 \u03eb 10 \u22128 ) and within each data set without accounting for the number of APOE \u03b54 alleles (Table 2 and eTable 3). These data show that each dose of the l allele is associated with a 2-year earlier onset of AD symptoms. However, this association was no longer significant after conditioning on the number of APOE \u03b54 alleles (meta-P = .12). Specificity of the association of AAO with APOE was supported by the lack of association with the l allele in the subgroup lacking \u03b54 (meta-P = .87) and evidence for a moderate association with the \u03b54 allele in the subgroup lacking the l allele (meta-P = .022) (eTable 2 and eTable 3). These results suggest that APOE \u03b54 has an effect on AAO independent of the TOMM40 poly-T l allele, whereas the association of the poly-T polymorphism is more likely due to confounding with APOE.\nThe effect of poly-T on AAO was further examined by survival analysis in each data set (Figure 2 ). Among subjects with AD in the l-negative subgroup, the \u03b54 allele showed a trend of association with earlier onset, but the effect of the l allele among subjects lacking \u03b54 was inconclusive because of a small sample size (Figure 2A , C, and E). There were no distinguishable differences in AAO according to poly-T genotype among \u03b53/\u03b53 subjects with AD, which is not surprising because few of these individuals had an l allele ( Figure 2B, D, and F) .\nEvaluation of the LD structure in this region revealed that in each data set rs10524523 was strongly correlated only with SNPs in the interval including TOMM40 and APOE (eFigure 2). We identified 5 SNPs (rs157580, rs2075650, rs8106922, rs405509, and rs439401) in high LD with rs10524523 (eFigure 2) and thus considered these SNPs as proxies for poly-T in analyses in the other ADGC data sets, which were not genotyped for rs10524523. None of these SNPs was significantly associated with AD or AAO after adjustment for APOE \u03b54 ( Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "ASSOCIATION OF AD WITH SNPs THROUGHOUT THE APOE REGION", "text": "To evaluate the hypothesis that multiple loci in the APOE region influence risk or AAO of AD, we tested association using the entire ADGC sample (eTable 4) with all SNPs spanning the 800-kb region surrounding APOE that encompasses previously reported genome-wide significant findings in several genes. 21 Eight SNPs spanning the entire region were significantly associated with AD risk at P \u03fd .001 in models adjusting for the number of APOE \u03b54 alleles, and one of these results (rs445925 located between APOE and APOC1) was genome-wide significant (P = 4.1 \u03eb 10 \u221211 ). However, significance of these results was greatly diminished after taking into account heterogeneity across data sets and APOE genotypes including the \u03b52 allele ( Table 4 ). In the model including all APOE genotypes, nominal significance was observed for 3 SNPs (rs29651, P = .04; rs37451, P = .0063; and rs20756, P = .01), but none of these results remained significant after correcting for the number of tests.

We were unable to replicate the original finding in models adjusting for APOE genotype or in subgroups stratified by APOE genotype, even though we used a much larger data set than others published to date. This result is consistent with negative findings in several other recent studies. 12, [22] [23] [24] [25] Moreover, association findings were also negative for 5 SNPs in high LD with rs10524523 evaluated in the entire ADGC GWAS sample. Although Cruchaga et al 12 found a significantly lower frequency of the rs10524523 v allele in cases compared with controls among APOE \u03b53 homozygotes in a large case-control series, the effect was in the opposite direction as reported in the original study. 10 In our study, there was no effect in either direction for s/s homozygotes with an APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype. In a subset of 733 subjects from the Cruchaga et al study, there was no evidence of association of rs10524523 with cerebrospinal fluid tau or \u2424-amyloid 42 levels. 12 Johnson et al 11 reported an association of rs10524523 with lower performance on learning tests and with decreasing gray matter volume in a brain region affected early in AD development in a small sample of APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 adult children of subjects with AD, but a study of a larger community-based cohort between the ages of 79 and 87 years was unable to disentangle the confounding effects of the rs10524523 l allele and APOE \u03b54 on poorer performance of verbal memory and abstract reasoning. 26 Since the association of AD with APOE was established nearly 2 decades ago, 1,2 numerous studies have reported significant associations with other genes in the region surrounding APOE, [27] [28] [29] whereas other studies concluded that these findings are not true independent contributors to AD risk. 30, 31 Attempts to resolve this controversy have been complicated by very strong LD in this region, which contains many biologically plausible candidate genes. 25, 29 However, further insight regarding multiple independent association signals can be obtained from analyses in other populations (eg, those of black African descent) having a narrower LD structure in the APOE region. Tycko et al 32 excluded independent influence of APOE or APOC1 promoter polymorphisms on risk of AD in samples of African American and Caribbean Hispanic individuals. Logue et al 33 identified highly significant associations of AD with 3 markers within 25 kb of APOE including PVRL2 SNP rs6859 (P = 5.39x10 \u22127 ) and TOMM40 SNPs rs157582 (P = 3.26x10 \u22126 ) and rs10119 (P = 5.95x10 \u22127 ) in a sample of 513 well-characterized African American AD cases and 504 ethnically matched cognitively normal controls. However, only rs6859 remained nominally significant (P = .008) after adjustment for APOE genotype, which was very strongly associated with AD (P = 9.69x10 \u221223 ). Our study has several strengths that lead to more conclusive findings than previous association studies of genes in the APOE region. First, genotypes for the APOE isoforms in all ADGC data sets were determined directly using robust methods, 8 rather than by inference using imputed genotypes for the 2 SNPs that determine APOE genotype. The genotype for 1 of the APOE SNPs (rs429538) imputed in the ADGC data sets using the 1000 Genomes reference panel (October 2011; release ICHG2011) was only modestly correlated (r 2 about 0.5) with the actual APOE genotype (data not presented). Second, our sample size is several-fold larger than those in any previous study of this issue and had sufficient power to detect associations with ORs of 1.2 or greater. 21 Thus, even if there were other loci in this region independent of APOE that influenced AD risk or AAO, we would have detected a signal whereas smaller studies probably could not. Third, we conducted a comprehensive examination of all markers in the region, including the poly-T repeat in TOMM40, and tested multiple models to address confounding with APOE.\nAlthough there is some evidence from gene expression, cell biology, and immunohistochemistry studies supporting a connection of AD to the immediate neighbors of APOE including PVRL2, TOMM40 and APOC1, 31, [34] [35] [36] results of our study weigh heavily against the hypothesis of inherited susceptibility to AD due to common variation in genes in the APOE region other than APOE.
