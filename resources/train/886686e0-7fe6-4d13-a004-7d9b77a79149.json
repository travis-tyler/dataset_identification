To date, clinical trials of AD therapies have been largely unsuccessful [1] . Several factors are thought to contribute to these failures, including incorrect target selection and poor trial design [1, 2] . As AD is a condition associated with the aging population, diseasemodifying treatments aimed at slowing the rate of progression toward AD would have considerable impact in reducing the social and economic burden of this disease worldwide.\nMathematical and statistical models of AD progression are increasingly focused on modeling the disease as a continuum of cognitive states toward AD [3] [4] [5] [6] . We have previously presented a 3-state model that describes disease progression from cognitively normal (CN) to a mild cognitively impaired (MCI) state and an AD state [7] . In addition, other models have been developed to include substates of mild, moderate, or severe AD and also those that focus on biomarker [8] or cognitive and functional states [4, 5] . Most of these models have been developed to describe progression rates using transition probabilities that have been derived from a single data set using a range of different statistical and epidemiological methods. However, there remains a need for convincing results, which have been generated from individual studies that are applicable to other data sets or to a general population. A meta-analysis by Neu et al. [9] compared the odds ratios for the risk of developing disease with the risk factors such as age, sex, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE \u03b54) from 27 independent research studies and found wide differences in the estimates for developing MCI and AD. Furthermore, a study by Qian et al. [10] which compared risk estimates for the incidence of MCI or dementia among cognitively unimpaired individuals stratified by APOE \u03b54 and age found that, while the effect of age and APOE \u03b54 was consistent between studies, there were differences in the cumulative incidence of AD between the data sets.\nIn this study, we calculate and compare transition probabilities from six data sets namely the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), AddNeuroMed, Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging study (ADNI), BIOCARD: Predictors of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals (BIOCARD), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), which represent 22,993 individuals with 2639 reported cases of dementia when combined. We use these probabilities to inform stochastic simulations of AD progression that are based on a Markov model. In particular, we simulate the progression from CN to AD in an artificial population and compare the results to a subset of the Cardiovascular Heart Study (CHS) cohort. The key strength of this work is the calculation of transition probabilities from a large number of data sets using identical data analysis protocols. This allows us to eliminate heterogeneity in results that arise as a result of using different statistical methods between data sets."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "2.1.

These variables were time between visits, age, Age^2, Age^3, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, gender, and current diagnostic group (CN or MCI). We used GLMMs to estimate the odds ratios for progression to the next (more severe disease) state within the data sets using six distinct combinations of the available variables (Table 1) and estimating their parameters using each of the six data sets (Supplementary Table 1 ). Although it is widely considered to be a modifier of risk, education was excluded from our study due to inconsistencies in data availability and methodology of measuring level of education within the different data sets. However, of the five data sets in which education could be compared, no significant association was found with the rate of transition (Supplementary Table 2) . We used the model deviance to select the model that was the best universal fit to the data sets. For data sets AIBL, AddNeuroMed, BIOCARD, and FHS, the model with the lowest deviance contained time between visits, gender, diagnostic group, age^2, and the interaction between age^2 and diagnostic group (Supplementary Table 1 , Model 3). For ADNI and NACC, the best fitting model contained time between visits, gender, diagnostic group, age, and the interaction between age and the diagnostic group (Supplementary  Table 1 , Model 2). For ADNI and NACC, the relative difference in deviance between model 2 and model 3 was minimal compared with the other data sets. Thus, to preserve homogeneity between analysis methods, we determined that model 3 was the most appropriate model for calculating "}, {"section_title": "1) Sample parameter values from the MCMC chains generated during es\u019fma\u019fon", "text": "2) Sample the characteris\u019fcs of the baseline popula\u019fon based on prespecified demographic distribu\u019fons the 12-month probability of transitioning toward AD, in the multiple data sets that were examined. It should be noted that deviances could not be statistically compared since the models were not nested.\nSubsequently, we calculated transition probabilities for rates of progression toward AD using model 3. In this model, the term representing time between visits significantly increased the likelihood of transitioning to a more severe diagnostic state in the data sets that had a longer average time span between visits (i.e., in ADNI, BIO-CARD, FHS, and NACC [P , .001]). The odds ratio for an increase of one year in the time-between-visits variable in these four data sets ranged from 1.24 in FHS to 1.87 in ADNI (Supplementary Table 1 ). The probability of progressing toward AD increased with Age^2, and as expected, the highest odds ratio in all data sets was associated with the Age^2 term; however, this was significantly reduced in individuals who were already diagnosed with MCI. In other words, individuals are more likely to transition from MCI to AD than they are from CN to MCI (i.e., acceleration of disease progression clinically). This effect appears to be less pronounced as individuals enter the oldest ages. APOE \u03b54 carriage (heterozygous or homozygous) confers significantly increased risk in every data set, except for AIBL where the odds ratio is positive but nonsignificant (odds ratio [OR], 1.138; P 5 .741). Only NACC demonstrated an effect of gender, with females less likely to transition to a more severe state (OR, 0.820; P , .001). The transition probabilities are displayed graphically in Fig. 2.

We first created a virtual population by sampling demographic variables using the baseline distribution from those in the CHS study who were CN at baseline and remained in the study for 6 years. This study was not included in our estimation of transition probabilities (Supplementary Table 3 ). Following this, we calculated 12-month transition probabilities, adjusting for the known risk factors that were shared between the cohorts, and the results are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The 10-year cumulative AD incidence rates in the simulations range from 15.4% using AIBL-derived probabilities to 32.0% using probabilities derived from AddNeuroMed. The biggest variation in incidence rate predictions came from AddNeuroMed and BIOCARD, and the smallest came from AIBL, FHS, and NACC (Fig. 3A) . We then compared these results to the actual incidence rates in the CHS population from which the baseline demographics were derived (Fig. 3B) . We found that the predictions made using the AddNeuroMed-derived transition probabilities overestimated the incidence rate in a generalized population. The best predictions were made using ADNI-, BIOCARD-, and FHS-derived transition probabilities, with NACC and AIBL both underestimating the incidence rate."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we have presented a comparison of the odds ratios and the rate of transitioning through the cognitive decline spectrum in AD for multiple data sets, using a standardized analysis method. Our results highlight the vast differences in odds ratios and 12-month transition probabilities determined from six major AD cohorts. However, it provides a tool or platform that can be used to further understand the reasons behind these differences.\nWe acknowledge that the studies considered here differ greatly in design especially in the criteria for subject recruitment. We, therefore, accept that methods that may be ideal for one study may be not optimal for another. However, the purpose of the present study was not to model transition probabilities as accurately as possible within specific studies but to begin eliminating the variability that is introduced using different methods for their calculation. Moreover, standardized analyses also highlight which design aspects and data characteristics of cohort studies should be considered when conducting more detailed analyses on a single study basis.\nQian et al. [10] have previously identified differences in odds ratios and cumulative incidence rates between studies through meta-analyses. However, the study could only estimate lifetime incidence for individuals that had a maximum age within the 80-85 years age band and only for two data sets. From the calculation of transition probabilities using continuous age as a risk factor, we found that the probability of developing AD increases substantially from age 80 in the three largest data sets, all of which had a large number of patients from individuals older than 80 years ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). We considered age (Age, Age^2, and Age^3), current diagnostic state (CN or MCI), APOE \u03b54 carrier status (positive for at least one allele or negative), and gender as potential risk factors for developing AD. These were based on measures that were shared between the data sets, and as expected, we identified age as the most significant risk factor. Combinations of Age, Age^2, and Age^3 were significantly associated with an increase in the risk of transitioning from CN to MCI in all data sets. However, the effect of age on the transition from MCI to AD is unclear because the interaction between age and diagnosis had differential effects, both between models and data sets under the same model. An important extension of this work would be to perform the same analysis using a well-defined metric of biological age such as those proposed by Belsky et al., Gott et al., and Petkovich et al. [23] [24] [25] in place of age. If the variables required for predicting biological age were measured in a variety of data sets, combined with exploring differential clinical endpoints, it should be possible to define suitable endpoints that could be agreed upon within the Alzheimer's research field.\nThe results presented here also demonstrate which of the six data sets analyzed are suitable for combining in a pooled analysis to increase sample size and therefore the robustness of inferences drawn from analyses. For example, ADNI, BIOCARD, and NACC have similar transition probabilities with respect to age.\nBy using simulation to extend these results, we found that the cumulative incidence of AD in a standardized population differed with a magnitude greater than the variability within cohort data sets (Fig. 3B) . Of considerable Predicted incidence rates in a generalized population. Two hundred parameter samples from each data set were generated and simulated 500 times to produce a range of estimates of the incidence rate of AD in a population that was cognitively normal at baseline and had demographics similar to that from CHS. Shown are mean from each parameter sample (A) and population level means (B interest is the observation that the probabilities generated from ADNI, a so-called \"convenience cohort\", better predicted incidence in a standardized population than community-based studies such as FHS. A possible reason for this is that factors such as education and biomarker values that were not included in the model could be more similar between ADNI and CHS than between FHS and CHS; however, both data sets provide an adequate job estimate of the CHS probabilities. Furthermore, because we are using only individuals that are retained for 16 years in CHS rather than the full population, it is possible that the incidence rates reported are increased from what would be expected in a general population. Additionally, from the transition probabilities recorded in Fig. 2 , it appears that individuals in the convenience cohort transition more quickly than individuals in FHS at younger ages but slower at older ages. Thus, it is plausible that the incidence rates in ADNI and FHS are similar because of a balance between the two sets of probabilities over time.\nThe statistical approach in using GLMMs rather than observed transition rates stratified by confounding factors increases sample size and allows for the inclusion of multiple risk factors both independently and combined. This approach also allows us to consider the population-level effects as well as quantify variance at the individual level. While we also acknowledge significant limitations to using diagnostic state as an endpoint for our analysis, it is important to note that there is no currently agreed upon gold standard endpoint in the AD field to use in its place as yet.\nThese results have important implications for both clinical trial design and public health policies. First, they highlight the degree to which incidence varies between seemingly similar populations. All the data sets included in this study comprised of individuals in the United States and Canada, demographic factors of which were accounted for in the calculation of the transition probabilities. Furthermore, this study highlights the considerable increase in the probability of developing AD in individuals older than 80 years compared with younger individuals. Another important conclusion arising from this work is that when predicting how interventions might impact the general population, a variety of data sets should be used to produce more reliable results of what is the background likelihood of transitioning between disease states in the control untreated group. For example, the work by Davis et al. [4] predicted that a 20% reduction in the number of MCI cases due to AD would translate to a 5% difference in AD cases in NACC. However, it is unclear if this would still be the case in a population such as FHS or ADNI where the rate of developing MCI was generally higher, but the rate of converting from MCI to AD was lower in older age groups.\nAn important future extension to this work would be to repeat this analysis with a wider range of data sets, incorporating some of the developing cohort studies from non-US sites such as Chariot-Pro (UK), the Gothenburg Study, and the Rotterdam cohort study [26] ."}]
