[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Biological sex is one of the major anthropometric factors which influences 21 physiology, metabolism and health status. We have investigated the effect of sexual 22 dimorphism on the blood lipidome profile in three large population level studies -the 23 Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative -ADNI (n =806), the GeneBank 24 Functional Cardio-Metabolomics cohort (n= 1015) and the Genetics of Lipid lowering 25\nDrugs and Diet Network -GOLDN (n=422). In total, 355 unique lipids from 15 lipid 26 classes were detected across all three studies using LC-MS. Sixty percent of these 27 lipids differed between men and women in all three cohorts, and up to 87% of all 28 lipids demonstrated sex differences in at least one cohort. ChemRICH enrichment 29 statistics on lipid classes showed that phosphatidylcholines, 30 phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, ceramides, sphingomyelins and 31 cholesterol esters were found at higher levels in female subjects while 32 triacylglycerols and lysophosphatidylcholines were found at higher levels in male 33 participants across the three cohorts. This strong sex effect on the blood lipidome 34\nsuggests that specific regulatory mechanisms may exist that regulate lipid 35 metabolism in a different manner between men and women. Cohort studies involving 36 blood lipidomics should consider separate analyses for male and female participants 37 instead of combined analyses treating sex as a confounding factor. 38 39 phospholipids, triacylglycerol 40 41\nDifferences between the sexes are one of the fundamental variations in biology [1]. 43\nSex disparities in research can ignore discoveries of the biological mechanisms that 44 are specific to particular sex, leading to missing opportunities in developing new sex-45 specific therapeutic strategies[2]. Sex differences have been observed for gut 46 microbiota[3] and transcriptome [4], suggesting that sex-specific strategies for health 47 improvement are needed. 48\nMetabolomics has been validated for molecular epidemiology to discover risk factors 49 and biological mechanisms for diseases. Several epidemiological studies have 50 investigated biological sex as a main factor to define a person's metabolome. 51\nDifferential network analysis of metabolomics data for 844 healthy subjects 52 suggested a sex-related variability in branched chain amino acids, ketone bodies, All lipid classes were found to be significantly different between men and women in 131 at least one cohort. The most drastic effects were observed for sphingomyelins, 132 triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholines in the GOLDN and the GeneBank cohorts. 133\nTriacylglycerols and lysophosphatidylcholines were consistently higher in men 134 across the three cohorts.

Metabolomics 58 analysis of 1,756 participants from the KORA F4 study showed that almost 33% of 59 the 507 metabolites were significant different between men and women. The study 60\nsuggested changes in steroid metabolism, fatty acid, amino acids, purine and 61 dipeptide metabolism differed between the sexes and suggested that a sex-62 regulated metabolic modules can be identified in the partial correlation network 63 among metabolites [7] . The cross-sectional KarMeN (Karlsruhe Metabolomics and 64 Nutrition) study included 301 participants, yielding a metabolomics dataset that 65 predicted sex descriptors from blood specimen [8] . In a study on 60 subjects it was 66 found that levels of sphingomyelins were higher in women in comparison to men in 67 serum and plasma samples [9] . The study also reported that levels of triacylglycerols 68\nwere higher in elderly than in younger women. Higher levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, total 69 cholesterol, sphingomyelins and C22:6 fatty acyl-containing phospholipids were 70 observed in women [10] . Similarly, women had higher levels of sphingomyelins and 71 phosphatidylcholines in a French study of 800 participants. In this study, branched 72 chain amino acids and lysophosphatidylcholines were also found to be higher in 73 males [11] . These previous studies highlight the importance of sexual dimorphism in 74 metabolic regulation for lipids and other metabolite levels.\nWe here report on the effect of sex descriptors on a comprehensive panel of 355 76 blood lipids from 15 lipid classes in three large cohorts with the largest comparison 77 to date with 2,243 subjects in total. These cohorts included the Genetics of Lipid 78\nLowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) (n = 422), GeneBank, Cleveland Clinic 79 (n= 1,015), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 806). 80\nWe have used univariate statistics and chemical similarity enrichment analysis to 81 highlight the strong sex effect on the detected lipids. 82 normalization method using the SERRF tool [12] removed technical variance to as 96 low as 2-6% relative standard deviation across all studies, using BioreclamationIVT 97 Supplementary Table S1 ). 99"}, {"section_title": "Results 83", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohort summaries and lipidomics datasets 84", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Significantly associated individual lipids 100", "text": "Up to 87% of all lipids were found to be significantly different (p<0.05) between men 101 and women in at least one cohort study using the raw p-values of the Mann-Whitney 102 U test.

We found that saturated fatty acids were higher in men while 155 unsaturated fatty acids were higher in women in all three cohorts. 156"}, {"section_title": "Discussion 157", "text": "In comparison to earlier metabolomics studies, we have expanded the sexual 158 dimorphism analysis of blood lipidome with using a comprehensive panel and larger 159 studies. Several new lipids classes were found to be under strong impact of sexual 160 dimorphism. We have replicated the previous finding that levels of sphingomyelins 161 and phosphatidylcholines were elevated in women [9, 10] while 162 lysophosphatidylcholines and acylcarnitines were found at higher concentrations in 163 men [6, 11] . We also observed differences in triacylglycerol levels in the ADNI study 164 between women and men that could possibly be due to biological age[9], while these 165 differences was absent in comparatively younger participants of the GOLDN and the 166 GeneBank cohort . The most significant lipid clusters included SM, PC, TG, p-PC, 167\nLPC and FA lipids in all three cohorts. We found new sex-regulated classes including 168 phosphatidylinositols, plasmalogens, and ceramides. Plasmalogen biosynthesis has 169 been linked with male fertility [13] . It has been previously shown that the hepatic ceramide biosynthesis is regulated by sex hormones, including testosterone [14] . 171\nDifferences in lipids between both sexes may suggest that sex specific remodeling 172 of lipid metabolism is a fundamental biological process and calls for further studies 173 to discover the underlying mechanisms that can create a basis for developing sex 174 specific disease prevention strategies. A schema of different metabolic pathways for complex lipids is shown in Figure 4 . 199\nOur results show a consistently higher ratio of PC to LPC lipids in women compared 200 to men. This ratio likely indicates a higher activity of phospholipases in men to cleave 201 fatty acyl groups from PC membrane lipids to LPC lipid species. We also found 202 higher levels of PC and SM lipids in women, along with lower amounts of ceramides. 203\nThese three lipid classes intersect in their biochemical pathway and may directly 204 support the idea of higher sphingomyelin synthase activity in women (Figure 4) . 205\nBoth phospholipases and sphingomyelin synthase are discussed as master 206 regulators of lipid metabolism [15] [16] [17] . These enzyme activities could be validated in 207 animal models to identify the specific organs that are contributing to the sexual 208 dimorphism of lipid differences, using functional genomics analysis to construct a 209 sex-specific metabolic network and to map regulatory mechanisms. Combining 210 metabolomics, lipidomics and genomics assays in follow-up studies should be used 211 to further discern the relative contributions from endogenous lipid remodeling versus 212 contributions from diet and exercise. 213\nThe strong sex effects observed in our study suggests that in epidemiological 214 studies, statistical analyses for lipidomics data should considered separately for men 215 and women. We argue against using sex as a confounding or co-variate for 216 regression models to mask the sex-regulated biology. Instead results should be 217 interpreted separately for male and female participants. These drastic sex-regulated differences in the blood lipidome have implications on large epidemiological studies 219 to identify the lipids that can be risk factors for chronic and aging associated 220 disorders. We have observed different patterns for men and women of utilization of 221 saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids, but further studies are needed on 222 remodeling of acyl chains within specific classes of complex lipid [18] . 223\nWe have looked into three cohorts that have differences in terms of participant's age, 224\ncomorbidities, diet and medication usage. Variations in these factors may affect the 225 lipid differences that are associated with sex. One has to consider the impact of 226 monitored, and non-monitored differences in the cohorts examined on the observed 227 results, and additional studies and verification are required. Even though, we have 228 observed remarkable p-values for few sphingomyelins, the sex-effect for these lipids 229 should be checked in other epidemiological cohorts. Nonetheless, our study argue 230 that sex specific differences should be considered in future lipidomic examinations 231 during both study design, and analyses. 232"}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods 233", "text": "Cohort 1.

After every ten 299 cohort samples, one BioreclamationIVT pooled plasma QC sample was analyzed. 300\nTargeted signal extraction and data generation: Raw LC-MS data files were 301 converted to the mzML format using the Proteowizard MS Convert utility. These files 302 were imported in R using the mzR package. A database of validated lipids that were 303 routinely detected in blood samples has been compiled at the West Coast 304\nMetabolomics Center over the past seven years. In this database, annotated lipids 305 are associated with retention time, adducts, m/z value and InChI keys, verified by accurate mass, isotope ratio, retention time and MS/MS spectra matching to either 307 commercial lipid standards or to the LipidBlast library [23] . In the database, ESI 308 positive mode had 515 RT-m/z values and ESI negative mode had 457 RT-309 m/z values [22] . Using the retention time-mass-to-charge ratio, RT-m/z database as 310 a targeted list, we extracted the ion chromatograms (EICs) for all m/z values using 311 R software with a targeted signal extraction strategy, stretching a range of \u00b10.5 min 312 of the target retention time for each m/z value and to obtain the peak height values 313 for all lipids. No peak smoothing or integration method was applied to the EICs. To 314 address retention time drifts between cohorts and among all samples of each cohort 315 study, retention times of the internal standards were obtained for each sample using 316 a \u00b1 0.2 min retention time window to find the peak apexes of the internal standards. 317\nA polynomial regression of second order (quadratic) curve was fitted between the 318 expected and observed retention times of the internal standards. The retention times 319 of the remaining compounds in the target database were recalibrated using the 320 regression model. The updated retention times were used with a window of 0.15 min 321 for each metabolite to extract the m/z intensities values belonging to that ion. 322\nMaximum intensity values within the retention time window were used as the peak 323 height of the target compounds. Data were normalized using quality control pool 324 samples that were interjected between every 10 subject samples during data 325 acquisition.
