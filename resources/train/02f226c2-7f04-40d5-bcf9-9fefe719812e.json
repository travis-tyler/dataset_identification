[25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] These poor outcomes may be due in part to lower procedure volumes. 20, 21, 27, 29, [32] [33] [34] The extent to which providers in different specialties perform colonoscopies in the general population is unknown. Yet, changes in the distribution of provider specialties performing colonoscopy, the complexity, duration and adequacy of supervised training, and the volume of colonoscopies performed could have a downstream influence on colonoscopy quality. 27, 34, 35 Our study aimed to examine the extent to which colonoscopy providers of different specialties perform colonoscopies in South Carolina (SC), a state that serves a large, rural population (34% based on 2010 Census 36 ), which may present unique challenges to the provision of high-quality colonoscopies. We also examined geographic and temporal variation in practice settings (hospital vs ambulatory surgery centers [ASCs]) and annual procedure volume by physician medical specialty."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "South Carolina has mandatory, population-based reporting for all visits to emergency departments, hospitals, and ASCs. Because reporting of all visits is required by legislation, data are not restricted to specific payers or age groups. To determine the number and type of providers providing colonoscopy, we used outpatient data from the SC Ambulatory Surgery Discharge database (which includes hospitals and free-standing ASCs), restricted to individuals 50-74 years of age who underwent a colonoscopy between 2001 and 2010, in order to identify average-risk individuals eligible for population-based CRC screening. 3 All indications for colonoscopy were included due to difficulty disentangling the test purpose from the available discharge records, without corresponding medical record data, 37 and a primary focus on workforce shifts based on total colonoscopy utilization among persons 50-74 years. Nationally, studies show that approximately 38%-45% of all colonoscopies are done for screening purposes. [38] [39] [40] We defined a colonoscopy center as a facility (hospital or ASC) performing \u08d91 colonoscopy in any particular year. Centers were identified using a unique facility ID. One key facility-level characteristic, county urban/rural status, was defined based on 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes developed by the US Department of Agriculture 41 (metropolitan categories collapsed to represent urban, and nonmetropolitan categories collapsed to represent rural).\nColonoscopy providers were defined as physicians who performed \u08d91 colonoscopy to individuals aged 50-74 years in any particular year. Providers were identified using a unique provider ID in the SC Ambulatory Surgery Discharge Database. Medical specialty is self-reported during the physician licensing process required by the SC Board of Labor and Licensing, and it is directly linked to the discharge data. Additional information from the National Provider Identifier Registry was used to supplement the database where medical specialty information was missing in the database, as well as to validate the medical specialty reported in the discharge database. Only 0.24% of physicians in the data set had missing specialty information over the time period under examination. We focused on 5 physician specialties: gastroenterology (GE), general surgery (GS), IM (including Geriatric IM), colon and rectal surgery (CRS), and FM (including Geriatric FM) because they perform nearly all colonoscopies. Other specialists performing colonoscopy were excluded due to the low volume of procedures performed annually (ie, <1% of procedures in 2010). Colonoscopies provided by these \"Other\" specialties were included, however, in all aggregate descriptive statistics. Records without a designated provider (ie, discharge record with only centerlevel information) were excluded from our provider-level analyses (n = 1,803; 0.22%). When multiple providers were included on a single discharge record (13% of records), only the characteristics of the first provider listed on the discharge record were used for our analy-\nThe Journal of Rural Health 34 (2018) 138-147 c 2017 National Rural Health Association sis, as he/she was assumed to be the patient's attending physician/provider.\nThe most comprehensive list of codes associated with colonoscopy was included (Appendix A, available online only) to try to capture all facilities and providers performing colonoscopy in the screening-eligible population, and explore procedure volume patterns. Analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used to examine statistical differences in the physician/center volume, and the chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to examine the differences in proportions. Statistical significance was based upon an alpha level of 0.05. Subsequently, to examine whether the growth rate of colonoscopy centers and providers outpaced the population eligible for CRC screening, we standardized the number of colonoscopy centers, colonoscopy providers, and the population aged 50-74 by year, plotted the variables on a scatterplot, and fit a linear trend line to the data. All analyses were performed in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

This represented a 27% increase in the number of colonoscopy centers and a 46% increase in those with practicing gastroenterologists compared to 2001, when Medicare began covering colonoscopy for people of average risk. Most of the change over time in availability of colonoscopy centers occurred in urban counties (Urban: 34% change, Rural: 15% change). Using linear trend analysis, we found the growth of colonoscopy centers and the population aged 50-74 exhibited a strong, positive linear relationship over time ( Figure 1A ). This linear trend occurred in both urban and rural settings; however, both slopes were slightly <1.00 (\u03b2 urban = 0.96, \u03b2 rural = 0.89), indicating that the population aged 50-74 is growing slightly faster (although not significantly) than the number of associated colonoscopy centers. A linear relationship was also found between the number of individual colonoscopy providers and the population aged 50-74 ( Figure 1B) , with both urban and rural slopes <1.00 (\u03b2 urban = 0.85, \u03b2 rural = 0.92), indicating faster growth (although not significant) of the population aged 50-74 compared to individual providers.\nThe number of hospitals providing colonoscopies remained fairly constant over time, while the number of ASCs increased more than 125% (Figure 2A) . Growth of ASCs performing colonoscopy was most pronounced in urban counties. The percent change in annual colonoscopy volume in hospitals between 2001 and 2010 was -7% in urban areas and +12% in rural areas, and in ASCs, it was +58% in urban areas and +33% in rural areas ( Figure 2B )."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Colonoscopy Providers", "text": "There were 583 unique colonoscopy providers in 2010, up from 448 in 2001 (+30%). In most urban and rural counties, the density of providers per 100,000 persons aged 50-74 declined. Only a few counties saw marked improvements (eg, Greenwood County, Chesterfield County, Jasper County).\nIn 2010, 78% of providers performed the majority of their colonoscopy procedures at a hospital (Table 1) Figure 3B ). In both urban and rural counties, gastroenterologists had the highest annual volumes, followed by colon and rectal surgeons, general surgeons, internists, and family physicians with the lowest volumes. Interestingly, rural gastroenterologists and general surgeons had higher annual procedure volumes on average than their urban counterparts (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Since 42 This shift may offer significant savings for Medicare, as ASC payment rates are approximately half that paid to hospital outpatient departments.\nFrom 2001 to 2010, the number of family physicians performing colonoscopy in SC has also increased, possibly resulting from colonoscopy training programs for SC family physicians. 43 A corresponding increase in the number of active family physicians was also noted nationally 44 and in SC 45 . 46 Despite the rise in the number of facilities and colonoscopy providers over time, some improvements have been limited to urban counties. For example, the number of gastroenterologists with a primary office location in rural SC has declined by 13%, whereas urban counties experienced a 17% increase.\nOur study found that nongastroenterologists do indeed fill a gap in counties without a practicing gastroenterologist. Despite our finding that nongastroenterologists are more common in rural areas, lacking a gastroenterologist in one's own county may not necessarily translate to lower quality colonoscopies for rural residents. A recent study in Oregon found that nongastroenterologists performing colonoscopy in rural areas had comparable polyp detection rates compared to nonrural practices, but lower cecal intubation rates, retrieval of resected polyps, and submission of polyps to pathology. 47 Rural residents also often bypass local nongastroenterologists 48 to seek care from gastroenterologists in neighboring counties. Fewer opportunities may exist, however, for residents who lack transportation to travel for health care. More research is needed to determine the quality of care provided by nongastroenterologists in urban and rural settings, where procedure volumes are expected to vary. \na Includes providers not classified in 1 of the 5 predominant medical specialties providing colonoscopies. b P values calculated using analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis for volume and chi-square and Fisher exact test for proportion comparisons. c Overall annual volume is based on data from any location where colonoscopy was provided by each provider, and annual volume at the primary office setting is based on data for all colonoscopies performed at the location in which the majority of procedures were performed. Volume calculations based on data from all patients served aged 50-74, including out-of-state patients and all colonoscopy indications (ie, surveillance, screening, and diagnostic).\nOur findings suggest that growth in the supply of providers following Medicare coverage of colonoscopy in 2001 has been heterogeneous across different provider types and care settings. As efforts are underway to screen 80% of the screening-eligible US population by 2018, 49 programs to address colonoscopy capacity limitations in rural America will be needed. In a survey of program directors of family medicine residency programs, only 18% of directors reported training one or more residents to perform colonoscopies. 50 When colonoscopy is incorporated into the residency training programs, indicators of success (eg, adenoma detection rate) increase with volume regardless of specialty. 32, [51] [52] [53] [54] A minimum threshold of 140 supervised colonoscopies for GE residents was previously recommended by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; however, new research suggests it takes 250+ procedures to achieve competence. 55 In contrast, the American Association of Family Physicians recommends a minimum threshold of 50 colonoscopies for basic competency. 56 More research is needed to determine the optimal number of procedure thresholds to maintain competency and success rates post training, particularly in nongastroenterologists who perform fewer colonoscopies. Furthermore, while the number of physicians performing colonoscopy is increasing over time, surveillance of quality measures including cecal intubation rates and complication rates, as well as long-term outcomes such as incident CRCs, will be critical metrics in view of the predominance of nongastroenterologists performing colonoscopies. Notwithstanding the need for more research on quality of colonoscopies performed by nongastroenterologists, one must realize that using only gastroenterologists to perform colonoscopy in rural areas is not likely to be feasible, given their limited availability, and consider as a consequence that a broader range of CRC screening modalities might be necessary under these conditions. [57] [58] [59] Interventions with targeted outreach (eg, mailed FIT kits) and education in rural areas have shown high success rates for FIT [60] [61] [62] and FOBT 63 completion. Research is therefore warranted to further explore CRC screening capacity (using different combinations of testing approaches and provider types) in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Limitations of our study also exist. This was a purely descriptive study, which established considerable variation among provider types (employment settings and medical specialties) in the volume of colonoscopies performed over space and time, although the data were not very recent. Also, our results may not be generalizable to other states. However, our population-based study contributes important new knowledge to the existing literature that is largely limited to reports of single institutions, systems or payers, and lays the foundation for national studies using a similar framework."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, we observed a major shift in practice settings for colonoscopy, whereby the number of ASCs performing colonoscopy has substantially increased over time, particularly in urban counties. In spite of the considerable growth in the number of colonoscopies performed and of unique colonoscopy providers since 2001, the difference between urban and rural availability of colonoscopy facilities and providers has increased. Programs to increase use of FOBT/FIT, recruit additional gastroenterologists, or train nongastroenterologists to provide colonoscopies in underserved communities would help alleviate the disparities observed in CRC screening and mortality rates in rural communities."}]
