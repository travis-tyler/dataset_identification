The revealed residential choice of city versus suburbs within large metropolitan areas is examined with particular focus on families with children, especially those with collegeeducated parents. Probit and bivariate probit estimates are presented for 15 large metropolitan areas in the United States, and for boroughs within New York City. Data are drawn from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. It is shown that overall more affluent and educated families with school-age children are less likely to live in many large central cities including Boston, Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia with a few important exceptions including Charlotte, Seattle, and the borough of Manhattan. We contrast our results with estimates for married and never married respondents without school-age children. \nTerms of use:\nDocuments in EconStor may"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The population of many large cities in the United States including Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. started to decline in the 1950s. More recently, at least some of these cities have experienced a population turnaround. For example, New York City's population has increased by over one million since 1990 after declining by about one million between 1950 and 1980. Over the past decade, 9 of the 10 largest cities in the United States gained population (and 17 of the 20 largest cities).\nMost studies attribute the population turnaround to a shifting residential attractiveness of the city. Prominent urban researchers, such as Glaeser (2011) , have described the return to central cities in the United States, along with the particular features of urban areas that have attracted households back. These include such things as new housing in city centers, amenities like specialized restaurants and cultural activities, and broad demographic trends toward young college-educated singles who have urban residential preferences (see Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009; Glaeser, 2011; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz, 2001 ).\nIn a recent study, Ehrenhalt (2012) calls the return to cities the \"great inversion\" that reverses trends that were present in cities since the mid-twentieth century. He hypothesizes that some American metropolitan areas are beginning to resemble 19 th century European cities where the more affluent lived in city centers and households of more modest means lived in the suburbs. Some of the reasons that he gives for the heightened attractiveness of many central cities as a place to live is the decline of manufacturing in cities making them more livable, lower crime rates, growth in the single, never-married population, lower fertility, and growth in relatively affluent and educated seniors.\nDespite the focus on amenities as the impetus to urban residential turnaround, other studies have documented the continued and revived strength of urban cores in fostering those jobs and businesses that are characterized by intense information exchange and creativity, thereby attracting college-educated residents to nearby neighborhoods ( Berry, Bodini, and Weissbourd, 2005; Storper and Scott, 2009; Sander and Testa, 2013) . In either case, not only is income important to city household location, but education and human capital as well.\nPrevious studies have correctly observed that the basis of the population turnaround has centered on college-educated singles and highly educated older adults (Brueckner et al., 1999; Florida, 2008; Glaeser and Kahn, 2001; Sander, 2005; Sander and Testa, 2009; Testa and Sander, 2010) . However, it is less clear how central cities (relative to suburbs) have fared in attracting and keeping families with children. If one goes back in time, studies indicated that suburbs provided families with cheaper land and housing and fewer inner-city type problems including crime and poor quality schooling (Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1967; Muth, 1969; Wheaton, 1977) .\nToday, as households once again consider the central city in increasing numbers, the city-suburb choice of households with children merits further consideration. To be sure, not all urban households with children have sufficient income to allow broad choices among city and suburban communities. However, those households that have high education attainment and high income are able and do tend to choose communities based on criteria such as the quality of local schools, safety, and the education level of residents. That is, such households demand a safe environment and good schools, which has generally made many suburban areas more attractive to such households (Albouy and Lue, 2011; Cullen and Levitt, 1999) .\nNonetheless, many cities have arguably become more attractive to family households than they used to be for the same reasons that they have become attractive to singles. Moreover, some amenities and conditions may be especially improved for households with children as crime rates have been generally falling over time (Kneebone and Rafael, 2011) . Similarly, in some places, recent improvements in public school quality and offerings have increased their attractiveness. For example, Hoxby and Muraka (2009) show that charter school initiatives in New York City have had positive effects on achievement. Angrist, Pathak, and Walters (2011) show that charter schools in general have boosted student urban achievement. Luppescu, et al. (2011) show that school reform in Chicago has increased achievement and high school graduation rates. Results from the National Assessment of Education Progress indicate that the quality of public education has improved in 11 big-city school districts (Casserly, et al., 2011) .\nFurther, to the extent that the quality of public schooling is problematic in central cities, families can opt out of the public school system and send their children to private schools. This is especially the case for more affluent families (see Cohen-Zada and Sander, 2008) . Thus, it could be the case that central cities are becoming increasingly attractive to high human capital families.\nIf so, city policy leaders may find it helpful to recognize and understand the residential choices made by households with children. If cities are going to attract high human capital families, they will need to provide the amenities and services that are important to families with children. Otherwise, to preclude or repel such high education workers from living in central cities could impose real costs in attracting jobs and in building a tax base to provide public services. For large metropolitan areas at least, un-necessarily long commutes by households with children from suburbs to central city work locations would tend to raise wage offers by these workers, thus having a negative effect on employment and investment.\nIn this paper, we further explore the relationship between higher education, income, and the location of families with school-age children within a city-suburban area context for 15 large metropolitan areas in the United States. We contrast our results with estimates for married respondents without school-age children and for never-married respondents without school-age children. We are thus able to show how marital status and children affect the attractiveness of specific cities to more educated and affluent consumers. We also include in our study a brief examination of the location of families within New York City (Manhattan versus the rest of New York City). We focus on Manhattan partly because data are available to separate out trends for the boroughs of New York City because of its large size. This cannot be done for other cities in the United States. Further, Manhattan has about 1.6 million people; it would be the fifth largest city in the United States if it were a city on its own.\nOur study thus contributes empirical evidence on the determinants of household location for 15 metropolitan areas in the United States highlighting the effect of high levels of educational attainment and children. Key findings include mostly negative higher education and income effects on living in a central city for families with school-age children for the largest cities within metropolitan areas in our sample including Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia although\nManhattan is found to be attractive to more affluent and highly educated families. Moreover, more affluent and educated families are more likely to live in a few of the smaller cities in our sample including Charlotte and Seattle. This contrasts with more positive higher education effects on living in cities for married and never-married respondents without school-age children."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data set that is used in this study is the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS Factors that have been shown to discourage more affluent and educated families from living in cities include crime and low quality public schools. For this reason, we also present data on violent crime rates and high school graduation rates that are comparable for most cities in our sample. The high school graduation rate is not necessarily a good indicator of the quality of schooling in a city, but it suggests how such public school systems might be perceived.\nCities that have particularly high violent crime rates include Detroit and St. Louis followed by Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. New York City has the lowest violent crime rate (declining by about two-thirds over the past two decades) in our sample followed by Seattle, Charlotte, and San Francisco. Most of the cities in our sample have relatively low (public) high school graduation rates. For the United States, the four-year high school graduation rate is about 75%. That is, about 3 out of 4 freshmen in 2007-08 graduate in 4 years. The National\nCenter for Educational Statistics (NCES) publishes education data for the 100 largest public school districts. For these districts, the rate is 65%. In our sample, all of our cities that are in the NCES sample except San Francisco are below the national average. (Table 1) .\nA key variable in our study is whether adults have at least a bachelor's degree. For this reason, we array data by city and suburb on the percentage of adults twenty-five and over who have at least a bachelor's degree for the MSAs in our sample. We call all areas that are within the MSA boundaries and outside the primary central city \"suburb\" throughout our study.\nOverall, educational attainment levels are higher in central cities than in suburban areas in about half of our metropolitan areas. In some cases, the differences are relatively large. For example, the percentage with a college degree is fifteen percentage points higher in the city of Seattle than in suburbs of Seattle. In contrast, in the case of Detroit the percentage with a college degree is eighteen percentage points higher in suburban areas than in the city of Detroit. Levels of educational attainment are important because high human capital families want to live in high human capital communities (Table 1) .\nIn Table 2 , we array more descriptive information on the metropolitan areas in our study.\nWe provide information of key aspects of where households and families live in MSAs by their levels of education and the location of where they work, variables that will be featured in our analysis below. In about half of the metropolitan areas in our study, the share of the MSA college graduate population that lives in the primary central city is about the same as the share of the overall population. In a few cases (Baltimore, Detroit, and Milwaukee), college graduates are less prominent in the central city of a metropolitan area and in a few cases college graduates are more concentrated in central cities (Charlotte, Seattle, and San Francisco out of 10 for college-educated parents with school-age children (Table 2) .\nAt the other end of the spectrum, adults with less than a high school education (called \"high school dropout\") are more likely to live in central cities in a majority of cases relative to college graduates. However, in 3 cases (Charlotte, San Francisco, and Seattle), high school dropouts are less concentrated than college graduates in central cities while in a few MSAs (Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C.) the proportions are about the same. One of the differences relative to college-educated parents is that in most cases parents with less than a high school education are about as likely to live in central cities as adults with less than a high school education in general. Once again, there are a couple of exceptions. Parents with less than a high school education tend to be more concentrated than other \"dropout\" parents in Detroit and less concentrated in San Francisco and Seattle (Table 2 ).\nThe descriptive information thus suggests that college educated parents with school-age children are usually less likely to live in central cities relative to other adults and less educated parents with school-age children. The data also indicates that parents who work in central cities are more likely to live in central cities relative to other parents. The estimates below will\nfurther explore to what extent these relationships hold when other factors are taken into account."}, {"section_title": "Models", "text": "In drawing on the ACS data, we undertake probit estimates of residential location for respondents 25 and older with school-age children (primary central city in the MSA versus suburbs and other parts of the MSA) for each of the 15 large metropolitan statistical areas.\nProbit is used because our dependent variable takes on a value of either zero or one. Logit would also be an appropriate methodology and should result in similar estimates. However, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) would be inappropriate because it would lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. The other right-hand side variables that are used to estimate household location include educational attainment (relative to high school graduate), household income, age and age squared, black, Hispanic, Asian, married, divorced, widow, both husband and wife work, and respondent works in the primary central city.\nWe focus on the effect of higher levels of educational attainment and control for respondents with a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, a professional degree like a law degree or a medical degree, or a Ph.D. rather than simply adjusting for respondents with at least an undergraduate degree. We do this to show how different levels of college attainment affect household location. One might expect that someone with, for example, a professional degree might differ in their propensity to live in a city than someone with a bachelor's degree. Educational attainment is taken into account because it could affect preferences for where one lives. It could also be associated indirectly with many factors like age at marriage and fertility that affect the incentive to live in cities. Further, it is important to separate out the effect of educational attainment from the effect of income, a variable that has received considerable attention in related research on household location (e.g., Margo, 1992) . Previous studies indicate that education and income do not necessarily operate in the same direction in their effects on household location (Sander, 2005) .\nThe adjustment for marital status is made because previous studies suggest that married couples have tended to place a higher value on the amenities of suburban locations, especially cheaper housing, good schools and lower crime. It is less clear how divorced, separated, and widowed individuals value suburban locations. Age (and age squared) are taken into account because they might affect the value of city living (e.g., the value of nightlife for young adults).\nAdjustments are made for racial and ethnic background because they also affect the propensity to live in cities for many reasons including preferences to live in ethnic enclaves (see Bayer, McMillan, and Rueben, 2004; Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan, 2007 ). An adjustment is made for whether husbands and wives both work although the effect of this variable is not clear. Finally, an adjustment is made for whether the respondent works in a city. Although the location of work is endogenous with household location, many studies indicate that working in a city increases the likelihood of living in a city.\nWe also undertake probit estimates for households without school-age children. We do this separately with estimates for currently married and never-married respondents. We estimate these variables to show how higher education and income effects vary by marital status and the presence of school-age children. The other variables in these additional estimates are the same as above.\nWe also estimate household location within the largest metropolitan areas in our sample, New York City. In the case of New York City, each borough of the city has a separate place of work PUMA associated with it, an important determinant of where households live. Thus, it is possible to separate out household locations in specific boroughs while adjusting for working in that borough. It is not possible to do this for other cities. We undertake multinomial logit estimates for New York City separating out three locations: Manhattan, other New York City, and suburbs of New York City. Manhattan is of particular interest because of an observed growth of families with children living there over the past decade. It would also be a large city on its own if it was independent of the rest of New York City with a population of about 1.6 million. Further, NYC is the only city (to our knowledge) in the ACS data where it is possible to separate out the location of work for locations within a city.\nAn important issue in estimating household location is that the location of work is endogenous with the location of households, as noted above. That is, probit estimates of household location and the location of work could have correlated disturbances. For this reason, we also estimate bivariate probit models of residential location, treating the location of work as endogenous. This is a two-stage process where we estimate household location as a function of the variables that have been listed above and we estimate the location of work as a function of the same variables excluding, of course, the location of work. While bivariate probit models can be estimated without exclusion restrictions, the quality of such estimates is problematic (Altonji, Elder, and Taber, 2005 ). An additional variable is needed that affects the location of work and is independent of household location. The additional variable that we use for identification is industry of work. The logic behind our identification strategy is that industries differ in their suburbanization propensities. For example, manufacturing tends to be more concentrated in suburban areas because of cheaper land and other reasons. Further, workers have invested in industry-specific human capital that affects where they work. Other research provides support for this identification strategy (Bajari and Kahn, 2005; Neal, 1995) .\nFor the multinomial logit estimate for New York City, we also use a predicted value for working in New York City to estimate living in Manhattan, other New York City, or suburban areas of New York City. The predicted value is based upon the other variables in the estimate and industry of work for identification. Limdep is the software package that is used for all of the estimates in the paper."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Probit estimates of living in the primary central city for the 15 large metropolitan areas in our sample are presented below (Table 3) Some of the other significant results in the probit estimates are as follows. The least educated (LTHS) are more likely to live in cities. The effect of age tends to be u-shaped in many cities suggesting that cities are relatively attractive to young adults and relatively older adults.\nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, and, to a lesser extent, Asians are more concentrated in cities.\nAlso, married, divorced, and widowed respondents are less likely to like in cities while if both husband and wife work, they are less likely to live in a city in several cases. Finally, working in a primary central city is positively associated with living in the city.\nProbit estimates for married respondents without school-age children are presented in Table   4 . For brevity, we only report the marginal effects of the higher education and income variables. In general, the results for the higher education effects are more positive than in the previous case where school-age children were present. For example, having either a professional degree or a Ph.D. has a significant positive effect on living in a central city in a majority of cases (and no significant negative effect in any case). A master's degree is positively associated with living in a city in 8 cases and only negatively associated with living in a central city in three cases while respondents with a bachelor's degree are more likely to live in a city in four cases and less like in three locations. However, the effect of income is only significant and positive in three cases while income has a significant negative effect in seven cases.\nThe effect of higher education on living in a central city is even more positive for nevermarried respondents without school-age children. Respondents with at least a bachelor's degree are significantly more likely to live in a central city in at least 9 cases (and as high as 12\ncases for respondents with a professional degree). In only two cases (Detroit and Philadelphia)\nare respondents with a college degree less likely to live in a city. However, once again, the effect of income is negative in most cases (Table 5 ).\nThe bivariate probit estimates of living in a central city for families with school-age children are presented in Table 6 . For brevity, we only present the marginal effects of the higher education, income, and \"work city\" coefficients. In general, a very similar pattern in the results is found for the higher education and income variables. The key difference in the estimates is that there are large differences in the effect of working in a central city in the bivariate probit results. Univariate probit models substantially overestimate the effect of working in a city on living in it. One primary reason for this is that some individuals work in a city because they choose to live there. For example, for the bivariate probit, the effect of working in the city of Boston on living there is about .1 rather than .2. In 5 cases, the effect of working in a city on living in the city is now either negative or zero.\nCities where the location of work tended to have the largest positive effect on household location were mostly the larger cities in our sample including Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle. Quite possibly, the personal transportation costs of cross-boundary commuting are naturally higher in large MSAs. One of the exceptions was New York City. This could be simply a result of a specific \"boundary effect\" where a large number of individuals commute a relatively short distance into New York City from New Jersey and elsewhere. For the smallest cities in our sample (Pittsburgh and St. Louis) the effect of working in these cities on living in them is zero suggesting either that are not especially attractive places to live for city workers, while commuting costs from the suburbs are not formidable.\nThe multinomial logit estimates for living in Manhattan and \"other New York City\" relative to suburbs of New York City are presented in Table 7 Estimates are presented with an adjustment for place of work and with a predicted value for place of work. Both estimates indicate that higher education and income have positive effects on living in Manhattan and negative effects on living in other boroughs of New York City relative to other areas in the New York City MSA.\nIf an adjustment is not made for place of work, the effect of higher education and income is more positive for living in Manhattan and less negative for living in other parts of the city not shown).\nIn Table 8 , we summarize the key results from our probit estimates for respondents with school-age children and for respondents without school-age children. We show the number of significant coefficients in our estimates and their signs. For respondents with school-age children, the results indicate that respondents with either a bachelor's degree or a master's degree are more likely to live in suburban communities. Respondents with either a professional degree or a Ph.D. are about as likely to live in cities as they are to live in suburbs. Respondents without school-age children are more likely to live in cities and less likely to live in suburbs. This is especially the case for never-married respondents. For all respondents, the effect of income is negative in a majority of cases and is positive in only three cases at most."}, {"section_title": "Discussion/ Conclusions", "text": "To be sure, many highly educated households are now settling in cities, especially educated singles, which has helped to sustain population growth following decades of decline. However, for most of our samples MSAs, the \"great inversion\" of U.S. cities has not yet taken place. With respect to the general tendency of household income to rise with distance away from the city center, we find that the marginal effect of household income on living in the city remains modestly negative for most cities in our sample. Further, this result holds across major groups of household structure-those with children and those without. This persistent result may be a holdover or lasting effect of the older and small(er)-sized housing stock of central cities, coupled with a suburban housing stock that is well-suited to higher income households.\nPhysical configuration of the stock of housing adjusts only slowly over time.\nIn most of our study MSAs, households having high educational attainment lead the way in living in central cities, but the presence of school-age children negates this effect. Overall, having either a bachelor's degree or a master's degree has a negative effect on families with school-age kids living in a city. However, there are a few exceptions where the effect is positive Declines in crime rates in many cities over the past two decades are one important factor that has seemingly made them more attractive to families. Also, improvements recreational/cultural amenities over the past decade have possibly made cities more attractive in general to those with greater educational attainment. Cities have concertedly pursued recreational and cultural redevelopment including waterfront festivals and shopping, museums, architectural preservation, theatre districts and much more.\nShould some cities, then, pursue households with children as a focus of strategic development? To some extent, the reasons for good schools and safe neighborhoods are obviously over-arching goals that need not be couched within a narrow strategy. Social returns to education and safety are high; today's children are tomorrow's citizenry and workforce.\nBut now that many households are choosing to live in the city during their pre-child bearing years, the stakes in offering them a suitable environment for raising children are high. As the results of this paper suggest, parents with high educational attainment are already favorably disposed to live in cities. The marginal efforts that must be achieved to attract and retain them in cities may be reachable."}, {"section_title": "References", "text": "Location.\" American Economic Review 67: 620-631 Estimates also include adjustments for age, age squared, marital status (married, divorced, widowed), both husband and wife worked, gender, black, Hispanic, Asian, less than high school, some college, and, place of work.
