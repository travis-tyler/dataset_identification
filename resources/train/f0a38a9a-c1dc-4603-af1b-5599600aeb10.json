Objective: Since impaired protein degradation plays an important role in many neurodegenerative disorders, we hypothesized that profiles of select lysosomal network proteins in cerebrospinal fluid could be differentially expressed in these parkinsonian syndromes. Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from PD patients (n = 18), clinically diagnosed 4-repeat tauopathy patients; corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (n = 3) and PSP (n = 8); and pathologically diagnosed PSP (n = 8) and CBD patients (n = 7). Each patient set was compared to its appropriate control group consisting of age and gender matched individuals. Select lysosomal network protein levels were detected via Western blotting. Factor analysis was used to test the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the select lysosomal network protein expression profiles. Results: PD, CBD and PSP were markedly different in their cerebrospinal fluid lysosomal network protein profiles. Lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 were significantly decreased in PD; early endosomal antigen 1 was decreased and lysozyme increased in PSP; and lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 and lysozyme were increased in CBD. A panel of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2, lysozyme and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain discriminated between controls, PD and 4-repeat tauopathies. Conclusions: This study offers proof of concept that select lysosomal network proteins are differentially expressed in cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinson's disease, corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy. Lysosomal network protein analysis could be further developed as a diagnostic fluid biomarker in parkinsonian syndromes."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "There is a compelling need to develop diagnostic biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS), including corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Due to their overlapping clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of these conditions can often be challenging, especially during their early clinical stages. Despite having similar clinical presentations, PD and the APS have different associated neuropathological features [1] [2] [3] [4] , which suggest that the underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms are also distinct, and their neurochemical footprints could be discerned through biofluid analysis for diagnostic purposes. Recent studies have explored the diagnostic and prognostic value of cerebrospinal fluid analysis of a number of proteins typically associated with neurodegenerative conditions, including amyloid-\u2424 1-42 (A\u2424 ), tau, alpha synuclein (\u2423-synuclein) and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in Parkisonian syndromes [5] . Whereas studies for individual proteins in specific parkinsonian syndromes have sometimes been inconclusive [6] , a panel approach, where a combination of several biomarkers is analyzed, has proven to reach higher accuracy and specificity [7] . Given that, protein misfolding, the key neuropathological changes in parkinsonian syndromes has been observed many years before the manifestation of clinical signs, some of the earliest pathogenic changes are hypothesized to involve mechanisms affecting protein autophagy, degradation and clearance [8] [9] [10] . Some of the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been described in connection to the lysosomal network, an interconnected vesicular network of endosomes, lysosomes and autophagosomes, that is crucial for protein homeostasis [11] . We recently observed select CSF lysosomal network protein increases in a large group of AD patients, including early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-1, LAMP-2), lysozyme and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) [12, 13] . The goal of this exploratory pilot study was to provide proof-of-principle that lysosomal network protein analysis reveals neurochemical differences in parkinsonian syndromes that could be further developed into diagnostic fluid biomarkers. We measured CSF levels of the select lysosomal network proteins EEA1, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LC3 and lysozyme in PD, CBD and PSP patients, and determined whether their expression profiles are different compared to controls. A subset of analyses included CSF from pathologically confirmed CBD and PSP patients.

The lysosomal proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 were significantly decreased in PD compared with control; LC3 was increased in clinically diagnosed 4-repeat tauopathy patients (CBS and PSP) compared with controls; pathologically diagnosed CBD patients had significantly increased LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LC3 and lysozyme levels compared with controls; whilst pathologically diagnosed PSP patients had significantly decreased EEA1 level and increased lysozyme levels compared with controls. A pool factorial analysis confirmed that combined patterns of lysosomal patterns are sensitive at discriminating controls from the different parkinsonian diseases. These results support that the lysosomal protein network is activated in parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, a combination of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LC3 and lysozyme levels was able to Fig. 4 . Patterns of lysosomal network protein expression showed differences between control subjects, patients with Parkinson's disease and 4-repeat tauopathies (CBD and PSP combined). Function 1 (canonical coefficients: lysozyme 1.4, LAMP-2 -0.15 and LC3 -0.39) showed a higher segregation of 4-repeat tauopathies (4RTau) patients. In turn, function 2 (canonical coefficients: LAMP-2 1.7, lysozyme -0.8 and LC3 -1.4, respectively) showed discrimination of PD patients. Control subjects featured comparatively lower LC3 with variable lysozyme and LC3. Conversely, PD featured low LC3 and lysozyme, whereas 4-repeat tauopathies showed high lysozyme score with variable LAMP-2 and LC3. distinguish patients with PD, from patients with 4-repeat tauopathies. It can thus be hypothesized that profiles of lysosomal network proteins could be different among parkinsonian diseases and could have value as biomarkers useful in the differential diagnosis of PD, CBD and PSP. These data are consistent with previous results from AD CSF samples, where no general increase of lysosomal network proteins was observed, but a select subset of lysosomal proteins was changed [12] . Based on these data showing differential expression profiles of select CSF lysosomal network proteins, further validating studies that also address their specificity in parkinsonian syndromes should be pursued. Whether other parkinsonian syndromes with different associated pathology, such as multiple system atrophy, or other non-related parkinsonian conditions with predominant tau pathology, such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, share some of the observed CSF lysosomal protein changes should be also further explored.\nSome of the earliest abnormalities observed in AD and PD are connected to malfunctioning protein clearance in the lysosomal network [11, 18, 19] . Our data indicate that it is highly likely that changes to lysosomal network proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of CBD and PSP, in one or more of the lysosomal network compartments; lysosomes, autophagosomes or endosomes. The pathologies of AD, PD, PSP and CBD have in common the accumulation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins; A\u2424, \u2423-synuclein, and tau, which are not degraded efficiently but instead may negatively affect degradation pathways, such as the lysosomal network [20] . It has been previously described that levels of LAMP-2 are decreased early in the disease progression in the PD brain [10, 21] . in particular, the lysosomal membrane protein isoform LAMP-2A is believed to be primarily involved in PD-related neurodegeneration, since the levels of the isoforms LAMP-2B and LAMP-2C are unchanged [22] and LAMP-2A is known to be involved in chaperone mediated autophagy. The decreased level of LAMP-2 correlates with a decreased level and activity of glucocerebrosidase and high levels of \u2423-synuclein in PD [21] . Our study demonstrates decreased levels of LAMP-2 in CSF from PD patients, which may reflect the levels of glucocerebrosidase and \u2423-synuclein in the PD brain. The levels of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 are not altered in substantia nigra pars compacta or amygdala in the PD brain [10, 23] , however, we detected a decreased level of LAMP-1 in PD CSF which might indicate that other brain regions and different cellular subtypes could be implicated in PD-related neurodegeneration. Overexpressing \u2423-synuclein in a microglia cell line shows, among other things, decreased LAMP-1 levels [24] . In the present study, CBD cases showed increased CSF LAMP-1 and 2 levels, mirroring what is seen in AD [12] . We found that the level of the lysosomal glycoside hydrolase and innate immunity protein lysozyme was increased in CBD but unchanged in PD and PSP. The increase of lysozyme in CBD could reflect an astrocytic response towards the tau pathology seen in astrocytes in this disorder [4] . LC3 is involved in formation of the autophagosome and earlier reports show increased levels of autophagic vesicles containing LC3 in PD brains as well as mice and cell models [9] . LC3 and impaired autophagy have previously been reported in a cellular model of CBD and PSP [8] , as well as in a mouse model for tauopathies [25] . We could not detect any differences in LC3 levels in CSF from PD or pathologically diagnosed PSP patients, but the protein was found at higher levels in CSF in pathologically confirmed CBD patients. Why the previously reported increased LC3 levels in the PD brain is not mirrored in the CSF could be explained by that LC3 was reported to be sequestered in Lewy bodies in PD [10, 23] , and that Lewy bodies are also detected in some PSP patients [26] . The endosomal protein EEA1, which is involved in fusion and delivery of endosomal cargo, was significantly decreased in CSF from PSP cases, but to our knowledge there are no prior studies on EEA1 in PD, CBD or PSP.\nThe difference in results between the clinically diagnosed CBS and PSP samples versus the pathologically diagnosed CBD and PSP samples could be caused by the propensity of clinically diagnosed patients to be misdiagnosed [27] , highlighting the need for reliable biomarkers, but could also indicate that the levels of certain proteins changes during the disease progression, like prior reports that sAPP\u2423 levels decreases longitudinally in APS patients [7] . It is noteworthy that the lysosomal marker profile of pathologically-confirmed CBD patients resembles that of the one previously reported for AD patients [12, 13] , more than PD patients, even though not identical, where CBD and AD patients have increased levels of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, lysozyme and LC3. This finding indicates that there may be overlapping pathophysiological changes in lysosomal function between these disorders and that therapies directed towards optimizing lysosomal functions in AD may turn out to be beneficial also in CBD. A recent study investigating the diagnostic power of combining the nine CSF proteins T-Tau, NFL, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, YKL-40, sAPP\u2423, sAPP\u2424, A\u2424 1-42 , P-Tau and \u2423-synuclein to distinguish between e.g. PD, APS, AD and DLB gave promising results [7] . To combine the levels and patterns of these proteins with the lysosomal network proteins, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, lysozyme, LC3 and EEA1 might boost the diagnostic accuracy of this diagnostic panel.\nThere are several limitations to this study. The number of analyzed cases is small, which likely resulted in underestimation of specificity and low accuracy. This in turn compromises the external validity of the findings. The predictive value of the current findings is contingent upon their replication in larger patient sets. Samples were obtained from different centers, which possibly contributed to case heterogeneity, thus affecting sensitivity estimates. Also, disease duration at the time of CSF sampling significantly varied between patient diagnoses and analyte levels could be significantly affected by the disease stage. The cross-sectional nature of this analysis presents a reduced dimension of analyte expression and further longitudinal studies will be needed to examine the consistency of the observed changes and the prognostic utility of the profiles. A strength of this study is the use of age-matched controls in each recruitment center. This may overcome potential bias related to sample processing. In addition, no differences were observed in control values across patient sets. This study also included more than one diagnostic group, which explores the specificity of the diagnostic tests. Results observed in clinically diagnosed APS cases had a replication in pathologically-diagnosed counterparts. The use of pathologically confirmed cases aids in the specificity of findings and strengthens the findings in light of our previous report on AD patients. In summary; this study provides proof of principle that the levels and patterns of the select lysosomal network proteins LAMP-1, LAMP-2, lysozyme, LC3 and EEA1 differ between PD, CBD and PSP CSF as compared to their appropriate controls. These proteins have the potential as tools in investigating the disease mechanisms for AD, parkinsonian disorders and other neurodegenerative conditions featuring abnormal protein degradation and aggregation, as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the diseases; and perhaps even as future targets for novel treatments. Further validation studies on the role of lysosomal network protein expression profiles are indicated."}]
