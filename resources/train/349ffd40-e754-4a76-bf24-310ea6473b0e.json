Ynicl (2018),\nBackground Previous publications indicate that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related cortical atrophy may develop in asymmetric patterns, with accentuation of the left hemisphere. Since fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) measurements of the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRgl) provide a sensitive and specific marker of neurodegenerative disease progression, we sought to investigate the longitudinal pattern of rCMRgl in amyloid-positive persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, hypothesizing asymmetric declines of cerebral glucose metabolism. Methods Using florbetapir PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures to define amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) positivity, 40 A\u03b2 negative (A\u03b2-) cognitively unimpaired controls (CU; 76\u00b15y), 76 A\u03b2 positive (A\u03b2+) persons with MCI (75\u00b17y) and 51 A\u03b2+ persons with probable AD dementia (75\u00b17y) from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included in this study with baseline and 2year follow-up FDG PET scans. The degree of lateralization of longitudinal rCMRgl declines in subjects with A\u03b2+ MCI and AD in comparison with A\u03b2-CU were statistically quantified via bootstrapped lateralization indices [(LI); range -1 (right) to 1 (left)].\nCompared to A\u03b2-CU, A\u03b2+ MCI patients showed marked left hemispheric lateralization (LI: 0.78). In contrast, modest right hemispheric lateralization (LI: -0.33) of rCMRgl declines was found in A\u03b2+ persons with probable AD dementia. Additional comparisons of A\u03b2+ groups (i.e. MCI and probable AD dementia) consequently indicated right hemispheric lateralization (LI: -0.79) of stronger rCMRgl declines in dementia stages of AD. For all comparisons, voxelbased analyses confirmed significant (pFWE<0.05) declines of rCMRgl within AD-typical brain regions. Analyses of cognitive data yielded predominant decline of memory functions in both MCI and dementia stages of AD.\nThese data indicate that in early stages, AD may be characterized by a more lateralized pattern of left hemispheric rCMRgl declines.

In recent years, AD has been conceptualized as a progressive sequence of pathophysiological changes that include the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), tau-mediated neuronal dysfunction/death and brain atrophy that correspond roughly to cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia stages (Jack et al., 2011 (Jack et al., , 2018 .\nBrain imaging measurements have been used to detect and track A\u03b2, tau, and neurodegenerative features of AD in the preclinical (cognitively unimpaired), MCI and dementia stages. The best established examples include PET measurements of fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition, PET measurements of paired helical filament (PHF) tau deposition, MRI measurements of hippocampal and whole brain atrophy, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRgl) decline in brain regions preferentially affected by AD (Herholz and Ebmeier, 2011; Reiman and Jagust, 2012; Saint-Aubert et al., 2017) . In the most recent conceptualization (Jack et al., 2018) , biomarker evidence of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology reflects \"AD pathophysiological change\", biomarker evidence of both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology reflects \"AD\", and individuals can also be characterized in terms of the evidence of neurodegenerative disease changes that may include rCMRgl declines and brain atrophy (i.e., \"AT(N)\" research criteria for AD; Jack et al., 2018) ).\nAD and related disorders are associated with distinctive MRI and FDG PET patterns of neurodegeneration. Some neurodegenerative diseases appear to begin with or are characterized by asymmetric patterns of neurodegeneration (e.g., Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), (Claassen et al., 2016; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004) .\nWhile AD has been characterized by bilateral neurodegenerative disease changes in medial temporal and heteromodal sensory association areas, several neuroimaging studies have suggested a pronunciation of the left hemisphere with respect to amyloid deposition (Raji et al., 2008) gray matter atrophy (Janke et al., 2001; Shi et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 1998 Thompson et al., , 2001 , cerebral perfusion and metabolism (Friedland et al., 1985; Loewenstein et al., 1989; Volkow et al., 2002) in persons with AD. Whereas many of these findings (particularly from studies of brain metabolism) have been cross-sectional, we sought to investigate the possibility that amyloid-\u03b2 positive (A\u03b2+) persons might demonstrate asymmetric left"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "lateralized longitudinal patterns of neurodegeneration, especially during the earlier clinical stages of AD. To address this possibility we compared longitudinal patterns of rCMRgl declines in A\u03b2+ probable AD dementia, MCI and an amyloid-\u03b2 negative (A\u03b2-) cognitively unimpaired control group from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\n\n\n\n\n\nreductions in synaptic function and density (Mosconi, 2013) . In contrast, earlier upstream pathophysiological events such as amyloid deposition may have plateaued even before clinical signs of AD are noticeable . Consequently, FDG PET may be more reflective of the clinical course of AD. Importantly, reductions in rCMRgl are sought to precede brain atrophy and alterations in glucose metabolism cannot be solely explained by brain atrophy and increases in CSF spaces (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 1998; Jack et al., 2010) .\nWithin the past decades the question whether AD pathology develops in an asymmetric or lateralized fashion has been investigated by numerous studies, yet with conflicting results. While post-mortem studies yielded a high variability of AD pathology for the left and right hemisphere, no clear signs of asymmetry or lateralization were observed (Janota and Mountjoy, 1988; Wilcock and Esiri, 1987) . In contrast, PET measurements of amyloid deposition in MCI and AD patients were found to be weakly left lateralized for some brain regions in MCI and right lateralized in AD, somewhat similar to the pattern of rCMRgl declines we observed in our within-group analyses (Raji et al., 2008) . It has to be noted though that these observations were made in a small sample and still require additional confirmation by further studies.\nEarlier studies of brain metabolism in AD and subjects at high risk for AD showed asymmetric reductions in cerebral glucose uptake, in parts with predominant left hemispheric metabolic deficits (Friedland et al., 1985; Loewenstein et al., 1989; Siegel et al., 1996; Small et al., 1995) while asymmetric glucose metabolism was found to correlate with cognitive dysfunction of lateralized domains such as language (i.e. left hemisphere) or visuospatial processing (i.e. right hemisphere) (Haxby et al., 1985) . Similar observations had been made by Keilp et al with differing correlations of left and right hemispheric perfusion deficits with specific cognitive domains in AD (Keilp et al., 1996) . In addition, more recent studies found marked left hemispheric decrements in FDG uptake in AD patients (Volkow et al., 2002) . Consideration of hemispheric differences in AD has also been given in brain structural studies. Observations of accentuated left ventricular enlargement in early AD were -in parts -confirmed by more sophisticated analyses of brain morphometry with detailed characterization of the spatial dynamics of brain atrophy in AD. Here, affirmative to studies of brain metabolism, asymmetric patterns of gray matter loss in AD with a left hemispheric pronunciation were demonstrated (Janke et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 1998 Thompson et al., , 2001 . Specific focus has also been given to the hippocampus with meta-analyses showing a\nconsistent left-less-than-right hippocampal volume in MCI and AD patients but also control subjects. While effect sizes were the strongest in MCI subjects, these results indicate dynamic changes of physiological asymmetry patterns during the course of the disease (Shi et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, Derflinger et al. argued that findings of left lateralized AD pathology are mainly attributable to a selection bias introduced by largely language based cognitive assessments (Derflinger et al., 2011) . In our sample post-hoc regression analyses showed that 24-month cognitive decline (ADAS-cog) was significantly associated with rCMRgl decline in both dementia-AD and MCI-AD subjects with patterns closely resembling the results from our group comparisons. Whereas for dementia-AD subjects bilateral decline with at most weak right hemispheric lateralization was seen, evidence of strong left hemispheric lateralization was found for associations of cognitive decline with rCMRgl declines in MCI-AD patients. For both MCI and AD subjects cognitive deficits at baseline and longitudinal decline of the ADAS-cog subitems were most pronounced in tests representative of memory performance, processing speed and praxis while language functions were only modestly affected at baseline and decline was only evident in dementia-AD but not MCI-AD patients, overall consistent with ADNI's focus on memory impairment . Similar results were obtained when subitems were grouped to subdomains (i.e. memory, language, praxis), again without significant decline of the language subdomain in MCI-AD subjects. While ADAS-cog provides a general measure of cognitive function we additionally analyzed Category Fluency (animals), a more language focused cognitive assessment of semantic fluency, with known left lateralization in healthy subjects as well as AD patients (Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2015; Meinzer et al., 2009; Yeung et al., 2016; Zahn et al., 2004) . Here, we did find weak but significant 24-month decline in both dementia-AD and MCI-AD with regression analyses yielding strong left hemispheric lateralization for the respective associations with rCMRgl decline, confirmatory to previous reports (Zahn et al., 2004) . Nevertheless, in MCI-AD subjects, these associations did not reach statistical significance (all p>0.6 FWE c ) with the largest cluster located within subcortical structures (i.e. caudate nucleus).\nOverall, these findings suggest that left hemispheric rCMRgl declines in our sample of MCI-AD subjects are not the primary result of a selection bias due to earlier detection of language impairment and/or predominant decline of language functions.\nThus far, no clear-cut explanation or potential mechanism has been provided for why left hemispheric brain regions could be more susceptible towards AD related neurodegeneration. Strong evidence indicates that brain regions associated with the default mode network (DMN) -a network of distinct brain regions characterized by increased activity under resting conditions -are particularly affected by AD pathology (Greicius et al., 2003) .\nThis in turn lead to the hypothesis that acquired lifetime cerebral metabolism of DMN regions facilitates AD related pathophysiological mechanisms, thus providing a potential explanation for the selective neuronal vulnerability that is seen in AD (Buckner et al., 2005) .\nIndeed, earliest A\u03b2 accumulation appears to manifest mainly within medial brain regions that form part of the DMN, while later stages of A\u03b2 accumulation include large parts of the neocortex (Palmqvist et al., 2017) . Brain regions of the DMN -next to others -include the PCC, precuneus as well as lateral and medial temporal lobe structures. Intriguingly, two studies focusing on the lateralization of DMN activity in healthy subjects showed left hemispheric lateralization, potentially supporting our and previous observations of left lateralized pathology in MCI (Agcaoglu et al., 2015; Swanson et al., 2011) . However, AD seems to be characterized by diverging trajectories of regional A\u03b2 pathology and brain metabolic declines (Perani, 2014) and although DMN alterations are well established in AD (Pievani et al., 2017) , it still remains to be clarified whether these changes develop in an asymmetric or even lateralized manner. Hence further research is required to shed light on the intricate interplay of pathophysiological processes that may lead to a potentially lateralized selective neuronal vulnerability in AD.\nPotential support for a higher left hemispheric susceptibility towards AD related neurodegeneration may also be provided by the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lpPPA), a focal variant of AD with typical AD pathology and distinct patterns of left lateralized temporoparietal atrophy and hypometabolism (Galton et al., 2000; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004; Henry and Gorno-Tempini, 2010; Madhavan et al., 2013; Rohrer et al., 2012) . Of note though, other focal variants such as the posterior cortical atrophy exist, that do not present with obvious lateralized pathological hallmarks (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015) .\nSomewhat contrasting, we found weak respectively strong right hemispheric lateralization in AD patients when compared to healthy controls and MCI-AD patients, indicating that metabolic differences between hemispheres develop in a dynamic fashion and seem to\ndiminish with further progression of the disease. This discrepancy needs to be interpreted under consideration of current theories on mechanisms related to disease progression. Both animal and human research support the concept of AD pathology spreading via neuronal transport and transsynaptic diffusion within interconnected brain regions (such as the DMN)\nwhich -in theory-would allow for interhemispheric spreading of to begin with more lateralized pathological changes such as A\u03b2 deposition and TAU formation (Jucker and Walker, 2013; Walker et al., 2013) .\nSeveral limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. First, this is an exploratory study of preexisting data. However, this limitation is compensated for by the detailed characterization of patients and controls of the ADNI cohort, its comparably large sample sizes and the longitudinal data. We also acknowledge the fact that evidence for strong left hemispheric lateralization was only seen in MCI-AD patients when compared to CU, while within group analyses showed same-directional but weaker effects. Nevertheless, comparisons against control subjects are mandatory as over time rCMRgl declines in healthy subjects as well and hence needs to be controlled for in order to distinguish AD related pathology from effects related to normal aging (Berti et al., 2014) . In this context we also want to stress that by the inclusion of exclusively MCI and AD patients with, and control subjects without evidence of A\u03b2 pathology high specificity of our findings with respect to AD as probable cause is ensured. However, as A\u03b2 pathology was determined based on availability of CSF measures or AV-45 PET imaging data, additional analyses to investigate the relationship between regional amyloid burden and rCMRgl declines in the context of hemispheric lateralization were not feasible in this sample, a question that should be addressed by future studies.\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T for the ADAS-cog 13 subitems for dementia-AD (AD), MCI-AD (MCI) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects.
