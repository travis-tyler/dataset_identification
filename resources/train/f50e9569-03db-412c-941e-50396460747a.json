Individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) have been shown to spend more time in bed awake 1, 2 and have more fragmented sleep than those without AD, [1] [2] [3] and studies of healthier older adults document associations between worse self-reported sleep and lower cognitive performance. 4, 5 In addition, recent research demonstrates that poor sleep, measured using wrist actigraphy, is associated with lower cognitive performance in community-dwelling elders. 6 While these findings indicate that sleep disturbance is associated with poor cognitive outcomes, it remains unclear whether poor sleep contributes to the neuropathology underlying cognitive decline.\n\u03b2-amyloid plaques are one of the hallmarks of AD, and fluctuations in amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide may be regulated by sleep/wake patterns. Kang et al. demonstrated, in wild-type mice and a mouse model of AD, that levels of A\u03b2 in brain interstitial fluid increased with time awake and decreased during sleep; they demonstrated similar fluctuations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 levels in young humans. 7 Intriguingly, sleep deprivation in the AD mouse model produced a substantial increase in \u03b2-amyloid plaque burden. 7 We are unaware of any published studies that have investigated whether sleep disturbance is associated with neuroimaging evidence of \u03b2-amyloid in the brains of older living humans.\nWe used data from community-dwelling participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to investigate whether self-reported sleep parameters were associated with fibrillar \u03b2-amyloid burden, measured in vivo with [ 11 C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET).

Participants also completed a modified version of the five-item Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS). 20 This version queried about sleep over the past month, rather than the prior four weeks, and was administered by interview, rather than questionnaire. The first four WHIIRS items query about how often respondents \"have trouble falling asleep,\" \"wake up several times at night,\" \"wake up earlier than you planned to,\" and \"have trouble getting back to sleep\" after early waking. 20 Participants indicated the frequency of these problems on a five-point scale (0 to \u22655 times per week). On the fifth WHIIRS item, respondents rate their sleep quality on a five-point scale (\"very sound or restful\" to \"very restless\").

Responses to two WHIIRS items (i.e., early waking, difficulty falling asleep after early waking) were highly correlated with other items or had a limited distribution. Thus, we did not consider these items as individual predictors, but they were included in the WHIIRS total score calculation. Next, we fit unadjusted and multivariable (MV)-adjusted linear regression models with either continuous cDVR or precuneus DVR as the outcome. The primary predictors included sleep duration, difficulty falling asleep, waking several times, sleep quality ratings, or the WHIIRS total, with each predictor analyzed in a separate model. To account for cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, we created a dichotomous variable indicating history of heart attack or myocardial infarction, heart failure or congestive heart failure, angina, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or COPD. MV-adjusted models included age, sex, race, CES-D score, body mass index (BMI; kg/m 2 ), APOE e4 status, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and current sleep medication use (any vs. none) as covariates. Partial correlations were calculated to quantify associations between sleep variables and continuous outcomes, after controlling for covariates. We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses. In the first, we re-ran analyses after excluding participants with an MCI or dementia diagnosis. In the second, to assess how robust our results were to the assumption of the data distribution, we fit logistic regression models with dichotomous (i.e., elevated vs. low PiB binding) versions of the cDVR (\u22651.125) and precuneus DVR (\u22651.38).

There were 1.7 \u00b11.6 years (range 0.0-4.9) between PiB and the most proximal sleep measure (Table 1) . Thirty-three participants (47.1 %) were women, and 13 (18.6%) were Black. Participants had 16.8 \u00b12.3 years of education (range [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , and at sleep assessment, their mean MMSE score was 28.9 \u00b11.6, and mean CES-D score was 5.2 \u00b15.7.

This association is evident when unadjusted mean cDVR images are compared as a function of sleep duration (Figure 1 ). There was a comparable association between shorter sleep duration and precuneus DVR.

There was no association between waking several times and either cDVR or precuneus DVR, but there was a trend toward an association between greater frequency of difficulty falling asleep and both cDVR and precuneus DVR in unadjusted and adjusted analyses, and between WHIIRS total scores and both cDVR and precuneus DVR in unadjusted analyses.\nAfter removing the four participants with MCI or dementia, associations remained in adjusted models between shorter sleep duration and both cDVR (B = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.14, partial r = 0.32, p = 0.019) and precuneus DVR (B = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02, 0.18, partial r = 0.32, p = 0.021).

After adjustment for potential confounders, shorter sleep duration was associated with greater amyloid burden on continuous measures of cortical DVR (cDVR) and precuneus DVR, and worse sleep quality was associated with greater \u03b2-amyloid burden according to continuous precuneus DVR. Further, these associations remained after excluding participants with either MCI or dementia, and we observed a similar pattern of associations when using a dichotomous outcome (elevated vs. low PiB). Neither participant-reported frequency of multiple awakenings nor a global index of disturbed sleep was associated with \u03b2-amyloid burden. To our knowledge, this is the first published study of self-reported sleep and PiB PET-measured \u03b2-amyloid deposition in community-dwelling older adults.\nOur results are consistent with those from animal research in which sleep deprivation increased ISF \u03b2-amyloid. 7 These studies raise the possibility that poor sleep may promote amyloid deposition, but they also raise questions about mechanisms linking sleep/wake and amyloid burden. It has been suggested that wake-related increases in neuronal activity may mediate the association between sleep and \u03b2-amyloid levels. 7 Indeed, in AD animal models and cultured hippocampal slices, increased neuronal activity promotes generation of A\u03b2 peptide, [28] [29] [30] and the sleep state is correlated with decreases, and the wake state with increases in synaptic strength. 31, 32 Recent functional neuroimaging findings also suggest that excess neuronal excitability may contribute to AD pathogenesis. 33 Our results may have significant public health implications. AD is the most common form of dementing illness, and almost half of older adults report insomnia symptoms. 34 Because late-life sleep disturbance can be treated, to the extent that poor sleep promotes AD onset and progression, interventions to improve sleep or maintain healthy sleep among older adults may help prevent or slow AD. This would have a substantial impact on independence and quality of life of older adults and their families, and on the significant healthcare costs associated with AD.\nThe present study has several strengths, including a well-characterized community-dwelling sample, assessment of multiple sleep variables, and [ 11 C]PiB PET imaging. However, it also has limitations. First, because it is cross-sectional in design, we cannot tell whether sleep disturbance preceded \u03b2-amyloid deposition, limiting our ability to evaluate the direction of a potential causal association between poor sleep and AD. Indeed, a recent study in an AD mouse model showed that A\u03b2 aggregation is accompanied by increased sleep/wake disruption and alterations in diurnal fluctuation of A\u03b2 in ISF, and that immunization with A\u03b2 1-42 decreases A\u03b2 aggregation and preserves sleep/wake patterns and diurnal ISF fluctuation. 35 Another recent study that measured sleep using actigraphy demonstrated that, compared to those without preclinical AD, humans with preclinical AD (measured by CSF A\u03b242) spend a smaller proportion of time in bed asleep (i.e., they have lower sleep efficiency). 36 It has been suggested that, while poor sleep may promote initial A\u03b2 aggregation, amyloid deposition may promote derangements of sleep/wake that feed forward to promote amyloid deposition, and that prospective studies are needed to characterize the association between sleep/wake disruption and amyloid deposition. 35 A second limitation of our study is that our sleep measures were based on self-report and did not include objective measures (e.g., wrist actigraphy, polysomnography). Self-report sleep measures can be influenced by lower cognitive function, 37 and in some cases are only modestly correlated or even uncorrelated with objective sleep measures. 38 Replication of findings using objective sleep measures would clarify whether perceptions of poor sleep and objective sleep indices are differentially associated with AD pathology. Third, the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases with age, 39 and SDB has been linked to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 40 Studies using polysomnography are needed to investigate whether SDB contributes to \u03b2-amyloid deposition, 41 and whether SDB drives the association we observed between poor sleep quality and \u03b2-amyloid burden. Finally, in our sleep duration measure, the response option for those with the longest sleep duration was \">7 hours,\" placing those obtaining 8 hours of sleep in the same category as those obtaining 11 hours. Consequently, we could not test hypotheses about very long sleepers compared to those with more intermediate sleep duration (e.g., 7 to 8 hours), with respect to \u03b2-amyloid burden."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings in a sample of community-dwelling older adults indicate that reports of shorter sleep and lower sleep quality are associated with greater \u03b2-amyloid burden.
