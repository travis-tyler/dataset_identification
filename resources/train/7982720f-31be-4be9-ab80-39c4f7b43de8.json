[{"section_title": "", "text": "The benefits of breastfeeding for mother, infant, and family are numerous, including a reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction, breast cancer, and diabetes for the mother and a reduction in pediatric deaths due to sudden infant death syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants (Bartick et al., 2017). For these reasons, the World Health Organization (2002) recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding alongside appropriate complementary foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. Despite these benefits and recommendations, there continue to be personal, societal, and institutional barriers to achieving optimal breastfeeding in the United States (Dunn, Kalich, Henning, & Fedrizzi, 2015;Grubesic & Durbin, 2017). Improving breastfeeding rates is a national public health priority; this priority is stipulated in the Healthy People 2020 goals set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2012) to promote health and prevent disease. Despite the prioritizing of breastfeeding at a national level, significant health disparities by race and ethnicity, poverty, education, and location persist (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017;N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 2016). The environment in which a woman gives birth may be an important determinant of breastfeeding initiation. Hospitals have historically employed practices that undermine successful breastfeeding (e.g., rooming newborns in separate rooms from their mothers and frequently supplementing with formula). To encourage practices that protect, promote, and support breastfeeding, the World Health Organization proposed a new standard for birthing facilities called the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI;United Nations Children's Fund, 2006). The BFHI has since been associated with improved breastfeeding outcomes in the United States and globally (Kramer et al., 2001;Salera-Vieira & Zembo, 2016). To become designated as Baby-Friendly, a birth facility must meet the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (World Health Organization & United Nations Children's Fund, 2009). These steps include implementing policies and practices to support breastfeeding through measurable actions (e.g., patient education, early skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant, and not providing formula unless medically necessary). Step 10 states that facilities need to foster breastfeeding support in the community and refer mothers to this support. In the United States, this step requires the provision of information regarding postdischarge sources of breastfeeding support, such as community-based peer support groups, lactation clinics, and telephone helplines (Baby-Friendly USA, 2016); however, Step 10 has been critiqued by experts as difficult to implement despite its potential to affect maternal breastfeeding decisions (Munn, Newman, Mueller, Phillips, & Taylor, 2016). The presence of a Baby-Friendly facility may itself change the landscape of breastfeeding support in a community in ways that are not directly quantified, potentially by attracting lactation professionals to the area and changing breastfeeding norms among health care professionals themselves. The impact of the BFHI is not well characterized in the southeastern region of the United States, where significant breastfeeding disparities persist (Munn et al., 2016). Within this region, North Carolina is a state comprising Appalachian, Piedmont, and coastal regions whose significant cultural divides and socioeconomic disparities may influence initiation rates. North Carolina began tracking breastfeeding initiation at hospital discharge on birth certificates in 2011 prior to the majority of Baby-Friendly hospital (BFH) designations in the state. This provides the opportunity to evaluate the impact of the BFHI on breastfeeding initiation across the diverse landscape of North Carolina.

Within North Carolina, geographic variation in breastfeeding practices and lactation support has been observed, with lower breastfeeding rates and fewer International Board Certified Lactation Consultants in rural counties than in more populated areas of the state (Wouk, Chetwynd, Vitaglione, & Sullivan, 2017). Breastfeeding initiation rates in North Carolina also vary considerably by racial/ethnic group: Among low-income infants participating in federally funded maternal and child health programs, only 53.7% of Black infants and 55% of American Indian/Alaska Native infants were ever breastfed compared to 63.3% of White infants (North Carolina Division of Public Health, 2011). As a result of these disparities, we used North Carolina birth certificate data from 2011 to 2014 to investigate the impact of the BFHI, exploring potential differences across rural and urban counties."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "A total of 491,150 pregnancies occurring between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014, was included in the original data set.

All births were categorized as having occurred at a BFH or not [referent]. The BFH designation status was assessed using the publicly available data from Baby-Friendly USA. All births occurring during or after the month of designation were classified as BFH deliveries. Rurality was determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2016) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes are published each decennial. The codes used in this analysis were published in 2013. Each county in the United States is assigned one of nine categories by population, and counties with fewer than 20,000 residents are further categorized by adjacency to a metropolitan area. Each of the nine categories is designated metro or nonmetro. County boundaries were obtained from NC OneMap (North Carolina Geographic Information Coordinating Council, n.d.), a free repository of statewide geospatial data. A key to deidentify individual hospitals was obtained from the state (S. Evans, personal communication, March 10, 2016). BFH status was determined using the Baby-Friendly USA (2018) Web site, which publishes the month and year of designation."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "To determine the association between birth at a BFH and breastfeeding initiation, a logistic regression was performed. Community exposure to a BFH was defined as maternal residence within a county with a BFH. In the logistic regression, county of residence was also dichotomized as metropolitan or rural using USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, wherein rural was assigned to all nonmetro classifications. The term rural is used hereafter to describe residence in a nonmetro county. The logistic model included the following sociodemographic and clinical variables thought to confound the relationship between delivery at a BFH and breastfeeding initiation: education (less than high school, high school graduate or General Education Development recipient, some college, bachelor's degree, master's degree, or PhD), race & ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and other), principal source of payment (Medicaid, private insurance, selfpay, other), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) utilization, maternal age, obesity, quality of prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck Index (inadequate, intermediate, adequate, and adequate plus), induction of labor, route of birth (vaginal or cesarean), and birth attendance by a midwife. Confounders were included based on previous literature suggesting an association with breastfeeding outcomes and place of residence. The association between birth at a BFH and breastfeeding initiation was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. All models were analyzed with Version 14.0 of Stata (2014). Mothers who resided in a county with a BFH were considered to have a community exposure to a BFH. Stratified multivariate logistic regressions were run for mothers who resided in metro counties, to determine the association between community exposure to a BFH and breastfeeding initiation. This model evaluated community exposure of a BFH as an interaction term with birth at a BFH. The predicted margins of the interaction terms and single exposures were computed and compared for differences by two-tailed Student t test in Prism (2018; significant at \u03b1 = .05). Three exposures were considered: birth in a BFH without residence in a county with a BFH (hospital-only exposure), residence in a county with a BFH without giving birth at a BFH (community-only exposure), and both birth at a BFH and residence in a community with a BFH (double exposed). These predicted probabilities were compared to births with neither birth in a BFH nor maternal residence in a community with a BFH (double unexposed). There were no BFHs in nonmetro counties, so the community exposure could not be determined for mothers who resided in nonmetro counties. Several descriptive studies were performed to compare the affect of birth at a BFH and community exposure to a BFH by metropolitan and rural residence. First, the percentage of births to county residents occurring at a BFH was superimposed on a map of the North Carolina counties using their rural-urban USDA designation. The percentage of births where breastfeeding was initiated was mapped, and hot-spot and cold-spot analyses were performed in ArcGIS (ArcGIS Desktop, 2011). Hospitals were geocoded by addresses publicly available online. The logistic regression residuals were aggregated by county to determine the mean residual and standard deviation of residuals for each county. The mean and standard deviation of residuals were mapped using county boundaries published by NC OneMap and analyzed for spatial autocorrelation in ArcGIS. Both mean residuals and the standard deviation of residuals were displayed using four categories determined by natural breaks (Jenks) within ArcGIS. A logistic regression was repeated, including only rural residents with a dummy variable representing adjacency to the metropolitan county (data not shown). The logistic regression was run independently for each of the population tiers of the USDA nonmetro classifications. Predictive margins of the association of hospital-only exposure on breastfeeding initiation were calculated for rural residents and plotted to compare to metropolitan residents."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Sample", "text": "Characteristics of births that occurred at a BFH and nondesignated hospital are presented in Table 1.

Notable sociodemographic differences between mothers who gave birth at a BFH and those who did not include the observation that mothers who gave birth at a BFH more frequently had private insurance, identified as non-Hispanic White, and less frequently received WIC assistance.

Hospital exposure was associated with an increased probability of initiating breastfeeding for all of the following population tiers in rural counties (see Figure 2): >20,000 residents, >2,500 residents, and <2,500 residents. Metropolitan residents who gave birth in a BFH had the highest probability of breastfeeding without an additional likelihood of initiating breastfeeding with community exposure to a BFH (see Figure 3). Rural residents who delivered at a BFH had probabilities of breastfeeding comparable to metropolitan mothers with community-only exposure to a BFH or no exposure to a BFH."}, {"section_title": "Geospatial Analysis of Model", "text": "Spatial analysis showed that the percentage of births at a BFH among all county residents was spatially clustered around BFHs (see Figure 4), which was expected. Two of the five BFHs are not located in hot spots of breastfeeding initiation (see Figure 5). Mean residuals from the model showed significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.39, p < .01), suggestive of clustering. Negative residuals correspond to overestimation of the odds of breastfeeding initiation and positive residuals correspond to underestimation. A contiguous band of counties wherein the model overestimated the odds of breastfeeding occurs roughly at the interface between the Piedmont and coastal plain regions in the north of the state. The blue areas in Figure 4 represent negative mean residuals, which is to say that we would expect higher rates of breastfeeding initiation than actually observed in those areas on the basis of predictors of breastfeeding initiation included in the model. Ten of the 11 contiguous counties with low mean county residuals are also in the breastfeeding cold spot from Figure 2. This overlap suggests that the model is less accurate in predicting breastfeeding initiation in counties that exhibit a lower frequency of breastfeeding initiation. There are likely important confounding predictors of breastfeeding initiation unique to these regions that are not included in the  model. These may include racial/ethnic inequities, diversity of local economies (agriculture, manufacturing, financial, academic), employment landscape (large vs. small business), and childcare climate. In Figure 6, darkness corresponds to increasing standard deviation. The distribution of the standard deviations also exhibited spatial autocorrelation suggestive of clustering (Moran's I = 0.36, p < .01). The model exhibited the least standard deviation of residuals in the central region of the state as well as the western region of the state. Both regions include counties of metropolitan and rural classifications. There is some overlap of these regions and the breastfeeding hot spots identified in Figure 2. Of the eight counties composing the western hot spot in Figure 2, four of them exhibit the lowest standard deviation of residuals in Figure 6. Of the five counties composing the eastern hot spot, two of them had the lowest deviation of residuals in Figure 6. This suggests that the model still has varying predictive value in areas with a high frequency of breastfeeding initiation. Additional analyses could stratify the means and standard deviations of residuals by race/ethnicity, principal source of payment, or WIC utilization at both the state level and within a county in order to test the robustness of the model in different communities."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our study found that birth at a BFH in North Carolina was associated with increased odds of breastfeeding initiation. Nationally, BFHs have rates of breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity above Healthy People 2020 goals, with select BFHs reporting breastfeeding initiation rates of more than 90% in recent years (Merewood, 2005;Terry, Barnes, Beal, Enciso, & Love-Zaranka, 2016). Terry et al. (2016) found an increase in the birth rate after achieving Baby-Friendly designation, which suggests that women may be actively choosing to give birth at a BFH. We found that 5.3% of rural mothers and 2.9% of metropolitan mothers in North Carolina gave birth at a BFH despite the lack of a BFH in their community. Women who give birth at a BFH outside their community may be actively seeking a Baby-Friendly environment for its associated benefits. We further explored whether the presence of a BFH in a mother's community increased her likelihood of breastfeeding. This study did not observe a significant increase in breastfeeding initiation among mothers with communityonly exposure to BFH or an additive affect of having both community and hospital exposure; however, this study may be underpowered to detect these differences because the confidence intervals around the community-only exposures are large. More research is needed into how the presence of a BFH in a county may improve breastfeeding initiation even among women who deliver at different facilities (spillover effect). There are several pathways through which a BFH's presence might affect the community breastfeeding landscape. First, achieving Baby-Friendly designation involves training health care professionals about the benefits of breastfeeding; however, the dispersion of this knowledge into individual-level practices is unknown. Second, Baby-Friendly designation may shift occupational cultures in important ways to promote breastfeeding among employees. Future studies of employee breastfeeding knowledge, understanding, and practices before and after Baby-Friendly designation could explore this possibility. We observed geospatial disparities in how well previously identified determinants of breastfeeding predicted breastfeeding initiation across North Carolina. These findings align with geospatial trends in breastfeeding observed in another analysis of county-level breastfeeding rates using birth certificate data in Kentucky (Grubesic & Durbin, 2016). As we did in our study, they found lower rates of breastfeeding initiation in rural counties and demonstrated that these lower rates persisted over time because of barriers like unemployment and lack of lactation support resources (Grubesic & Durbin, 2016). Their study also found that the presence of an interstate highway in rural areas correlated with breastfeeding hot spots, highlighting the transportation challenges faced by rural communities in accessing health care, including BFHs. We observed both breastfeeding hot spots and cold spots occurring around interstate highways in North Carolina. The three BFHs located within the breastfeeding hot spots intersect with interstates, supporting Grubesic and Durbin's Moderation effect of presence of Baby-Friendly hospital in maternal community of residence. Probability of initiating breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge was computed from predictive margins of multivariate logistic regression models for residents of a metropolitan county by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. Community only = mothers who had a Baby-Friendly hospital in their county of residence but did not give birth at that facility; Hospital only = mothers who did not have a Baby-Friendly hospital in their community but did give birth at one; Double unexposed = mothers who did not give birth at a Baby-Friendly hospital or have a Baby-Friendly hospital in their community. For nonmetro residents, hospital-only exposure was considered as no rural counties in North Carolina have a BFH within their community. Nonmetro analyses were performed for each USDA population tier: >20,000 residents, 2,500-19,999 residents, and <2,500 residents.  findings that interstate access may be a particularly important aspect of utilizing a BFH. Additionally, we found that the two BFHs in breastfeeding cold spots (see Figure 2) were not near an interstate or bordered the ocean, likely limiting accessibility. A subsequent analysis of breastfeeding support resources in Ohio found that BFHs were more likely to be present in more affluent, more educated, and more diverse catchment areas (Grubesic & Durbin, 2017), reflecting potentially differential access to breastfeeding support among rural and metropolitan residents. Our study similarly noted that there were no BFHs located in nonmetropolitan counties in North Carolina. Their study concluded that access to WIC may be a particularly important breastfeeding support resource in rural communities, given its presence within each county. Whereas we controlled for utilization of WIC in our multivariate analyses, future studies may investigate the interaction between both WIC and birth at a BFH on breastfeeding. We suspect that the presence of a BFH in a community may impact local WIC culture and practices that subsequently improve community breastfeeding resources. We evaluated the robustness of our model across counties and identified a large region of North Carolina, wherein well-established predictors of breastfeeding systemically overestimate breastfeeding initiation. The continuous area where the model fit poorly occurred in eastern North Carolina, a predominantly rural area with significant health disparities. Another study evaluating the density of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants and county-level breastfeeding initiation observed breastfeeding disparities in the same regions of North Carolina (Wouk et al., 2017). This study found the prevalence of any breastfeeding at 6 weeks to be lowest in the eastern coastal plain and southern Piedmont counties. These are the same counties that exhibited systematic overestimation of breastfeeding initiation in our analysis. The overestimation suggests either that important confounding variables are systematically missing from our analysis or that the literature-supported predictors of breastfeeding in these rural areas do not adhere to the same trends. Comparing marginal affects on breastfeeding between rural and metropolitan residents, we found that metropolitan residents without hospital or community exposure to the BFHI have a higher probability of initiating breastfeeding (p < .01) than rural residents without hospital or community exposure to the BFHI. However, rural residents who give birth at a BFH exhibit breastfeeding initiation probabilities similar to mothers in metropolitan areas. This suggests that giving birth at a BFH may be a modifiable predictor of breastfeeding initiation that can mitigate some of the disparity observed between rural and urban populations."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study is limited by characteristics of the study design as a retrospective secondary analysis. We also used an aggregation of individual outcomes to the county level. Counties may not reflect the granularity of local environments where breastfeeding support resources are provided. This analysis also considered only BFHI designated hospitals. The North Carolina Division of Public Health recognizes hospitals' incremental actions toward achievement of the 10 steps they would need for Baby-Friendly status (North Carolina Division of Public Health, Nutrition Services Branch, 2017). Future analysis should consider the spectrum of breastfeeding support services offered at hospitals. Controlling for the presence of hospitals that actively support breastfeeding would clarify the relationship between community and hospital exposure to the BFHI. Breastfeeding initiation is also a crude proxy of the health behavior that optimizes infant and maternal health. Many of the mothers who initiate breastfeeding may fail to meet other breastfeeding milestones; for example, it is likely that the frequency of breastfeeding initiation greatly exceeds continued breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum. It is also possible that some hospitals may not consider mothers who express human milk as having initiated breastfeeding, which could lead to an underestimation of those practicing human milk feeding."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The BFHI is associated with higher odds of breastfeeding initiation in North Carolina.
