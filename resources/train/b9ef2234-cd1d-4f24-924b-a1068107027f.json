[{"section_title": "I.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Adoption of technology is an extensively studied topic in agricultural economics. A plethora of empirical literature has identified a wide range of factors that influence technology adoption decisions by farmers. Among such factors, and being consistent with the human capital theory, education may be one of the most frequently used variables in empirical models. Research points out that education is positively correlated with technology adoption. In agriculture, farmers with higher education have better access to information and knowledge that are beneficial to farming operation. They also tend to possess higher analytic capability of the information and knowledge necessary to successfully implement new technology and realize expected results. Hence, higher education allows farmers to make efficient adoption decision Rahm and Huffman, 1984 and early adopters who can take advantage of new technology are likely to extract maximum profit Gardner and Rausser, 2001 . Highly educated farmers also tend to adopt technology with greater intensity Saha, et al., 1994 . The objective of this study, however, is to challenge this conventional brief. We believe that it is possible that education could potentially have a negative effect on technology adoption in agriculture. Take the case of education and labor supply, both on and off-farm. Education increases farmers' human capital and gives them more lucrative incentives for employment opportunities off the farm, which in turn decreases the managerial time on farm to implement new technologies and realize the expected results 1 . This is particularly true for management intensive technologies. This study empirically examines this theory. Considering the facts that the number of farmers with college education has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years Mishra, et al., 2009 and increasing share of farm household income is from off-farm sources Fernandez-Cornejo, 2007 , it is crucial to accurately assess the effect of education on technology adoption in the context of labor allocation between on and off the farm by farm households. In so doing, we estimate a simultaneous equations model that coalesce labor allocation and technology adoption models using 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS data. Technologies considered in this study are precision farming as a representative of management intensive technology and genetically modified GM crops as a representative of management saving technology. We estimate this model following the procedure suggested by Nelson and Olson 1978 to obtain asymptotically consistent estimates of parameters of our interest. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews existing literature on the relationship between education, technology adoption and off-farm labor supply in agriculture. Section III provides analytical framework, followed by empirical results in Section IV. The final section offers concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "II. Literature Review", "text": "In order to lay a comprehensive theoretical foundation about the net effect of education on technology adoption, we attempt to unite findings from three different topics in agricultural economics literature. We first review empirical findings about the effect of education on technology adoption, followed by the effect of education on off-farm labor supply. Finally, we shed light on recent studies that account for these two effects into a single model to explain simultaneous decision making process through which farmers allocate their time between off-farm and on-farm activities, including technology adoption."}, {"section_title": "Education and Adoption", "text": "In agriculture, human capital of farm operators can be represented by a number of different ways, with formal education and farming experiences being two of the most commonly adopted measures. Although farming experience can be a preferred measure in a static environment in which accumulated knowledge in farming operation or on-the-job training experiences do not depreciate or become obsolete, formal education is widely considered to be the most important form of human capital Becker, 1994 in a dynamic political and economic environment where new technology and information are regularly developed Gardner and Rausser, 2001 . In such a more realistic setting, formal schooling will play a more prominent role than farming experience for farm operators to constantly update their knowledge and farming practices to stay competitive. A number of empirical studies have shown the positive effect of education on adoption of various types of technology in agriculture. For example, education is found to have a positive impact on adoption of forward pricing methods Goodwin and Schroeder, 1994 , computer technology Huffman and Mercier, 1991;Putler and Zilberman, 1988 , use of the internet Mishra and Park, 2005;Mishra, et al., 2009 , reduced tillage Rahm andHuffman, 1984 , recombinant bovine somatotropin rbST Klotz, et al., 1995, precision farming Roberts, et al., 2004, genetically engineered corn Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2001 , soil nitrogen testing Bosch, 1995 , conservation practices Traore, et al., 1998 and the level of participation in government-supported conservation programs Lambert, et al., 2007 , to name a few. On the other hand, there are also some empirical evidences of insignificant or even negative effect of education on technology adoption. Farmers' education has insignificant effect on adoption of variable rate technology Khanna, 2001 and GPS guidance system for cotton farmers Banerjee, et al., 2008 . Nyaupane andGillespie 2009 identified factors affecting adoption of best management practices BMP for Louisiana crawfish producers, but education was found to be insignificant for adoption of all but one BMP, where education was found to be negatively correlated with BMP adoption. There are studies that discovered mixed effects of education on different technologies; Soule, et al., 2000 found that education positively affected adoption of conservation tillage whereas it had no significant impact on adoption of medium term practices such as contour farming, strip cropping, and grassed waterway; Wozniak 1984 found a positive impact of education on adoption of cattle feeding technology but not such impact is found for implanting technology."}, {"section_title": "Gould et al. 1989 studied factors affecting adoption of conservation tillage for", "text": "Wisconsin farmers. They unexpectedly found that education is negatively correlated with adoption, holding other factors such as the proportion of off-farm work time to on-farm work time, among others constant. This implies that highly educated farmers are less likely to adopt conservation tillage, given the same proportion of off and on farm work time. Because highly educated farmers are more likely to earn higher wages from off-farm work, they are expected to have a higher proportion of off-farm income to on-farm income given the same proportion of on and off farm work time. Therefore, it seems plausible if highly educated farmers, who are more reliant on off-farm income, have fewer incentives to spend time and effort on farming, including adoption of technology such as conservation tillage. As these examples show, the effect of education on technology adoption in empirical literature has yet to reach a consensus consistent with the economic theory. Although the mixed empirical evidence might to some extent be explained by factors such as type of technology and diffusion process of the technology Gardner and Rausser, 2001 , relatively little attention has been paid to explore underlying reasons for such incoherent findings perhaps because the underlying theory seems intuitively too appealing to refute."}, {"section_title": "Education and Off Farm Labor Supply", "text": "One possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results about the effect of education on technology adoption may be attributed to the relationship between education and off-farm labor. The recent trend of increasing off-farm labor supply by U.S. farm households can be attributed to 1 relative increase in non-farm sector real wage, 2 decrease in demand for farm labor and family labor housework due to development of labor saving technologies Gardner and Rausser, 2001 . Highly educated farmers have higher incentives to work more off the farm, ceteris paribus. As human capital accumulated through longer years of formal education becomes an advantage to find more off-farm employment opportunities, which makes farming relatively less attractive. Theoretically, however, the effect of education on off-farm labor supply is ambiguous; while higher education increases employment opportunities off the farm, farms with highly educated operator may realize higher productivity in farming operation and thus reservation wage to work off-farm for such operators may be high Hallberg, et al., 1991;Huffman and Lange, 1989Hallberg, et al., 1991, Huffman and Lange, 1989 . The existing literature has mostly found that education is positively correlated with both off-farm labor participation and the intensity of off-farm work Huffman, 1980;Huffman and Lange, 1989 , indicating that the marginal effect of education on off-farm wage is higher than the marginal effect of education on the reservation wage. For instance, Goodwin and Mishra 2004 found a strong and positive effect of education on off-farm labor participation; an additional year of education leads an increase in off-farm labor supply by fifteen hours annually. Huffman 1980 estimated the effect of education on the odds ratio of off-farm work participation and the number of days worked off-farm by farm operators. The study found a positive and significant effect of education on both the odds ratio and the number of days working off-farm by operator. From theoretical standpoint, there are two seemingly contradicting effects of education on technology adoption. On one hand, higher education leads to more technology adoption, but on the other hand, higher education increases off-farm labor supply, which inevitably affects on-farm labor supply available for technology adoption 2 . The mixed findings about the effect of education on technology adoption in empirical literature can perhaps be attributed to the fact that conventional technology adoption models do not fully account for the role of off-farm labor supply."}, {"section_title": "Technology Adoption and Labor Allocation", "text": "Although studies that have combined technology adoption and labor allocation into a single model had been largely nonexistent until recently, exceptions are Fernandez-2 Although it is theoretically possible that increased off-farm labor income provides farmers with financial flexibility to implement a new technology, Wozniak 1993 concluded that the negative impact of reallocation of operators' time away from farming on technology adoption seems to be more significant than the financial flexibility due to off-farm income. Cornejo et. al. 2005 andFernandez-Cornejo 2007 . The former explored the simultaneous process through which operators and spouses allocate their time between on and off farm work and its relation to adoption of herbicide tolerant HT soybean as a representative of time saving technology. The study found a positive correlation between education and off-farm work for operators but not for spouses. Also, the impact of education on adoption of HT soybeans was not statistically significant. The study by Fernandez-Cornejo 2007 employed a model similar to Fernandez-Cornejo et. al. 2005 but it included adoption of yield monitors, which is required for precision agriculture, as a representative of management intensive technology. The study confirmed a negative correlation between adoption of yield monitor and off-farm income. However, they did not specify if education has a significant effect on adoption of yield monitor as it was not their primary interest. In this study, we extend models developed by Fernandez-Cornejo 2007 andFernandez-Cornejo et. al. 2005 to estimate the net effect of education on adoption of two different technologies: GM crops and precision farming. We do so by including in our model the interaction between farm size and education. The correlation between adoption, education and farm size is of particular interest because small farms are more likely to work off-farm Fernandez-Cornejo, 2007 and less likely to adopt management intensive technology Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2001;Saha, et al., 1994 . Therefore, one can capture the net effect of education that varies across farm sizes. Further, in order to test the robustness of our findings we use two measures of farm size-namely value of agricultural sales and total acres operated."}, {"section_title": "III.

The system we consider here consists of four equations: adoption of precision farming, adoption of GM crops, and off-farm labor supply by farm operators and spouses. Based on the general results above, we can express the technology adoption and labor allocation model as follows: , where y is a dummy variable that takes 1 if the farm employs precision farming and 0 otherwise, y is also a dummy variable that takes 1 if the farm adopts GM crops and 0 otherwise. y and y are off-farm working hours for th farm operators and spouses with y and y being the latent variable of y and y , respectively. and are unknown constants and , , and are vectors of unknown parameters to be estimated. , , and are vectors of exogenous variables.

The error terms, \u03b5 , \u03b5 and \u03b5 are assumed to be normally distributed with zero means but we assume that \u03b5 and \u03b5 are correlated with each other at . We first estimate the reduced form equations of 8 and 9 in which endogenous variables, and , are absent. We employ Tobit model as the dependent variables, annual off-farm working hours by operators and spouses, are censored variables bounded from below at zero. Then, we obtain linear prediction of the latent variable, y and y , which are used as instruments in the second stage estimation of adoption of GM crops and precision farming by bivariate probit model."}, {"section_title": "Interaction between Education and Farm Size", "text": "The primary interest of this study lies in estimating the effect on technology adoption of the interaction between education and farm size as an approximation of the Equation 12 shows that is now dependent on as well as a new regressor that is a product of the two variables of interest, and . However, following this method and creating a product of education and farm size would not allow us to fully capture the potential interaction between education and farm size. This is because we expect that the coefficient of the interaction term, equivalent to in equation 12 in the above example, will not be a constant. Therefore, instead of simply creating a product of the two variables, we employed the following steps to estimate the interaction between the two variables. First, as a measurement of farm size, we select gross cash farm income gcfi . Next, we create dummy variables for each quintile of gcfi. Then we multiply each of the five dummy variables with education to create five interaction variables each of which represents different levels of farm size in terms of farm income. We include four of the five dummy variables created, each representing first, second, fourth and fifth quintile of farm size, into the regression model and assume coefficient of each dummy variable is associated with education as in equation 11 4 .For the lowest quintile interaction variable, for example, we expect the sign of coefficient to be smaller than those for higher quintile interactions. This is because, for smaller farms, more educated operators are likely to work more off-farm and thus adopt fewer technologies. For the highest quintile, on the other hand, we expect the sign of coefficient to be more elusive 5 . The point we wish to clarify here is that we expect the effects of interaction between farm size and education to be different for small farms with higher education and large farms with lower education. If this is the case, simply multiplying education and farm size does not capture such conflicting effects."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This study employs 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS data. ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The ARMS, which has a complex stratified, multiframe design, is a national survey conducted annually by the Economic Research Service ERS and the cs Service for more detail, see National Agricultural Statisti http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/ARMS/ . Each observation in the ARMS represents a number of similar farms, the particular number being the survey expansion factor or the inverse of the probability of the surveyed farm being selected for surveying , and is referred to henceforth as survey weight, or w i i 1, \u2026, n, where n denotes sample size . To demonstrate, the size of the samples considered in the analysis was 4,674 which when properly expanded using survey weights yielded populations of farm operator households totaling 345,241. The ARMS collects data to measure the financial condition farm income, expenses, assets, and debt and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. The 2006 ARMS also collected information on farm households; in addition to farm economic data, the survey contains detailed information on off-farm hours worked by spouses and farm operators, the amount of income received from off-farm work, net cash income from operating another farm/ranch, net cash income from operating another business, and net income from share renting. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the 48 contiguous states. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 of agricultural products during the year. Due to the nature of the study dairy farms are excluded from the sample. Farms can be organized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, non-family corporations, or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator. A senior farm operator is the operator who makes the majority of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms run by hired managers were excluded. Table 1 provides the complete list of variables used in this study, their definitions and descriptive statistics. Finally, following Goodwin and Mishra 2004 we adopt a bootstrapping approach that consistently accounts for the stratification inherent in the survey design 6 . The ARMS database contains a population-weighting factor that indicates the number of farms in the population i.e., all U.S. farms represented by each individual observation. We utilize the weighting population-weighting factor factor in a probability weighted bootstrapping procedure. Specifically, the data selecting N observations from the sample data are sampled with replacement. The models are estimated using the pseudo sample of data. This process is repeated a large number of times and estimates of the parameters and their variances are given by sample means and variance of the replicated estimates. We utilize 2,000 replications in the application that follows."}, {"section_title": "IV. Results and Discussion", "text": "Maximum likelihood estimates of the first stage Tobit models of off-farm labor supply by operators and spouses are provided in Table 2. The results show that, for both operators and spouses, off-farm labor supply is positively correlated with education and age. Highly educated operators and spouses are more likely to work off-farm as suggested by past literature Hallberg, et al., 1991;Huffman, 1980;Huffman and Lange, 1989  The presence of children in family hh6, hh7-13, and hh14-17 has no significant impact on operators' off-farm labor supply, whereas it has negative and significant impact on spouses, who are mostly female. The younger the children, the larger the negative impact on off-farm labor supply for spouses, however, presence of children between age 14 and 17, has no significant impact on spouses' off-farm labor supply. This is consistent with the views that the presence of young children requires more childcare Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2005;Kimhi and Lee, 1996 Lambert, et al., 2006 . Overall, results from Table 2 underlie the importance of including spouses in the analysis of off-farm labor supply by farm households Goodwin and Mishra, 2004 . The effects of tenure, presence of young children in the family, farm location and government payments are all found to be significant but signs of the coefficients may be different on offfarm labor supply by operators and spouses. Next we estimate the second stage bivariate probit model of technology adoption for precision farming PF and GM crops using the predicted values of off-farm labor supply by operators and spouses ools_hat and sols_hat 7 obtained in the first stage as instruments. Parameter estimates and summary statistics are presented in Table 3, while Table 4 presents the marginal effects of explanatory variables on probability of adopting precision farming PF or GM crops 8 . The Wald test statistic suggests that the null hypothesis of no correlation between two error terms can be rejected at 1% significance level, which supports the use of bivariate probit model instead of two separate probit models. In the case of precision farming PF adoption, the predicted value of operators' offfarm labor supply ools_hat has a marginally insignificant coefficient estimate p-value of 0.13 while coefficient of sols_hat, the predicted value of spouses' off-farm labor supply, is not significant. This is contrary to our expectation that adoption of management intensive technology like PF is negatively correlated with off-farm labor supply. This may be due to the relatively broad definition of precision farming in our data. The 2006 version of ARMS queried respondents on adopt any precision farming practices that reduce production costs. 7 Strictly speaking, ools_hat and sols_hat are the predicted value of the latent variable of off-farm labor supply by farm operators and spouses, repectively. However, we refer to them as \"predicted value of off-farm labor supply\" or simply \"off-farm labor supply\" to keep the notation simple and to avoid wordiness. 8 GM crops included in the analysis presented in Table 3 and 4 are corn, soybeans and cottons. We have also conducted analysis using only GM corn and soybeans. See Coefficients of interaction between operators' education and total acres are partially , inconsistent with our expectation but they nonetheless provide interesting results. First of all, note that coefficient of education educ represents the effect of education on technology adoption either precision farming or GM crops for the base group farmers whose total operated acres belong to the third quintile from 41 st percentile to 60 th percentile . For precision farming, educ is found to be positive and significant whereas it is negative and significant for GM crops. Coefficient estimates of interaction between operators' education and total acres oeduc*ac1 ~oeduc*ac5 relative to the base group are negative and significant for farms with smaller acreages oeduc*ac1 and oeduc*ac2 and positive and significant for farms with larger acreages oeduc*ac4 and oeduc*ac5 for both precision farming and GM crops. Marginal effects estimates evaluated at means of explanatory variables shows that the absolute values of marginal effects become larger as the total acreage deviates away from the base group of the third quintile, again for both precision farming and GM Crops. In other words, the effect of education on technology adoption is dependent on farm size represented by total acres and the larger the total acres are, the stronger the effect of education on adoption of both precision farming and GM crops. For instance, the marginal effect of 0.0096 for the base group farmers whose total acres belong to the third quintile means that an additional year of education for farm operators increases probability of precision farming adoption by 0.96%. The corresponding probabilities become even larger for farms with larger acreage oeduc*ac4 and oeduc*ac5 ; probability of precision farming adoption in increased by 1.1% 0.0096 0.0018 for farms with fourth quintile total operated acres and by 1.4% 0.0096 0.0044 for farms with fifth quintile total operated acres. On the other hand, farms with smaller acreage has lower probabilities of adopting precision farming; the marginal effect of operators' education is 0.56% 0.0096 -0.0038 and 0.55% 0.0096 -0.0039 for farms with second and first quintile total operated acres, respectively. In summary, marginal effect of education on probability of precision farming adoption is positive for farms at all levels of farm size, but the effect is larger for farms with large total operated acres. Although the increasing marginal effect of education according to total acres also holds true for GM crops, the notable difference from precision farming is that the marginal effects of operators' education on GM crops adoption are negative at all levels of total acres. An additional year of education decreases probability of GM crops adoption by 1.2% -0.0063 -0.0057 for farms whose total acres classified into the first quintile, and analogous probabilities for farms with second through fifth quintiles are, respectively, -0.88%, -0.63%, -0.44%, and -0.28%. It is surprising that education has a negative impact on technology adoption, however, several explanations could be for this unexpected results. First, precision farming is more human capital intensive whereas GM crops are considered a time-saving and convenient technology Smith, 2002 . Different labor and human capital requirements of the two technologies might have caused smaller marginal effects estimates of education on adoption of GM crops relative to precision farming. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the controversy over manipulation of gene structures in GM crops might have discouraged its adoption, especially for highly educated farmers, leading to negative marginal effects. Note that marginal effects of education on GM crops adoption are negative regardless of the size of farming operation, but they become less negative as the farm size increases. However, farmers' risk perceptions about GM crops are not observed in 2006 versions of ARMS data and thus we are unable to verify such claim in this study. In order to examine the robustness of our specification of farm size proxy via total acres , we also estimated the same two stage models using interaction between education and gross cash farm income, following Mishra and Park 2005 . We also estimated each model with another definition of GM crops that only includes corn and soybeans in addition to the original definition that includes corn, soybeans and cotton, which was reported in Table 3 and 4. Estimates of marginal effects of education for these four models are summarized in Table 5. The results are similar when we replace total operated acres by farm income and for alternate definitions of GM crops. The fact that all but two marginal effect estimates have significant coefficients and marginal effects in four different models validates inclusion of the interaction between education and farm size in our model. It also confirms our expectation that the effect of education on technology adoption do vary across farm sizes, holding off-farm labor supply by farm operators constant. As we expected, the effect of education is smaller for small farms for adoption of both precision farming and GM crops and, contrary to our expectation, it becomes negative for adoption of GM crops. Now we turn back to results in Table 3 and 4 to interpret coefficients and marginal effects of other explanatory variables. For precision farming, operators' age opage has positive and age squared opage2 has negative coefficients, as expected, but they are not significant for GM crops. Total operated acres in operation divided by 1,000 acres/1,000 has no significant impact on adoption of precision farming but has a positive and significant impact on adoption of GM crops; an increase in total operated acres by 1,000 acres increases probability of GM crops adoption by 0.69%. Household net worth and average interest rates charged on loans are two variables that represent financial status of farm households netw and interest and they are included only in precision farming equation on the assumption that precision farming is capital intensive while GM crops are not. While new worth is not found significant, interest rate has a positive impact on probability of precision farming adoption. This supports the above claim that adoption of precision farming is capital intensive and those who have higher probability of adopting it would be willing to take on loans with higher interest rates. The degree of risk aversion 9 risk , measured by ratio of crop insurance expenses to total variable costs, as proposed by Goodwin and Rejesus 2008 , has  Estimates for fowner and ftenant represent effects of being a full owner or tenant relative to the effect of being in the excluded base group of part owners. Descriptive statistics in Table 1 shows that part owners and tenants explain 45% and 11% of the sample respectively and the rest of the 44% is represented by full-owners. Coefficients and k marginal effects of fowner are negative while marginal effects of ftenants are not significant relative to the base group of part owners for both precision farming and GM crops. Although one might expect the degree of land ownership to be positively correlated with technology adoption, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Our results is consistent with the fact that it is part owners who operate the largest farms and account for the largest share of farm sales, followed by tenants in the U.S. agriculture USDA, 1998 ; part owners and tenants may face higher profit opportunities and/or longer time horizon and thus ftenants are not significant when considering adoption of precision farming and GM crops than full-owners. Another variables that was only included in precision farming equation is internet, a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the household has an internet connection. It has a positive and significant impact on probability of adopting precision farming. Marginal effect estimate of 0.04 Table 4 indicates that having an internet connection increases probability of adopting precision farming by 4%, which is a very significant effect considering the fact that an additional year of education increases the probability of adoption by only 1.4% at most. It appears that knowledge and experiences in computer and the internet important factor for precision farming adoption and this is evidence that precision farming is a human capital intensive technology. Government payment is also found to be positively correlated with adoption of both technologies. A possible explanation of this finding is that farm program payments may provide farmers with additional source of income that can be used to purchase newer technologies and adopt newer practices Caswell, et al., 2001;Lambert, et al., 2006;Lambert, et al., 2007 . Results indicate that farmers who receive any type of government payments are 2.3% more likely to adopt precision farming and 17% more likely to adopt GM crops. The higher marginal effect of government payments on GM crops can be attributed to the fact that farm program payments are tied to production of corn, soybean, cotton and other cash grain crops. Literature indicates that technology adoption is affected by regional location of the farm Mishra, et al., 2009 . Parameter estimated in Table 3 and marginal effects in Table 4 show that most of the coefficients of regional dummy variables were statistically significant for GM crops but only four of them are significant for precision farming. Note that the where crop production is active is also expected as found by Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2005 ."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "While the economic theory suggests that education has a positive influence on technology adoption for farmers, existing studies on technology adoption have yielded mixed results. We hypothesize that this is because conventional technology adoption models do not account for the potentially negative effect of education on technology adoption through labor allocation between on and off the farm. The purpose of this study is to fill the gap between the economic theory and empirical findings in agricultural economics. We built a simultaneous equations model that coalesce labor allocation and technology adoption decisions following Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2005 andFernandez-Cornejo 2007 and included interactions between education and farm size to estimate the net effect of education. The results confirm our expectation that the marginal effect of education on technology adoption is significantly higher for large farms. Contrary to a priori expectation, however, the marginal effects of education on GM crops adoption are found to be negative at all levels of farm size. These results suggest that formal education can be a barrier to technology adoption, especially for small scale farmers who have higher tendency to work off-farm. Given the increasing federal spending on agri-environmental programs that encourages farmers to adopt environmentally benign practices over the last two decades, a precise assessment of the effect of education on technology adoption is of great importance for policy makers. Our findings suggest that simply targeting highly educated farmer to adopt new farming practices on the basis of the conventional theory is not sufficient to achieve an efficient outcome. This is primarily because highly educated operators who have small operations are usually more dependent on off-farm income and thus their opportunity cost of farming is higher than that for relatively less educated counterparts. Finally, some limitations this study has encountered have to be noted. First, the definition of precision farming in our data is more broadly defined than previous studies such as Banerjee, et al. 2008 andRoberts, et al. 2004 . This may have obscured the relationship between off-farm labor supply and adoption of precision farming. Second, our results showed that the marginal effect of education on adoption of GM crops were negative regardless of farm size. As mentioned earlier, this unexpected result could be attributed to the controversy over the genetically modified crops, especially for highly educated farmers who would be more aware of the latest discussion and findings about the risk and safety of GM crops. Third, we have employed Nelson and Olson's procedure to estimate a simultaneous equations model with endogenous limited dependent variables. The simplicity of this procedure is a tremendous advantage for practitioners. Although this procedure allows us to obtain consistent estimates of unknown parameters, there exists an asymptotically efficient, but relatively more complicated, estimator suggested by Amemiya 1979 . Future researches will address these limitations to build on our early attempt to estimate the true effect of education on technology adoption in the context of labor allocation between on and off the farm.
