[{"section_title": "Measuring R&D in the National Economic Accounting System", "text": "By Marissa J. Crawford, Jennifer Lee, John E. Jankowski, and Francisco A. Moris E CONOMISTS HAVE LONG recognized that re search and development (R&D) products have the characteristics of fixed assets-their ownership rights are well defined, they are long lasting, they can be used repeatedly in the production of other goods and ser vices, and their value depreciates over time. In the early 1990s, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) began researching how R&D expenditures should be treated in the core economic accounts. That research culmi nated when as part of the 2013 comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and the 2014 comprehensive revision of the industry economic accounts (IEAs), BEA expanded the asset boundary to recognize business, academic, nonprofit, and government R&D expenditures as investment, not as a current expense. This new approach allows the ac counts to better measure the effects of innovation and intangible assets on economic growth and productiv ity. The enhanced treatment of R&D investment in the NIPAs and IEAs reflects the consensus view that R&D and other intellectual property products are critically important to the modern economy. Treating R&D as an investment allows economists to analyze its contri bution to growth and productivity using the same framework as other capital goods. 1 BEA's treatment is also consistent with the recom mendations of international guidelines, notably the System of National Accounts 2008, which defines R&D as \"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge, and use of this stock of knowledge for the purpose of discovering or devel 1.

BEA's standard approach for measuring output is to value it at market prices if possible. When market prices are not available-mainly when valuing output for own-account and nonmarket uses-the standard approach is to use the costs of production as a proxy. BEA defines the owner (or investor) of R&D as the funder of the R&D. This decision was made largely be cause funders typically reserve some, if not all, rights to the outcome of the R&D and receive economic ben efits from the R&D. BEA estimates of R&D investment include (1) R&D that is funded by one entity but produced by another entity, which is considered \"purchased\" R&D, and 2R&D produced for an entity's own use, which is con sidered \"own-account\" R&D. Market prices are used to value purchased R&D, while the value of own-account R&D is estimated as the sum of production costs. A Brief History of BEA's Capitalization of R&D The Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) effort to measure R&D investment and to examine the effects of R&D expenditures on the U.S. economy began with a set of satellite accounts. These accounts provided a means of exploring the effect of R&D activity on the economy and a framework through which various methodological and conceptual issues, such as how to measure changes in R&D prices, could be examined. In 1994, BEA first published an R&D satellite account. In 2006, BEA introduced a revised satellite account and updated that account in 2007 and in 2010. This satellite account formed the general framework for how BEA would implement R&D into its core eco nomic accounts. However, the R&D estimates incorporated into BEA's core economic accounts differ from the satellite account estimates in two ways: \u2022 Source data differences. To incorporate R&D as investment into the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and into the industry economic accounts (IEAs), BEA uses additional data sources, such as the Census Bureau's economic census and information from publicly-traded companies. \u2022 Classification differences. In the core accounts, R&D software remains in BEA's estimates of soft ware investment. In the satellite account, BEA had removed R&D software from the software invest ment estimate, retaining it in R&D investment because the R&D satellite account was designed to focus on R&D as a capitalized asset. The development of the R&D satellite account was funded by the National Center for Science and Engi neering Statistics (NCSES) at the National Science Foundation (NSF). NSF data on R&D expenditures continue to serve as the primary data source for BEA's estimates. NSF and BEA are working together to col laborate on survey methodologies appropriate for BEA's R&D estimates. 1 1. NCSES R&D statistics are collected from an expenditure, or current-cost perspective, following international guidelines in Fra scati Manual: Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development (Paris: Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development, 2002). See also \"R&D Recognized as Investment in U.S. Gross Domestic Product Statistics: GDP Increase Lowers R&D-to-GDP Ratio,\" NSF InfoBrief (forthcoming on the NSF's Web site)."}, {"section_title": "Source data and adjustments", "text": "In producing estimates of R&D investment, BEA relies primarily on NSF's R&D surveys, which provide infor mation on expenditures associated with the produc tion of R&D. These surveys include the business research and development and innovation survey, higher education research and development survey, survey of federal funds for research and development, and survey of state government research and develop ment. All are conducted annually except the survey of state government research and development, which is conducted every other year. 3 In general, the NSF sur veys provide data beginning in 1953. For years not covered by the surveys, BEA uses a va riety of sources to estimate R&D investment. For ex ample, for years before 1953, business R&D is estimated primarily by using employment data for sci entists and engineers. For the details on the primary source data for all of BEA's R&D investment and out put estimates, see table 1. BEA adjusts the NSF expenditure data for coverage, for scope, and for alignment with the NIPA framework and concepts. The adjustments are as follows: \u2022 BEA converts NSF R&D expenditures data on a fis cal year basis to a calendar year basis to align with the NIPAs. \u2022 NSF surveys of business R&D collect some informa tion on exports of R&D (including R&D performed domestically that is funded by sources outside of the United States). However, these data do not fully rep resent all of the R&D foreign trade flows recorded in BEA's economic accounts. BEA must also separately record imports of R&D, which are not captured in NSF's surveys of business R&D. As a result, instead of relying on the NSF data, BEA integrates its inter national transactions accounts (ITAs) data on imports and exports of R&D services when deriving measures of total R&D output and investment. This approach ensures consistency with BEA's methods for estimating imports and exports and with exist ing estimates of R&D services in the ITAs. To align the trade data with the definition of capitalized R&D services, a portion of the ITA-based imports and exports is removed because they represent non-R&D testing services. \u2022 BEA's estimates of R&D investment exclude soft ware R&D, which is already captured in BEA's esti mates of software investment.

Because the accounting methods used by most businesses and governments do not capitalize R&D and because other data sources such as patent records do not provide comprehensive coverage of R&D assets, BEA must pro vide its own allocation of ownership to the corporate and noncorporate business sectors, NPISHs, and the general government sector. The allocation of owner ship is important because it affects measures of net in come such as corporate profits and personal income as well as measures of net saving because consumption of fixed capital is a charge against the income of the owner. 4 NSF's surveys of R&D expenditures are conducted based on the performer of the R&D, but they also pro vide extensive information on the funder of R&D for each performer. For the private sector, the allocation of R&D owner ship to the funder is clear. However, the ownership of government-funded R&D may be less transparent. Government-funded R&D is supported through two primary mechanisms-purchases and grants. As an example, the federal government may directly pur chase R&D from an academic institution, or the fed eral government may provide funding for R&D at an academic institution via a grant. The ownership of purchased R&D is straightforward, because the federal government normally retains ownership of the out come of the purchased R&D activity. For grant-based R&D, however, the ultimate beneficiary is difficult to ascertain because both the federal government and the performer can benefit from the transaction. Histori cally, NSF surveys have not collected information on the allocation of purchased and grant-based R&D for the federal sector. 5 Because of this lack of direct infor mation, federal purchases and grants of R&D are both treated as investment by the federal sector because the federal government is assumed to receive the primary economic benefit. The funders of R&D generally invest in R&D because they receive economic benefits; in the case of government funding, the economic benefits in clude the benefits that the government obtains on be half of the general public. For a perspective on how funding differs for each performer, see tables 7 and 8, which show the different funding sources for each R&D performer.

Because the NSF data are based on production costs, the market price of the purchased R&D is not captured. To estimate the market value of R&D, BEA applies a profit markup. BEA calculates this profit markup based on the net operating surplus of the miscellaneous professional, scientific, and technical services industry. This is an industry category from BEA's GDP-by-industry data that contains scientific R&D services within it as a subindustry.

For a given company, expenditures can be made in several different types of establish ments, including manufacturing plants or servicesproducing facilities, company headquarters, a free standing R&D laboratory that provides all its output to the rest of the company (auxiliary establishment), or an independent establishment that sells its R&D out put. Since the NSF surveys do not link R&D expendi tures to establishments, using the NSF industry classification would imply that all pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing R&D activity was conducted in manufacturing plants when more realistically, it was conducted in R&D laboratories, company headquar ters facilities, manufacturing plants, and other types of establishments. BEA's industry input-output accounts are classi fied based on establishments. According to this estab lishment-based approach, for example, a multiunit company with one establishment whose main activ ity is manufacturing and another establishment whose main activity is R&D services will have the output of the manufacturing establishment assigned to the man ufacturing sector (the primary industry) and the output of its R&D services establishment assigned to the services sector. To incorporate R&D as investment in BEA's input-output accounts, the NSF data are converted to an establishment basis. BEA applies a company-to-establishment adjustment based on a rec onciliation of Census Bureau-based data from the sci entific R&D services industry (establishment-based) with the NSF's company-based data.

However, the most complete and accurate source data are the NSF surveys of R&D expenditures, which provide only annual data. BEA thus relies on a number of methods and data sources to interpolate annual estimates of R&D invest ment into quarterly estimates. These methods and sources vary depending on the period. For NPISHs, academic institutions, federal govern ment, and state and local governments, little informa tion on quarterly trends in R&D activity is available. Therefore, quarterly estimates are interpolated from annual estimates assuming no quarterly pattern. For business R&D, the quarterly interpolation methods are split into three periods, each with a different interpola tion method: 1947-1990, 1991-2007, and 2008for ward. For 1947-1990, the quarterly estimates are interpo lated assuming no quarterly patterns.

Ta ble 10 shows the R&D depreciation rates for 10 R&Dintensive industries. As described in Li's working paper (2012), the results are consistent with expert opinions and conclusions from empirical analysis that R&D de preciation rates should be higher than the traditional assumption, 15 percent, and should vary across indus tries. Details of the model and estimation results are described in Li (2012). Industries not specifically identified use the depreci 8. For more details on R&D business depreciation rates, see Wendy C.Y.

This rate is also used for NPISHs and aca demic institutions. For general government R&D, a contribution to profits is not estimated, but like business R&D, de preciation reflects obsolescence over time. Based on this concept, BEA observed that R&D investments  were associated with the production of other products that eventually became obsolete; for example, invest ments in stealth technology were associated with the development of particular military aircraft. As innova tions give way to newer technologies, the original R&D becomes less valuable or obsolete, thus bringing an end to the effective service life of the R&D. BEA derived service lives for four federal govern ment functions: defense, health, space, and energy. To estimate service lives for these government R&D asset types, BEA selected a sample of representative projects. The service life for an R&D project spans the time from prototype design through the end of production of the physical tangible asset. An average for all sample projects for a particular R&D asset type, such as de fense R&D, was used to calculate the overall life for the R&D asset (table 11). For nondefense transportation and other R&D and for all state and local government R&D assets, BEA ad opted the same rate (16 percent) used for the private scientific R&D services industry.  "}, {"section_title": "Methodology: Price Measures", "text": "Price deflators for R&D are used to develop quantity measures for R&D investment, stocks, and deprecia tion. Unfortunately, these prices are generally unob servable, given that much R&D is produced for ownaccount use and that R&D projects are heterogeneous in nature (so that similar outputs are not available for observation). Consequently, it is generally accepted that measures of own-account R&D investment are de rived as the sum of the costs of their inputs, such as compensation, materials and supplies, and capital ser vices. In the absence of direct price measures for R&D output, this input cost approach is the preferred method for constructing R&D price indexes. 9 How ever, by using an input cost index as a proxy for the output price change, the impact of productivity change on the value of real R&D output or on investment is not captured. Considering the widely held view that R&D expenditures are an important source of in creases in productivity, BEA uses the economy-wide measure of multifactor productivity produced by BLS as the estimate of unobserved R&D productivity. This productivity adjustment is made by subtracting the growth rate of private nonfarm business sector multifactor productivity from the growth rate of the R&D input cost index. In periods that productivity increases, the price of R&D is adjusted downward because of the underlying assumption that more R&D can be produced per unit of input; conversely, the price of R&D is adjusted up ward when productivity declines because less R&D can be produced per unit of input. Three R&D price indexes are used in the NIPAs and IEAs: a business R&D price index, an academic R&D price index, and a federal own-account R&D price in dex. All three price indexes are based on an input cost approach. The academic and federal price indexes are used for R&D performed by academic institutions and the federal government, respectively. (All of R&D per formed by the federal government is own-account). The business price index is used for all other R&D per formers; that is, private business, NPISHs (excluding academic institutions), and state and local government because they are assumed to have similar R&D cost structures.

The source of the price data for each cost component varies over time, depending on availability. each period. Two primary sources are used to develop weights for the academic R&D price index: Inflation Measures and NSF's higher education research and development (HERD) surveys. 11 In addition to data from Inflation Measures and the HERD surveys, estimates of currentcost depreciation of equipment and structures used in the production of R&D were used as the weights for the measure of capital services for R&D production.

The price index weights and input costs are combined to create the Fisher-weighted academic R&D price index.
