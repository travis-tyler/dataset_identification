[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Neuroinflammatory changes are observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown the presence of activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding the amyloid plaques, along with the presence of cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. The role of inflammation in AD is not yet completely understood. More specifically, some inflammatory processes, such as the activation of microglia, may have detrimental or beneficial effects on the underlining neuropathology, by promoting inflammation and tissue damage or rather phagocytic activity and tissue repair. Imaging of neuroinflammation with positron emission tomography (PET) is the only technology that enables the visualization of microglia and astrocyte activation in the living human brain. PET studies with first-or second-generation radioligands binding to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) (\n18 F]FEPPA) have shown some conflicting results, demonstrating on average a *30 % higher TSPO availability in AD patients compared with controls, with a few studies showing no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Similar conflicting evidences have been shown when comparing subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and control subjects. Therefore, whether TSPO is a good marker for detecting in vivo microglia activation in AD is still a matter of debate. Imaging of MAO-B as a marker for astrocyte activation in AD is a valid alternative to TSPO imaging in the context of neuroinflammation. Only limited MAO-B imaging studies with [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 are available so far in AD and MCI, showing increased MAO-B binding in MCI patients compared with controls with a degree higher than that observed in AD. There are two unmet questions that are still under discussion. The first question is which neuroinflammatory process, microglia or astrocyte activation, occurs earlier in the natural course of AD from prodromal to dementia stage? Comparative studies using these two markers in MCI and AD could be important to clarify which marker can be used for earliest detection of neuroinflammatory changes in vivo. The second question is whether imaging of microglia or astrocytes per se is a useful marker of neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration. The development of new radioligands for other targets that are more directly associated with the proor anti-inflammatory activity of microglia could help in understanding the relevance of neuroinflammation in the pathological processes leading to neurodegeneration in AD. Molecular imaging with PET can be a useful tool to determine the nature and temporal evolution of inflammation in early stages of AD in relation to other pathological markers, such as deposition of amyloid plaques and tau as well as clinical presentation of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The involvement of inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is suggested by different experimental findings. Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between the onset of AD and the treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs [1] . The use of anti-inflammatory drugs might be more important in the pre-dementia stage of AD, since clinical trials in patients with clinical symptoms of dementia have failed to demonstrate efficacy of antiinflammatory treatments [2, 3] . A range of inflammatory processes, such as activated microglia, cytokines, activation of complement cascade have been found in the AD brain [4, 5] . The role of inflammation in the natural progression of AD is still a matter of debate. Microglia and astrocytes are the glial cells involved in the modulation of the inflammatory response and repair in the brain [6, 7] . Post-mortem data indicates that microglia and astrocytes are associated with amyloid deposition in AD. In postmortem AD brain tissue, microglia and astrocytes are found in the proximity of amyloid plaques [6, 7] (Fig. 1) and pre-clinical studies in animal models of AD have shown that microglia and astrocytes are recruited around the amyloid plaques quite rapidly [8] . Astrocytes are cells that are involved in the reparative processes following inflammation and tissue damage. Although it is well acknowledged that both microglia and astrocytes are important cells involved in neuroinflammation, their relative contribution to the overall neuroinflammatory process is not fully understood.\nMicroglia is activated in response to cell damage and might promote a pro-inflammatory reaction that contributes to tissue damage and sustained inflammation, or can actively promote phagocytosis and tissue repair. A conventional way to indicate these two different functions of microglia is the M1/M2 polarization [9] . The M1 phenotype is conventionally considered pro-inflammatory, whereas the M2 phenotype is classically seen as anti-inflammatory. The balance between the two functional types of microglia activation might determine the end result of the inflammatory process and neurodegeneration [10] . In the APP/PS1 mouse models of AD, it has been shown that in the hippocampus microglia undergoes an age-related phenotypic switch. At 6 months of age, when the Ab plaque pathology develops, the M2 or alternative state with phagocytic capacity is predominant, whereas at 18 months of age there is a transition to the classical M1 state, associated with the formation of Ab oligomers and with pyramidal degeneration [11] . The microglia displaying M2 phenotype was located mainly around the Ab plaques and was present also at 18 months, at the time of maximal activation of the M1 phenotype [11] . In AD patients it is more difficult to examine this transition and studies have found the presence of both activation phenotypes of microglia [10] . Therefore, the development of specific radioligands for the two activated states of microglia could be helpful to study in vivo the relative contribution and longitudinal progression of the M1/M2 phenotypes in relation to AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "PET imaging of neuroinflammation in AD", "text": "The most established target for noninvasive molecular imaging of neuroinflammation in AD is the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) [12] . TSPO is expressed on the inner mitochondrial membrane of several cells including monocytes, macrophages, microglia and astrocytes [13] . The activation of microglia following tissue damage results in an increased density of TSPO in the mitochondrial membranes [14] . The increased TSPO expression is not limited to only microglia, but also to astrocytes. However, in vitro studies with [ 3 H]-R-PK11195 have shown that the binding of this TSPO radioligand in AD brain is more directly associated with immunohistochemical markers of microglia rather then astrocytes [15] . Therefore, TSPO imaging in AD is classically viewed as a tool to image microglia activation rather than astrocyte activation.\nA marker that is more specifically associated with astrocyte activation is the measurement of monoamino oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity. MAO-B in the brain is present in astrocytes and serotonin containing neurons [16, 17] . An autoradiographic study using double staining with [ 3 H]L-deprenyl and GFAP-immunohistochemistry showed that the binding of [ 3 H]L-deprenyl was in agreement with the GFAP-staining in the white matter of controls and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [18] . The selectivity of [ 3 H]L-deprenyl for the binding in reactive astrocytes in ALS patients was confirmed in subsequent studies [19] [20] [21] , suggesting that the MAO-B can be a suitable marker for imaging reactive astrocytosis. In AD brain, [ 3 H]L-deprenyl has been shown histochemically to co-localize with GFAP immunoreactivity in cell clusters of astrocytes around senile plaques, in amygdala, hippocampus and insular cortex [22] . Autoradiographic studies using the tritiated MAO-B inhibitors [ 3 H]lazabemide [23] and [ 3 H]L-deprenyl [24] or [ 11 C]L-deprenyl [25] have also shown increase MAO-B binding in the cortex of AD patients and correlation of MAO-B signal with GFAP immunoreactivity [23] . Based on these evidences, PET imaging of MAO-B with [ 11 C]L-deprenyl or the deuterated analog [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 is considered a marker of astrocyte activation in neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Since L-deprenyl is a suicide inactivator of the MAO-B enzyme [26] and the uptake and distribution of [ 11 C]L-deprenyl in the brain has been shown to be influenced by the tracer delivery, particularly in regions with high MAO-B content [27] , the deuterated analog [\n11 C]Ldeprenyl-D2 has been developed [28] . The introduction of deuterium in the molecule decreases the rate of cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond alpha to the amino group in the propargyl function of L-deprenyl, thereby decreasing the irreversible trapping of 11 C in the brain [28] . The end result is that [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 displays a less irreversible kinetic behavior in the brain and its uptake and distribution is more associated to MAO-B activity and less dependent on blood-flow. For these reasons [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 is at present the radioligand most widely used to image MAO-B activity in the brain with PET. Previous imaging studies with [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 have been performed in different neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [29] [30] [31] [32] . These studies demonstrated increased binding of [ 11 C]Ldeprenyl-D2 in the brain areas involved in the pathology of the different disorders, such as the epileptic lobe, the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the white matter and the pons in ALS.\nOne aspect to be considered when using [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 for MAO-B imaging is that smokers have reduced brain MAO-B activity as compared with nonsmokers [33] and that there is a difference in the arterial input function of [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 between smokers and nonsmokers [34] . These effects of smoking on the delivery and brain uptake of [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 may influence the quantification of MAO-B activity in the brain, therefore it is recommended to match control and patient groups for smoking or better include only nonsmokers in research studies, to avoid possible bias related to the effect of smoking and to potential differences in the pharmacokinetic of the radioligand in the body. [41] , have been used to compare TSPO binding in AD versus control subjects. We focused our review only on TSPO imaging in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Previous reviews have discussed the role of imaging of neuroinflammation in other forms of dementia, such as Parkinson's disease dementia, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies [42, 43] . A search of the literature using as key words ''translocator protein'', ''TSPO'', ''peripheral benzodiazepine receptor'', ''PBR'', ''Alzheimer's disease'' and the different radioligands listed above gave 23 results for in vivo clinical studies. In three papers, different quantification approaches for [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 were presented and although the dataset included also PET data from AD patients or MCI subjects, the studies were primarily intended to evaluate the performance of different reference tissue models [44] [45] [46] . One paper examined the correlation between binding of [ 11 C]PBR28 to TSPO in subjects with PARP1 gene variation, but did not provide separate data for AD patients and controls [47] . Another paper used data from the ADNI cohort and examined the effect of TSPO polymorphism on amyloid load and clinical progression of AD, but did not include TSPO imaging data in AD patients. The remaining 18 studies were designed to specifically compare TSPO binding in AD patients, MCI subjects and elderly control subjects and were considered for this review. The summary of the studies conducted with ["}, {"section_title": "TSPO imaging in AD", "text": "11 C]-R-PK11195 and second-generation TSPO radioligands in AD and MCI are presented in Table 1 . We have also included one SPECT study using the 123 I-labeled version of PK11195 [48] and one study with the TSPO radioligand [\n11 C]vinpocetine [49] . Twelve studies have reported different degrees of difference in TSPO binding between AD patients and controls [35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 48, [50] [51] [52] , whereas the remaining six studies have not shown any statistically significant difference [37, 40, 49, [53] [54] [55] . The brain regions in which TSPO binding was found to be significantly higher in AD patients than in controls included the prefrontal cortex [36, 38, 41, 48, [50] [51] [52] 56] , the temporal cortex [35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 50, 51, 56, 57] , the parietal cortex [35, 36, 38, 41, 50, 51, 56, 57] , the precuneus [38, 52] , the anterior cingulate [36, [50] [51] [52] 56] , the posterior cingulate [35, 38, 39, 50, 52] , the occipital cortex [38, 41, 50, 56] , the amygdala [35, 56] , the hippocampus [38, 56] , the parahippocampal cortex [52, 57] , the entorhinal cortex [38, 57] , the fusiform gyrus [35] , the striatum [35, 36, 39, 50, 51] , and the thalamus [39] . If only the studies showing positive results are considered, and excluding one study that used a quantification approach that might have artificially produced several-fold differences in BP ND between AD patients and control subjects [52] , AD patients showed higher TSPO binding as compared with control subjects, approximately by 30 % on average. Those studies have used different radioligands and different quantification methods and outcome measures, based on the use of a reference timeactivity curve or based on the measurement of the arterial input function. In four of the studies using second-generation TSPO radioligands, data were stratified according to the TSPO polymorphism or binding status. Interestingly, although the first study conducted with [\n11 C]-R-PK11195 and quantification using a supervised cluster analysis has shown very promising results [35] , the data were replicated only in two subsequent studies using the same radioligand [50, 56] ; whereas, no statistically significant differences were found in two other [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 studies [54, 55] . Negative findings have been reported also in two studies using either [ 18 F]FEDAA1106 [37] "}, {"section_title": "% MCI", "text": "PVEc partial volume effect correction, PDD Parkinson's disease dementia a In this study, it is not specified if the racemic mixture of PK11195 or the R enantiomer was used stratification of the patients by the binding status, likely contributing to the variability of the data and reduced effect size. In the case of the [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 studies, no obvious reason could explain the lack of statistically significant differences between AD patients and controls. One possible explanation could be that the measurement of neuroinflammation in vivo using TSPO imaging is not sensitive enough to detect differences between patients and controls that can be clearly seen in post-mortem studies. Therefore, although [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 is a radioligand with clear limitations for its sub-optimal imaging properties, the development of second-generation TSPO radioligands has not really provided imaging tools that outperform [\n11 C]-R-PK11195. In support of the possible explanation that in vivo imaging might not be sensitive enough to detect differences between AD patients and controls, two post-mortem studies conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s using There is a major discrepancy between post-mortem and in vivo data concerning TSPO in AD. While post-mortem data show 100-200 % higher TSPO binding in AD patients compared with controls, the in vivo data show only approximately 30 % difference. This discrepancy cannot be explained only by the difference in resolution between ARG and PET or by the difference in sensitivity between in vitro and in vivo analyses. The discrepancy cannot be explained also by the fact that the outcome measure in vitro is B max and in vivo is B max /K D *f ND (BP ND ) or V T (which contains specific and nonspecific binding). In vitro studies have not shown differences in K D between AD patients and controls [15, 59] and differences in f ND should not be expected. One explanation could be that there are other sources of differences between in vitro and in vivo conditions. For instance, in hippocampus specimens from AD brain it has been shown that 54-kDa trimers represent the most abundant form of TSPO [60] . It is not known whether the TSPO radioligands bind to TSPO polymers with the same affinity as they bind to monomers. If they bind with different affinity to monomers or polymers some of the discrepancy might be attributed to the different status of polymerization between in vitro and in vivo conditions and between control and AD brains.\nConsidering all the possible caveats discussed so far, the main conclusions from the majority of the in vivo imaging studies that showed positive results are that only a moderate increase of TSPO binding (30 %) in AD patients compared with controls can be detected, that a large overlap is observed between patients and controls and that when using second-generation TSPO radioligands it is necessary to stratify for TSPO binding status (Fig. 2) . If the data of the different studies showing positive results are carefully examined, it is clear that besides the large overlap, only a fraction of AD patients show TSPO binding levels that are clearly higher than controls, see for instance [50] "}, {"section_title": "Methodological aspects of TSPO imaging in AD", "text": "A major aspect that must be considered when reviewing the different studies examining TSPO imaging in AD and MCI, is that no consensus has been reached in terms of quantification of TSPO binding. Because of the difficulty of measuring adequately the arterial input function of [ 11 C]-R-PK11195, the method of choice for the quantification of the binding of [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 to TSPO has been the supervised cluster analysis [35, 46, 50, 55, 56] . This method uses the combination of different kinetic clusters that represent different kinetic behaviors of normal GM tissue, pathologic tissue and vascular component. The outcome measure derived using this method is the binding potential (BP ND ). The estimation of BP ND is based on the assumption that the time-activity curve used as reference tissue is devoid of specific binding. This assumption is not true in the case of TSPO, since the density of TSPO is similar to the density of other G protein coupled neuroreceptors and cannot be considered negligible [14] . In the case of [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 it has been conventionally accepted that the outcome measure of choice is BP ND , but in reality the outcome measure obtained with [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 is a surrogate of BP ND , reflecting the ratio between [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 binding to ''pathological'' and ''physiological'' tissue. The acceptance of this violation to the basic assumptions of PET quantification has partly been an advantage, since BP ND values close to zero can be expected in control subjects, whereas BP ND values as low as 0.2-0.5 in AD patients already provide a large difference at group level between AD patients and controls [35] .\nThe introduction of second-generation TSPO radioligands has contributed to examine the quantification in more details. Since second-generation TSPO radioligands have higher affinity for TSPO compared with [\n11 C]-R-PK11195, the level of specific binding associated with physiological TSPO expression cannot be neglected and PET quantification must rely on accurate measurement of arterial input function and kinetic analysis with compartmental modeling. In such case the outcome measure of choice is the total distribution volume, V T . The drawback of V T is not only that arterial cannulation and radiometabolite analysis are required, but also that V T contains also a proportion of nondisplaceable binding. In the case of [ 11 C]PBR28, for instance, it has been shown that the proportion of nondisplaceable binding is approximately 40 % of the total binding in all brain regions [62] . Therefore, the use of V T as outcome measure for differentiating AD patients from controls might be affected by the variability introduced by the measurement of the arterial input function and by the proportion of specific vs total binding that can be different for different radioligands, depending on the affinity for TSPO and the amount of nonspecific binding. Two recent studies with [ 18 F]FEMPA [39] and [ 18 F]FEPPA [41] have used V T as outcome measures and have shown statistically significant higher TSPO binding in AD vs controls when stratifying for TSPO binding status. Therefore, V T can be a useful outcome measure provided that methodological or biological sources of variability are considered.\nContrary to the above-mentioned studies, a recent study with [ 11 C]PBR28 has shown that using V T as outcome measure does not permit to differentiate statistically AD patients from control subjects, whereas using V T normalized by the plasma-free fraction of [ 11 C]PBR28, f P , permits to detect statistically significantly differences [57] . The use of f P is somewhat controversial, because the measurement of f P has itself larger test-retest variability than V T and measurements conducted at different centers show indeed different values. In the same study, using SUV ratio with the cerebellum as reference region there was a more statistically significant difference between AD and controls (higher SUVR values in AD than controls), with lower variability of the data. Therefore, using an outcome measure which is less accurate than V T but less affected by noise can in principle paradoxically increase the possibility to show increased neuroinflammation and TSPO binding in AD. The major question is of course if a cerebellum is a suitable reference region in AD. Amyloid plaques can develop in the cerebellum, although more likely in the later stages of the disease. In addition, some studies have shown differences in TSPO binding in the cerebellum between AD patients and controls [36, 39, 50] . Therefore, the suitability of cerebellum as pseudo-reference region should be checked for each TSPO radioligand using full quantification with arterial input function.\nBesides the different quantification methods that might have contributed to the variability of the findings reported so far, another aspect to be considered with regard to quantification is also the potential interference of radiolabelled metabolites entering the brain. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been systematically addressed in the studies reported so far. If radiometabolites enter the brain, in theory differences in metabolism between patient groups could determine differences in the outcome measures. At least in two studies, the parent fraction of [ 18- F]FEDAA1106 [37] and [ 18 F]FEMPA [39] did not differ significantly between AD patients and controls, although the findings of the two studies were different (Table 1) . If this is the case for the other radioligands too, then the differences in metabolism of the TSPO tracers should not contribute largely to the differences in the findings observed so far.\nAnother methodological aspect that should be considered is related to the analysis of the data. For instance, using SPM analysis applied to parametric BP ND images clusters of increased binding of [\n11 C]-R-PK11195 to TSPO in AD brain have been observed [50, 55] , even when the ROI results were negative [55] , suggesting perhaps that depending upon the ROI size microglia activation might be underestimated using ROI analysis, because of ''dilution'' of the increased signal with the normal signal."}, {"section_title": "Neuroinflammation in prodromal AD", "text": "Neuroinflammation is a condition that is clearly related to amyloid deposition in the brain and that most likely follow a certain time course in parallel with amyloid deposition.\nTo our knowledge, there are no longitudinal studies examining the changes of TSPO binding over time. However, cross-sectional studies have examined subjects with MCI, a condition representing a prodromal stage of AD. These studies have used [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 and secondgeneration TSPO radioligands and have reported either no statistically significant differences between MCI subjects and controls or AD patients [38, 54, 55] or a mild-tomoderate increase of TSPO binding between 17 and 41 % in MCI subjects compared with either AD patients or controls [51, 56, 63] . The regions in which TSPO binding was significantly higher in MCI subjects than in controls included the prefrontal cortex [51, 56, 63] , the temporal cortex [51, 56] , the parietal cortex [51, 56] , the anterior cingulate [51, 56] , the posterior cingulate [56] , the amygdala [56] , the hippocampus [56] , and the striatum [51] . The amyloid load does not seem to always correlate with the level of TSPO binding in AD [50, 63] and the differences in TSPO binding between MCI and controls or between MCI and AD do not seem to be largely influenced by the presence of absence of amyloid in the brain [38, 54, 63] .\nSome studies have though shown significant correlation between amyloid load and TSPO binding in the posterior cingulate cortex [52] or in several brain regions typically involved in AD pathology such as frontal cortex, temporoparietal cortex, cingulate cortex and parahippocampal gyrus [56] . This last study used an advanced method of voxelbased analysis based on the correlation of binding potential between voxels of [ 11 C]PIB and [ 11 C]-R-PK11195 parametric images. In the same study, a correlation between amyloid load and TSPO binding was also found in MCI subjects in similar brain regions as in AD patients [56] .\nAt present, it is difficult to conclude whether neuroinflammation can be detected in vivo with PET already at early or prodromal stages of AD and whether the presence of neuroinflammation can be a finding predictive of longitudinal progression of the disease or of clinical deterioration in MCI subjects. The only study that attempted to examine the relationship between TSPO binding and conversion to dementia reported that MCI subjects with binding potential values of [ 11 C]DAA1106 higher than the control mean ?0.5 SD developed dementia within 5 years [51] . Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to establish whether the presence of neuroinflammation can be predictive of conversion to dementia.\nImaging of neuroinflammation can be extremely valuable as imaging marker to assess direct or indirect antiinflammatory effects of new drugs with potential disease modifying properties. Therefore, imaging neuroinflammation with PET in MCI or AD can be a valuable tool for proof-of-mechanism studies and clinical trials with antiinflammatory drugs."}, {"section_title": "Neuroinflammation and cognitive function", "text": "It is acknowledged that in AD there is no straightforward correlation between amyloid load and cognitive function and that most likely tau pathology is more correlated with cognitive impairment.

At present, the only well-established radioligand available for imaging MAO [64] . The first in vivo study conducted in an AD population examined the inhibition of MAO-B activity measured with [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 using a selective MAO-B inhibitor [65] . A subsequent study with [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 has shown high binding in AD patients [66] , while interestingly enough in one study PIB-positive MCI subjects showed higher binding of [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 in brain as compared with both AD patients (Fig. 3 ) and healthy controls [67] . In addition, in PIB-positive MCI subjects, the binding of [ 11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 in the para-hippocampus has been shown to be inversely related to the grey matter density in the same region [68] , suggesting a link between astrocyte activation and neurodegeneration in prodromal AD. High [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 binding has been shown also in pre-symptomatic subjects with familiar AD [69] and in transgenic mice carrying the APPswe mutation, in which increased MAO-B activity measured with [\n11 C]L-deprenyl-D2 microPET was present already at 6 months, whereas amyloid deposition measured with [ 11 C]AZD2184 was significantly increased only at 18-24 months [70] . These studies in prodromal AD and in animal models of AD suggest that astrocyte activation is an early pathological finding in AD.\nPET imaging of TSPO and MAO-B have been combined with amyloid imaging to examine the relationship between amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation. Although amyloid deposition and activated microglia or astrocytes are present in similar brain regions, suggesting the co-localization of both phenomena, the amyloid load does not necessarily correlate with TSPO binding or MAO-B activity in the brain. The relationship between amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation is not completely straightforward but accumulating data suggest that the two processes are linked to each other, which is also indicated by the high presence of astrocytes found close to the amyloid plaque formations [6] . "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Several evidences from pathological as well as in vivo PET studies in human subjects indicate the involvement of microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Despite many contributions to the field of molecular imaging of neuroinflammation, some important questions remain to be addressed, to better understand the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes in AD pathology. How much of the TSPO binding in vivo is associated to microglia or astrocytes? Is the type of microglia that expresses TSPO mainly proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory? The first question could benefit of combined PET studies in prodromal and clinical AD stages with TSPO and MAO-B radioligands, to understand which process, microglia or astrocyte activation, occurs first in relation to amyloid deposition. The second question could benefit of the development of specific radioligands targeting M1 or M2 types of microglia. Radioligand development in the area of neuroinflammation beyond TSPO is very important to try to better understand the process of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders. After many years of work in trying to find the most suitable TSPO-PET radioligand, the major challenge for the coming years will be to develop radioligands for novel and more specific targets of neuroinflammation to be used as early diagnostic markers as well as for the evaluation of new drug targets for treatment of AD and related dementia disorders.\nContribution statement Andrea Varrone is responsible for literature search and review, content planning, manuscript writing and editing.
