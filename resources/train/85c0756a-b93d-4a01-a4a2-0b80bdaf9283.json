These super-ordinate concepts of genotype, morphotype and phenotype have specific applications to our understanding of neurodegenerative disease.\nA typology of neurodegenerative disease affecting the striatum may be discerned, namely, direct neurodegeneration, deafferentation or indirect deafferentation. The structure of the striatum as a nexus of anatomically segregated interconnections arguably constitutes a unique vulnerability to proximally (such as direct neuronal loss in the striatum) and distally mediated (such as cortical or white matter atrophy in the interconnections of the striatum) disease. This review will summarize studies of various neurodegenerative diseases affecting the striatum according to this model. The model may be analysed via the concept of an endophenotype, an intermediate phenotype, which is characterized as 'measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype' (p 636 (ref. 18) ), comprising here the morphology of the striatum and associated functional/genotypic factors. Potentially, such endophenotypes may constitute biomarkers: 'A characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.' (p 91 (ref. 19) ). Similarly, the quantitative morphology, or structural plan of the striatum may itself, in an adaptation of Mayr's terminology analogous to the term endophenotype, be described as an endomorphotype.\nBased on the above, it is argued:\n(1) the neurodevelopment of the striatum is predicated on a constrained series of homeobox genes and factors, and is maintained by specific neurogenic centres in adults; (2) the unique morphology of the striatum serves as a map of neurodegeneration of associated cortical regions in vivo and thus may constitute an endomorphotype; (3) mapping of striatal morphology may correlate with measures of cognition, emotion and behaviour; (4) therefore, the combination of a genetic basis and the ability to map morphology and to link morphology to function constitutes a thread that may in turn constitute the structural basis for endophenotypes of 18, 20 corticostriatal circuit dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease; 21 (5) this yields a potential biomarker."}, {"section_title": "NEURODEVELOPMENT AND NEUROGENESIS OF THE STRIATUM", "text": "The neurodevelopment of the striatum is relatively constrained across mammalian species and is summarized only very briefly here, to establish that there are significant genetic factors involved in development. 6, 7, 22 The striatum arises from the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences on the floor of the lateral ventricle. 6, 22 The eminences themselves comprise ventricular and subventricular zones, which are also relevant in later life. Initially, overlapping patterns of gene expression establish the development of the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences, while further differentiation is effected by corticostriatal and nigrostriatal afferents that result in a patterned structure of striosome and matrix. 6 The main body of the striatum, the medium spiny neurons (MSN), are derived from distal-less homeobox 1/2 (Dlx 1/2) progenitors in the germinal zone of the lateral ganglionic eminence. 22 MSN migrate tangentially into the striosome and matrix, influenced by the signalling factors BDNF (brain-derived neutrotrophic factor) and Mash-1 among others. 22 The genes Forkhead box P1 and P2 are also associated with striatal development, and in contrast to other genes and factors mentioned above, their expression persists into adulthood. 22 Striatal interneurons, comprising approximately 10% of the striatum, arise from tangential migration originating in the medial ganglionic eminence. 7 The subventricular zone is the zone of origin for the radial migration of the majority (90%) of striatal projection neurons (MSN), under the influence of Dlx 1/2 and Netrin-1."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "MSN are characterized through expression of dopamine-and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa and comprise the majority of neurons in human striatum (X90%). 6, 7, 22 As projection neurons, the MSN receive the majority of afferents from the midbrain, thalamus and cortex, and subserve outputs to the same regions as well as the globus pallidus and substantia nigra downstream. 22 Thus, the MSN serve as the structural basis of the corticostriatal circuits.\nIn adulthood, there remain regions within or adjacent to the striatum that are sites of potential neurogenesis. The core of the nucleus accumbens comprises islets of cells that have potential for neurogenesis, 23 as does a remnant of the subventricular zone. 24 It has been observed that neurogenesis in these regions does occur in neurodegenerative diseases of the striatum, 25, 26 perhaps in response to neuronal loss, as well as dendritic degeneration of MSN in neurodegenerative disease. 27, 28 A recent large genome-wide association study of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study found replicated genetic association for the right caudate volume at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs163030, with a peak around two genes related to dopamine signalling and development, WDR41 and PDE8B."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "This study also identified three other genes associated with caudate volume in the ADNI cohort: GMDS, encoding an enzyme involved in metabolism pathways and neuronal migration; C10orf46 (CAC1), a cell cycle--associated protein; and TMSB4X, involved in corticogenesis as well as actin polymerization. 29 Thus, there may be an ensemble of specific genetic factors associated with striatal volume, ranging from developmental factors and signalling genes to expressed proteins, providing a potential genetic basis for an endomorphotype and hence, endophenotype."}, {"section_title": "STRUCTURE OF THE STRIATUM", "text": "The striatum comprises the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. 21, 23 The nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle receive inputs from the limbic regions of the brain, such as insula, amygdala and hippocampus, being referred to as the limbic or ventral striatum. The dorsal striatum or neostriatum, comprising the caudate nucleus (Latin: the nucleus with a tail), and the putamen (Latin: wheat husk) receive inputs from association cortex and primary sensory-motor areas, and are neuroanatomically and functionally related. 1, 2, 23 The caudate and putamen are each divided into functional subregions based on afferents received from the frontal cortex and substantia nigra. 3, 9, 30 The ratio of cortical inputs is highly compressed, at 10 000--20 000 cortical neurons to one medium spiny neuron, 11, 31 while the output ratio from striatum to globus pallidus is 300:1.\n11, 32 The caudate receives connections on its lateral aspect from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior orbitofrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, and the tail receives input from the frontal eye fields. On its medial aspect, the caudate is connected to the anterior cingulate cortex 1--3,23 ( Figure 1 ). The putamen receives connections on its medial aspect from the motor cortex and somatosensory cortex. The lateral putamen receives connections from the supplementary motor area. In addition, there have been connections 3, 30 described from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the ventral aspect of the putamen. There are also grey matter bridges linking the caudate and putamen above their mutual origin in the nucleus accumbens. 3 These specific connections of the neostriatum may constitute a map of related cortical regions. 21 Because of the anatomical distribution of these functional capacities across the neostriatum, regional changes in shape and volume of the structures may relate to specific circuit dysfunction with resultant clinical consequences. The frontostriatal circuits traverse the caudate and, to a lesser extent, also by interconnection, the putamen. Corticostriatal circuits in humans have recently been visualized in vivo, by diffusion tensor MRI, confirming, in humans, the pathways originally proposed via neuroanatomical studies of primates. 4, 5 Therefore, the morphology of the neostriatum, comprising the caudate and putamen, is a suitable candidate as an endomorphotypic structural basis of endophenotypes, owing to the strategic location of the neostriatum within corticostriatal circuits."}, {"section_title": "CORTICOSTRIATAL CIRCUITS", "text": "Evolutionarily, corticostriatal circuits are crucial in human behaviour and cognition, constituting five significant neurodevelopmentally distinct parallel pathways found only in the closest phylogenetically related species, 1, 10, 33 confirmed by recent functional brain imaging in humans. 4, 5 These circuits share commonalities in cytoarchitecture, with three circuits primarily arising from the prefrontal cortex serving roles in executive cognitive function, emotional and behaviour regulation. 10 Arising from the prefrontal cortex are the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, the orbitofrontal circuit and the anterior cingulate circuit. 10 Two other circuits, not discussed further here, are thought to serve mainly motor functions in the eye and body, respectively. 10, 21 The architecture of the three prefrontal circuits comprises: origin from the relevant prefrontal region, via the caudate or nucleus accumbens, via the globus pallidus, via the thalamus, and thence, feedback to the prefrontal cortex. In summary, these are cortico-striato-pallidothalamic-cortical circuits. (Figures 2--5 )."}, {"section_title": "TYPOLOGY OF STRIATAL NEURODEGENERATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR MORPHOLOGY", "text": "It can therefore be proposed, on the basis of the existence of the corticostriatal circuits, that deafferentation of MSN (via loss of cortical or other afferents) may induce morphological change in the striatum. The likely effect of deafferentation from cortical neurons is reduction in size and/or number of interneurons, with consequent downstream effects on the efferent pathways and targets of the striatum via trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, which has been proposed as a mechanism of neurodegeneration in AD. 34, 35 Essentially, trans-synaptic neurodegeneration is based on the premise that altered regulation of synaptic connections and activities, which may arise from deafferentation, results in the neuronal activity-dependent spread of neurodegenerative disease in vulnerable brain networks. 35 Retrograde trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, in which the cell degeneration proceeds to the cell body from the damaged axon, has recently been confirmed in humans in that following upon lesions of the occipital lobe, shrinkage of the optic tract and retinal nerve fibre layer have been observed. 36 However, owing to the ratio compression of cortical and other afferents, deafferentation of the neostriatum needs to be marked to effect a detectable morphological change. MSN dendritic arbores contribute to caudate volume, and previous neuropathological studies in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have found deafferentation results in dendritic degeneration. 27, 28 Altered dendritic morphology may also contribute to shape change. The exact extent of deafferentation needed to effect changes in the striatum is as yet unknown; this will require studies quantifiying morphological changes in all components of corticostriatal circuits, which are planned for the future. Similarly, white matter disease, such as that due to cerebrovascular lesions and multiple sclerosis, may have a deafferenting impact upon the striatum by means of disconnection of the white matter itself. Indeed, white matter-and grey matter-mediated deafferentation may be cumulative or synergistic in effect on the striatum.\nNeuropathology directly affecting the neostriatum, such as in Huntington's disease (HD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or choreoacanthocytosis (ChAc), is most likely to result in marked atrophy and morphological changes in the neostriatum, corresponding to the impact of the first category of direct neuropathology on the morphology of the striatum. 12, 15, 37, 38 In frontotemporal lobar degeneration, where deafferentation may result from cortical atrophy, combined with neuropathology in the neostriatum, owing to richer connections between the frontal cortex and the striatum, intermediate change should be evident, corresponding to the second category of impact on the morphology of the neostriatum. 13,14,39--41 Finally, in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or similar non-striatumspecific neurodegeneration, where the primary process is in the hippocampus or elsewhere, with lesser neostriatal neuropathology owing to less-rich interconnections between temporal/parietal cortex and the striatum, we would expect the least morphological change, corresponding to the third category of impact on the morphology of the neostriatum. 14, 16, 42, 43 QUANTIFYING MORPHOLOGY USING ADVANCED MRI ANALYSIS: TOWARDS AN ENDOMORPHOTYPE From the cytoarchitectural studies detailed above, 1--3 functional atlases of the interconnections of the neostriatum have been developed. 4, 5 Recent studies demonstrate that corticostriatal circuits are concurrently segregated and overlapping; so that afferent maps to the striatum depict gradients of connectivity to cortical and subcortical circuit components. 4, 5 Thus, in our mapping of putative striatal afferent connectivity (Figure 1 ), we infer a gradient of connection to afferent origins (cortical and subcortical) being strongest in the specified surface regions.\nMethods that assess three-dimensional striatal shape, such as spherical harmonic analysis, 14, 44 radial distance mapping, 16 and growing adaptive meshes, 42 combined with atlases, have allowed analysis of systematic effects and structural--functional correlations of the neostriatum in neurodegenerative brain disease. This work continues the application of mathematics and physics to morphology outlined by Thompson, 45 with advances in computational neuroscience.\nIn brief, the common features of the shape analytic methods above comprise:\n(1) ability to measure precisely the surface of the striatum using specific algorithms on MRI obtained in vivo; (2) ability to calculate an average shape of the striatum, based on disease group/control group membership; (3) statistical comparison of the average shape of the striatum between comparator groups; and (4) statistical correlation of the average shape of the striatum within a group with clinically relevant measures, such as disease duration, symptom level, neuropsychological testing and other disease variables.\nUsing shape or morphological analysis, we discuss the types of striatal neurodegeneration outlined above, citing specific studies that illustrate the significance of such methods."}, {"section_title": "TYPES OF STRIATAL NEURODEGENERATION", "text": "Direct neurodegeneration of the striatum: morphology Diseases directly impacting upon the striatum putatively alter morphology, and hence function, to the greatest degree. Let us discuss some prototypic diseases in this category: HD, ChAc and PSP.\nArising from abnormal CAG triplet repeats on the Huntingtin gene on chromosome 4, HD (OMIM 613004) 46 has long been known to show neuropathology in the striatum. 47 That caudate atrophy may serve as a neuroimaging biomarker has been proposed for some time. 48 Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to map morphological alteration, and hence atrophy, in HD. 37, 38, 49 The degree of striatal atrophy is marked, and has been observed in a gradient from lesser atrophy in premanifest HD compared with greater in manifest HD. 38 Furthermore, a greater dorsal--lesser ventral pattern of atrophy, consistent with neuropathologically ascertained atrophy has been found. 37, 38, 49 Due to existence of specific corticostriatal afferents, it may be inferred that subregional atrophy of the caudate and putamen has implications for corticostriatal circuit dysfunction. 38, 49 The next logical step would be to correlate clinical and neuropsychological measures (of corticostriatal circuit-mediated cognition) with striatal morphology, which has been attempted, in part, in volumetric studies and revealed that caudate volume at least is inversely related to movement disorder severity. 50 Thus, there is evidence that altered morphology of the striatum in HD is a viable biomarker for HD.\nChAc (OMIM 200150) 46 ,51 is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with mutations or deletions in the VPS13A gene on chromosome 9q, resulting in neurological and psychiatric manifestations, as well as (red blood cell) acanthocytes. 15 In limited neuropathological studies, striatal atrophy and gliosis has been noted. 52 The morphology of the caudate and putamen is significantly altered in ChAc, early in the disease process, and again follows a dorsal--ventral gradient that may potentially correlate with motoric and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have as their substrate corticostriatal circuits. 15 These findings concur with the previous voxel-based morphometric approaches. 53, 54 PSP(OMIM: PSNP1 601104; PSNP2 609454; and PSNP3 610898) 46 is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by gait and postural disturbance, gaze palsy, apathy, decreased verbal fluency and dysexecutive symptoms, with these clinical features potentially having origins in degeneration of corticostriatal circuits and the mesencephalon. 12, 55 Neuropathological studies have shown that accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein and neuropil filaments within the striatum is significant. 55 Using morphometric methods, significantly smaller striatal volumes were found in the PSP group: putamina were 10% smaller and caudate volumes were 17% smaller than in controls. Shape analysis revealed significant shape deflation in PSP in the striatum, compared with controls. Morphological regionally significant change relevant to corticostriatal circuits in the caudate was found.\nBased on the above studies, there is considerable evidence that morphological change in the striatum: can be detected with in vivo MRI using different image analysis methods; can be resolved to specific regional atrophy with functional implications; and is a robust measure. Therefore, morphology of the striatum as assessed via MRI is a potential biomarker in neurodegenerative affecting the striatum, and a suitable basis for an endomorphotype.\nIndirect neurodegeneration of the striatum: specific deafferentation In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a group of neurodegenerative diseases in which specific frontal and temporal cortical atrophy is a key neuropathology, it has been proposed that cortical deafferentation may effect morphological change in the striatum due to mechanisms of trans-synaptic neurodegeneration. 14, 21, 34, 35 However, direct neuropathology of the striatum has also been observed in FTLD and its clinical subtypes. 56, 57 Using morphometric MRI methods, it has been found that a gradient of striatal atrophy exists, consistent with the putative degree of corticostriatal dysfunction between FTLD, AD and controls.\n14 A gradient of atrophy is furthermore present in subtypes of FTLD, atrophy being greatest in the behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, lesser in progressive nonfluent aphasia and least in semantic dementia. 13 A dorsal--ventral pattern of striatal atrophy has also been demonstrated in FTLD and subtypes, a commonality with HD, ChAc and PSP. 12--15,38,49 However, the degree of morphological change in FTLD and subtypes is lesser than that observed in the prototypic primary striatal neurodegenerative disorders. 12, 13, 15, 49 Specific regional patterns of striatal atrophy in FTLD and subtypes implicate, in particular, fronto--striato--pallido--thalamic--cortical re-entrant pathways, and are consistent with the cognitive, motor and behavioural dysfunctions observed in such diseases. 14, 38 Although specific correlation of structure with clinical features is yet to be demonstrated, it is proposed such correlations may exist, especially in the context of analogous studies in neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, schizotypal personality disorder studies demonstrated structural--functional correlations between verbal learning capacity and anterior caudate. 58, 59 Indeed, specific patterns of striatal atrophy, relevant to corticostriatal circuits, have been detected in bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and relatives of persons with schizophrenia. 60--62 Indirect generalized deafferentation of the striatum AD is caused by neurodegeneration that progresses in two spatiotemporal gradients, left hemisphere before right, and from temporal to frontal to sensorimotor regions. 63 Such general temporal and frontal lobe atrophy may result in deafferentation of the striatum. There is neuropathological evidence that amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in the striatum, 64 and functional neuroimaging (positron emission tomography) evidence of amyloid accumulation in sporadic and autosomal dominant AD. 65, 66 Finally, in AD, there is a generalized reduction of neurogenesis, which may also affect the striatum. 24 Using radial distance mapping, an 8.5% significant reduction in volume of the right caudate in AD compared with controls in the ADNI cohort, with generalized atrophy of the head and body of the caudate and loss of right versus left asymmetry, has been demonstrated in AD, 16 but a further study, on a smaller Australian cohort, using radial distance mapping found no significant atrophy in caudate or putamen compared with controls. 49 Bilateral atrophy of the medial head of the caudate has been demonstrated via growing adaptive mesh-shape analysis. 42 Putaminal atrophy in AD compared with controls has also been found, using volumetry. 43 In another study, using spherical harmonic-shape analysis, bilateral caudate and putamen shape was overall significantly different from controls, but specific shape deflation was largely confined to posterior caudate. 14 The striatal afferent regions implicated in the above shape analysis studies include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and rostral motor regions (motor cortex and premotor cortex; Figure 1 ). This may reflect generalized atrophy of the cortex in AD, but nonetheless would be expected to have functional implications for cognition. Indeed, the ADNI study found that caudate atrophy was correlated with clinical dementia rating scores, delayed logical memory scores, mini-mental state scores a year later, age and body mass index. 16 Reduced right caudate volume showed association with conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD and cerebrospinal fluid tau protein levels. 16 This indicates that caudate atrophy is associated with cognitive impairment, as well as other clinical features that may contribute to cognitive impairment (age, body mass index and tau accumulation). Thus, there is evidence that the caudate in AD is a candidate biomarker."}, {"section_title": "RELATIVE ROLE OF STRIATUM AS A BIOMARKER", "text": "The striatum has a significant role as part of an ensemble of quantitative clinical neuroimaging biomarkers in neurodegenerative disease, especially in view of the relative ease, reliability and amenability of the striatum to morphometry. The greater connectivity of the dorsal striatum, relative to the ventral striatum, may render it more vulnerable to the effects of deafferentation. For some disorders, in which altered striatal morphology is particularly relevant, such as HD and PSP, the role of the striatum as a biomarker may be superior to cortical atrophy. In disorders where there is both cortical and striatal atrophy of significance, such as FTLD, the striatum will be a prominent biomarker. In AD and similar disorders where there may be lesser striatal atrophy, there may still be a role for the striatum as an adjunctive biomarker."}, {"section_title": "CORRELATIONS WITH CLINICAL FEATURES", "text": "Morphology may be correlated with function. While yet to be attempted on a larger scale in neurodegenerative disease affecting the striatum, there have been studies correlating neuropsychological dysfunction with striatal morphology in schizotypal personality disorder, 58, 59 and a recent study has demonstrated that caudate atrophy was associated with delayed logical memory recall and a decline in mini-mental state examination scores. 16 Radial distance morphometric methods of the hippocampus and striatum have demonstrated that striatal morphometry may be a useful biomarker for the prediction of progression of illness from mild cognitive impairment to AD. 16, 67 It is therefore possible that neuropsychological and clinical dysfunction may be correlated with the morphology of the striatum according to the typology proposed above."}, {"section_title": "TOWARDS ENDOPHENOTYPES AND BIOMARKERS", "text": "Based on the above, there is evidence for developmental and environmental genetic factors impacting on the morphology of the striatum. There is also evidence of distinct patterns of altered striatal morphology in neurodegenerative disease, and burgeoning evidence of the association of quantitative measures of shape and clinical features in the same diseases. The conjunction of genetic, morphological and clinical features associated with the striatum thus yields probable endomorphotypes and hence, endophenotypes. 18 For example, a dysexecutive syndrome may be associated with specific regional striatal atrophy, based on the afferent connections of the striatum from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, such as in PSP. 12 Such endophenotypes may be useful biomarkers to monitor disease progression and treatment response. Morphology of the striatum as a biomarker may be used for: robust measurement of changes with decline or improvement; in prediction of future decline; and to stratify drug trial analysis into more powerful analyses that focus on those more likely to decline in function with disease. This strategy may be most powerful in neurodegenerative disease in which the genetic basis and striatal morphology have already been proposed as a biomarker, on the basis of existing knowledge of the genotype and previous morphological studies, such as in HD. 48, 68, 69 For example, in HD, the genotype of Huntingtin CAG repeat length has been associated with age and striatal volume in HD, 68 yielding a probable biomarker, which accords with other structural studies (albeit without genotype at this stage). 38, 49, 70 LIMITATIONS Currently, the relationship between in vivo morphology of the striatum, genetic factors, and cognitive, motor and behavioural features is admitted to be primarily theoretical. Similarly, the existence of corticostriatal afferents does not necessarily indicate a one-to-one correspondence between cortical deafferentation and striatal atrophy, and indeed the ratio compression of inputs and outputs to the striatum suggests that deafferentation effects are complex. Also, trans-synaptic neurodegeneration may progress up and downstream. However, the atrophy of the striatum is likely to affect the function of corticostriatal circuits, given the highly strategic hub role of the striatum. In network theory, the loss of a highly connected hub can greatly affect the entire network, especially in small-world networks, 71 multiple networks of which the human brain could be considered to be comprised. However, to examine functional networks in vivo requires functional imaging and such approaches are being explored in parallel currently, 41, 72 albeit focused on larger scale networks. 73 Much remains to be elucidated regarding possible genotypic and perhaps epigenetic factors in relation to the striatum, and research into neurodevelopmental and adult mechanisms of striatal structural integrity will be needed in parallel with in vivo morphological studies."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "The following has been demonstrated:\n(1) Neurodevelopment of the striatum is predicated upon a constrained series of homeobox genes and factors, and maintained by specific neurogenic centres in adults. (2) The unique morphology of the striatum serves as a map of neurodegeneration in vivo, an endomorphotype. It is proposed that future research build upon the foundations established above. This can be approached as follows:\n(1) Studying neurodevelopmental, neurogenesis and apoptotic processes of the striatum. This will require sophisticated collaborative interdisciplinary research, perhaps best conducted by international research consortia bringing together epidemiological samples and specific expertise. The use of neuroimaging biomarkers has already been proposed in AD 74 and in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. 75 What has been proposed here can more broadly be extended across neurodegenerative disease affecting corticostriatal neural networks, and based on previous studies, may be applicable in neuropsychiatric disorders affecting corticostriatal neural networks. In doing so, we may potentially discover strategic sites for innovative therapies, such as stem cell technology, with the possibility of targeting stem cells to sites of neurodegeneration 76 mapped via striatal endomorphotypes. In addition, in future, the tools we currently use for research may be translatable to a clinical context. Via the endomorphotype of the striatum, and hence, corticostriatal endophenotypes, a unifying and yet multi-dimensional perspective may be gained on neurodegenerative disease."}]
