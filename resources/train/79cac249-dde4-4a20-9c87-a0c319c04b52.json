These findings are supported by other autopsy studies that indicate that well-characterized subjects in the early phases of AD demonstrate neuronal loss in selective layers of the ERC and TEC [17] , [22] , [41] . This neuronal loss and injury can be indirectly measured through the analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [3] , [20] . ERC atrophy as measured on structural MRI scans has been associated with greater clinical disease severity [12] , [21] , [24] , [34] impairment on memory tests [46] , and are predictive of progression from normal cognition to MCI [52] . In addition, numerous MRI studies have shown an associatio n of hippocampal atrophy associated with disease severity [11] , [12] , [21] , [24] , [40] . In comparison, relatively few MRI studies have distinguished the TEC from the ERC or have examined the amygdala [33] , [35] . From the few recent studies on transentorhinal atrophy, there is evidence of a correlation between neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden measured from PET and atrophy rate measured from MRI in the transentorhinal cortex, as well as enhanced discrimination from healthy controls and early stages of AD using transentorhinal atrophy [48] , [49] . In previous work [45] , we found significant thickness and volume differences in the TEC of MCI subjects. In this study, we have introduced a new, unbiased, low variance method for estimating the thickness and curvat ure of the laminar neocortex based on diffeomorphic flows. This has allowed us to further investigate the differences in the local change of the volume measure by separating the detection of baseline differences from differences in atrophy rate and incorporating a protocol that provides measures of absolute thickness in addition to changes in thickness. Furthermore, we examine four regions of interest in this population to put our findings in context of the wealth of studies performed on the hippocampus: the TEC, the ERC, the hippocampus, and the amygdala.\nThe field of computational anatomy has worked to establish quantitative, robust structural imaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease [18] . Evidence of neuronal loss in the ERC and accumulation of pathology within the TEC motivate a local, laminar study of this region.\nHowever, segmentation of the ERC and TEC presents two technical hurdles. First, the proximity of the meninges and oculomotor nerve make accurate automated segmentation of the ERC difficult. Here we address this following a protocol to manually segment and then automatically correct for undesirable longitudinal variability in segmentation boundaries through a technique"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T called longitudinal diffeomorphometry [45] . The second hurdle results from the difficulty in accurately and consistently measuring distances across curved manifolds in the human cortex. We utilize a method that maps the pial surface to the grey matter-white matter boundary surface along a flow of diffeomorphisms constrained to move in a direction normal to the surface [42] . Here we assess local changes in cortical thickness over time and compute the atrophy rate and spatial distribution of these changes in the ERC and TEC separately.

The results of the linear discriminant function analysis, in which all of the available measures were combined showed that the ERC thickness and TEC thickness together improved specificity of diagnosis beyond TEC thickness alone. Addition of volume measures did not improve specificity or accuracy.

Inclusion criteria for subjects with MCI included evidence of impaired performance on the Logical Memory Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (based on age and education adjusted norms) and a score of 0.5 \uf0b3 on the clinical dementia rating scale (CDR).

We used partitions defined by Krimer et al [23] to guide the boundaries for our measurements of the ERC. This Krimer partition, as it is referred to through out this paper, divides the ERC into 9 subregions. This framework was used to construct the lateral to medial coordinates for the 9 subregions, using an established protocol [19] , [23] , [31] . MRI studies of the ERC typically define the lateral boundary of the ERC at the apex of the gyrus [12] , [21] , [24] , [34] , [46] , [52] , whereas histological studies typically extend past the apex [17] , [22] , [41] . In this study, we define the following 7 medial caudal, and (7) lateral. This definition corresponds well to how the ERC is typically defined for most MRI studies. We define the Krimer sulcal and transentorhinal regions together as the TEC; these are the sections often not included in prior MRI studies. We map the region from the subjects onto this atlas using the LDDMM framework [6] to visualize and evaluate subregional thickness. All thickness results in the ERC and TEC are shown projected onto the high field atlas\nof Figure 1 to localize information within the subregions.

Given the goals of the current analyses, we restricted the analysis to the left hemisphere and e xcluded subjects with a discontinuity in the left collateral sulcus. Manual segmentations for 35 MCI subjects that met the criteria were completed in alphanumerical order, with priority given to subjects with 4 scan times.\nERC and TEC were segmented manually by one expert (C.S.) and reviewed by another expert (T.B.) using the Seg3D software [8] . For hippocampus and amygdala segmentations, we processed the same subjects through an automated segmentation pipeline called MRICloud [36] using a set of 26 adult atlases specifically for 50-90 year old adults. The atlases were fused following a previously established label fusion algorithm [47] . Left hippocampus and left amygdala segmentations were extracted and manually corrected by an expert (T.B.) using neuroanatomical boundaries previously described [10] , [34] , [38] . All regions were adjusted for variability in segmentation boundaries over time by mapping a population template simultaneously onto each scan of a time series as shown in Figure 1 . The template surface is estimated as a triangulated mesh from the population of controls and MCI subjects [28] . Denote this mesh representation as\n, a collection of vertices representing points in 3D-space with smoothly varying normals, and we denote observed k q as a subject's mesh at time k t , where = 1, , kM indexes through scans of a subject. Each region's population template was mapped onto each subjects time-series as follows. First, the template was deformed to a subject-specific average mesh at an average time * t , not necessarily one of the observed scan times. Second, it was deformed along a continuous geodesic trajectory [32] , both forwards and backwards in time, to closely match each of the observed segmentations. The three parameters, consisting of the subject specific map, the average time * t , and the continuous trajectory, were all estimated simultaneously by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood [44] .

In our case, shifts are replaced by geodesic flows of equation (1) and (2), with resulting deformations combined using composition rather than vector addition. We i) define p , and * t by minimizing the cost:\nWe chose this specific form of cost function because it is the same as used in population template estimation [26] , with the added constraint that each deformed surface lies along a single geodesic trajectory. This type of procedure is often called geodesic regression [16] . The volume of a structureamygdala, ERC, hippocampusis calculated from the set of faces of the surface. To calculate volume, let F be the number of faces where the f -th face is defined as a set of three \n\natrophy rate of the ERC was considerably smaller.\nThe volumetric measure for the region that combined the TEC and the ERC together were also different cross-sectionally between MCI subjects and controls. The volume of the amygdala was also significantly different between these groups.\nDiscriminant function analysis was also performed to determine which of the thickness and volumetric measures described above best differentiated MCI subjects from controls. The TEC thickness had the largest sensitivity and specificity than any of the other regions (0.89 and 0.81, respectively). The clinical relevance of these MRI findings was reflected by examining the relationship between the TEC and the CDR-SB. There was a significant correlation between the CDR-SB and TEC thickness in the MCI subjects, but there was no significant correlation between the CDR-SB and ERC thickness.\nTaken together, these findings demonstrate that the TEC thickness appears to be differentially affected during the early phase of AD. Cortical thickness atrophy in the TEC corresponds well with the localization of early neurofibrillary tangle accumulat ion previously reported [7] . This study adds to the growing evidence that the thickness of the TEC could function as a biomarker for early AD. The subjects selected for this analysis were specifically chosen with strict criteria for MCI due to AD in order to reduce the confounding effects of MCI due to other conditions. Given the marked difference in cross-sectional analysis of the TEC, ERC, and amygdala, one future direction is to implement this analysis on a population of subjects earlier in the disease course as well as cognitively normal older adults following previous findings in the TEC in this population [27] . Another future direction is to implement this analysis on a larger population of subjects to determine whether significant longitudinal diagnostic differences can be detected for amygdalar volume and hippocampal volume. A larger sample size may also show hippocampal volume differences between the groups. While the volume of the hippocampus did not differ between diagnostic groups in the present s tudy, the estimated volume of the hippocampus is similar to previous reports [9] , [11] , [14] , [37] . For example, in this study the hippocampal volume for MCI subjects was 3 248 mm smaller than controls on the left hippocampus while in another study the hippocampus was 3 240 mm smaller than controls in the left hippocampus [11] .\nThis study has a number of strengths. This includes: the careful selection of subjects in order to maximize the likelihood that any differences observed were the result of underlying AD\npathology and the use of 11T MRI to place coordinates on the images.\nThe study also has some limitations. Measures of cortical thickness along the boundaries of the ERC were excluded due to inaccuracy of trajectories. Extension of surface laterally into the perirhinal cortex may yield a more complete understanding of changes in the thickness profile of this region. The analysis was restricted to subjects with a continuous collateral sulcus in the left hemisphere. Restriction to the left hemisphere was based on previous findings showing that functional and structural changes in MCI were primarily observed in the left medial temporal lobe [4] , [5] , [51] . This may be due to a functional specialization of left medial temporal lobe structures relevant to the behavioral impairments observed in subjects with MCI [15] . In the future, this work could be extended to other well-characterized variants of the collateral sulcus [13] using a multi-atlas approach [50] . Without histology as a gold standard, the accuracy of Krimer region placement on longitudinal data cannot be validated. Using mappings to the high field atlas is our best available alternative, and has been used in other studies [28] , [31] , [33] , [53] . While it remains unclear whether these regional differences could be observed without the use of 11T MRI to improve accuracy of coordinate placement, the distribution of thickness differences in Figure 8 can still be considered valid independent of the Krimer partition labels. The current study provides evidence that changes in the TEC thickness provide a sensitive measure of disease progression associated with functional decline in the MCI phase of AD, providing a potential outcome measure of disease modification in clinical trials for AD."}, {"section_title": "Cortical thickness of TEC and ERC", "text": "For estimating the cortical thickness of the ERC and TEC, we used LDDMM to generate a normal geodesic flow of the pial surface to the grey matter-white matter boundary surface. The ERC plus TEC surface template calculated in the previous section is manually cut into two surfaces: the pial surface and the grey matter-white matter boundary surface. Specifically, the boundaries were defined using dynamic programming to find the shortest geodesic path between user-defined landmarks [43] . Landmarks were chosen to be the points spaced along the inferior and superior sides of the surface at the most lateral, medial, rostral and caudal extents. These two surface cuts were then mapped to subjects using the diffeomorphic mapping described in the previous section.\nOne surface is then deformed to the other surface within the constrained LDDMM framework [2] with an additional imposed constraint that the surface must flow in the direction normal to its current surface. For details on implementation, please see [42] . Local cortical thickness is then estimated as the distance a vertex travels along the trajectory of this surface deformation as shown in Figure 3 . Due to variability of measures along the boundary, we excluded distance measures on vertices at boundary of surface cuts. A paired t-test was performed on average TEC thickness versus average ERC thickness in controls. A one-way ANCOVA were conducted on baseline TEC thickness and baseline ERC thickness to determine statistically significant differences between diagnostic groups while controlling for age and sex.
