Lacovara, PhD James Spotila, PhD In this dissertation I studied historical changes in the Delaware Bay along the New Jersey coastline to improve our understanding of the region as well as better understand how the area will respond to rising seas. The shallow sloping, low elevation shoreline of the Delaware Bay makes it especially vulnerable to sea-level rise. The New Jersey coastline along the Delaware Bay consists of coastal communities, wetlands, sandy beaches, and fetch-limited barrier islands at risk as sea-level rises and shorelines erode. Using dendrochronology and 14 C dating of peat deposits I created two sea level curves for the area. Using the 14 C curve I found a historical rate of sea level change of 1.5 mm/yr for the last 3000 years. The dendrochronological sea level curve shows a rate of 8.9 mm/yr for the last 57 years. As sea level has risen over the last 130 years, the shoreline has eroded at an average rate of 1.67 m/yr. The wetland shorelines are eroding faster than the regional average at a rate of 4.1 m/yr. As the rate of sea level rise accelerates, so does the rate of shoreline erosion. During the most recent time x period, 1970-2013, the average rate of shoreline erosion has increased to 2.64 m/yr for the whole region and 6.12 m/yr for the wetland shorelines. In addition, I sought to better understand the fetch-limited barrier islands in the region. The barrier islands are composed of well sorted, medium and coarse grained sand, which becomes coarser and poorly sorted longshore from north to south. The barrier islands are becoming more fragmented as they migrate landward, but overall sand area has remained stable since the 1970s. Understanding how the system is responding to sea-level rise is critical for helping resource managers' plan for the future of this critical tidal ecosystem. Chapter 1: Ecological Significance of the Delaware Bay and Statement of the Problem"}, {"section_title": "Ecological Significance of the Delaware Bay", "text": "The Delaware Bay is the second largest estuary on the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Near Trenton, the Delaware River becomes tidal; these upper reaches of the River are characterized by tidal freshwater marshes. The transitional zone occurs from 60 to 140 km downstream where fresh and saltwater mix (Fletcher et al., 1990). The lower tidal river is characterized by rapid accumulation of fine grained sediments due to a circulation system driven by nontidal mixing (Fletcher et al., 1990). Tidal current activity has developed a complex bathymetry in the open estuary. The Delaware Bay is classified as a 'low energy' environment where wave energy is minimal compared to open ocean coasts (Davies and Moses, 1964;Jackson et al., 2002). Wind-wave energy shapes the near shore environments while flooding of the paleo-drainage system and deposition of fine grained sediments results in the development of tidal wetlands (Fletcher et al., 1990;). The shallow sloping, low elevation shoreline of the Delaware Bay makes it especially vulnerable to sea-level rise. The majority of the study area is listed on the Coastal Vulnerability Index as at very high risk of inundation with sea-level rise (Cooper et al., 2005;Office of Coastal Management, 2011). Sea-level rise itself does not cause increased erosion (it simply causes inundation), but rising sea levels can drive erosion by allowing more wave energy and larger waves to reach more of the beach thus increasing erosion (Leatherman et al., 2000;Zhang et al., 2004). The New Jersey coastline along the Delaware Bay consists of coastal communities, wetlands, sandy beaches, and fetch-limited barrier islands at risk as sealevel rises and shorelines erode. Erosion of salt marsh wetlands is of particular concern as these ecosystems are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world and provide critical ecosystem resources Office of Coastal Management, 2011). Tidal wetlands sequester carbon, cycle nutrients, absorb flood waters, buffer wave energy, and prevent pollutants and sediments from entering open water (Stammermann and Piasecki, 2012). Coastal birds, forage and nest in wetlands while many marine organisms spawn and grow in the estuary utilizing the nutrients released by the tidal wetlands and inlets. The sandy parts of the coastline provides critical habitat for the world's largest population of horseshoe crabs which come to the fetch-limited beaches every year to mate and lay eggs (Cooper et al., 2005). The horseshoe crab eggs provide a critical food supply for migrating birds including piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) and the endangered red knot (Calidris canutus). Terrapin turtles (Malaclemys terrapin), a species of special concern in New Jersey, also nest on the sandy beaches in the bay. Furthermore, humans utilize the Bays resources both recreationally and professionally by fishing, boating, bird watching, and crabbing. People make their homes along the southern and northern ends of the study area, which are at risk of erosion, inundation, and increased storm energy as sea-level rises. Knowing the historical rates of sea-level rise and shoreline change along this coastline will help resource managers' plan for the future of tidal ecosystems and human communities."}, {"section_title": "1.2: Statement of the Problem", "text": "In this dissertation I studied historical changes in the Delaware Bay to improve our understanding of the region as well as better understand how the area will respond to rising seas. Sea level studies have generally neglected the New Jersey Coastline of the Delaware Bay. Therefore, using dendrochronology and 14C dating of peat deposits we sought to create two sea level curves for the area. The 14C curve goes back about 6,000 years and provides a historical rate of sea level change. The dendrochronological sea level curve only goes back about 60 years and reflects the most recent rates of sea-level rise. By understanding historical rates of sea level change, we can better predict how local relative sea level will change in the future. As sea-level rises, the shoreline migrates upward and inland. Various studies have determined rates of shoreline loss for the open ocean coastlines of the United States, but inland coastlines including bays have not been studied. Using historical maps I determined the rate of shoreline loss along the New Jersey coast of the Delaware Bay. This information will help resources managers better prepare for the loss of coastal habitats. In addition, I sought to better understand the fetch-limited barrier islands in the region. Fetch-limited barrier islands are generally understudied and prior work in the Delaware Bay has not included fieldwork. I characterized the beaches through field observations and a sedimentological study, and sought to understand how sediment making up the islands varies along longshore and cross-shore transects. Improving our understanding of beach sediments and morphology provides insight into currents in the Bay as well as how the beaches have changes and will change. Finally, I used aerial imagery to study the historical changes in shape and area of the fetch-limited barrier islands. This information allows for examination how the islands have responded to rising seas and increased wave energy. I want to know how the beaches have changed and how they will change to better understand potential for habitat loss in the region. Chapter 2: Literature Review"}, {"section_title": "Historical Eustatic Sea-level", "text": "Global or eustatic sea-level changes result from fluctuations in the volume of water in the oceans. Rapid large scale changes come about with changes in continental ice sheets on the order of thousands of years (Miller et al., 2005). Variations in ground water, changes in marginal seas, and thermal contraction/expansion of seawater have a smaller overall impact, but also affect eustatic sea-levels on the order of thousands of years. Variations in sedimentation and ocean basin volume affect changes in sea-level on the order of millions of years (Miller et al., 2005;Miller et al., 2011). Changes in eustatic sea-level variation are estimated using tide gauges, coral dating, shoreline markers, oxygen isotopes, and fossils (Miller et al., 2005;Miller et al., 2011) Reconstructing ancient sea-levels is complicated by regional conditions causing variations in sea-level at any one point around the globe. Data from any one region represent local relative sea-level, which is how eustatic sea-level manifests itself locally. Local variations in sea-level are caused by a combination of eustatic and local conditions including sedimentation, compaction, and glacial isostatic adjustment. Studies of the Pliocene paleoclimate are particularly useful for predicting future changes in sea-level. During the Pliocene, ca 5.3 to 2.6 Ma, temperatures were 2-3 \u02daC greater than today and CO2 levels are thought to have been between 330-415 ppmv, which is similar to the 390 ppmv measured in 2011 (Miller et al., 2012). In addition, the configuration of tectonic plates was almost identical to today. Therefore, the Pliocene relationship between global climate change, atmospheric CO2, and sea-level change can be used to better understand current fluxes in sea-level (Miller et al., 2012). Eustatic sea-level during the Pliocene has been estimated to have peaked between 22 and 35 m above present levels during the high-stand from 3.2 to 2.7 Ma (Miller et al., 2012). Despite disagreements on the height of peak sea-level, most studies agree that both the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were melted during this time but disagree on the extent of melting of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) (Miller et al., 2012). Complete melting of the of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic Ice sheet accounts for 5 m and 7 m of sea-level rise respectively leaving between 13 and 23 m unaccounted, with many studies suggested extensive melting of the EAIS (Lythe and Vaughan, 2001;Miller et al., 2012). After reexamining the data Miller et al. (2012) argue that the peak was most likely around 22 \u00b110 m, which is in agreement with the IPCC assessment that sea-level peaked at 20 m above sea-level during the middle Pliocene . They argue that at the temperatures and CO2 levels of the Pliocene the interior of the EAIS would be relatively stable contributing at most 10 m to sea-level rise mainly from melt at the margins. Reconstructing global sea-levels from this period is difficult as it is hard to account for thermal expansion, tectonic activity, isostatic adjustments, and initial regional differences in response to global sea-level rise. The similarity in current CO2 and temperature conditions to those during the Pliocene indicate that near complete or complete melting of the West Antarctic and Greenland Ice sheets is highly likely if temperatures continue to rise. More recently, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Antarctic ice sheet was larger and large ice sheets covered North America and Europe (Lambeck et al., 2002). The LGM began about 45,000 years ago and reached maximum ice extent about 30,000 years ago and remained stable for another 10,000 years (Lambeck et al., 2002). By using shallow dwelling corals researchers estimate that sea-levels were 120\u00b15 m below current levels during the peak of the LGM (Church et al., 2008;Miller et al., 2005). After the LGM, the land based glaciers melted rapidly from 20,000 to 7,000 years ago. Sea-levels rose at an average rate 10 mm/year with some periods experiencing rates as rapid as 40 mm/yr due to the melting of land based glaciers (Church et al., 2008). Then, from 7,000 to 2,000 years ago global sea-level rose slowly (Church et al., 2008;Lambeck et al., 2002). At about 2000 years ago, the sedimentary record indicates essentially no sea-level change until the onset of modern sea-level rise during the 19th century (Church et al., 2008). Modern, since the 20th century, sea-level change is generally based on local tide gauge records (Church and White, 2006). Tide gauge data represent local changes in sea-level relative to a coastal benchmark. Sea-level varies locally due to the melting of land based ice sheets, thermal expansion of ocean water, and glacial isotactic adjustment (GIA) of the crust (Church and White, 2011;Church et al., 2008;. Tide gauge records are limited and contain substantial variability, which overshadows any acceleration in sea-level rise (Church and White, 2006). Since these are local data, records must be corrected in order to estimate eustatic sea-level change over the period represented by tide gauges alone (Church et al., 2004). Actual global data has been measured since 1993 by satellite altimeters. They are used with the tide gauge data to estimate reconstructed variations in global sea-level and rise before 1993 (Church and White, 2006). The recent satellite data corrects the noisy, but long term, tide gauge data by reducing temporal variability (Church and White, 2006). This allows the local tide gauge data to be used to accurately reconstruct global changes from the 1870s to present. Church and White (2006) reconstructed data from 1870 to 2004 and found that global mean sea-level rose by 195 mm at an average of 1.44 mm/yr. When sea-level data is limited to just the 20th century, the rate of rise increases to 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm/yr (Church and White, 2006). If sea-level continues to accelerate at this rate, then sea-level will be 310 \u00b1 30 mm higher in 2100 than it was in 1990 (Church and White, 2006). This is consistent with the central range projection of the IPCC from 2007(IPPC, 2007. However, recent precise satellite altimeter observations between 1993 to 2008 show a rapid increase in this rate to 3.11 \u00b1 0.6 mm/yr (Ablain et al., 2009). This most recent rate suggests that sealevel in 2100 will most likely be at least 0.6 to 1.6 m above present, which is consistent with the upper range projections of the IPCC 2007 report (Jevrejeva et al., 2010). Figure   2.1 shows sea level reconstructed sea level from the IPCC 2013 report as well as the IPCC projections for future sea level . Some scientists argue that the IPCC produced very conservative estimates especially since the IPCC range assumes a net zero contribution from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Church et al., 2008;Rahmstorf, 2010). In his 2010 paper, Rahmstorf compares estimates made since the 2007 IPCC report and found that out of six projections only three estimates had lower limits that overlapped with the upper limits of IPCC report (Rahmstorf, 2010). The other three had projections with lower limits greater than the upper limit of the IPCC 2007. Jevrejevaet al. (2012, which is included in Rahmstorf's 2010 paper, projects 2100 sealevels to be between 0.57 to 1.1 m above current sea-level. Recent work suggests that the ice sheets are less stable then the IPCC assumes (Church et al., 2008). There are concerns that the Greenland ice sheet melt water may be finding its way to the base of the ice sheet and increasing melt there causing the ice sheet to slide more rapidly at the beginning of each summer (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006). In Antarctica, there are concerns that warmer water may be penetrating the base of the ice sheet and causing melt. There are also concerns that the estimates of Antarctica's total ice volume may be low, meaning that there is potential for even more contribution as the ice sheet melts (Church et al., 2008). When making projections it is important to account for changes in all ice sheets and the potential for accelerating rates due to increased warming, but the models do not adequately account for ice sheet processes. Sea-level change occurs on both temporal, from millennial to decadal, and spatial scales, from global to local (Church et al., 2008). It can be difficult to determine what factors are most important to each of these scales (Church et al., 2008). The more we research geological changes in sea-level on all scales the better we will be able to predict future changes. Rising sea-level will make coastal communities more vulnerable to floods and storm surges (Church et al., 2008). Knowing the rate of sea-level change will help coastal communities prepare for diminishing shorelines, habitat loss, and increased flooding (Church et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Local Relative Sea-level Change in the Delaware Bay", "text": "How global sea-level affects individual coastlines extent depends on local geological conditions. For example, the rate of rise for Galveston, Texas, is significantly higher than the global rate due to its easily compacted fine-grained mud platform and to the rapid extraction of oil and gas, which exacerbates local subsidence. On the other hand, in Sitka, Alaska, local sea-level is decreasing as the area experiences isostatic rebound due to glacial retreat. Local geology, coastline slope, shallow subsidence and deep subsidence all influence the rates of local relative sea-level change. Regional relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic Coast of the United States over the last 2000 years was mainly caused by glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) due to the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet proglacial forebulge . Even though the ice sheet melted by 7,000 years ago, GIA continues today on the US Atlantic coast. Because the Delaware estuary is underlain by compactable fine-grain sediment and is characterized by a low-gradient estuarine shoreline, it will experience substantial compaction with even small rises in sea-level . Since average slope of the Delaware Bay is 1:1000-3000, 1 cm of sea-level rise will result in about 10 to 30 m of shoreline retreat Lacovara, 1990;Rosen, 1978). Thus, small changes in sea-level will have a tremendous impact on this region, so determining historical rates of change for the area is critical to predicting future coastline loss. Over the last 2,000 years, Delaware Bay experienced both a transgression and a regression .  observed these transitions by radiocarbon dating the facies changes in core samples from the Leipsic River Valley, Delaware. About 2,000 years ago the area was characterized by an estuarine environment, which drowned due to a marine transgression characterized by rapidly rising water levels.  and  observed this same transition at 1,800 years ago on the New Jersey side of the bay . This transgression lasted until about 900 years ago when the water receded in a marine still-stand and the area was once again characterized by tidal wetland facies, which have persisted until today . These two events are specific examples of local sea-level change as opposed to eustatic sea-level changed discussed above. A study by Nikitina et al. (2000) produced a sea-level curve for the Delaware Coast within the Delaware Bay. They used new radiocarbon dates from 22 basal peat deposits and recalibrated 16 previously published dates to establish the long term trends as well as tide gauge, cesium, and lead data to establish short term trends. They found that sea-level rose at 1.9 mm/yr from 2000 to 1250BP and at 0.9 mm/yr from 1250 to present. Their results are similar to a study by Belknap and Kraft (1977) that found a slightly higher rate of 1.3 mm/yr from 1250 to present. However, due to the large error envelope surrounding the curves, the difference is not significant. Neither study is precise enough to determine when the more recent acceleration to current, more rapid rates began. A study from 2009 produced a sea-level curve for the upper and lower Delaware coast .  estimate a rate of sea-level rise of 1.7\u00b10.2 mm/yr for the upper Delaware Bay and 1.2\u00b10.2 mm/yr lower Delaware Bay along the Delaware coast over the last 2000 years. However, the data for this study had relatively large uncertainties and did not account for the effects of changes in the tidal range during the Holocene. This was accounted for in a study by Nikitinaet al. (2015). The study controlled for the effects of tidal changes during the late Holocene and found that Engelhartet al. (2009) and other previous studies had overestimated the rate of subsidence/sea-level rise in the upper Delaware Bay. When they controlled for tidal range in previous studies they found essentially no difference between rates in the upper bay (1.26\u00b10.33 mm/yr) and the lower bay (1.3\u00b10.36 mm/yr). The study also produced a sealevel curve for Sea Breeze, New Jersey, which added to the two other sea-level curves for New Jersey coast in the Delaware Bay. At Sea Breeze they calculated that sea-level rose at 1.12\u00b10.22 mm/yr from 2200 to 150 years ago . The study estimates a regional rate of 1.25\u00b10.27 mm/yr for the entire bay for 2200 to 150 years ago, which is closer to the rates observed in other parts of the Atlantic not influenced by as large a tidal range. However, the extensive tidal range in the Delaware Bay will only exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on the region. The most recent rates of sea-level change for the Delaware Estuary come from two tide gauges in the Delaware Bay. The one at Cape May, NJ, shows a trend of 4.06 \u00b1 0.74 mm/yr from 1965from to 2006from (NOAA, 2011. This rate is equivalent to a change of 0.4 m over 100 years (NOAA, 2011). When the data are extended to 2012, the rate increases to 4.64 \u00b1 0.62 mm/yr (NOAA, 2012). The other tide gauge at Lewes, Delaware, located across the bay from Cape May, NJ, shows a slightly slower rate of 3.2 \u00b1 0.28 mm/yr based on monthly mean sea-level data from 1919 to 2006 (NOAA, 2011). This is equivalent to a change of 0.32 meters over 100 years. The rate of rise increases to 3.65 \u00b1 0.26 mm/yr when data from 2006 to 2012 are added to the calculations (NOAA, 2012). These rates are significantly faster than the global rate over similar periods because the region is undergoing GIA and shallow subsidence as the coastline compacts. However, these tide gauges only exist at the opening of the Delaware Bay, so the most recent rate of local relative sea-level change is unknown over large stretches of the Delaware Estuary shoreline. This lack of information is common for large areas of global coastlines. Thus, ascertaining the rate for specific locales is important in order to provide scientists and resource managers with valuable tools for predicting habitat loss in this area due to sea-level rise over the next century."}, {"section_title": "Dendrochronology as a tool to measure sea-level changes", "text": "Dendrochronology is based on the principal that trees of the same species growing in the same area produce similar patterns of growth. The width of annual tree rings is related to the temperature and precipitation conditions of that year . Trees of the same species in the same region will exhibit the same ring width patterns allowing for the development of chronologies (Stokes, 1996). Composite chronologies developed from both living and dead tree records can go back thousands of years. These chronologies, produced through crossdating, can be used to date geologic and historic events as well as reconstruct past climates (Pilcher, 1973;. Dendrochronology can provide precise dates for geologic events including earthquakes, glaciation, flooding, and mass movements (Beniston, 2002;Wiles et al., 1996). The principle of crossdating is used to apply dates to tree ring records (Figure 2.2). Crossdating matches the patterns of wide and narrow rings to date trees and was developed by A.E. Douglas in the early 1900 (Speer, 2010). Crossdating is based on the principle that variations in tree ring widths are driven by environmental factors, which will produce similar patterns in trees of the same species (Hughes et al., 1982). The outermost ring will correspond to the year that a living tree was cored and the subsequent rings can be counted and dated. However, simply counting tree rings will likely result in errors as individual trees may have false rings or may be missing rings (Speer, 2010).Thus, crossdating matches similar ring width patterns between trees and identifies missing rings and false rings (Fritts, 1976;Shroder, 1980;Speer, 2010 (Hupp and Morris, 1990). They measured the sediment buildup from the base of the tree and then determined sedimentation rates based on the age of the tree. Archaeologists use dendrochronology to date historic and prehistoric log structures. For example, researchers were able to determine the harvesting time period of logs used to construct a slave cabin built on President Andrew Jackson's plantation . In this case, the cabin was built out of eastern red cedars (Juniperus virginiana), which is an important dendrochronological species as it is particularly rot resistant. Since tree rings record seasonal differences in temperature and precipitation by producing annual rings, dendrochronology can be used to reconstruct ancient climates. This subset of dendrochronology is known as dendroclimatology (Hughes et al., 1982;Hughes, 2002;White et al., 2010). Dendroclimatology is particularly useful as it can be used to reconstruct climate and weather patterns at a high temporal resolution providing data for regions and time periods where direct observations are not available (Beniston, 2002). The idea is that wider rings indicate a longer, milder growing season meaning warmer temperatures in the polar and upper altitude regions (Alley et al., 2010;Beniston, 2002;White et al., 2010). In lower latitudes and arid regions, ring width correlates to summer moisture (Beniston, 2002;Tessier et al., 1997). Reconstructing climate variables in less extreme regions (where neither temperature nor precipitation is the primary limiting factor) requires more complex methods than simple tree-ring width measurements . There are many factors that affect tree growth in addition to temperature and precipitation, which cause noise in dendrochronological climate reconstructions. However, the climate signal is the only factor that shows annual periodicity and can be consistently seen in samples over a large region . Conifers are typically the easiest trees to date because they produce easy to interpret records without missing rings or double rings that can make dating difficult. Eastern red cedars are datable, but it is often difficult due to frequency at which false rings and double rings form. However, they are important because compared to most conifers, cedars are particularly rot resistant . Therefore, they remain datable after most other species would have rotted away. Their rot resistance allows eastern red cedars to remain standing in marshes long after the tree has died. Coastal forests, including those made up of eastern red cedars, typically experience greater flooding. This results in \"ghost forests\" as trees die due to greater salt-water intrusion (Williams et al., 2009). In their article, Williams et al. (2009) note that ghost forests are \"common in southern New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina\" (Williams et al., 2009).The increasing numbers of drowned forests show the change in sea-level over the last century and can be used to determine the local rate of sea-level change."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Marshes", "text": "The coastal marshes from Maine to New Jersey formed from 7000 to 4000 years ago as sea-level rise slowed after the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet (Hartig et al., 2002). Today, some of those marshes are drowning as sea-level rise has once again accelerated and caused submergence and erosion of salt marshes. However, changes in sea-level do not necessarily result in losses. Rising sea-levels often carry more sediment inland, which helps the marsh maintain its elevation. In fact, in many parts of the United States, marsh accretion rates are exceeding or keeping pace with sea-level rise (Hartig et al., 2002). As sea-level rises, salt marshes must aggrade at an equal or greater rate in order to maintain an elevation above sea-level. Without an adequate sediment supply, salt marshes are inundated, converted to open water, and their ecosystem services lost (Orson et al., 1985;Orson et al., 1998).As the one of most productive ecosystems in the world, tidal marshes provide critical habitat and ecosystem services . More than 80% of commercial and recreational fish spend part of their life in coastal marshes . Shoreline birds forage and nest in wetlands while many marine organisms spawn in near-shore habitats utilizing the nutrients released by the wetlands   (Buynevich et al., 2001). The marsh will stop moving inland and instead the high marsh will move seaward slowly replacing the low marsh (Buynevich et al., 2001). A stable marsh is then generally flat with topographic lows and highs due to tidal creeks, saltpans, and other features (Buynevich et al., 2001) (Orson et al., 1985;Orson et al., 1998  .The salt marsh systems will be reduced on the landward side when human development prevents the system from migrating inland and on the seaward side by erosion and drowning. The supratidal zone will be the first zone constricted as human structures prevent landward migration. Temperate salt marshes are dominated by the plants Spartina alterniflora in the intertidal zone, and Spartina patens in the supratidal zone. With an adequate sediment supply, marshes aggrade and each tidal zone shifts landward. As the marsh aggrades the underlying peat compacts causing shallow subsidence, and thus, the original elevation of now buried plants is not maintained. When marsh plants initially colonize the mainland, they grow on a firm substrate that maintains a consistent elevation. For the east coast of New Jersey this antecedent surface is composed of foreshore sands from previous Pleistocene marine transgressions Gallagher 2006). As the marsh migrates inland, it lays down progressive layers of peat. By coring down to the basal layer where peat is in contact with the Pleistocene sand, issues with measuring former elevation are avoided as compaction does not occur at the basal layer. Since Spartina alterniflora, grows at sea-level, its occurrence in basal peat deposits represents a reliable proxy for local-relative sea-level. The basal S. alterniflora can be dated using accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating. Using the dates and elevation data we can develop a local-relative sea-level curve for each study site."}, {"section_title": "Barrier Island Systems and Fetch-limited Barrier Islands", "text": "Barrier island systems consist of six major coastal environments . The environments include the barrier itself, defined simply as a littoral sand body, the mainland, a back barrier lagoon, inlet and inlet deltas, the barrier platform, and the shoreface (Davis, 1994;Hoyt, 1967;.  proposes that if even one of these environments is not present, then the term barrier island should not be used (Figure 2.3). The presence of the mainland establishes the island as a barrier. There are three mainland characteristics that influence the barrier island system: lithology, slope, and drainage. The lithology of the mainland determines the lithology of the island (Davis, 1994). Along with lithology, the slope of coastline is an important factor influencing the rate of movement of lagoonal and barrier island shorelines . Gentle antecedent slopes result in barrier islands with relatively thin barrier platforms . Thus, a greater portion of their sediment budget can be used for construction of subaerial features. This results in well-maintained barriers, but it also results in less effective mechanisms of landward migration . Therefore, barrier islands on these shallow slopes have slower rates of landward translation with sea-level rise . In areas with steeper slopes, less sediment is available for subaerial features and these barriers are more sensitive to overwash and inlet formation . Thus their landward rates of translation with sea-level rise are faster compared to barriers with on shallow slopes . According to , at a constant rate of sea-level rise and constant sediment supply, shoreline recession will remain where antecedent slopes are constant, increase with decreasing slopes, and decrease with increasing slopes. Slight changes in slope will affect the rate of recession of the barrier island. Finally, drainage characteristics of the mainland are an important factor in the evolution of barrier islands. Coastlines with trellis drainage patterns tend to produce barrier islands and lagoons with well-developed shore-parallel trends (Belknap and Kraft, 1985;. On the other hand, coastlines with dendritic drainage patterns generally produce headland barrier systems that have wetlands and estuaries with shore-normal trends . The drainage patterns affect the trends of barrier islands and control the sediment supply reaching the barrier island from the mainland (Davis, 1994). Between the mainland and island is the back barrier lagoon, which is a depositional environment separating the barrier island and inlets from the mainland. The lagoon generally accumulates silts and clay sized sediments . More sandy deposits are associated with inlet deltas, and wash over deposits. Sand occurs in the tidal flats and may be more interlaminated with muddy units forming lenticular, wavy and flaser bedding Reineck and Singh, 1973). These lagoons can contain a number of sub-environments including bays, tidal channels, tidal flats, and marshes (Oertel and Kraft, 1994). Barrier inlets connect lagoonal waters with ocean waters while also separating one island from another. They act as a pathway for water and sediment transport between the lagoon and the barrier island shoreface . In tidal systems, barrier inlets have bathymetrical and sedimentological patterns due to inlet currents, backbarrier energy sources, and open sea energy sources . The barrier island itself is the exposed sediment accumulation between two inlets as well as the shoreface and the backbarrier lagoon. The sedimentary environments of a barrier island include: the beach, foredunes, dune ridges, barrier flats, salt marshes, washover fans, spits, and tidal flats Prothero, 1990). The foreshore encompasses the intertidal zone and the end point for the majority of wave energy. Berms are a transitional zone followed by the backshore. The berms are an accumulation of loose sediment deposited by overwash and wind processes Reineck and Singh, 1973). The backshore or backbarrier includes all the landward portions of the island (Oertel and Kraft, 1994). The barrier flats in the backshore are a prograding environment which act as a platform for landward movement of the island . Barrier islands are formed by the interaction of paralic and subaerial deposition and erosion processes. There are three hypotheses concerning the formation of the barrier island (Haslett, 2000). The first is that upward building of offshore bars will produce islands from sediments eroded from the sea floor (Hoyt, 1967). The second formation theory is that a spit forms due to shoreline erosion. The spit is then converted to a barrier island due to inlet breaching (Davis, 1994;Hoyt, 1967). The third method for barrier island development argues that during periods of high water associated with storms, a bar develops in front of the beach. It then builds vertically to about the level of the temporary rise in sea-level (Hoyt, 1967). Then, when sea-level returns to normal, the bar remains above sea-level and continues to accumulate sediment. An additional factor that can determine if a barrier island will be formed is the movement of the mainland shoreface relative to the headline shore. If the landward movement of the upper shoreface of a mainland beach system is approximately equal to the retreat of the headline shore, it is unlikely that a barrier island will form. Conversely, if the headline shore of a mainland beach system is retreating faster than the upper shoreface, a barrier island platform can form which may lead to the evolution of a barrier island . As sea-level rises, barrier islands naturally migrate inland such that they maintain their elevation relative to sea-level ). There are two primary methods that allow for the sediment transport necessary for the barrier island to migrate inland: inlets and waves. Leatherman (1979) argues that inlets are critical for barrier island migration as they allow for the exchange of water and sediment for a longer period of time than overwash processes caused by storms. Overwash events are still important, but they only last for a portion of the storm, whereas sediment movement in inlets continues until the waters calm (Leatherman, 1983). Leatherman (1979) notes that previous studies estimated that 70% to 90% of the landward movement of sediment on the east coast of the United States is associated with inlets. The other 10 to 30% of sediment movement was due to overwash and eolian processes (Leatherman, 1979). Leatherman (1979) also found that overwash was important for landward barrier migration of eroding islands most likely because the barrier had reached a critical narrow width. Therefore, overwash is the primary mechanism once islands have been substantially eroded. Overwash may become more important as human development limits the sediment supply reaching barrier islands through inlets. Furthermore, rapid sea-level rise may overtake the natural mechanisms that maintain barrier islands causing them to be eroded and drowned. Human development may exacerbate barrier island erosion (Oertel and Kraft, 1994;Pilkey and Davis, 1987). Coastal stabilization efforts can starve barrier islands of sediment preventing them from maintaining their position relative to sea-level. For example, stabilization efforts of the Ocean City Inlet in 1935 resulted in increased erosion of Assateague Island as the southern end of the island was starved of sediment (Leatherman, 1979). Barrier islands and the habitat they provide may be lost due to human development and increasing sea-levels. The loss of barrier islands will have a devastating effect on inland shorelines and habitats. Barrier islands protect inshore wetlands and shorelines from wave, current, and storm energy while also providing the structural framework necessary for the formation of inland estuarine and coastal habitats (Feagin et al., 2010). In addition, barrier islands themselves provide important habitat for many species such as the endangered piping plover and horseshoe crabs that gather each year on barrier island beaches to breed. The 15,000+ barrier islands in fetch-limited environments remain understudied with most of the literature focusing on open ocean barrier islands, which total only 2,200 around the world . Fetch-limited barrier islands (FLBI) are defined by  as barrier islands that develop in sheltered waters, such as bays or lagoons, where they are protected from high-energy wave conditions. In these sheltered environments, the waves are generally less than 1 m in height and the fetch distance is generally less than 25 km under non-storm conditions. Compared to open ocean barrier islands, fetch-limited barriers are typically short (1 km), narrow (10-100 m), and low (1-3 m), which makes them very susceptible to reworking wave energy. Despite their small size, FLBIs meet the six criteria used by  to define a barrier island. They are (1) elongated bodies of unconsolidated sediment, 2bound by inlets, (3) backed by a lagoon, (4) fronted by a marine shoreface, (5) set on a barrier platform, and (6) protect a mainland coastline . The morphology and location of FLBIs are predominately controlled by local conditions including pre-existing topography, sediment supply, sea-level history, and shoreline orientation   . During marine transgressions, open ocean barrier islands are eroded away, but the low wave action in fetch-limited environments increases the probability that during rapid marine transgressions the islands will be overstepped, drowned in place, and buried . Fetch-limited barrier islands are found off of every continent except Antarctica but, like open ocean barrier islands, they are most common along trailing edge tectonic margins where conditions favor low energy bays and lagoons  ( Figure 2.4). Within the fetch-limited setting, the islands may occur immediately behind ocean inlets, on the edge of salt marshes or deltas, and behind and parallel to open ocean barriers . While there are more than 600 fetch-limited bodies of water, the islands generally form along unlithified coastlines and are most abundant along wide shelf coastlines with shallow slopes . They are most common near trailing edge margins where geologic conditions favor lagoons and bays. The presence and abundance of FLBIs depends on the size, shape, and fetch of an area as well as sediment availability, storm frequency, sea-level history, vegetation, antecedent morphology, and tidal range in these low energy environments . These sheltered environments are commonly characterized by waves driven by local winds, narrow shorefaces, limited sediment supply, and low wave run-up, limiting overwash processes. . Environments with a marsh platform, abundant sediment supplies, moderate to strong storm climate, and shallow water depths favor the development of fetch-limited islands . Tidal range of an environment is not a good indicator of the presence or absence of FLBIs. Unlike open ocean barrier islands, which generally form in micro-to mesotidal environments, FLBIs can form in any tidal range . FLBI differ from open ocean barrier islands in a variety of ways. Dune formation in these low energy environments is rare. Dunes may form on islands inside lagoons at the mouth of ocean barrier island inlets such as in Bogue Sound, North Carolina . Inlets and tidal deltas are important in the evolution of open ocean barrier islands, but are less important for the development of fetch-limited islands. In general their formation is not dependent on sediments discharged from rivers . Fetch-limited barrier islands form in the some of the same ways that open ocean islands form. They form through the alteration of antecedent topography, spit breaching, and onshore transport of sand. Some FLBIs formed when ancient open ocean barrier islands were stranded during a higher sea-level stand . Unlike open ocean barrier islands, FLBI evolution is more dependent on storms as wave energy is rarely enough to cause physical changes under normal conditions . Widening occurs primarily through storm overwash while longshore currents cause the islands to lengthen. Short waves in fetch-limited environments refract less than oceanic swells, which causes the longshore currents to be a proportionally greater influence compared to open ocean beaches . Low energy waves allow for the establishment of salt marshes, sea grasses, and mangroves seaward and landward of the islands, which can often have significant impacts on the islands. Vegetation may have a stronger effect on island orientation than fetch direction . Vegetation in front and behind the islands stabilizes them, protects them from storm energy, and encourages sediment accumulation . The wave energy impacting open ocean barrier islands is usually strong enough to prevent the growth of salt marshes or mangroves on the ocean side of the island. The wrack, the line of detritus on a beach left by tidal or wave energy, is a common foreshore feature of low energy beaches. High wave energy generally prevents the buildup of large amounts of wrack along open ocean islands. In fetch-limited waters, only storm generated waves are strong enough to modify the wrack. In some cases, such as in Spencer Gulf, Australia where the wrack spans 1 km and is 1.5 m thick in some places, the wrack may build up and protect the underlying sediment from erosion . Ebb tidal deltas associated with fetch-limited islands are small and flood tidal deltas are rarely present . In addition, unlike ocean barrier islands, the orientation of fetch-limited islands are highly variable because wind fetch may come from any direction, which may cause the ends of the island to be strongly curved. In contrast to the well-defined shorefaces of open-ocean barrier islands, shorefaces fronting FLBIs are more variable. The shoreface may be completely non-existent, as in the case of marsh fringe islands, or range from shallow and sandy to multiple nearshore bars, to subtidal sand flats . However, in both settings the shoreface acts as a source, a channel, and a sink of sediment.  describe three categories of fetch-limited islands. These landforms range from sand bodies morphologically indistinct from their open ocean counter parts to narrow strips of sand edging salt marshes or mangrove forests . Active islands are those that are actively influenced by modern sealevel conditions and are undergoing regular modification. Inactive islands are typically trapped by salt marshes large enough to protect them from all oceanographic process but the largest storms. These islands primarily evolve through subaerial processes. Anthropogenic islands are composed of dredge spoil piles and can be difficult to distinguish from naturally formed islands. Cooperet al. (2007; assume that any island completely surrounded by salt marsh is inactive but note that islands surrounded by mangroves are likely to be active as mangroves offer less protection.  further describe eight types of active fetch-limited barrier islands based primarily on their geologic/oceanographic setting and morphology as determined mainly from satellite imagery . First there is the classic fetch-limited barrier island, which accounts for about half of the fetch-limited islands described by . Except for their small size, they differ the least from the open ocean barrier islands . They may form individually or in chains and exist in a wide variety of environments with varying tidal ranges and sediment supplies. They can be found along Xefina Island (Mozambique), within Chesapeake Bay (United States), and Spencer Gulf (Australia; . Their variable morphology indicates that they form in a variety of ways . Vegetation, especially salt marsh, appears to play an important role in the life of these islands. The plants provide a stabilizing platform while reducing wave energy causing sediment deposition . The two-sided barrier island is the least common with only 125 worldwide. They are classic barrier island that experience fetch in two direction perpendicular to the shoreline causing beaches to form on both the seaward and landward sides of the island . They typically form alone or in very short chains of islands. One example of the two-sided FLBI exists along the Southern Tip of Tangier Island, Chesapeake Bay, United Sates . Backbarrier parallel fetch-limited barrier islands form parallel to open ocean barrier islands in the quiet tideless or microtidal waters landward of the larger island . They make up 8% of the worldwide FLBIs and typically form long chains of islands which average less than 1 km each . Field observations from the backbarrier parallel FLBIs in Laguna Madre, Mexico indicate that a good portion of the sediment comprising the small islands comes from overwash from the oceanic barrier island. Fetch-limited deltaic barrier islands are found along the rims of river deltas which empty into fetch-limited waters . They are most abundant along mountainous, active tectonic margins such as the Philippines and the Aegean coast (Turkey). The fluvial sediments are worked into barrier islands by storm generated waves and alongshore transport . Similar to the deltaic islands, are the fjord-head barrier islands, which only account for 1.3% of worldwide FLBIs. They form in short chains seaward of an active glacier  and about 50 m wide . Their nearness to sediment rich active tidal deltas mean that these FLBIs have extensive dune development uncommon in the other types of FLBIs. These can be found in Colombia, Mozambique, and Portugal . The marsh fringe FLBI forms as sediment collects on salt marsh margins within fetch-limited environments . They make up about 8.3% of worldwide active FLBIs. They are most often found in brackish water and only form in temperate and subtropical environments where salt marshes are common. Marsh fringe islands form in chains separated by small gaps and are some of the smallest fetch-limited islands: often only a few hundred meters long, 10 m wide, and rarely more than 1 m above sea-level. The islands tend to be thin veneers of sand which form upon eroded mud platforms instead of developing a true subaqueous shoreface . In contrast to the other FLBIs, marsh fringe islands show a variety of irregular shapes influenced by the marsh vegetation.Finally, the thermokarst FLBIs form as permafrost tundra erodes and pieces are stranded in fetch-limited environments. They account for 16% of all the fetch-limited islands and are generally the longest with an average length of 1.5 km . They exist only along the Arctic coasts of Russia and North America where they form in the fetch-limited waters behind chains of Arctic open ocean barrier islands."}, {"section_title": "Fetch-Limited Barrier Islands and the Delaware Bay", "text": "The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America, with their considerable bay, lagoon, and estuarine waters, have the greatest abundance of active islands with 19% of the total counted by . In the Delaware Bay, these small strips of sand curve around the salt marsh platforms and to protect the delicate salt marsh ecosystems from erosive wave energy. They also provide habitat for annual horseshoe crab mating in the Delaware Bay, which draws thousands of migrating shorebirds to the beaches.

Understanding these historical changes are critical for understanding how the bay, it's wetlands and barrier islands are changing and will change as sea level rise continues to accelerate. As sea-level rises, these low lying forests drown and convert to salt marsh; the decay resistant cedars remain standing, often for decades, in the marshes. The outer growth ring of each dead tree records the year of its death while the root mantle of the tree records its position relative to sea-level. Therefore, each drowned tree is a proxy for local-relative sea-level rise. By establishing a composite chronology using the living Eastern Red Cedars in the area, we cross dated the dead trees to establish their year of death ( Figure 3.3). Then using the elevation of the dead trees and their year of death we produce a local relative sea-level curve for the area  Van de Plassche, 2013).\n\nSea-level is rising at an average rate of 1.5 mm/yr at Jakes Landing, NJ, which is higher than the regional average for the Delaware Bay. Just as the rate of eustatic sealevel rise is accelerating, the rate of sea-level change at the study site has accelerated throughout the study period with a noticeable increase in the rate at about 1800 years BP. The acceleration of sea-level rise in this region threatens tidal wetlands and coastal forests. Understanding this rate of change will help public planners prepare for future habitat loss and coastal flooding.           1970, 1977, 1995, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015 to study changes in barrier islands from East Point Light House to Reeds Beach along the New Jersey coastline of the Delaware Bay ( Figure 5.1). Fetch limited barrier islands (FLBI) are defined by  as barrier islands that develop in sheltered waters, such as bays or lagoons, where they are protected from high-energy wave conditions. In these sheltered environments, the waves are generally less than 1 m in height and the fetch distance is generally less than 25 km under non-storm conditions. The barrier islands in the Delaware Bay are considered in the literature to be fetch-limited. However, much of the Bay has fetch distances greater than 25km. Thus, these beaches may be better classified as estuarine or low-energy beaches as the Bay experiences lower wave energy than open ocean systems. However, the barrier beaches in the bay do meet the other criteria for fetch limited islands as described by  fronted by a marine shoreface, (5) set on a barrier platform, and (6) protect a mainland coastline . The morphology and location of FLBIs is predominately controlled by local conditions including pre-existing topography, sediment supply, sea-level history, and shoreline orientation . with an average length of 1.1 km . However, in the 2009 paper they note an abundance of sand features edging features less than 50 m in length . The southernmost portions of both shorelines within the Delaware Bay are composed of barrier beaches attached to the mainland. The barrier islands of the Delaware Bay fall into two categories: classic and marsh fringing. The classic islands occur in the southern section where they are subjected to the greatest wave energy in the bay. The more northern islands are the marsh fringing islands where the vegetation causes the islands to take on a wide variety of shapes and temporary headlands composed of peat, or occasionally living marsh, are a common influence on the shape of the islands within the bay .  note that the size of the islands, sediment supply, and wave energy diminishes as one moves away from the mouth of the bay. Sea-level rise accelerates erosion and causes greater storm surges, which results in greater overwash.  suggests that these islands will migrate inland and not be drowned as sea-level rises. They argue that the islands will continually rollover during storms. I sought to study historical changes of the barrier islands of the Delaware to better understand how they will respond to rising sea-level.\nThe rates of shoreline change for the Delaware Bay are significantly higher than the shoreline change along the Atlantic coasts of New Jersey and Delaware. The 2010 USGS report on historical shoreline change along the New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts reports that average net long term shoreline trend was erosional with a rate of -0.9 mm/yr for northern New Jersey and -0.5 mm/yr for the northern Delmarva peninsula . Southern New Jersey has an average net progradation rate of 0.8 mm/yr for the long-term period (1883-2013). In contrast, the average net change over the last 30 years was 0.5\u00b1 0.06 m/yr for northern New Jersey, 0.2\u00b10.1 m/yr for southern New Jersey and -0.8 \u00b10.04 m/yr for coastal Delaware . These shorelines are relatively stable due to extensive human development. However, the percentage of southern New Jersey experiencing erosion increased from 15% for the long term data to 28% for the short term data. The areas in the USGS study that were eroding were coastal state parks with natural shorelines. Rates of shoreline change vary due to underlying geology, rate of sea level change, shoreline type, wave energy, sediment supply, human development, orientation, storms, etc. Underlying geology and sea level rise are fairly constant for this small region and most likely do not cause variations in shoreline change. I was able to control for shoreline type, orientation, and human development and find that all three cause variation in rates of shoreline change. Sediment supply and wave energy are also contributing to variations but data do not exist for either of these variables. More work is needed to assess how wave energy and sediment supply are affecting the shorelines in order to better understand the factors driving shoreline change for this region.    Carranza, 2001;Folk, 1957;Pizzuto, 1986). This information is critical for understanding sediment transport and its mechanisms, changes in beaches over time, identification of ancient beaches in the rock record, and potential effects of beach nourishment. As sealevel rises, baseline sedimentogical data is critical for understand how beaches will change and for determining human responses to these changes. I collected and characterized sediment samples from the natural fetch-limited barrier islands along the New Jersey Coast of the Delaware Bay. I examined grain size distribution both longshore and cross shore to determine how grain size varies with location. Longshore grain size data will give us insight into the trends of longshore currents in the region and improve our understanding of sediment transport mechanisms.\nThe fetch-limited barrier islands from East Point Lighthouse to Bidwell Creek along the New Jersey shoreline of the Delaware Bay are characterized by sediments ranging from pebbles to medium sand. There are not any strong longshore patterns along any one island, but the samples become coarser and more poorly sorted longshore from north to south within the study region. This may be due to a longshore current traveling from north to south. This generally chaotic mix of sediment characteristics is most likely due to the consistent reworking of the whole, narrow beach face by waves. More data, over years, is needed to look for trends in long term movements of sediment. In addition, more data on the presence or absence of plants and the shape of the foreshore may provide insight into the variations in cross shore sediment.       "}, {"section_title": "Study Site", "text": "The \nJakes Landing, in Dennis Township, New Jersey is part of the Dennis Creek Wildlife Management area (Figure 4.2). A road provides access to woods, salt marsh, and Dennis Creek. Birders and boaters regularly used the boat ramp at the site. The salt marsh is composed primarily of Spartina alterniflora with patches of Spartina patens at higher elevations and Phragmites sp. and bushes at the salt marsh/forest boundary. Drowned eastern red cedars remain standing in the marsh marking its progression inland with sealevel rise. According to stratigraphic studies, the site experienced repeated transgressions and regressions over the last 3,000 years with the largest transgression occurring about 1,800 years BP . This roughly corresponds with the transgression observed by    Engelhart et al., 2011b;Kemp et al., 2013;Kemp et al., 2012;Shennan and Horton, 2002; Van de Plassche, 2013). Sea-level index points can be used to estimate historical relative sea-level at specific points in space and time by dating macrofossils and microfossils with established elevations (Figure 4.3). Sea-level curves can be produced from dating of different sea-level index points when they are related to the same tide level. Relative sealevel for each index point is equal to altitude of the sample minus the midpoint of the indicative meaning expressed relative to the same water level (Engelhart et al., 2011b). The indicative meaning is the relationship between sea-level indicators and the elevational range in which it occurs relative to the tidal frame (Engelhart et al., (Table 4.2). The rate of relative sea-level change was reconstructed through an \"error in variable\" model using BChron, a program in the R programming language (Parnell, 2016;. BChron ran a calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration curves, models of age-depth relationships, and included the time uncertainty in its estimates relative to sea-level using polynomial regression models. First I used BChron to fit a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution to the age/depth data. Then, using the output from the first function, BChron fit an error in variable polynomial regression model to the data. The error in variable model accounted for the uncertainty in both the age and the depth (Parnell, 2016;. I ran 10,000 iterations of the Markov chain Monte Carlo with the first 2000 iterations discarded or burned and a size step of two for every iteration beyond the burn. The polynomial linear regression determined the average rate of sea-level rise and a polynomial cubic regression to examine the changes in the rate of sea-level over the study period. Appendix A shows the R dialogue used in this analysis.\nI collected samples from five beaches from East Point Lighthouse to Bidwell Creek (Figure 7.1). Two large beaches in this region were not sampled. Moore's Beach had recently been replenished; sand was added to the beach to maintain its width. Thompson's beach has extensive debris from former buildings. The beaches in the study area are fetch-limited barrier islands Lewis et al., 2005). They have all the characteristics of regular barrier islands but they exist in mainly in tide-dominated systems and they are generally much smaller than their open ocean counterparts. For the purposes of this study, the beaches are described in terms of north and south. However, the beaches are along a curved section of shoreline. Most of the islands in the study region are not named, so each island was given an identifier (Figure 7.2). The island I identify as TB is the northernmost island, followed southward by the island identified as XY. TB is about 360 m long and trends east-west. It is 25 m at its widest and 5m wide at its most narrow. XY is 1600 m long, is about 15 m wide along most of the island, and is also oriented east-west. Continuing southward, there is a gap after XY where only small stripes of sand exist along a shoreline mainly composed of wetland. The last three islands all follow a north-south orientation. The next island, identified as AB, is about 1400m long, varies in width from 4 m to 16 m wide. Z is a small patchy island, 250 m long, and generally no more than 10 m wide. The island I identify as RB is 1000 m long and ranges from 10 to 15 m wide. The southern portion of the study site is bounded by a jetty, which traps sediment for the developed beaches to the south of the study site."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Analysis", "text": "NOAA's National Climatic Data Center maintains a large dataset of tree ring series from tree species around the world. However, the dataset does not include eastern red cedars from southern New Jersey. Thus, I used the living trees in the area to create composite chronology for the area. I used a hand driven increment borer and extracted two cores per tree at 1.3 m above the base of the tree from opposite sides of the tree. Twenty healthy living trees were sampled, as a baseline. Samples were dried, mounted, sanded, and ring widths were measured (Phipps, 1985) (Figure 3.5). Crossdating was verified using COFECHA, a program used to determine the overall quality of chronologies (Holmes, 1983). Series intercorrelation measures the strength of the common signal in the chronology; a series with an intercorrelation value less than 0.4 cannot be reliably dated (Grissino-Mayer, 2001). The composite chronology was developed using ARSTAN, a program that produces chronologies from tree-ring measurements by detrending and standardizing the measured series (Cook, 1985;Cook and Holmes, 1999). As trees grow they experience a reduction in raw ring width due to the increasing circumference of the tree. In order to account for size trends in the series, the series was detrended once using a 30% spline. For this study, we assume that the trees standing in the marsh died due to saltwater toxicity, resulting from inunction, due to rising sea-levels. Dead trees were examined carefully before being chosen for study to avoid trees that have died due to other causes. J. virginiana is a moderately salt sensitive species meaning they can survive some salt water exposure (Miyamoto et al., 2004). Through field observations in New Jersey I found trees living right on the edge of salt marsh but no trees living below mean higher high water line. Only trees broadly classified as 'mangroves' are capable of living completely inundated with saltwater. There is currently no information as to exactly how much inundation the tree can handle before it dies or how long the tree takes to die. We estimated an error of 3 years and assume that this uncertainty is the same for each tree. Even though eastern red cedars are rot resistant, the dead trees are subject to damage due to weather, insects, and birds. Only trees whose outer layers had not been worn away and whose inner structure had not been compromised were sampled. Forty dead trees were sampled in the same way as the living trees (Figure 3.2). The sampling was weighted towards trees closer to the living forest. Dead trees further in the marsh tended to be more decayed and less suitable for study. Using COFECHA the dead trees measurements were crossdated against the live tree chronology to determine their year of death. I measured the elevation of each dead tree with a Real Time Kinematics GPS. Since their death, the salt marsh has built up around the base of each tree. I removed the salt marsh around the tree, and placed the unit at the base of the trunk in order to measure "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "I sampled 36 trees and measured the surface elevation and the original or base elevation of each tree (Table 1). From a dendrochronological perspective the dating was difficult; the samples had many false and missing rings. The series intercorrelation for the living trees was 0.42, which is low but not surprising considering the difficulty of crossdating eastern red cedars . Year of death ranged from 1959 to 2011 (Table 2). When I plotted the elevation of the root mantle vs year of death for each tree (Figure 3.6) and ran a linear regression, the R2 was 0.42 with a p-value of 1.34e-6. The slope of this linear indicates a rate of sea-level change of 8.9 mm/yr.  ). The extremely rapid rate of sea-level rise found using dendrochronology is most likely the result of this rapid rate of shallow subsidence at the site.\nUsing BChron, I modeled the age of the sample versus the depth of the sample with a 95% credible interval (Figure 4.5). Instead of a single carbon-14 date, each sample was plotted with its intcal13 calibration curve in order to account for potential age errors. I ran a polynomial linear regression to determine the rate of sea-level change over the whole time period and found a rate of 1.5\u00b10.5 mm/yr (Figure 4.6). The linear regression did not account for any fluctuations in the rate of sea-level change, which have been observed in the eustatic record as well as other local studies Nikitina et al., 2000;Varekamp and Thomas, 1992). The cubic regression accounted for the variations in the rate of sea-level over time (Figure 4.7). I determined the rate of sea-level change for the study area over 500 year intervals with 95% credible intervals; from 500 years BP to present I found a rate of sealevel change of 3.8 mm/yr (Table 4.3). The rate of sea-level rise has accelerated at about 0.9 mm/yr over the 3,000 years study period with this acceleration beginning around 1,800 years BP.\nBarrier islands were more extensive in 1977 than in 2015 ( Figure 5.3). The islands are numbered based on the 2015 imagery. The position of the islands changed significantly during the time period. In 1970 the barrier islands were connected with fewer inlets opening into the bay. By 2015, the islands are more broken up by inlets and the length of individual islands decreased for all islands except one. From 1970 to 2015, island 8 accumulated sand and extended northward. The total barrier island area for the region varied annually with a high in 1977 to a low in 2010. However, there is no significant difference in total area between 1970 and 2015 ( Figure 5.4). The linear regression analysis showed essentially no trend (R2=0.37, p = 0.08) from 1970 to 2015. There was an increase in barrier island area from 1970 to 1977 with the greatest barrier island area total in 1977. This high in 1977 was due to extensive development from 1970 to 1977, which served to temporarily trap more sediment in the region. When I only analyzed natural islands not influenced by human development there was a slight trend (R2 = 0.6, p = 0.01) showing a decrease in total island area indicating that human development affected total barrier island area for the region (Figure 5.5). Thus, human development served to slow island change in this area. The number of individual barrier islands increased from a low of 10 in 1977 to a high of 38 in 2015. The average barrier island size decreased significantly (R2=0.77, p = 0.0017) from 1970 to 2015 ( Figure 5.6). These breakups occurred in the non-human influenced areas and were generally caused by inlet formation. Where inlets cut into islands, the length of the island was truncated but in most locations the island wrapped around the edge of the shoreline and paralleled the inlet, thus preserving the total barrier island area for the region. There were also a few places where sand was simply lost as the islands migrated inland. Some of these places where sand was lost one year were refilled in subsequent years. The area was dynamic and sand was moving through the system. Even as the number of individual islands increased, the width of the patches increased helping to preserve the overall area. The islands were breaking up, but this breakup was only minimally affecting the total barrier island area. Regionally, the barrier island shorelines were migrating inland at an average of \u22122.5\u00b10.26 m/yr with a range of 1.18 m/yr gained to 14.96 m/yr lost ( Figure 5.7). Ninety three percent of the shorelines were eroding and 70% of the shorelines were eroding faster than 1m/yr (Table 5.1). The back edge was migrating inland at an average of -2.45\u00b10.26 m/yr with a range of -15.82 m/yr loss to 0.27 m/yr gained ( Figure 5.8). Ninety six percent of the back edges were eroding and 72% of the region was eroding faster than 1 m/yr. Regionally, there was no significant difference between the average rate of shoreline migration and the average rate of back edge shoreline migration supporting geomorphic response designation of landward rollover per McBride et al. (2015). The fastest rates of migration were on Island 7 (Table 5.1), which experienced extensive change due to inlet widening at its northern edge. Island 1, the most developed island, experienced essentially no shoreline migration and minimal back edge migration. Island 11 was the only island where there was a significant difference between the rate of shoreline movement (0.15\u00b10.26 m/yr) and back edge migration (-0.52\u00b10.26 m/yr). Linear regression analysis showed that 83% of the shoreline and 70% of the back edges are migrating at a linear rate with R2 values over 0.7. In general, the shorelines and the back edges of the islands were migrating inland at about the same rate; the barrier islands were moving inland at a steady rate and not narrowing. The areas not migrating at a linear rate were at the edge of inlets or were stabilized by human development. This linear rate of migration, and visual observations, suggests that these islands exist at the critical width necessary for land ward migration.\nThe grain size varies from medium sand to pebbles with most samples having an average grain size of coarse or very coarse sand (Figure 7.3). The high tide line has slightly finer samples with medium sand being the most common average size, while along the backshore coarse sand is the most common average grain size. When I compare the samples from the high tide line to the samples from the back edge using a Mann-Whitney test there is no significant difference between the high tide data and the backshore data (p = 0.35). The majority of samples are well sorted with the rest falling between very well sorted and poorly sorted (Figure 7.4). Only a few samples are classified as very poorly sorted. For the high tide samples, most of the samples are well sorted with moderately well sorted being the second most common. Along the backshore, most of the samples are either well sorted or poorly sorted. In general the high tide line samples are better sorted than the samples from the backshore. However, the two data sets are not significantly different according to the Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.54). Most of the data is strongly coarse skewed (Figure 7.5). The average skew for all the samples is -0.19, which corresponds to strongly coarse skew. Less than 10 samples are fine or strongly fine skewed. The same is true of the samples from the high tide line, but the majority of back edge samples are near symmetrical. However, overall the back edge data is also mostly coarsely skewed. According to the Mann-Whitney test the two data sets are significantly different at a 95% degree of confidence (p = 0.019). I also examined the overall sediment characteristics by island. The sediments on the two more northern islands (TB and XY) are generally finer than the three more southern islands (AB, Z, RB) ( Figure 7.6). There are two trends: the northernmost island(TB) has the finest sediment followed by XY; in the southern half of the study area, the island with coarsest material is AB, and the last two islands become progressively finer southward (but remain coarse on average). When I compared the mean grain size of the samples by island using a Mann-Whitney test I found that islands RB and TB are significantly different from all the other sites (p < 0.05) and that islands AB, Z, and RB are not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05) (Figure 7.6). There is less variation in grain size on islands TB and XY and the samples on those islands are better sorted than the more southern islands (AB, Z, RB). The majority of the samples on TB are well sorted while the other islands show a greater range of sorting values (Figure 7.7). In general, the islands become more poorly sorted from north to south. On average, all of the islands are negatively skewed (skewed towards coarser material) ( Figure 7.8). They all have some samples that are positively skewed and the two most southern islands (Z and RB) have the greatest distribution of samples. Except for island Z, on average, the islands become more negatively skewed southward. Throughout the study area there are no consistent differences between the high tide line samples and the back shore samples (Figure 7.9, 7.10, 7.11). Out of 73 transects, in 42 of the pairs the backshore sample is coarser and in 33 pairs the backshore sample is finer. The differences between the sorting and skew of high tide samples and backshore samples are also highly variable. For sorting values, 38 of the 73 (52%) backshore samples are better sorted than the high tide line samples and 35 (48%) are more poorly sorted. There are also no patterns in how the data varies between the backshore and the high tide line. The variations between the two locations appear to be randomly distributed. When I tested all the samples using the Mann-Whitney test, there was no significant difference between the backshore and the high tide line samples either as a whole data set or when the data is examined by island. When I plotted the mean grain size of the samples by location from north to south the both the high tide and the backshore samples become coarser (High tide: R2 = 0.2, p = 9.841e-6, Backshore: R2 = 0.11, p = 0.002) and more poorly sorted (High tide: R2 = 0.166, p = 0.0002, Backshore: R2 = 0.06, p =0.01). Skew exhibits no significant trend (High tide: R2 = -0.005, p = 0.3, Backshore: R2 = 0.04, p =0.03)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "However, there could also be errors in dating the trees, and/or the small sample size. The exact year of death is hard to calculate as outer rings of the tree may be lost due to decay and eastern red cedars are prone to false rings making them difficult to date. Thus, the year of death most likely does not correspond exactly to the year of inundation. These errors could contribute to an erroneously high rate of sea-level rise calculated in this study.      \nThe average rate of local relative sea-level rise for Jakes Landing New Jersey was 1.5\u00b10.5 mm/yr over the last 3,000 years. This is in agreement with the 1.49\u00b10.87 mm/yr calculated by . The quadratic rate of change was slightly higher at 1.6\u00b10.5 mm/yr but still fell within the error range. This is faster than the regional average for the Bay of 1.19\u00b10.26 mm/yr . The faster rate is due to the compaction of the heavy, thick muds laid down by Dennis Creek Varekamp and Thomas, 1992).  and   yr BP, but the acceleration is not as drastic as reported in other studies. Unlike the other studies, we did not collect whole cores to study ecological transitions in the marsh.\nThe barrier islands in the study area experienced dynamic changes. Regionally the barrier islands underwent both landward rollover and inland migration at a linear rate with no significant difference between the rate of shoreline and back edge migration. The only exceptions were the human developed islands, which remained relatively unchanged. However, as sea level continues to rise and the shoreline of these islands begins to erode despite human intervention, these islands will narrow rapidly if the back edge is not allowed move inland as well. The natural islands are so narrow to begin with that they exist within the critical width needed for landward migration. These islands were responding to sea-level rise by migrating landward; it appeared that they were at minimal risk of disappearing at the current rate of sea-level rise. There was landward rollover when I examined the region as a whole, as also observed by McBride et al. (1995). Examining only the natural barrier islands I observed breakup, but with only a minimal decrease in area. There was no general decrease in barrier island area from 1970 to 2010. After the low reached in 2010, barrier island area began to rebound, and the 2015 area was not significantly below the 1970 total area. Continued monitoring is needed before concluding that the total barrier island area is truly rebounding or if the most recent data are only showing annual variation. Even when I only examine natural islands, the data suggest that total barrier island area may be rebounding from the 2010 low. The area was also experiencing some break up; islands were becoming shorter and more numerous. There was also a slight widening of these broken up islands. This breakup was mostly due to inlet widening and formation. In the areas where breakup was not due to inlet formation, the sand often reappeared at that place in subsequent years or new small islands were formed where none were present. Despite this break up, the total barrier island area in the region remained relatively stable throughout the study period. However, examining just the natural islands revealed a general decrease in total barrier island area during the study period. It is concerning as these islands provide critical habitat for horseshoe crabs.         Hapke et al., 2007a;Hapke and Reid, 2007;Hapke et al., 2007b;Morton, 2008;Morton et al., 2005). However, inland bays, including the Delaware Bay, have not been studied. I analyzed historical shoreline changes along the New Jersey coast of the Delaware Bay from the tip of Cape May to Nantuxent Point ( Figure 6.1). This area is relatively unaffected by humans, and the shoreline in this region is composed of sandy barrier islands and salt marsh tidal wetlands. The barrier islands provide habitat for nesting horseshoe crabs and migrating shore birds while protecting the sensitive salt marshes. The tidal wetlands provide vital ecosystem services and are economically important to various fisheries. Their continued viability is threatened in the face of rising seas and coastal erosion. While this peril is well known qualitatively, it is necessary to understand these processes quantitatively in order to anticipate the effects of sea level rise on these fragile systems.\nSediment in the study site ranges from granule (2 -4 mm) to medium-sand (0.25 -0.5 mm) indicating that wave and storm energy are the dominate processes in the region, which is in agreement with previous work on fetch-limited barrier islands (Lewis et al., 2005). These authors (op. cit.) note that fetch-limited islands will be most affected by storms and overwash processes, and that aeolian processes will be negligible. These beaches have no dunes and I found no samples with a mean grain size finer than medium sand indicating that wind energy is not a significant modifier these beaches. I expected the sediments on the backshore to be finer and more sorted than the high tide line sediment because as sediment is transported it tends to become finer and more sorted, but instead found that there were no significant differences between the two data sets and there were no patterns in how the data was distributed. The lack of any consistent differences between sediment characteristics of the high tide line and the backshore samples may be due to the narrowness and low elevation of the beaches. There is not enough space on the beach for sediments to be effectively sorted. The backshore is only slightly higher in elevation then the high tide. Therefore, the reduction in wave energy is minimal between the two locations. In addition, the area has a large tidal range (about 2 m) and beaches are just barely above sea-level. During the high, high tides the waves rework the most of the beach meaning that the whole beach is subject to the same processes. Furthermore, the beaches are so narrow and low lying that even during minor storms it is likely that the waves easily overwash the whole island. These beaches are migrating inland and overwash deposits are visible all along the study region, which further supports the idea that the whole beach is consistently being reworked. This constant reworking of the entire islands does not allow for sediment stratification. Parts of these islands are fronted by degrading salt marsh and some sections of the marsh remain alive. Beach grasses and bushes are also very common along their length. Heavy wreck lines are present on most of the islands. It is possible that the plants and debris have an impact on the distribution of the sediments as they slow wave energy and trap sediment at their bases. Future studies should collect samples with an eye for the presence or absence of plants and debris. There are no discernable trends in grain size data along the individual beaches. Without these patterns I are unable to pinpoint any specific longshore currents. However, when I examine the area as a whole the sediment generally gets coarser, more negatively skewed, and more poorly sorted from TB in the north to RB in the south. The presence of sand build up on the southern edge of a jetty just south of the study site indicates a north flowing longshore current. The general fining and sorting of the sediments from south to north away from this jetty suggests that this longshore current continues along our study beaches."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "At the peak of the last glacial maximum (about 26,000 years ago), sea-levels were 120 m lower than present (Church et al., 2001). Since then, 50 million km2 of land based ice melted, raising eustatic sea-levels (Engelhart and Horton, 2012;Engelhart et al., 2011a;Engelhart et al., 2011b). During deglaciation, rates of eustatic sea-level rise averaged about 10 mm/yr with peaks around 50 mm/yr during meltwater pulses (Alley et al., 2005). About 7,000 years ago sea-level rise slowed significantly and sea-level changed by only a few meters until the recent increase during the 20th century . Total local relative sea-level change is equal to eustatic changes plus net isostatic effects, tectonic effects, and total local effects such as sediment accumulation or erosion and shallow subsidence (Engelhart et al., 2011b). Globally, sea-level rose at an average rate of 1.8 mm/yr during the 20th century. Glacial isostatic adjustments (GIA) occur on a 1000 years scale and continue today. At its peak, the glaciation extended south to New Brunswick, New Jersey, causing much of the US Atlantic Coast at the margin of the ice sheet to be uplifted in the peripheral bulge around the glacier. Glacial isostatic adjustments and local conditions vary along the Atlantic coastline making it critical to assess rates of sea-level change on a local scale. The New Jersey Coastline, within the Delaware Bay, is composed of low gradient estuarine shorelines underlain by compactable, fine grain, Pleistocene sediments . These shorelines are particularly sensitive to sea-level changes and are experiencing substantial coastal inundation as a result. The two NOAA tide gauges across the mouth of the Delaware Bay measure local relative sea-level rise at a rate of 3.2 mm/yr at Lewes, Delaware and 4.06 mm/yr at Cape May, New Jersey (NOAA, 2012) ( Figure   4.1). These tide gauges only represent recent changes in sea-level and with only two gauges, the vast majority of the bay is unrepresented. My aim was to determine the rate of local-relative sea-level change along a section of the New Jersey coastline within the Delaware Bay not represented by tide gauge records. Ascertaining this rate will provide scientists and resource managers with a valuable tool for predicting habitat loss in this area due to sea-level rise over the next century. Most sea-level studies in New Jersey focus on the Atlantic coastline, and those in the Delaware Bay tend to focus on the Delaware Coast (Belknap and Kraft, 1977;Engelhart and Horton, 2012;Engelhart et al., 2011a;Kemp et al., 2013;Nikitina et al., 2000). Only three studies have examined sea-level in the Delaware Bay along the New Jersey coast Varekamp and Thomas, 1992).  cored throughout the Dennis Creek area including one core near Jakes Landing and analyzed the stratigraphy of the area. Carbon-14 dating of these cores has since been used to create a sea-level curve for the site. Varekamp and Thomas (1992) cored near Dennis Creek (exact location was not provided) and used microfaunal, geochemical data, and carbon-14 dating to create a sea-level curve through time (Varekamp and Thomas, 1992). The 1992 study found a rate of 3.6 mm/yr over the last 700 years. Most recently Nikitina et. al. (2015) collected data from Sea Breeze, New Jersey and compiled data from other studies to create a sea-level curve for the New Jersey Coastline of the Delaware Bay. They corrected all of the data from previous studies for changes in paleo tidal range, which removed the significant difference between the rates in the lower bay and upper bay. The study estimated a regional rate of 1.25\u00b10.27 mm/yr for the entire bay for 2200 to 150 years ago. For just the New Jersey coastline, they determined that sea-level rose at 1.12\u00b10.22 mm/yr at Sea Breeze and at 1.49\u00b10.85 mm/yr at Jakes Landing from 2200 to 150 years ago . I sought to add to the database of sea curves for the New Jersey coastline along the Delaware Bay."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "I outlined each barrier island in the study area using aerial imagery of New Jersey in order to examine changes in area and shape during the study period. I considered any linear body of sand at least 10 m long, fronted by the bay, and backed by saltmarsh or tidal channel to be a barrier island. Sand features shorter than 10 m long were outlined in order to track overall sand movement. I defined the shoreline as the high water line and identified it as the wet/dry line visible on the aerial imagery . The back and sides of the islands were defined as the sand/marsh interface in most cases or sand/water line as in the case of island backed by tidal channels. Sand roads presented a complication as the sand is part of the system, but the roads themselves are often separated from the barrier island by a few meters. In cases where overwash covered the road, the road was outlined as part of the overwash and was considered to be part of the barrier island. Outlining was performed by a single person and was completed at a scale of 1:2000 using Esri ArcGIS and the New Jersey aerial imagery. Once outlined, I counted the number of individual barrier islands for each year and used Esri ArcGIS to calculate the area for each barrier island and the total area of all the sand bodies for each year. This allowed me to study how the region changed over time in terms of area of sand and break up of large barrier islands into smaller barrier islands.\nThe shoreline is generically defined as the physical interface between land and water (Dolan et al., 1980). Tides, waves, and longshore currents cause the shoreline to be dynamic, constantly changing making identification of a reliable shoreline position for shoreline change studies complicated. There are a variety of shoreline indicators that can be used as a proxy to represent the true shoreline including debris lines, wet-dry lines, plant edge, and base of cliff . In shoreline studies, the wet-dry line is commonly used as an indicator of the high water line (HWL) . I extracted the HWL based on the wet-dry line visible on the aerial imagery for the region from 1970, 1977(New Jersey, 2013. To obtain older shoreline positions I used historical T-sheets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Shoreline website from 1883, 1932, 1943, and 1946. It is important to assess the inherent errors with historical imagery and shoreline position. Uncertainty associated with aerial imagery and T-sheets due to issues with distortion and digitization has been extensively researched (Anders and Byrnes, 1991;Thieler and Danforth, 1994). For the aerial imagery I use the values from 2010 USGS shoreline change report of 1 m and 3 m for the digitizing uncertainty and aerial photo uncertainty, respectively . For t-sheets uncertainty is due to geo-referencing uncertainty (4 m), digitizing uncertainty (1 m), and the uncertainty from the survey itself (10 m). Determining the uncertainty of the high water line due to variations in water level is more complicated as water level varies due to tides, waves, storms, and seasons Douglas and Crowell, 2000;Pajak and Leatherman, 2002). Seasonal shoreline variation can be significant but can be accounted for using imagery collected during the same season. I account for the other variables by following Ruggiero and List (2009), who showed that the uncertainty associated with the proxy bias datum equation is equal to the uncertainty of the HWL shoreline position due to changing water levels. The proxy datum bias uncertainty equation simply requires the best estimate of wave slope, wave length, and wave height. However, reliable wave data is not available for the Delaware Bay. Without reliable wave data for the region, I estimated shoreline position uncertainties based on shoreline movement over a tidal cycle and interpretation error at map scale . Shoreline uncertainties vary from 2.6 m ), to 7.5 m , to \u226515 m . By using Esri ArcGIS to map our shorelines, I was able to zoom into a map scale of 1:8000 or better, so I chose a shoreline error of 7.5 m, per . The total uncertainty associated with the HWL shoreline is equal to the square root of the sum of squares of the individual uncertainty values . The final shoreline uncertainty for the aerial imagery is 8.13 meters and 13.16 m for the t-sheets. Table 6.1 summarizes the uncertainty variables for the t-sheets and aerial imagery. In order to calculate shoreline change rates, I used the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) by Theiler et al. (2009) and followed the methods from the USGS shoreline change report for the Mid Atlantic . Per , I used DSAS to draw orthogonal transects every 50 m along the study area and calculated shoreline change at each transect. The latest shoreline had to be present for calculations to be run along any one transect. In some areas, inlet widening has caused the shoreline to be lost completely. To account for this, I measured the total length of the shoreline that existed in 1883 and 1970 but had eroded by 2013, and report this length as complete shoreline loss. DSAS output provides net shoreline change, end point rate, and linear regression for each transect. The end point rate does not assume a linear change in the shoreline position and thus represents the net change with a constant uncertainty value for each transect. However, the linear regression assumes a linear trend, which is not always the case, so I analyzed both long-term and short-term rates of change to capture potential reversals in the shoreline change trends. Net shoreline movement is the total shoreline change from the oldest year to the most recent. Long term shoreline changes rates were calculated at each transect as a linear regression with a 95.5% confidence through all the shorelines. For the short term trends, the average shoreline change was calculated using the end point rate (EPR), which is calculated as the distance between only the oldest and most recent years and divided by the time between surveys. The EPR confidence interval is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the square of each surveys shoreline uncertainty dividing that by the time between surveys . Average long term trends of shoreline change were calculated for 1883 to 2013. In order to assess changes in trends, short term trends were calculated for 1883 to 1946, 1943 to 1970, and 1970 to 2013. I also examined regional trends within the study area by breaking the shoreline up into three sections ( Figure 6.2). Section one is from the tip of Island is exposed to extensive wave energy. Overall, the region is erosional with 90 percent of the shoreline eroding from 1883 to 2013. Only 10% of the shoreline is accreting, but the accretion rates never exceed 0.99 m/yr (Table 6.3). About half the shoreline is eroding faster than 1 m/yr and 33% of the shoreline is eroding faster than 2 m/y (Table 6.3). Section 1 is the most stable with only 1.2% of the shoreline eroding at or faster than 1 m/yr. Section 2 is eroding the most with 86% of the section eroding faster than 1m/yr and 61.9% of the shoreline eroding faster than 2 m/yr. Section 2 is oriented so it has the greatest fetch distance and the majority of the wetland shorelines occur in this section. In Section 3, 65% of the shoreline is eroding faster than 1 m/yr with 35% eroding faster than 2 m/yr. Section 3 experiences less fetch and has fewer wetland shorelines making it slightly more stable. In order to examine potential trends in shoreline change rates I analyzed three short term periods: 1883-1946, 1943-1970, and 1970 show the results for these three time periods by transect. For 1883-1946 the average rate of erosion is -0.72 \u00b1 0.28 m/yr. For 1943For -1970, the average rate of shoreline loss increases to -1.92\u00b10.47 m/yr. From 1970-2013 the average rate of shoreline change increased to -2.64 \u00b10.27 m/yr, which is significantly faster rate of erosion than both 1883-1946 and the 1943-1970 time periods. I see an increase in the rate of shoreline change from the late 1880s to the 2000s, which corresponds to the increase in the rate of sea level rise in the 20th century. From 2.4% of the shoreline is accreting faster than 1 m/yr with most of this accretion taking place in Section 3 and none in Section 1 (Table 6.3). This percent of accretion increases to 3.5% during the 1943-1970 time period when development increased in Section 1. By the 1970-2013 time period, only 0.7% of the shoreline was accreting faster than 1 m/yr with all of accretion taking place in the stabilized Section 1. The percent of shoreline eroding faster than 1 m/yr increases from 27.1% for 1883-1946, to 55.1% for 1943-1970, to 56.5% for 1970-2013. The difference in the percent eroding faster than 1 m/yr for 1943-1970 to the modern time period is minimal, but the percent of shoreline eroding faster than 2 m/yr increases from 32% to 43.5% for the same time periods. The percent of the shoreline eroding remains stable between these two time periods, but the rate of the erosion increases in the 1970-2013 period. century Nicholls et al., 1995;Ranasinghe et al., 2012). A similar study conducted by  used aerial photographs from 1940 and 1978 to determine rates of shoreline change for parts of the Cumberland County shoreline and found a rate of shoreline loss of 3.21 m/yr for his study period, which is higher than our 1943 to 2070 rate of -1.92 m/yr . However, Phillips (1986) only studied select portions of the shoreline that correspond to our Sections 2 and 3. When I analyze only Sections 2 and 3, I find a higher average rate of -2.73\u00b10.27 m/yr. The increase in erosion for the 1970-2013 period compared to our rate for the 1883-1946 rates for 1940-1978 is likely due to faster rates of sea level rise during the 20th century. With a rate of -6.12 m/yr the wetland shorelines are eroding rapidly indicating that they are particularly sensitive to rising sea levels. This difference between erosion rates for wetlands and sandy shorelines could be due to several reasons. First, sandy shorelines are more resistant to sea level change, and the wetlands may already be degraded, which would further hasten erosion. This could be also due to differences in wave energy due to the position of the wetland shorelines within the region. This rate of erosion threatens the continued viability of the bay's tidal wetlands. Even before extensive human development, Section 1 experienced the least amount of shoreline change of all the regions. Since then, the jetties and groins have slowed the increasing rates of erosion by trapping sediment and accretion is occurring in some areas. Section 1 has experienced minimal shoreline erosion, but as sea levels continue to rise more efforts will be needed to maintain that stability. More stabilization efforts may further exacerbate shoreline erosion in other areas as sediment is trapped and not able to move northward. These communities are positioned behind narrow beaches and are still at risk of inundation during storms. Section 2 eroded the most rapidly during each time period. Section 2 had the most wetland shorelines and was orientated such that it experienced a long fetch distance, which may mean it experienced more wave energy, thus increasing erosion. In Section 2, several rivers, including the Maurice River and Dennis Creek, empty into the Delaware Bay. Shoreline change is greatest around these inlets as they widen. Section 3 is eroding slightly faster than the regional average. It is mainly composed of sandy shorelines, with a few sections of wetlands and human development. Section 3 has a similar orientation to Section 1, but is located where the Bay begins to narrow, thus reducing the fetch distance and the wave energy. In Section 3, the greatest rate of shoreline change is around the tip of Egg Island, which juts out into the bay and experiences the greatest fetch distance in Section 2. The wetland shorelines are eroding rapidly at a rate of 6.12 m/yr. This raises concerns for the long-term stability of the wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide. The already degraded wetlands are being pummeled by increased wave energy as sea levels rise. The sandy shorelines are more slightly resistant to erosion and are slightly more stable with a rate of erosion of 4.1 m/yr. These sandy shorelines are important as they provide habitat and protect the wetlands behind them from wave energy. It is apparent from the imagery that these beaches are migrating inland and covering the wetlands they protect from storms and waves.\nSurface samples were collected through the grab method: without looking, the collector grabs a handful of surface sand at the high tide line of the backshore of the island. For the backshore, samples were collected at the sand/marsh edge. These islands do not have dunes, so the backshore is fairly uniform and flat. Samples were then dried, plant debris removed, and a 30 g subsample was measured using a CAMSIZER an optical particle analyzer that collects simultaneous measurements of particle size, shape, and density. The output allows for mean, median, skew, sorting, and kurtosis to be calculated for each sample per Folk (1974). The data is not normally distributed and a transformations of the data did not make it normal so I use the Mann-Whitney test to test for statistical differences in the data. I must be careful when using statistical tests to compare the samples between islands as the data sets vary in number of samples."}, {"section_title": "ArcGIS and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) by the United States", "text": "Geological Survey (USGS) allowed me to determine the rates of change for both the shoreline and the back edge of the barrier islands . The DSAS program drew shore perpendicular transect every 50m along the study area and calculated rates of shoreline change at each of transects. The DSAS program allowed for uncertainty values for each year to be incorporated into the analysis. Uncertainty was a result of errors in the aerial imagery due to inherent issues when taking the images and when digitizing the images. For the aerial imagery uncertainty I used values from 2010 USGS shoreline change report of 1 m and 3 m for the digitizing uncertainty and aerial photo uncertainty respectively . However, when determining rates of shoreline change, the greatest source of uncertainty, and the hardest to account for, was the shoreline position that varied due to tides, waves, and seasons . The literature cites uncertainties in shoreline position varying from 2.6 m ), to 7.5 m , to \u226515 m . Uncertainties reported by  and  are different because the researchers used aerial imagery at different map scales: 1:10000 and 1:20000 respectively.  calculate their uncertainty by examining orthophoto pixels. By using ArcGIS to map our shorelines, I was able to zoom into a map scale of 1:8000 or better, so I chose to use a shoreline error of 7.5m per . The total uncertainty associated with HWL shoreline is equal to the square root of the sum of squares of the individual uncertainty values . The final shoreline uncertainty for the aerial imagery was 8.13 m. DSAS output provided net shoreline change, end point rate, and linear regression for each transect. The end point rate did not assume a linear change in the shoreline position and thus represented the net change with a constant uncertainty value for each transect. However, the linear regression assumed a linear trend, which was not always the case, so I analyzed both long term and short term rates of change to capture potential reversals in the shoreline change trends. Net shoreline movement is the total shoreline change from the oldest year to the most recent. Long term shoreline changes rates were calculated at each transect as a linear regression with a 95.5% confidence through all the shorelines. For the short term trends, the average shoreline change was calculated using the end point rate (EPR), which was calculated as the distance between only the oldest and most recent years and divided by the time between surveys. The EPR confidence interval was calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each survey's shoreline uncertainty dividing that by the time between surveys . In some areas, inlet widening caused the shoreline to be lost completely. To account for this, I measured the total length of the barrier islands that existed in 1970 but had eroded by 2015 and report this as loss of barrier island length. In addition to determining the regional rates of barrier island movement, I assessed the islands on individual levels. Islands were identified as natural or human influenced. Human influenced islands were those with houses or jetties/groins stabilizing the shoreline and inlets. These stabilized beaches did not respond to sea-level change in the same way and were analyzed separately from the natural beaches. I also broke the barrier islands into groups within the study area in order to determine if there were differences in how the barrier islands changed by location ( Figure 5.2). These groups were based on the 1970 barrier islands. Each section of the study area was affected by different fetch distances, wave energy, longshore currents, sediment supply, and numbers of tidal inlets, which can cause variation in barrier island response to sea-level change. I classified the geomorphic response of each island based on work by McBride et al. (1995). McBride et al. identified eight geomorphic barrier island shoreline responses to human and natural influences (McBride et al., 1995). These eight responses are grouped into two categories: simple and complex. Simple involves changes along only one side of the island, either the seaside or the backside. The first three types of responses are simple. The first type is lateral movement when the dominant sediment transport is shore-parallel causing downdrift accumulation and updrift erosion. In the second type, the barrier island advances when the island progrades due to relative sea-level fall or excess sediment supply which allows the island to build seaward. The final simple type is dynamic equilibrium, which occurs when a shoreline shows long-term stability. A barrier island is considered in equilibrium if the long-term average rate of change is less than or equal to the maximum potential error. The five remaining geomorphic responses are considered complex because the entire feature moves (McBride et al., 1995). In place narrowing, the barrier width decreases due to both seaside and bayside erosion but the core of the island remains in place. If an island is experiencing in-place narrowing, it then generally also experiences landward rollover or breakup. Landward rollover occurs when wash-over processes (generally due to storms) cause both sides of the islands to migrate inland. Landward rollover usually does not begin until a barrier narrows to a critical width, which allows the over wash deposits to both move and maintain the island. Instead of rolling over, a narrowed island may break up as inlets form and widen (McBride et al., 1995). The eighth and final type of response is rotational instability; an island rotates around a midpoint as one end of the island advances and the other end retreats."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The New Jersey Coastline within the Delaware Bay is composed of low gradient estuarine shorelines underlain by compactable, fine grain, Pleistocene sediments   (Donnelly and Bertness, 2001;Kearney et al., 2002;Kraft et al., 1992).
