[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to Dean and Dalrymple (2002), the NOAAlNational Weather Service uses the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model (Jelesnianski et al. 1992) operationally to predict storm surges. The numerical SLOSH model runs on a grid system. Convective accelerations are neglected, but some nonlinearities are included (particularly in shallow water). Comparisons with historical storms show that the model is accurate to within \u00b1 20% of observed values. On the other hand, according to the USACE (1977), Jelesnianski (1972) combined empirical data with his theoretical calculations to produce a set of nomographs that permit the rapid estimation of peak surge for any geographical location when a few storm parameters are known. In September 1998, Hurricane Georges made eight landfalls in its 17 -day journey, from islands in the northeastern and northern Caribbean Sea to the Florida Keys and finally to Biloxi, Mississippi (Pasch et al. 2001). Hurricane Georges were measured at locations along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida (Fig. 2). A NOAAlNWSlNational Data Buoy Center buoy (42040; see Fig. la) was located near Georges' track and recorded wave characteristics necessary for the wind-wave interaction study related to this storm. The purpose of this investigation is to estimate the peak open-ocean surge using Jelesnianski's nomograph and to further substantiate this nomograph by recent wind-wave interaction formulations."}, {"section_title": "Appl ication of Jelesnianski's Nomograph", "text": "According to Jelesnianski (1972), the corrected peak surge on the coast, Sp, can be estimated by (1) where Sr is the peak open ocean surge (i.e., before shoaling), Fs is a shoaling factor, and FM is a correction factor for storm motion. N omographs for Sr, Fs, and FM are available (e.g., USACE 1977;see Figs. Al -A4 in Appendix). Around 1130 UTC 28 September 1998, Georges made its final landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, with maximum sustained surface winds of 46 m S\u20221 (90 kt), and a minimum central pressure (Po) of960 hPa measured by an Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) \"Hurricane Hunter\" reconnaissance aircraft at 0503 UTC (Pasch et al. 2001). The radius of maximum wind (R) was approximately 50 km (30 miles; Hsu et al. 2000). Since Po = 960 hPa, LlP = (1010 hPa -Po) = 50 hPa. Using LlP = 50 hPa and R = 30 miles, one finds Sr = 11.2 ft from Jelesnianski's nomograph (see Fig. AI). Furthermore, Fs is approximately 1.1 (see Fig. A2). The speed of the storm was about 3.6 m S\u20221 (7 kt or 8 mph). If one approximates its track to be nearly perpendicular to the shore, FM = 0.8 (from Fig. A4). Therefore, from Eq. (1) Sp = 9.9 ft. From Fig. 2, the surge is about 2.9 m (9.6 ft) at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Hence, we can say that Eq. (1) is a useful analytical formula."}, {"section_title": "Application of Wind-Wave Interaction Formulas", "text": "In order to further substantiate Eq. (1) physically, formulas related to wind-wave interaction are employed. It is clear that 80% of the total surge was contributed by the x-component setup during this hurricane. The x-component setup along the hurricane track before shoaling has been parameterized by Hsu (1999): where pa and pw are the air and water densities, respectively. K (= 0.0016) is the wind-wave interaction coefficient, u\" is the friction velocity, UlO is the wind speed at a height of 10 m, Hs is the significant wave height, and Ds is the shoaling depth. Note that the parameters (u*llho) and (DJHs) are normalized friction velocity and shoaling depth, respectively. It follows from Eq. (3) that from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis, Sx has the same units as Hs (meters or feet). In order to estimate Sx from H s , we must further parameterize (UJUlO) and (DsfHs). This parameterization is accomplished as follows. In the atmospheric surface boundary layer under hurricane conditions, the stability is near neutral (see Simpson and Riehl 1981, p. 201)  where Uz is the wind speed at height Z, K (0.4) is the von Karman constant, and Zo is the roughness length. . According to Taylor and Yelland 2001 (5) where Lp is the deepwater dominant wave length, g is the gravitational acceleration, and T p is the dominant wave period at the spectral peak. From Eq. 4   :"}, {"section_title": "\" I I I", "text": "2.1m--': ::  and from Eqs. (5) and 6[ 20H1\" Simultaneous measurements of Hs and Tp during Hurricane Georges in 1998 are provided in Table 1. The mean and standard deviation during this 30-h period for U\"lUlO are 0.054 \u00b1 0.0057. Therefore, the coefficient of variation (ratio of s.d. / mean) is 10.6%. Note that this mean value is not significantly different from that of 0.0504 for UlO > 20 m S-l as suggested by Amorocho and DeVries (1980), since the difference between the two means is less than 7%. According to Taylor and Yelland (2001), a large increase in the sea surface roughness is predicted for shoaling waves if the depth is less than about 0.2 Lp (where Lp is the peak wavelength for the combined sea and swell spectrum). If one approximates that According to USACE (1984, p. 3-85, Eq. 3-64), Eq. (12) is verified in x max According to Dean and Dalrymple (2002;p. 84), the total storm surge is the sum of four components: the barometric tide, the wind-stress tide, the Coriolis tide, and the wave setup. Since both Coriolis tide and wave setup have greatest effect in the nearshore region, we postulate from Eq. (2) that, before shoaling, Also, from Dean and Dalrymple (2002; p. 81) 8l!.p = 0.0104AP 16Since ilP = 50 mb, S~p = 0.5 m. Sx = 3.1, hence the maximum Sr is 3.6 m (11.8 ft) from Eq. (15). The difference between this value and that of 3.4 m (11.2 ft; see Section 2) is about 5%, therefore we can say that Jelesnianski's nomograph is further substantiated by the physics of wind-wave interaction."}, {"section_title": "Further Simplification of Equation 14a", "text": "Because measurements ofHs are often not as available as those of ilP, we need to use the pressure difference in Eq. (14a). This is done as follows: According to Hsu (1991Hsu ( , 1994 and Hsu et al. (2000), Equation 17b  Using ilP = 50 hPa as before,Eq. (19)  According to Jelesnianski (1972), the nomograph for Sr was constructed for a hurricane moving perpendicular to the coastline at a speed of -6.7 m S-1 (15 mph). Under these conditions the highest surge elevations occur with large values of ilP for R = -48 km (30 statute miles). This curve may be digitized so that Sr varies approximately linearly with ilP as where Sr is in meters and ilP in hPa. It is interesting to note that this R value (48 km) is also the composite mean (with a standard deviation of only 3 km) between categories 2 and 4 based on 59 hurricanes affecting the U.S. coastline from 1893 through 1979 (Hsu and Yan 1998). The composite mean R is 47 km for all hurricanes as compiled with central presssures between 909 and 993 hPa. Since Eq. (21) and Eq. (19) are nearly the same, and since 90% of the hurricanes studied were within categories 2 and 4, Eq. (20a) is an excellent approximation for operational use. Furthermore, some information about the general movement or speed of a typical hurricane may be useful. According to Simpson and Riehl (1981, Table 36), there were 48 hurricanes between 1893 and 1979 with major open-coast storm surges affecting the U.S. for which definitive speeds were obtained. The mean speed is 5.5 m s-t, with a standard deviation of 1. 7 m S-1. The coefficient of variation is approximately 0.3; consequently about 70% of the hurricanes moved at a speed of 5.5 m S-1 (12 mph). Since this mean speed is not very much different from that of 15 mph as used in construction of the Sr nomograph, this further reinforces our recommendation that Eq. (20a) and Eq. (20b) are useful operationally. This rapid estimation method may be applied as a supplement to the numerical simulation such as SLOSH model as mentioned in Section 1."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Several conclusions can be drawn from this study: a. The measured peak. storm surge along the northeast Gulf coast induced by Hurricane Georges in 1998 was approximately 3 m (10 ft), and was located within the radius of maximum wind as expected; b. Estimation of the peak onshore surge is also about 3 m (10 ft) based on Jelesnianski's nomographs; c. Jelesnianski's open ocean surge nomograph is further substantiated physically by recent advances in wind-wave-surge interaction studies; d. For operational use, an analytical formula Eq. (20a) is provided. It is recommended that this equation be subjected to further verification and improvement using more pertinent tropical cyclone datasets.  "}]
