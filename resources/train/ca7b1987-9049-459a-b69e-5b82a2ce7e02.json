[{"section_title": "", "text": "Many students with prior labor market experience enroll in public 2-year institutions to acquire new skills or certifications in order to advance in their careers or transition to new careers (Jacobson, Lalonde, and Sullivan 2005;Jenkins et al. 2010;Leigh and Gill 1997). These students often continue to work, in many cases full time, while enrolled. In 2011-12, about one-third (32 percent) of public 2-year students worked full time while enrolled, compared with 18 percent of public 4-year students (Radford, Cominole, and Skomsvold 2015). Additionally, when given the opportunity to identify themselves as an \"employee enrolled in school\" or a \"student working to meet expenses,\" 28 percent of public 2-year students in 2011-12 considered themselves an \"employee enrolled in school,\" compared with 12 percent of students at public 4-year institutions (Skomsvold 2014 Skomsvold (2014) and Radford, Cominole, and Skomsvold (2015) use data from the 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), which surveyed a nationally representative sample of postsecondary students in 2011-12. In addition to differences in their employment experiences, public 2-year students' academic lives also differ from those of their peers in public 4-year institutions. In particular, proportionally fewer public 2-year students than public 4-year students enroll full time. In 2011-12, some 20 percent of all undergraduates at public 2-year institutions were enrolled full time, compared with 53 percent of all undergraduates at public 4-year institutions (Skomsvold 2014). More students enrolled at public 2-year institutions work full time and more are enrolled part time. As this report focuses on the experiences of beginning public 2-year students, it is worth noting that both working full time while enrolled and not enrolling full time are negatively associated with postsecondary completion rates, although there is less evidence that working part time has negative effects on postsecondary completion (Darolia 2014;Skomsvold, Radford, and Berkner 2011). 3 3 Some of these findings describe all postsecondary students, not beginning public 2-year students specifically. For example, about one-half (49 percent) of 2003-04 beginning postsecondary students who worked full time during their first year in college had not earned a credential and were not enrolled in 2009. In contrast, among their peers who did not work during their first year in college, 29 percent had not earned a credential and were not enrolled 6 years later (Skomsvold, Radford, and Berkner 2011). To examine the relationships between beginning public 2-year students' academic progress and labor market participation, this report uses data from the 2012/14 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:12/14). The report explores the demographics, enrollment intensity, and 3-year attainment and persistence of students who started in public 2-year institutions in 2011-12 in relation to their employment before, during, and after their postsecondary enrollment. 4 This definition includes some students enrolled in 4-year institutions that primarily granted certificates and associate's degrees. All comparisons of estimates were tested for statistical significance using the Student's t statistic, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. 6 "}, {"section_title": "STUDY QUESTIONS 1", "text": "Were there differences in demographic characteristics between beginning public 2-year students and other beginning college students in 2011-12?
