Accurate manual tracing of deep brain structures, such as the thalamus and hippocampus, demands a high level of tracer expertise and preferably standardized segmentation proto-cols. Introducing automatic or semi-automatic techniques into post-processing pipelines accelerates data analysis and offers reproducible and consistent decisions across datasets in large studies, which is crucial for obtaining reliable results [1] .\nSeveral software solutions for automatic segmentation are publicly available. Frequently used softwares in clinical research include \"Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain\" (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) (http://fsl. fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk).\nThe segmentation techniques applied in FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM are model-based methods. In highly variable data, such as MRI of the brain, it may be difficult for the segmentation tools to model the ROIs with sufficient accuracy, even when the techniques are trained on representative datasets. To address this, multi-atlas label fusion has been suggested and has demonstrated excellent segmentation abilities [2] [3] [4] . Label fusion relies on a representative image library with corresponding validated structure segmentations (atlases). Recently, multi-atlas segmentation techniques, such as patchbased segmentation, have become popular [5, 6] . Patch-based methods have the advantage of requiring a smaller training library compared to regular label fusion and is therefore relatively easy to implement in a local setting [5, 7] . Even though these improvements in segmentation algorithms have demonstrated highly accurate morphometric results, 1 most of the novel approaches are still not publicly available and therefore less used in clinical research. Moreover, the impact of segmentation accuracy on quantification of parameters from other imaging modalities, such as diffusion and perfusion MRI, is not well studied.\nQuantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to investigate microstructural changes in tissue. In diseases that cause subtle microstructural changes, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), there is a need for sensitive biomarkers in clinically relevant areas of the brain. Thalamus and hippocampus are two deep brain structures, where previous DTI studies have shown microstructural changes linked to cognitive impairment [8, 9] , stress [10] and headache [11] . Segmentation directly on the DTI maps is prone to inconsistency and bias, as DTI provides limited anatomical information. Unbiased and automatic studies rely on accurate T1-weighted (T1w) segmentation and co-registration for obtaining quantitative measurements within relevant brain regions. Thus, it is highly relevant to investigate the impact of automatic segmentation accuracy on these quantitative measures.\nPatch-based segmentation methods [5] perform well on conventional T1w images, such as Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) [12] . To the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of different automated segmentation methods has not yet been compared using T1w images from the recently proposed MP2RAGE sequence, which significantly reduces the intensity bias and provides superior grey matter (GM) to white matter (WM) contrast [13] .\nIn this study, we compared the performance of a multiatlas, patch-based segmentation method, as implemented in the online software platform volBrain (with two different training libraries), to three widely applied methods implemented in FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM. We used manual segmentation as the gold standard and measured the segmentation accuracy of thalamus and hippocampus when imaged with MP2RAGE. Additionally, we applied the segmented masks of thalamus and hippocampus on co-registered fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps for the purpose of evaluating the effect on the quantification of these diffusivity metrics."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Twenty-two healthy subjects were included in the study (age range 19-40 years, 12 females).

As reported by Fujimoto et al. [14] , the amplified background noise in MP2RAGE images may introduce errors in FreeSurfer segmentations. To deal with this, we used a slightly different approach than Fujimoto and colleagues. We classified the intensities of the proton density-weighted image acquired during the second inversion recovery into four classes using a Fuzzy C-means algorithm [15] . This robustly separates the background (1 class) from foreground (3 classes). To regain a \"natural\" background noise, we added the background noise of the second inversion recovery to the combined (flat) image. The modified image was used as input to all segmentation pipelines, and no errors were detected. Despite inherent intensity normalization of the MP2RAGE images, all segmentation tools were run with intensity nonuniformity correction, as this was the default setting.\nDiffusion data were eddy current and motion corrected using FSL, and EPI distortion correction was performed with ExploreDTI toolbox [16] .

The thalami were first manually traced by EN in the axial plane using anatomical landmarks. Next an initial training phase of TA using the protocol outlined by Power et al. [18] and supervised by EN was established. TA then adjusted the thalami in all three principal planes according to the protocol. Bilateral thalamus segmentation took 35-40 min per subject. The hippocampi were manually traced according to the EADC-ADNI segmentation protocol [19] by TA, initially supervised by EN. Segmentation of both hippocampi took 25-35 min per subject. As done in the EADC-ADNI protocol [19] , all manual segmentations were performed in MNI space, where similar appearance of the nuclei is expected to improve tracing consistency and speed when using the segmentation protocols. The final segmentations were transformed back to scanner native space for comparison.

For an overview, see Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we evaluated the performance of a recent patchbased segmentation method [5] as implemented in volBrain [20] and three widely used conventional methods as implemented in FSL [21] , FreeSurfer [22] and SPM [23] . Using MP2RAGE images, we tested the algorithms on two often investigated deep brain structures: the thalamus and the hippocampus. We found that the patch-based segmentation had the best overall accuracy. FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM all oversegmented the thalamus including non-thalamic tissue near the border of the IC and under-segmented in regions of the medial and lateral geniculate of the thalamus. In the segmentation of hippocampus, volBrain performed best followed by FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM. Moreover, we demonstrated that volBrain, based on a local library, was the only method, in which the diffusivity metrics of the thalamus did not differ significantly from the metrics obtained based on manual segmentation ( Table 1) . Analysis of hippocampus revealed that volBrain and SPM (although reporting low DSI) were not significantly different (Bonferroni corrected) from the manual method in terms of FA, and for MD only, volBrain local was not significantly different. This demonstrates that segmentation accuracy impacts the obtained diffusivity results, and less accurate methods, such as FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM, do not produce consistent diffusivity results. The accuracy of the patch-based segmentation method in our study is comparable to previous results on hippocampus segmentations using MPRAGE images [5, 6] . A study by Patenaude et al. [21] , using conventional T1w images and a leave-one-out comparison on its own library, found higher DSIs using FSL than found here. Patenaude and colleagues reported a mean DSI of 0.887 and 0.840 for the thalamus and hippocampus, respectively. This difference may reflect the importance of using coherent labelling protocols and similar imaging parameters within the template library. Patenaude et al. did, however, not reach the accuracy of the volBrain local segmentation in our study with DSI of 0.913 and 0.892, respectively. To compare the performance of the volBrain method with a training library different from MP2RAGE, we applied volBrain with an external training library consisting of MPRAGE and SPGR images. We found that volBrain still performed better than FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM (Fig. 3) . The results of the intra-reliability test on hippocampus further emphasize the advantage of automatic segmentation. We found a mean DSI of 0.915, which is consistent with the previous findings by Frisoni et al. [24] of DSI = 0.89. This result is at an accuracy level of volBrain local. However, in contrast to manual segmentations, automatic methods are deterministic and yield consistent errors. Thus, automatic segmentation methods are more robust in a longitudinal setting.\nFSL, FreeSurfer and SPM over-segmented the structures with FPRs in the range of 15-42 %. This resulted in con- sistent inclusion of white matter in the segmented regions of thalamus and hippocampus (both grey matter structures) as qualitatively verified using FA maps (see Fig. 5a, b) . Regarding the volBrain method, no systematic over-or underestimation for thalamus was observed with neither local nor external libraries (FPR out-balanced FNR). Patches can capture texture similarities [5] , and this is perhaps why the patch-based method attains consistently high accuracy on both thalamus and hippocampus. volBrain local was unbiased for hippocampus, while volBrain external slightly over-segmented hippocampus (FPR M = 26 %). This was unexpected, because the two libraries were constructed using hippocampus masks segmented based on the same protocol (the EADC protocol), while the protocols differed for the thalamus libraries. For hippocampus, this may be explained by different interpretations (different operators) of the EADC-ADNI protocol in the segmentation procedure of the hippocampus or by differences in contrast to the T1w images in the training libraries (MP2RAGE versus MPRAGE/SPGR). The Hausdorff distance showed a stepwise increase between the manual and automatic methods, with mean values in the range 2-6 mm, the lowest being volBrain local followed by volBrain external, FSL, SPM and FreeSurfer (see Fig. 4 ). When considering the obtained FPR and FNR, the Hausdorff distance most likely reflects a maximum over-segmentation. However, evaluating the examples in Fig. 5a , b where the geniculate bodies of the thalamus are excluded (except for volBrain local), the distance may be due to under-segmentation in this specific region.\nThe intra-operator reliability test of manual hippocampus segmentation showed a consistent segmentation and no significant difference between volumes segmented with a time interval of 10 months. Our intra-operator DSI (M = 0.913, SD = 0.010) is in line with previous reports of manual hippocampus segmentation reliability (M = 0.89, SD = 0.01) [24] . The DSI of repeated tracings reveal that manual segmentation of hippocampus has the same level of accuracy as between manual segmentation and the volBrain local method. The volBrain local method though has the advantage of being more consistent, faster and less costly when the library has been established [25] .\nThe obtained segmentation accuracies are partly reflected in the analysis of the diffusivity metrics. The volBrain local method was the only method not yielding significantly different FA and MD results in the thalamus compared to the results obtained by manual segmentation with a mean difference of \u22121 and \u22120.1 % in FA and MD, respectively. The other methods yielded mean differences between 1 and 9 % and were all significantly different in FA and MD compared to the values obtained with manual segmentation. This can be explained by the over-segmentation expanding into IC and the ventricular cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (Fig. 5a, b) . In hippocampus, the manual method was significantly different in FA compared to all methods ( p < 0.03). When correcting for multiple comparisons, FA values in both volBrain local and SPM and MD in volBrain local was not signif-icantly different from manual measurements. The finding of SPM not being significantly different from the manual method, despite the inaccuracy of the SPM segmentation, can be explained by the segmentation expanding into both WM and CSF, which on average blur the FA differences as WM and CSF, respectively, represent higher and lower FA values. Higher FA values of volBrain external, FSL and FreeSurfer in the hippocampus can be explained by oversegmentation into areas at the transition to the thalamus and fornix. The difference between volBrain local and the other methods in the hippocampus segmentation is furthermore confirmed by the post hoc analysis (Table 2) , which shows that both volBrain external, FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM all significantly differ in FA from volBrain local estimates, but not from each other, if corrected for multiple comparisons. This is visualized in Fig. 7 by the offsets between volBrain local and volBrain external, FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM. The FA and MD results of the intra-operator reliability test in hippocampus showed a significant difference between the two segmentations. This difference is similar to that of the best automatic segmentation (volBrain local). In both cases, the difference seems to be systematic (Fig. 7) . However, this bias will be removed if using automatic methods in a longitudinal setting, as automatic methods are consistent and not prone to changing interpretations of the segmentation protocol. Finally, it should be noted that Bonferroni correction removed the significant differences between the manual segmentations.\nAlthough the mean difference of FA and MD varies, all segmentation methods yielded consistent inter-subject differences compared to the manual approach (Figs. 6, 7) . This was most pronounced for MD results. Group comparisons may therefore relatively yield similar results, using the same method within the same study. However, in diseases and disorders with subtle structural changes where the influence of segmentation errors could blur the findings and result in reduced sensitivity, it is crucial to use the most accurate method to detect pathological changes. A study by Barbagallo et al. [26] found a significant difference in MD in the thalamus between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and controls (0.06 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , p = 0.019) using FSL FIRST, but the FA difference of 0.01 was not significant ( p > 0.025). We speculate that such a result might have been significant if a more accurate segmentation method had been used. We found that volBrain local obtained the most accurate measurements compared to the manual segmentation (FA mean difference = \u22120.001), and all the other methods obtained a mean difference of FA higher than the 0.01 level obtained between groups in the study by Barbegello and colleagues. Although it is not directly comparable, the impact of using different methods (more or less accurate) in clinical studies should be investigated further.\nThe variation of our diffusivity measurements was considerably smaller compared to those reported in the study by Barbagello et al. The volBrain local method obtained SDs of FA values in the thalamus and hippocampus of, respectively, 0.008 and 0.007 and SDs of MD values of, respectively, 0.014 (\u00d710 \u22123 ) and 0.017 (\u00d710 \u22123 ). In the Barbagello study, the corresponding SDs were 0.02 and 0.01 for FA and 0.05 (\u00d710 \u22123 ) and 0.07 (\u00d710 \u22123 ) for MD. This could be due to the reliability of the MP2RAGE images, as pointed out in a recent study [27] . The MP2RAGE sequence is less influenced by B1 as well as M0 and T2*, improving the image contrast and sharpness, which makes it easier to discriminate between grey-and white matter structures [13] . Another reason for the higher FA and MD variation in the Barbagello study could be due to the ALS pathology.\nIn the present study, we executed the FSL pipeline with the empirical optimized default settings. Experimentation on optimizing the FSL modes and boundary correction adapted to the MP2RAGE images may improve the final segmentation of FSL. The influence of adapting the FSL segmentation tool, FIRST, to MP2RAGE remains to be investigated. However, Patenaude et al. [21] used an adapted and optimized setting to their T1w images (no specification of the T1 sequence) and did still not reach the DSI levels of the patchbased method in volBrain local. Furthermore, it was not possible to use the same template library in volBrain and FSL, which would have been optimal for comparing the methods. Thus volBrain local has an advantage because it uses consistent training and testing data. This is similar to the Patenaude study [21] , which showed good performance when using customized local settings. Patch-based methods have the advantage of requiring a relatively small library, which makes it feasible to implement and optimize locally.\nState-of-the-art segmentation methods, like patch-based methods [5] , together with high image quality, as in MP2RAGE data, may lead to higher sensitivity in future studies of morphometry and of microstructural changes. It could also be of interest to apply the presented methods retrospectively to clinical studies and evaluate whether statistical power and conclusions might be altered.\nIn conclusion, we have shown the potential of a recent, automatic patch-based segmentation method, volBrain, to provide more accurate thalamus and hippocampus segmentations in MP2RAGE images compared to conventional approaches. We have furthermore demonstrated that FA and MD values, extracted from co-registered DTI, deviated less from the reference of the manual segmentation, when using patch-based methods compared to the segmentations of FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM. We have illustrated under-and particularly over-segmentations on T1w images and FA maps, especially for FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM. Finally, we propose that MP2RAGE images are more suitable for thalamus and hippocampus segmentation compared to conventional T1w images."}]
