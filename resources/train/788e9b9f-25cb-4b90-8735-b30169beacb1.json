This is of great concern from a public health perspective due to the tracking of childhood obesity into the adulthood. Moreover, there is strong relationship between the number of years lived with overall [2] or abdominal obesity [3] and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality.\nHence, the results of the Framingham Cohort Study showed that the risk of CVD mortality increased 7% for every 2 years additionally lived with obesity [2] .\nThe rise in the prevalence of overweight/obesity in preschool children has been particularly dramatic in the last three decades [4] . Likewise, the increase of early childhood overweight/obesity worldwide was 21% from 1990 to 2000, and 31% from 2000 to 2010 [5] . In 2010, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study reported that almost 15% of kindergarten-age children were overweight and 12.4% obese in the United States [6] . The latest systematic review in Europe reported prevalence rates of overweight or obesity between 8.4 and 31% in 2-5-year children, and observed the highest rates in countries in the Mediterranean region [7] . Spain, together with Malta and Sicily is leading the ranking of overweight and obesity rates in children aged 5-10 years [8] .\nChildhood is a crucial period in life in which individuals adopt lifestyle patterns that are likely to track into their adulthood. Healthy dietary habits and adequate physical activity levels during early life reduce the risk of major chronic diseases later in life [9] . Physical activity level, particularly moderate to vigorous physical activity, is strongly associated with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), a powerful health marker. However, in the last decades, the consumption of unhealthy diets has become average dietary patterns [10] and physical activity levels, and consequently CRF, have decreased among children [11] . Low level of CRF is engaged in the etiology and occurrence of many chronic non-communicable diseases, such as CVD, diabetes or obesity. For instance, higher total and central adiposity have been associated with low levels of CRF in children and adolescents [12] . This is potentially of great interest and concern because CRF is an important marker of health already in childhood.\nThe Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), based on the typical dietary habits followed by people from countries around the Mediterranean Sea, has been extensively studied due to its health benefits [13] . High adherence to the MDP has been associated with lower prevalence of major chronic disease morbidity and mortality [13] , and with lower adiposity and overweight prevalence in youths [14, 15] , while the other found no significant associations between the adherence to the MDP and obesity prevalence [16] . Interestingly, epidemiological evidence suggests that dietary patterns in the South of Europe are changing especially among youths, and that children living in countries in the South of Europe can even have lower adherence to the MDP than their peers living in the North of Europe [14] .\nThe majority of the studies examining the influence of CRF level and the adherence to the MDP in overweight/ obesity risk have been conducted in school children or adolescents. There are no previous epidemiologic studies examining the influence of both the adherence to the MDP and CRF levels on adiposity measures in preschool children. Early recognition of risk factors associated with excess adiposity and monitoring overweight/obesity rates are important steps towards preventing long-term health consequences. Therefore, the aims of the current study were: (1) to examine the adherence to the MDP in preschool children and (2) to examine the associations of the adherence to the MDP and CRF with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a sample of preschool children from the north of Spain."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design and participants", "text": "The PREFIT study (Assessing FITness in PREschoolers) is a multicentre cross-sectional study performed in 10 towns/ cities of Spain (Almer\u00eda, C\u00e1diz, Castell\u00f3n, Cuenca, Granada, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Zaragoza, and Vitoria-Gasteiz) that aimed to evaluate nutritional status and fitness in preschool children (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The present study focused on the sample from Vitoria-Gasteiz (north of Spain), the only center in which the adherence to the MDP was studied, and it is not representative of the whole Spanish population of preschoolers.

The test is composed of 16 nutritional items, 10 questions about the consumption of the different food groups and 6 more about healthy dietary habits not directly associated to the MDP [14] . For the purpose of the current study only those items related to the MDP were considered, while questions about breakfast habit, eating in fast-food restaurants or taking sweets were not included in the main analyses (Supplemental Table 1 ). A value of 1 was given to the questions which have a positive connotation in accordance to the MDP. The total MDP score (MDP index) was computed by adding up all the values obtained in the ten items. Thereby, the MDP index test ranged from 0 to 10 points. The MDP score was also expressed as percentage of adherence.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the current study, BMI and waist circumference, the adherence to the MDP and CRF were examined in more than six hundred Spanish preschool children. The study aimed to explore the associations of the adherence to the MDP and CRF levels with adiposity estimates. The main findings were that (1) the adherence to the MDP was low to moderate; (2) higher adherence to the MDP was associated with lower waist circumference, while higher levels of CRF were associated with both BMI and waist circumference; (3) those children with low adherence to the MDP and low CRF had higher waist and waist z-score, regardless of age, sex and sociodemographic factors. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first examining the combined associations of the adherence to the MDP and CRF with total and central adiposity estimates in preschool children.\nIn the current study, 16.0% of preschool met the criteria for overweight and 4.9% for obesity. These results reinforce findings from other studies demonstrating that Spain, together with other Mediterranean countries, showed the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity in early childhood compared with other European countries, particularly Scandinavian countries [19, 20] . Likewise, overweight/obesity rates in our study sample were similar to those recently reported in a study of 128 preschoolers from the South of Spain (22% classified according to the WOF criteria) [20] and also to the percentage of overweight children aged 2 to 10 years identified as overweight or obese (21.2%) in the Spanish children participating in the IDEFICS study [21] .\nFindings of the current study support previous evidence for low to moderate adherence to the MDP among children [22] . Likewise, the average adherence of the preschoolers to the MDP was 62.7% and only 24.3% of children showed optimal adherence (\u2265 80%). The low proportion of preschoolers with optimal adherence to the MDP observed in the present study is of concern and confirms that children living in Mediterranean countries are abandoning the traditional MDP [22] . Optimal adherence to the MDP in the current report was lower than in Spanish preschool children participating in the IDEFICS study (32.3%), whose data were obtained 8/9 years earlier in Zaragoza, one city located also in the north of Spain close to Vitoria-Gasteiz [14] . Although it cannot be interpreted as a secular trend of worsening dietary habits among preschool children, it seems that at least in the north of Spain the adherence to the MDP is decreasing in early childhood, in agreement with previous findings. Results from older children are even more alarming. In Italian 8-9-year-old children, only 5.0% had optimal adherence to the MDP [23] . In older children (from 10 to 12 years old), several studies conducted in large samples of Greek [16] , Cyprus [24] and Balearic Islands [25] reported optimal adherence to the MDP ranging from 4.3 to 7.1%. To note is that direct comparison among studies are difficult because of differences in the age of children and methods used to assess the adherence to the MDP. Indeed, three of the above-mentioned studies assessed the MDP with the KIDMED questionnaire [16, 23, 24] and two with food frequency questionnaires [14, 25] .\nWe observed that lower adherence to the MDP was associated with higher waist circumference, which in turn is strongly related to cardiometabolic risk. The specific relationships between dietary factors and/or diet quality and abdominal and truncal fat mass, as well as with visceral and hepatic fat regardless of total body fat, have been previously reported in several studies [26] [27] [28] . The influence of the adherence to the MDP on waist circumference in older pediatric populations was previously reported in cross-sectional [29] and longitudinal studies [14] , though no significant associations have also been shown [16, 30] . The observed association of MDP with waist circumference in preschoolers may help to explain the previously reported relationship between the adherence to the MDP and metabolic syndrome in older children and adolescents [31] , as well as with the preventive role of the MDP against cardiovascular disease later in life [13] . Given the influence of the MDP on the prevention of chronic diseases, and with the reduction in total mortality and improvement of longevity [13] , health policies should focus on promoting this traditional dietary pattern from early childhood.\nWe observed that a worse performance in the 20-m shuttle run test (i.e., CRF) was associated with higher BMI and waist circumference in preschoolers. Our results agree with previous studies conducted in school children and adolescents [11] . Furthermore, these findings concur with the few reports that have examined the association of CRF with central and overall adiposity in preschoolers [32, 33] . Of note is that CRF is a physical condition, while dietary pattern is a behavior. However, despite the strong genetic component of the CRF, regular physical activity (a lifestyle behavior) is one of its main determinants [34] . Therefore, our results reinforce the importance of promoting physical activity already in preschool children. Excess body fat gain is determined by a positive energy balance; thus, the increase of physical activity level may have benefits improving CRF, but also increasing energy expenditure.\nThe most novel observation of the current study is the combined influence of the adherence to the MDP and CRF on waist circumference in preschoolers. The results showed that the highest levels of waist circumference were found in those children who were unfit and had an unhealthy diet. It can be also observed that children not having high CRF levels had higher waist and waist z-score than those with high CRF, regardless of their adherence to the MDP. However, it should be also noted that children not having high CRF and with low adherence to the MDP had higher waist circumference than those not having high CRF but with a high adherence to the MDP. Actually it means that those children with non-high CRF levels and not having a high adherence to the MDP are at a higher risk of central obesity and cardiometabolic risk later in life. These findings expand the current knowledge since, as far as we are aware, this is the first study reporting both the separate and combined influence of the adherence to the MDP and CRF on adiposity estimates in preschool children.\nThe current study has several limitations. Findings from our study should be taken with caution due to its crosssectional design. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the long-term influence of the adherence to the MDP and CRF on obesity and adiposity gain. Collection of dietary data for more than 2 days or the use of a food frequency questionnaire would have been desirable to compensate for day-to-day variability. However, the KIDMED has been previously validated to use in children [17] and chosen as the dietary assessment method to estimate the adherence to the MDP in many previous studies [16, 23, 24] . Specifically in preschool children, it has the advantage of its short administration time and high response rate. The sample is not representative of the population of the north of Spain; however, it is a relatively large sample size that covers both public and private schools that should be acknowledged."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current study observed poor adherence to the MDP among children from 3 to 5 years together with a high prevalence of overweight and obesity (\u2248 21%). Our results demonstrate that only CRF was negatively related to total adiposity; however, both non-high adherence to the MDP and non-high CRF levels are associated with higher waist circumference already in preschoolers. Likewise, children not having high CRF levels and with low adherence to the MDP had the highest levels of waist circumference. Overall, these findings suggest that educational strategies aimed to increase CRF and promote healthy dietary habits are necessary from the early childhood to prevent children from suffering excess total and abdominal adiposity and later cardiovascular disease."}]
