[{"section_title": "", "text": ". This research has used student test scores to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of hypothesized characteristics of teacher quality (e.g., in-field degree, subject matter certification, years of teaching experience, advanced degrees, etc.). Many have specifically focused on mathematics teachers (Monk, 1994;Brewer, 1997 and2000). The best studies have controlled for students' prior achievement (i.e., used pre-and post-test scores to examine the 'value added' by teachers rather than assume that the highest student achievement scores correlate with the best teachers) (e.g., Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997;Monk and King, 1994;Darling-Hammond, 2000;Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2001, etc.). All, however, rely on the assumption that the effects of teacher quality characteristics are 'immediate' (e.g., many studies rely on tests administered half-way through the school year or after only four or five months with the focus teacher) and captured by test scores. The NELS survey of 8th-graders in 1988, with its second follow-up at the end of high school (1992) and its fourth follow-up eight years after a typical student's high school graduation (2000), allows one to test whether the characteristics of teacher quality that are associated with improved test scores are also associated with long-term effects on a student's education attainment. Specifically, the NELS:88 second follow-up data combined with the \"academic pipeline\" transcript classification of high school mathematics courses (which classifies courses into eight levels of academic rigor, ranging from \"no mathematics\" and \"non academic\" to \"advanced academic III\"1) allows one to For a detailed description of the \"academic pipeline\" for mathematics, see National Center for Education Statistics, The Condition of Education 2002, (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2002, 232-34 (also at http: //nces.ed.gov).

In short, the NELS:88 dataset allows us to explore the question of whether a single highly qualified teacher in a critical subject makes a lasting difference in the academic career of his or her students.

It began in 1988 with a cohort of about 24,000 8th-graders. The sample generalized to the 3 million 8th-graders attending the approximately 40,000 public and private schools serving 8th-graders in the U. S. in 1988S. in . Follow-up data were collected in 1990S. in , 1992S. in , 1994S. in , and 2000 information obtained from the students, parents, teachers, administrators, and from school The rationale for using the mathematics pipeline for this analysis is that mathematics is, by and large, a sequentially progressive subject that can easily be converted into an academic pipeline and easily interpreted. By contrast, English, social studies, and even science course are more difficult to convert into an academic pipeline and far more difficult to interpret (e.g., Is world history at a higher academic level or the same academic level as U.S. history? as economics?; Is AP Biology at a higher academic level or the same academic level as Chemistry II? as AP Physics?). transcript files. Just prior to the third follow-up in 1994, the decision was made to subsample the NELS:88 sample down to 14,000 respondents. Both respondents and nonrespondents from the third follow-up sample were selected for the 2000 survey, yielding a sample size of over 12,000 cases. For each student in the 8th -grade sample, two teachers were surveyed. One of these teachers was either the student's mathematics or science teacher and the other teacher was either the student's English or social studies teacher. For this study we selected cases of students whose mathematics teacher was surveyed by dropping all student cases that lacked 8th -grade mathematics teacher background data. By including only those students whose mathematics teacher was surveyed, we were able to specifically focus on the relationship between mathematics teacher quality and our three outcome variables: mathematics coursetaking in high school, high school completion, and postsecondary attainment. In order to rule out the possibility of bias in the subsample, we calculated frequencies for students who were dropped and for those who were retained. There were no marked differences in the frequency distributions of selected and nonselected students by (1) various student background characteristics (race, socioenomic status, limited English proficiency, parent's education, and mathematics grades from 6th grade until the base year survey), (2) school characteristics (urbanicity composite, geographic region, and the percent of students in the school eligible for free or reduced price lunch), or (3) the highest academic level of mathematics courses taken in high school."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "To examine the effects of a \"high quality\" teacher on a student's academic career, we (a) created a teacher quality measure, (b) used the National Center of Education Statistics' \"mathematics pipeline\" variable, and (c) used several outcome and background variables in the NELS:88 dataset."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Quality", "text": "We created a composite variable for teacher quality using the following items from the NELS:88 base year teacher survey: whether or not the teacher had a graduate (BYT310D1) or bachelor's (BYT3_9D1) degree in mathematics, or was certified in mathematics (BYT3_7A); their response to the question \"How prepared are you to teach this course?\"(BYT2_14); the amount of time they spent \"maintaining order and discipline\" in the classroom (BYT2_16D); their years of teaching experience at the elementary or secondary level (BYT3_4); and how diligent they were in keeping records on, correcting and returning, and discussing homework (A composite of BYT2_8A, BYT2_8B, and BYT2_8C). Teachers who were not certified and did not have a bachelor's or master's degree in mathematics were coded as low quality teachers if they also reported at least one of the following: (a) being \"unprepared\" or only \"somewhat prepared\" to teach 8th-grade mathematics; (b) lacking diligence on at least two homework factors (i.e., teacher reported never or only occasionally (i) keeping records on, (ii) correcting and returning, or (iii) discussing homework); or (c) having taught for 3 or fewer years.2 About 4.4 percent of the mathematics teachers surveyed fell into the cate-gory of low quality teacher. Teachers who had a bachelor's or master's degree in mathematics were coded as high quality teachers (about 39.5 percent of teachers) if they also reported that they were \"very well prepared\" or \"well prepared\" to teach 8th-grade mathematics. Certain high quality teachers were recoded as highest quality teachers (about 3.1 percent of teachers) if they also reported (a) diligence on all three homework factors (i.e., teacher reported most of the time or always (i) keeping records on, (ii) correcting and returning, and (iii) discussing homework) and (b) spending no time maintaining order in the classroom.3 About 53 percent of the mathematics teachers surveyed did not fall into any of these three categories and were coded as average quality teachers."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics pipeline", "text": "To create a variable for the highest academic level of mathematics completed using student transcript files, we replicated the code used for the analysis and preparation of indicators on high school student coursetaking in The Condition of Education 2002 (NCES 2002). In the second follow-up (1992), transcripts were collected for a sample (17,281) of the original 8th-grade students, of whom 42 percent (7,264) had an 8th-grade mathematics teacher who was surveyed. The categories (and percent of students for whom this was the highest academic level of coursetaking they completed) are as follows: teachers with at least 5 years of teaching experience (Darling-Hammond, 2000). The category of '3 or fewer years' was the lowest and most appropriate category for inexperience available in the variable BYT3_4. Low academic level (8.3 percent): Highest completed courses are preliminary courses (e.g., prealgebra) or mathematics courses of reduced rigor or pace (e.g., algebra I taught over the course of 2 academic years). Considered to be more academically challenging than nonacademic courses, courses at this level include prealgebra; algebra I, part I; algebra I, part II; and geometry (informal). The middle academic level is divided into two sublevels, each of which is considered to be more academically challenging than the nonacademic and low academic levels, though level I is not considered as challenging as level II. Middle academic level I (21.9 percent): Highest completed courses include algebra I; plane geometry; plane and solid geometry; unified mathematics I and II; and pure mathematics.

This we did by estimating several ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression models with AM software using as the dependent variable the mathematics pipeline variable in the first set of regressions, the type of high school diploma in the second set of regressions, and the highest postsecondary degree in the third set of regressions. We controlled for student background characteristics and ability level as well as various school factors (using the variables described above under The results of the second and third model can be interpreted, respectively, as the change in the type of high school diploma and change in the highest postsecondary degree earned associated with particular teacher quality levels when holding other student and school factors constant. The general equation for each of these models is the same as that for the first model, with Y adjusted accordingly."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Preliminary results", "text": "The results of a simple bivariate analysis reveal that students who had the highest quality mathematics teacher in the 8th grade are significantly more likely to have completed advanced academic mathematics level II and III courses in high school than students who did not (see Table 1). They are also less likely to have stopped taking 11 12 mathematics at the low academic level in high school. These students are more likely to have graduated from high school (see Table 2) and to have gone on to complete a bachelor's degree by 2000 (see Table 3) than students with an average or low quality mathematics teacher in the 8th grade. Such results suggest the possibility that the quality of a student's 8th -grade mathematics teacher may be associated with educational attainment later in life. However, skepticism suggests that it is more likely that these results indicate that the quality of a student's 8th-grade mathematics teacher are highly correlated with other factors (e.g., better school districts, affluent families, better classes, highly self-motivated students, etc.) that are the true determinant of later educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "Regression results", "text": "The results of our three OLS regressions (to sort out the relative importance of the quality of a student's 8th-grade mathematics teachers when student and school background factors are controlled for) reveal that the quality of a student's 8th-grade mathematics teacher does not turn out to have a significant impact on high school mathematics coursetaking, high school graduation, or postsecondary educational attainment once one controls for the achievement level of the student's 8th-grade mathematics class. Table 4 shows that when teacher quality is regressed upon the highest academic level of mathematics completed in high school, and only a student's grades and family socio-economic status (SES) are controlled for, teacher quality is a significant determinant of the highest academic level of mathematics completed in high school (see run A). Controlling for parental education, the percentage of students in the school eligible for free or reduce-price lunch, whether the school is private, urbanicity, region, the percentage of minority students in the school, class size, school size, student race, and whether the student has limited English proficiency (LEP) did not change this result (see run B). However, if one also controls for the teacher's perception of the level of achievement in the class (i.e., whether the teacher reported that students in the 8th-grade mathematics class were above or below the average level), teacher quality no longer remains a significant determinant and the estimated impact of grades, SES, the percentage of students eligible for free or reduce-price lunch, and urbanicity diminishes (see run C). This suggests that an 8th-grade class's achievement level \"soaks up\" the effect of teacher quality (as well as some of these other factors), perhaps by eliminating the effect of the best students being sorted into the best teachers' classes. For were this occurring, high quality teaching would not be a determinant but rather the high quality teachers would be an indirect factor by virtue of bringing together students who sustain a high-quality learning environment. This could be because the high quality teachers are more likely to teach the advanced classes (see Table 4a) (though this may be an artifact of the dataset and the construct used in this analysis as this was not found to be the case in an analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 2000 8th-grade mathematics teachers, Provasnik and Young, 2003). Likewise, it could be because bringing together a critical mass of students with higher than average achievement levels raises the performance expectations for all students in the class, or that the teacher's perceptions of the level of their class may be related to their expectations of how well their students will perform, which may in turn have an effect on the performance of their students. Or it may be that there are other factors that we have not controlled for that 13 would better control for the possibility that the advanced classes are more likely to be in the most affluent schools. Table 5 shows that when teacher quality is regressed upon the type of high school diploma a student received, only the highest teacher quality is a significant factor (see run A). Once one controls for a student's grades, family socio-economic status (SES), and the level of achievement in the class, teacher quality again is not a significant determinant (see run B). Moreover, being part of a class with a higher than average achievement level is not a predictive factor of high school graduation though being part of a low achievement level class is a negative factor. Once one controls for other factors, however, being in a class with a higher than average achievement level becomes a positive predictor at a 0.1 level of significance (see C). Table 6 shows that when teacher quality is regressed upon the highest completed level of postsecondary education, a high quality teacher is a significant determinant (at 0.1 level of significance) even controlling for a student's grades and family socioeconomic status (SES) (see runs A and B). However, once one controls for the teacher's perception of the class's level of achievement, the effect disappears (see run C). Controlling for the rest of the student background and school factors does not change this result."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "The results of this study suggest that a single high (or low) quality teacher, by virtue of what they bring to the classroom as teachers, does not have any discernible impact on a student's educational career once one controls for the student's background, ability level, and other school factors.
