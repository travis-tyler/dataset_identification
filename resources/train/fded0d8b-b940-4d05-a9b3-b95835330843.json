The mechanisms underlying AD onset and progression remain largely unclear. Up to now, the only genetic variant consistently shown to impact AD risk and age at onset was APOE [2] . It has been reported that variations in genes associated with cholesterol homeostasis modify the risk of AD progression [2]. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is a strong functional AD candidate gene because it encodes part of the statin-binding domain of the enzyme, which serves as the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis in all mammalian cells [3, 4] . The association of HMGCR (rs3846662) with LDL-C levels has been replicated in Japanese Populations [5] . A study identified rs3846662 as a functional SNP in intron13 [6] . Besides, it was in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs of genome-wide significance and influenced alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA [7] . Compounds having inhibitory effects on the enzyme HMGCR, such as statins, are thought to possess anti-inflammatory effects and may have some clinical effects in AD patient [8] . A study has clearly identified HMGCR rs3846662 as a potent genetic modifier for AD risk, age of onset and conversion in three cohorts study [4] .\nNeuroimaging methods increasingly are used as additional outcome measures to explore the link between HMGCR rs3846662 and AD. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the involvement of HMGCR in the development and progression of AD by studying the influence of HMGCR on neuroimaging biomarkers in the three different clinical stages (normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset."}, {"section_title": "rEsULts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic and clinical characteristics", "text": "The dataset comprised of 48 AD patients (18 women, 75.51\u00b19.23 years), 483 MCI samples (201 women, 72.28\u00b17.45 years) and 281 NC (145 women, 74.51\u00b15.56 years) at baseline in our study (Table 1 ). In consistent with previous studies, AD patients had the highest frequency of the \u03b54 allele within APOE gene and CN group had the lowest frequency.

In the cortical structure analysis, baseline volume of right entorhinal was identified to have strong associations with SNP rs3846662 in the hybrid population (the population included NC, MCI and AD patients) (P = 0.01002) ( Figure 1A) Figure 1A ). So it was detected that right entorhinal of C-allele carriers in the subjects showed significant prevention on the percentage of atrophy. Then we compared the volume between TT, CT, and CC groups in the three different clinical stages (NC, MCI, and AD). We observed that rs3846662 only prevent the atrophy of right entorhinal in the MCI group (P = 0.02755) ( Figure  1D ). In the subcortical structure analysis, we didn't find the baseline volume of any region have relationship with SNP rs3846662 in the hybrid population.\nIn the follow-up research of two years, we found that rs3846662 decrease the percentage of atrophy in the volume of right entorhinal (P = 0.03385) ( Figure 1B ). The C-allele in remarkably protected right entorhinal from shrinking at the two-year follow-up (CC: 0.99\u00b10.1738, CT: 0.979\u00b10.136, TT: 0.95\u00b10.1323) ( Table 3) . Similarly, we can get the results in the MCI group (P = 0.01073) ( Figure 1E ). With regard to the subcortical structures, rs3846662 decreased the percentage of atrophy in the volume of left hippocampus in the hybrid population (P = 0.01839) ( Figure 1C ). We can get same results in both dominant and recessive pattern (Supplementary Table 2 ). The C-allele prevented left hippocampus atrophy (CC: 0.9828\u00b10.1051, CT: 0.9564\u00b10.06219, TT: 0.9515\u00b10.07469, P = 0.01839) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, in the MCI cohort, the volume of left hippocampus was found to be related to rs3846662 (P = 0.003746) in the follow-up research of two years ( Figure 1F ). In addition, the C-allele prevented left hippocampus atrophy in MCI subjects. More importantly, HMGCR (rs3846662) was not found to be related to hippocampus or hippocampus substructure (CA1) (P > 0.5) (Supplementary Table 1), the most associated substructure with the AD specific amnestic syndrome in hippocampus [9] ."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of HMGCR (rs3846662) on glucose metabolism", "text": "We test the relationships between HMGCR genotypes and the cerebral metabolism rate of glucose (CMRgl) on FDG-PET imaging (Supplementary Table 2 ).

In the analysis of the three groups, same result was found in MCI groups at baseline (P = 0.001808) ( Figure  2C ). The C-allele had significantly higher CMRgl in the right temporal (CC: 1.237\u00b10.1166, CT: 1.212\u00b10.1146, TT: 1.189\u00b10.1413, P = 0.001808) (Table 2) ( Figure 2C ).\nIn the follow-up research of two years, rs3846662 Data are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation unless otherwise indicated may lower the drop rate of CMRgl in right temporal in the hybrid population (P = 0.03078) ( Figure 2B ).

Cholesterol synthesis may be involved in AD neurodegeneration because of polymorphism in HMGCR was found to be related with AD [10] . Some variants of HMGCR have been identified as AD susceptibility loci, whereas little is known about the interaction between the HMGCR and risk of AD [2, 10] . Rs3846662 SNP in intron 13 of the HMGCR gene was found to significantly associate with sporadic AD [4] . This present study investigated the effects of HMGCR rs3846662 (TT, CT, and CC) on neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages (NC, MCI, and AD).\nIt is recognized that regional brain atrophy could be an important underlying pathology in functional imaging studies of neurodegenerative diseases [11, 12] . A study has demonstrated that structural brain changes occur years before the clinical onset in AD and were localized to regions influenced by AD neuropathology [13] . Therefore, in our study we detected the influence of rs3846662 on different brain volumes. Our study showed that variants at rs3846662 would change the volume of right entorhinal in the two-year follow-up study and the C-allele remarkably prevented the atrophy of right entorhinal. Then the finding was confirmed by the stratified analyses of MCI group. In addition, rs3846662 had influence on the volume of left hippocampus in the two-year follow-up study and C-allele showed protective effect on the volume of left hippocampus. This was in accordance with previous MRIbased studies that hippocampal atrophy was a recognized biological marker of AD. The finding was confirmed by the stratified analyses of MCI group. But we did't found any relation in AD group due to the limited sample size. Apart from hippocampal, middle temporal has been implicated as a key brain region involved in the pathogenesis of AD [14, 15] . But we didn't confirm it in our study.\nCerebral glucose metabolic rate may be related with AD. We investigated the mechanism underlying the interaction between rs3846662 and AD in this study, and found that right temporal reveal higher CMRgl both at baseline and the two-year follow-up. In addition, in the stratified analyses of AD, MCI and NC group, we also discovered C-allele carriers increased CMRgl in right temporal in the follow-up study of two years.\nSome previous studies have paid their attentions to the effects of cholesterol on A\u03b2 metabolism. They have shown that brain cholesterol metabolism may play a certain role in AD development, with increased cellular cholesterol levels leading to high amyloid beta (A\u03b2) production [16] [17] [18] . Another study believe A\u03b2 directly affects the activity of the HMGCR enzyme and the metabolism of cholesterol in neuronal cells, being \u03b3-secretase dependent [8] . In our study, AV45-PET imaging was utilized to mark the presence and deposition of A\u03b2. Nevertheless, no significant effect was detected for rs3846662 SNP on florbetapir retention. In addition, in the stratified analyses of AD, MCI and NC group, we also didn't discover rs3846662 have connection with A\u03b2 deposition. More evidence will be needed to illustrate the interactions between rs3846662 and A\u03b2 deposition.\nThere are several potential limitations in our study. First, our results are obviously limited to the ADNI dataset and its small sample size. Second, a follow up of two years may be too short to detect the significant influence of HMGCR on the AD process, and further study need an increase of follow-up. Moreover, our results cannot represent other ethnicities, because our sample was restricted to Caucasians. Finally, unbalanced number of subgroups (AD, MCI and NC) also makes the conclusions of total cohort tends to the results arisen from MCI, which has the most case number. This might lead to untrue finding for the entire cohort. Hence, more studies are needed to perform to fill the gaps.\nIn general, it is possible that HMGCR (rs3846662) could be involved in the structural and functional modification of right entorhinal and left hippocampus throughout the AD physiopathological process. What's more, it influedced glucose metabolism of right temporal. HMGCR (rs3846662) plays an important role in AD-related neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, identification of specific factors that regulate HMGCR alternative splicing and elucidating the underlying mechanism may lead to a better understanding of its impact on regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegenerative processes. It is necessary to explore more clear understanding on the mechanisms in a larger sample, with longer follow-up and a wider range of people."}, {"section_title": "MAtErIALs AND MEtHODs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in this article were got from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu\\ADNI).
