[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "As of May 16, 2020, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) , has infected more than 4.6 million individuals and has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 people across 212 countries globally.\nThe virus has a positive, single-stranded genome that is over 29 kb in length [1] . The spike (S) protein, being the sole protein responsible for receptor binding and viral entry, stands as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. The S-protein is a class I fusion protein, with each S protomer consisting of S1 and S2 domains. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-using MAESTROweb to determine positions where mutations are predicted to have little effect on the stability, or if they are predominantly stabilizing or destabilizing [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Structure refinement for Rosetta interface design", "text": "The resulting structure of the RBD-ACE2 complex was optimized using Schr\u00f6dinger Maestro (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2016-4: Maestro, Schr\u00f6dinger, New York) and used for structural preparation and refinement by Rosetta relax, the main protocol for all-atom refinement of structures in the Rosetta force-field [18] .

The RBD of the RBD-ACE2 complex was redesigned, keeping the backbone flexible and using Rosetta's full-atom scoring function. In this step, only the 24 residues of RBD known to interact with ACE2 were redesigned with eighteen other amino acids (except cysteine to prevent disulfide bond formation during interface design). During this stage, the remaining residues of RBD and ACE2 were allowed to repack without design. A total of 100,000 designs were generated where ten cycles were carried out to generate a structure. In the design simulations, a modified RosettaScripts was used to design the interface residues that consider the Backrub flexible backbone modelling method [20] . The designs were then sampled by Monte-Carlo simulated annealing using the Rosetta all-atom force field. For a detailed structural and quantitative analysis with a focus on in cerebro examination of the resulting designs, the Rosetta total score, root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the starting structure, Rosetta DDG representing the binding affinity between designed RBD with ACE2, and the percentage sequence identity from the starting sequence were obtained."}, {"section_title": "Validating the interface design protocol on high-frequency RBD mutations", "text": "To test the accuracy and reliability of our Rosetta interface design protocol, we took two mutants of RBD (G476S and V483A) into consideration, which were high-frequency RBD mutations identified from a study involving 1609 different strains of the virus [14, 21] . In this stage, we designed Gly476 and Val483 residues, whereas the remaining residues were allowed to repack without design.

The height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino acid at that position."}, {"section_title": "PRODIGY-based binding affinity calculation", "text": "The Rosetta based interface designs were then subjected to the calculation of the binding affinities between RBD and ACE2 using PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY), a predictor of binding affinity in a protein-protein complex from their 3D structures [23] . In this method, after the 3D model is supplied with a suitable temperature (default of 25\u00b0C), the binding affinity is computed. From the Rosetta designed structures, the binding affinity (\u0394G) and the number of intermolecular contacts were obtained for analysis.

As a final step, residue level interactions between ACE2 and RBD interface for the top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs obtained by the DIMPLOT program of LigPlot+v1.4.5 and were analyzed in Pymol."}, {"section_title": "Interacting residues of RBD-ACE2 complex and mutation sensitivity profile", "text": "The crystal structure of the RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that the interface between them is stabilized by 59 interactions in total (Table 1) . Among the 59 interactions, 23 residues from RBD establish intermolecular contacts with the ACE2 interface ( Figure 1 ). We were curious to learn how the residues of RBD affect the stability when they are mutated systematically to other residues. To understand this, we obtained a mutation sensitivity profile, where the impact of each mutation at each possible position is visualized. It was found that the interface residues of RBD that interact with ACE2 are not highly stable at many positions with \u0394\u0394Gpred>0 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Some of the hot-spot residues such as R403, G446, Y453, L455, F456, Y473, G485, Y489, F490, Y495, N501 and G502 with \u0394\u0394Gpred>0 suggests they are relatively unstable and likely more prone to mutation. It is noteworthy that some of these native RBD residues are already found to be mutated in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as reported in the CoV-GLUE database, which publishes information on amino acid replacements, insertions, and deletions from genome sequences sampled from the pandemic (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/replacement). For instance, G446 to S, Y453 to S, F456 to L, Y473 to D/H, Y489 to S, F490 to L/S, Y495 to S/N, N501 to T, etc. This further confirms our mutational sensitivity profiling. However, this does not consider the flexibility of the backbone residues while suggesting the sensitivity profile, owing to which, we opted for interface designing focused on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to gain further structural insights."}, {"section_title": "Rosetta flexible backbone interface design and various structural features", "text": "To gain insights on how the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can modulate the interaction with ACE2, we designed the interface of RBD-ACE2 with a focus on the RBD specifically. In our design experiments, we allowed the backbone flexibility of RBD during design, where 24 interacting residues of RBD were mutated to other remaining amino acids except cysteine. The 100,000 generated designs were first sampled by calculating the total scores versus RMSD of the designs.\nWe found that >50% of the topmost total-scored designs exhibited RMSD <2\u00c5, suggesting even after mutations of the interface residues of the RBD, the whole complex doesn't deviate much from the crystal structure, thus maintaining structural integrity ( Figure 2A ).\nSecondly, we calculated the Rosetta DDG of the designs and plotted them against the total scores. Importantly, we also observed that the designs with top-scored DDG/binding affinities have higher total scores, indicating that the designs with mutations at the interface interacting residues of RBD converge well during the simulations ( Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S2 ).\nFor distinguishing the designs among themselves, we took the ACE2-RBD complex and only repacked (no designing) the same set of interacting residues of RBD and compared it with the DDG and total score as control ( Figure 2B ). From this analysis, we further confirmed that many top-scored designs exhibit much higher binding affinities than the control in our design experiments.\nThirdly, our computation of Rosetta DDG versus the RMSD further demonstrated the convergence of the design simulations and better affinity variants of RBD ( Figure 2C ). As expected, here we found that some of the better binding affinity designs (out of the red box) exhibit relatively higher RMSDs (from 1.5-3.5 \u00c5) but still retain higher binding affinities, suggesting that certain mutations have changed the backbone conformation resulting in slightly increased deviation in RMSDs ( Figure 2C ).\nOur final evaluation of binding affinities in comparison to percentage sequence identity revealed that the designs exhibiting higher binding affinities most often contain sequences with 90-95% identity to that of native sequence ( Figure 2D ). However, the RBD designs having lower binding affinities showed relatively low percent sequence identity, suggesting their mutational profiles are less diverse, thus ensuing low stability as a whole when the RMSDs and total scores are taken into consideration ( Figure 2D ). This also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations (not just single point mutations) at the RBD of the RBD-ACE2 complex during evolutionary pressure."}, {"section_title": "Validation of Rosetta flexible backbone interface design", "text": "To validate our interface design methodology, two residues of RBD, such as G467 and V483, were designed and evaluated to see whether our methodology is able to score and rank G476S and V483A at the top because they have the highest occurrence in several isolates across diverse populations. Our analysis of binding affinities versus total score revealed that the G467S mutant scores better in both binding affinity and total score as compared to V483A mutant in the design experiments (Supplementary Figure S3) . However, both the designs scored much better in the design simulations when compared to other residues that are sampled during the designs and rankordered. This suggests that our design protocol and workflow are capable enough to score, rank order, and distinguish the favorable and unfavorable RBD mutants for binding with ACE2 (Supplementary Figure S3) ."}, {"section_title": "Diversity of top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs", "text": "We subsequently divided the designs into two groups, such as the affinity-enhancing designs and the affinity-weakening designs. The affinity-enhancing designs had higher total scores in addition to better binding affinity. The analysis of 50 top-scored RBD designs from each group revealed a landscape of mutations at the interacting residues of RBD ( Figure 3) . It was observed that while certain positions of the native RBD such as Arg403, Gly446, Gly476, Gly485, Phe490, Tyr495, Gly496, and Gly502 are sampled to almost identical residues in both the groups, they varied most at other positions of the remaining residues. However, residues Phe456, Tyr473, Phe486, Tyr489, Gln498, Thr500, and Asn501 were mutated to unique residues in both groups, which drive the affinity enhancing or weakening characteristics towards ACE2 (Figure 3 ). Some of these residues were found to be the hot-spot residues in mutation sensitivity profile (Supplementary Figure S1) , altogether suggesting these are the ones probably to be used by the SARS-CoV-2 for its infection, propagation, and survival from its evolutionary and immunological pressure."}, {"section_title": "RBD designs-ACE2 binding affinity calculation using PRODIGY", "text": "Next, we computed the binding affinities of the RBD designs with ACE2 obtained from Rosetta simulations. We found that the binding affinities ranged from -8.8 kcal/mol to -12.5 kcal/mol across the designs (Figure 4 ). When the binding affinities were compared, many of the designs scored higher in both methodologies, suggesting that they formed a higher number of interactions and contacts with ACE2 when certain positions of the RBD were mutated. An analysis of the number of intermolecular contacts versus the binding affinities (Figure 4) , further confirmed the assumption that Rosetta generated top-scored higher binding affinity designs can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 to establish stronger interactions with ACE2. Detailed decomposition of intermolecular contacts of the top five affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs further demonstrated that the numbers of intermolecular contacts, charged-apolar contacts, polar-polar contacts, apolarpolar contacts, and apolar-apolar contacts primarily drive the affinity-enhancing or affinityweakening RBD mutants towards ACE2 (Tables 2 and 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Visualization and computation of intermolecular interactions for the affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutants", "text": "In the end, we were interested in visualizing and computing the types of intermolecular interactions that play a role in inducing the improved or reduced affinity of the RBD designs towards ACE2 ( Figure 5 ). For this, we took two designs representing the top-ranked affinityenhancing and affinity-weakening characteristics. In cerebro analysis revealed a significantly higher number of interactions with a much compact binding interface for the affinity-enhancing Design-1 ( Figure 5A ) as compared to affinity-weakening Design-1 ( Figure 5B ). The number and types of intermolecular interactions between both the designs demonstrate this feature (Table 4) .\nWhen comparing how the intermolecular interactions of the RBD-ACE2 crystal structure contrast with our affinity-enhancing Design-1, we found that although the crystal structure has a higher number of interactions, the total number of intermolecular interactions in the designed affinityenhancing mutants surpassed the crystal structure, mainly due to the increased number of van der Waals and proximal interactions (Table 4 ). Finally, the residue level interactions between ACE2 and RBD for the top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs were obtained by the DIMPLOT program, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 Thus, the blocking of S-protein to ACE2 receptor interaction, and cell fusion is one of the key strategies for antiviral development. The binding free energy of RBD to ACE2 is the key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. The higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to ACE2 is attributed to the presence of an extended network of favorable hydrogen bond networks between the interacting partners. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2-RBD displays a 10-20 fold stronger affinity for ACE2 compared with the RBD of other SARS-CoVs [2, 3] . This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 encodes distinct epitope properties in the RBD from other SARS-CoVs.\nThe RNA viruses evolved a specific strategy to interact with the host membrane. They use protein-binding interaction motifs specific to RNA viruses [25] . Multiple virus and hostdependent processes contribute to viral diversity by encouraging mutations in the viral proteins to adapt to a new host and environment [26] . Mutations in the viral binding proteins modulate infectivity and alter antigenicity leading to species specificity, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The spike gene of the SARS-CoV-2 may be recombined with the other SARS-CoVs due to convergent evolution (with its relatively high mutation rate), which is the very nature of SARS-CoVs [27] . Under natural selection and evolutionary pressure, the SARS-CoV-2-RBD has undergone several mutations conferring stability to the viral particle [1, 9, 28] . Pieces of evidence are accumulating on viruses undergoing positive selection suggesting the emergence of a more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2 [29] [30] [31] . However, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is not particularly high with respect to other SARS-CoVs, but they do accumulate with time. Thus, as the epidemic progresses, accumulations of further mutations due to positive selective pressure could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This may accelerate the risk for antigenic drift and the accumulation of immunologically significant mutations in the population.\nTo understand the complex mechanisms of the infection process, computational analysis of underlying protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks may provide crucial insights for designing novel and effective therapeutics. To modulate SARS-CoV-2-RBD interactions with ACE2, we applied high-throughput mutational screening. We observed that in several mutants, the binding affinities had similar binding interface sizes but altered RBD-ACE2 interactions.\nDeterminants of binding affinity include 'hot spots', i.e., residues at critical positions in the binding interface for which mutations cause a significant reduction in affinity. Mutations at other positions in the PPI interfaces are known as 'cold spots' and do not significantly affect or may sometime increase the binding affinity [32] . Knowledge of the direction of mutational pressure may help design more effective therapeutic strategies. If the affinity-enhancing mutations are known, one may try to choose \"cold-spots\" for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of \"hot-spots\". A comparison of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences suggests that the rate of non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is less than that of synonymous ones indicating that the active SARS-CoV-2 is at present under the control of negative selection. This is because presently, the virus is not under significant immune or drug pressure. If these pressures mount, the positive selection of non-synonymous mutations will accumulate much rapidly. This will cause a change in the viral phenotype allowing it to evade the host immune system and also develop drug resistance [33] . Thus, the weakening of the RBD-ACE2 complex interaction by modulating affinity-enhancing/affinity-weakening mutations represents a possible therapeutic strategy.\nThe rapid increase in the atomic-level understanding of molecular determinants desirable for the development of specific therapeutics has led to significant advances in the computational design of conformationally stable epitope-scaffolds and inhibitors. In recent years highthroughput computation and mutational mapping have been used to optimize the binding interface and develop several peptide-based inhibitors and conformationally stable epitope-scaffolds against several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [34, 35] . These computationally designed, conformationally stable epitope-scaffolds were able to elicit superior epitope-specific responses "}]
