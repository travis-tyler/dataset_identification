[{"section_title": "", "text": "worse by coastal land loss. Few structures have been designed to withstand hurricane forces and many depend on coastal hurricane protection systems. Many are located in close proximity to industrial facilities or hazardous material sites. Meanwhile, MSN patients and decision-makers lack access to the latest hurricane science. This prevents them from conceptualizing their true hurricane vulnerability. Indications were that high numbers of MSN patients remained in the risk area even while Category 5 Hurricane Katrina loomed towards Louisiana. Many still plan to shelter in place for hurricanes. This manuscript reviews the health and hurricane risks of MSN patients in evacuation vs. sheltering in place in coastal Louisiana. The latest hurricane models are incorporated with critical MSN location data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine threshold viii events. Solutions are explored to communicate risk, visualize data, and share hurricane research and GIS tools with MSN decision-makers at the local level. Based on scientifically accredited modeling and associated research, this study has determined the threshold storm event for coastal Louisiana MSN patient evacuation to be a tropical storm. Particularly, rapid hurricane intensification has historically supported that even lower order storms may intensify enough within 48 hours of landfall to create unsafe flood and wind levels. Thus, full MSN patient evacuation south of the Louisiana interstates is recommended upon a tropical storm entering the Gulf of Mexico.  Boyd 2006). Approximately 37 hospitals and 34 nursing homes had to evacuate southeast Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina, with 19 nursing homes evacuating prior (LA DHH 2007b). Hurricane Rita months later prompted the early evacuation of 24 nursing homes, but later required the evacuation of 21 hospitals across southwest Louisiana (ibid). Hurricane Katrina further demonstrated the severe risk of hurricanes and floods to elderly residents. Figure 1. Preliminary deceased victims data for Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana indicate a positive association between age and mortality (LA DHH 2006b)."}, {"section_title": "Number of Hurricane Katrina Fatalities by Age", "text": "Elderly often have existing medical conditions or extreme physical difficulties which may qualify them as MSN patients. Preliminary data from Hurricane Katrina indicate a positive association between age and mortality, with older Louisiana residents disproportionately affected by the storm (see also, Appendix C). Over 400 fatalities at age seventy or above were recorded ( Figure 1) (LA DHH 2006b). Supported by just over half of the total data (853 of 1464 records), it is unclear whether future data when completely tabulated will support the same association. From the existing data however, 51 percent of elderly recovery locations (places where deceased elderly were recovered or documented after the disaster) were identified as residences. This indicates that many elderly remained in their homes and did not evacuate a risk area that was at one time being threatened by a Category 5 hurricane ( Figure 2) (LA DHH 2006b, Boyd 2006. Hospitals (18%) and nursing homes (14%) accounted for the second and third largest number of recoveries of deceased elderly (ibid). Deceased elderly victims were also recovered from hospice settings (2%), airport medical staging areas (2%), the Convention Center (2%) and the Superdome (1%) (Figure 2, 3a-c) (ibid).  Figure 2. Current fatality datasets identify the primary recovery locations for deceased victims 65 and older as residences, hospitals, and nursing homes (State Medical Examiner, LA DHH 2006b, Boyd 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Elderly Recovery Locations by Type", "text": "Figures 3a-c.

Above, an overwhelming number of elderly and MSN patients were brought to airport medical staging areas and the New Orleans Convention Center (LA DHH, Katrinahelp.com). not evacuated the risk area. These also served to document the critical situation faced by MSN patients following the disaster . Figures 4a-c. There are indications that high numbers of MSN patients remained in the risk area for Hurricane Katrina. Photos above show numerous individuals requiring mobility aids, as well as frail elderly. Left: Residents waiting to enter the Superdome, a shelter of last resort, before the storm (wikinews). Middle: MSN patients are evacuated long distances to shelter (Florida DMAT). Far right: MSN patients await transport to shelter facilities (Katrinahelp.com). Further evidence of MSN patient vulnerability in disasters is indicated by the cases of exacerbated chronic disease reported after the storm. Similar chronic conditions were reported at medical staging areas and triage sites, field hospitals, emergency rooms and shelters. Heart problems, diabetes, and mental illness were among the major conditions reported (CDC MMWR 2006a-b, LA DHH 2005a-c, 2007b, Ford et al 2006, Mokhad et al 2005. Of Hurricane Katrina evacuees sheltering in Texas, \"41 percent of Houston shelter residents reported chronic health conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, or asthma\" (Brodie et al 2006(Brodie et al , p 1403. Medical special needs are therefore a serious concern in hurricane and flood disasters, as strongly evidenced by recent hurricane events such as Hurricane Katrina in coastal Louisiana."}, {"section_title": "Defining Medical Special Needs", "text": "Medical Special Needs (MSN) patients, for the purpose of this research, are generally considered those individuals who, for health reasons, should be very near medical professionals during a disaster. It is accepted that many MSN patients may not have appropriate levels or access to health care even prior to a disaster. However, MSN patients for this study are conceptualized as those individuals who should be accounted for, and for whom we should be immediately prepared to receive in any disaster situation, to fulfill their basic medical needs. MSN populations for this study are considered a subset of overarching \"special needs\" and \"vulnerable\" populations. MSN populations may be differentiated from these larger groups in that MSN individuals will have an existing medical problem that requires prompt, professional medical care; otherwise serious harm may result. MSN individuals can also be described as \"\u2026medically dependent individuals who have physical or mental conditions that limit their ability to function on their own\u2026 (Bridges and Garcie 2006, p. 4).\" These individuals can be found in hospitals, nursing homes, their own residence, in adult day service programs, assisted living facilities, foster and group homes, and long term care facilities (ibid, USFA EMI 2003, GOHSEP 2005, DOJ CRD/DRS 2004, Lapolla 2003, Prats 2003. The discerning factor for MSN individuals is that if medical assistance is not received immediately, or within the short term of a few days of an emergency or disaster situation, injury or death can result. Definitions of the special needs population are more inclusive, and comprise larger numbers of \"\u2026individuals in the community with physical, mental or medical care needs who may require assistance before, during and/or after a disaster or emergency after exhausting their usual resources and support network (ibid, p.1.3).\" This group differs from the MSN subset in that, if prepared and supported at the onset of an emergency, special needs individuals will usually not encounter problems navigating an evacuation or sheltering in place. With basic support, they have the capacity to proceed as normal, often times on their own, without any resulting medical emergency (ibid). Special needs definitions will typically incorporate the disabled and mentally ill. However, the important distinction for MSN disabled and mentally ill which separates them out from general special needs populations, is that again, these individuals will have an immediate medical need and will not be able to care for themselves. They might require medication they cannot dispense without medical assistance, need help in the operation of medical equipment, or demand some level of professional medical care or supervision. Specific categories of MSN disabled and mentally ill are discussed in more detail in Section 3.1.1, but as an example, may include traumatic brain injury patients, bariatric 1 patients, or the seriously mentally ill, such as schizophrenic patients. Along the same lines, vulnerable populations are a larger and more inclusive designation than MSN. These individuals are somewhat more at risk in an emergency, but are generally not likely to be emergency medical patients. In the broadest definition, those included in within vulnerable populations may range from young children entirely dependent on adults for their care; to pregnant women; to the immuno-compromised; to individuals facing socio-economic problems such as poverty; to individuals located near hazardous materials sites. One important subset within vulnerable populations in the case of a hurricane disaster are those with Critical Transportation Needs (CTN) (LA DHH App 9). CTN individuals may not be able to \"provide for or arrange their own transportation or sheltering outside a risk area (ibid).\" This leaves them potentially stranded in a hazard area, and subject to harm. Where MSN patients might separate from vulnerable populations are in instances such as medically dependent children, pregnant women who are high risk or late term, or low-income residents with untreated medical conditions living in high risk areas (e.g., low elevations, near levees or hazardous sites). In either case, it is important to note that the larger group definitions of \"special needs\" and \"vulnerable\" individuals are inevitably going to be the next series of MSN patients if a disaster situation becomes dire (USFA EMI 2003). That is, individuals from these groups are most likely to deteriorate into emergency medical patients and amplify the MSN population shortly after a disaster such as a hurricane, if their primary needs are not met and if they are overwhelmed by an extensive or severe storm. Although just a subset of vulnerable or special needs populations, MSN categories are nonetheless quite inclusive and often overlapping. The MSN designation may incorporate many more individuals with medical conditions and needs in a disaster, particularly the elderly and as previously discussed, the disabled. These individuals may live at home or in assisted living, community care or retirement settings (ibid, Bridges and Garcie 2006, GOHSEP 2005, DOJ CRD/DRS 2004, Lapolla 2003, Prats 2003. Many elderly or senior citizens (considered in most cases to be age 65 and older) may be self-supporting and completely healthy. However, the elderly that comprise MSN populations will require varying levels of assistance and medical care and will have other special, medical or transportation needs (USFA EMI 2003, p.1.9). \"Medically fragile\" may be considered a classification of patients within MSN populations that often include the very elderly and bedridden who are totally dependent (Lapolla et al 2003). Medically fragile patients are becoming much more common in nursing homes (Prats 2003) and are present in hospice settings. At the same time, medically fragile patients simultaneously include those who have difficulty swallowing; those requiring electrical equipment to sustain life; insulin-dependent diabetics who are unable to monitor their own blood sugar or self-inject; those requiring continuous IV therapy; and individuals with critical medications and labs requiring daily monitoring (Lapolla et al 2003). Individuals with disabilities also comprise much of the MSN population. In general, disability types include (1) Sensory, including the blind, deaf, or individuals with varying levels of loss of sight or hearing; (2) Mobility: those with limited stamina, or who use mobility aids such as a cane, wheelchair, walker, scooter, or crutches; e.g., individuals with Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis or Muscular Dystrophy (3) Mental: including the mentally ill, developmentally disabled (e.g., Autism), those with traumatic brain injury, and learning or cognitive disability; and (4) Medical: renal dialysis patients, diabetics, oxygen or respiratordependent (USFA EMI 2003, US DOJ 2004. As with the elderly, not all disabled individuals have immediate medical needs, but may simply have special needs. Many disabled can function well on their own or with basic support (ibid). However, anyone with a disabling condition listed above that requires immediate medical attention or supervision at the onset of a disaster could be considered an MSN patient. Of note, according to 2000 Census data, over twenty percent of residents in Louisiana aged 5 years and older had some type of disability, including physical, employment (preventing them from working), mobility, mental, sensory and self care disabilities, respectively (St. Bernard Parish Health Profile 2004). Disability rates for elderly Louisiana residents far exceeded those of younger residents, while over twenty percent of Louisiana households had at least one child with a special health care need (ibid). Such statistics underscore the importance of special needs and MSN patient disaster planning in Louisiana. Providing even more overlap, disabled residents have higher rates of chronic medical conditions, emergency room visits and \"hospitalization for a primary disabling condition (ibid).\" As discussed, chronic conditions were some of the most commonly reported emergency medical problems reported in field hospitals and hurricane shelters immediately following Hurricane Katrina (CDC MMWR 2006 and others). Similar to CTN individuals, which were discussed under \"vulnerable\" populations, transportation for individuals with disabilities can be likewise disrupted. This may be due to overcrowding, blocked streets or sidewalks, or systems that are closed on account of the impending storm, rather than a lack of resources (USDOJ 2004). Many people with disabilities cannot use usual modes of transportation, but instead require lift-equipped school or transit buses (ibid). In summary, MSN patients may include a wide range of individuals who will need access to medical professionals immediately during and following a disaster, or they risk injury or death. MSN populations require immediate medical attention or supervision, medicines, access to equipment, or other resources in a disaster and may be comprised of many overlapping categories of individuals. These include hospital, nursing home or hospice patients; the physically or mentally disabled; medically-dependent individuals requiring life-sustaining equipment, medicines or varying levels of care; frail elderly; and those with chronic medical conditions. Special needs and vulnerable populations are often the first to add to the MSN population in the case of a large-scale event when their usual support network has been disrupted (USFA EMI 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Evacuate or Shelter in Place? Patients Face Life-or-Death Decisions", "text": "Both evacuation and sheltering in place carry inherent risks for patients with special medical needs during hurricanes (ibid, Dosa et al 2007, Bridges and Garcie 2006, GOHSEP 2005, DOJ CRD/DRS 2004, Lapolla 2003, Prats 2003. Successful hurricane evacuations require careful planning and sufficient time before the onset of tropical storm force winds, rain and congested roadways. Evacuation is costly and highly dependant on well-trained staff, available transportation and supplies (Dosa et al 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006, Bascetta/GAO 2006. Each of these pieces is crucial for a successful evacuation; none can be missing or the entire operation may fail. Yet, there are nearly insurmountable challenges facing facility mangers in each of these aspects of an evacuation (DHHS/ OIG 2006, Cutter 2006. Evacuation risks include long commutes, heat exposure, temporary dehydration, injury, lack of immediate access to medical care or medicines, lack of appropriate levels of care in transit or at receiving facilities, and stress, among many others (ibid, Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Klein and Nagel 2007, Mutter and R'id 2007, Kuba et al 2004. Sheltering in place presents another set of risks, as hurricanes can rapidly intensify, shift in track, or cause a host of other unanticipated problems (Keim/SRCC 2007, NOAA 2007b. Tornadoes and extreme rainfall often accompany hurricanes (ibid), followed by downed trees and power lines which may block access routes and disrupt electrical utilities, water supply and communication. In coastal Louisiana, levee breaches or hazardous chemical releases may also result , Pardue et al 2005. Low elevations and other coastal factors expose facilities to serious flooding, and few have been designed to withstand high winds (LSU HC 2007, Levitan pers comm 2007. As an example, most nursing homes in coastal Louisiana are one-story buildings built decades ago (ibid). Similar to coastal Louisiana residences, even if constructed to the most conservative building codes of the time, these structures would not likely be safe or able to withstand hurricane force winds, because such stringent standards were not required at that time (ibid). Safe shelter spaces are generally limited to halls without windows (unless hurricane rated) and between secure fire-protected doors or within secondary barriers (unless doors are hurricane rated). Safety is dependant on factors such as a continuous loadpath (a building designed or mitigated to withstand wind forces as a complete unit, from the roof to the floor) and other factors which are sometimes not easily confirmed or reasonably expected (ibid). In short, most nursing homes and other one-story residential structures in coastal Louisiana will provide little if any protection from high wind events such as tornadoes, and are not likely to fare much better during hurricanes. MSN patients sheltering in place may suffer injury, heat exposure, dehydration, lack of caregivers or appropriate medical care, isolation, non-functioning medical equipment, and stress (Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert, 2007, Mutter and R'id 2007, Fernandez et al 2002. In extreme cases, storm injuries or death may result from drowning, lack of basic needs (e.g., water or food) or untreated medical conditions when emergency responders can not reach them (ibid)."}, {"section_title": "Current Hurricane Risks to Coastal Louisiana MSN Facilities and Residences", "text": "Hurricanes cause a wide range of public health impacts that most seriously affect MSN populations within the community. Louisiana facilities and residences, particularly in the southern-most parishes, are now faced with daunting hurricane risks from even minor hurricanes. There are over 560 hospitals and nursing homes in the state of Louisiana (LA DHH 2007a, Louisiana GIS Digital Map 2007. Approximately 305 -over half -are located in the twenty-six coastal Louisiana parishes that have some portion of land south of interstates I-10 and I-12 (ibid, listed in Appendix B). These estimates exclude hundreds more facilities and residences dotting the coastal communities that may house MSN individuals who are physically or mentally disabled, medically dependent or elderly (ibid, HRSA 2007, US Census Bureau 2000. As previously discussed, health risks to MSN patients are high during hurricane disasters; additional factors increase the overall hurricane risks to coastal Louisiana facilities and residences. Examples of coastal hurricane risk factors are prevalent in recent history, even prior to 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. New Orleans had already been enduring rainfall events and minor storms that were resulting in major floods, including the floods of 1995of , 2001 Storm Allison (that flooded Houston and New Orleans, to a lesser extent), and tropical storm Isidore in 2002 (Robbins/SRCC 2004). Post-Katrina storm surge models now predict serious coastal flooding in some areas of New Orleans and the Louisiana coast beginning at Category 1 and 2 storm levels (NOAA SLOSH Display Program, version 1.4.3, May 9, 2007). Storm surge is defined as a \"large dome of water, 50 to 100 miles wide, that sweeps across the coastline near where a hurricane makes landfall. ...The level of surge in a particular area is primarily related to the intensity of the hurricane and slope of the continental shelf (NOAA 1999, p. 13).\" Land loss and other coastal changes in Louisiana have substantially increased the hurricane and flood risk to coastal communities over time (van Heerden/CCEER 2004). Estimates range from approximately forty (Barras/USGS 2006) to one hundred acres of wetland loss per day (van Heerden/CCEER 2004) 2 . Outer defenses to hurricane wind and surge are also damaged by extreme storm events, as demonstrated most recently by once-Category five hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, resulting in significant erosion to the protective barrier islands and already fragmented Louisiana marsh (Barras/USGS 2006). USGS estimates indicated over two hundred square miles of marsh were converted to open water in coastal Louisiana on account of both storms (ibid). Both storms retained their Cat 5 storm surge effects even though making landfall in Louisiana as lower order storms (Levitan pers comm 2007). Meanwhile, the coastal parishes of Louisiana are located over a subsiding basin with a series of natural geologic faults (   (Murray 1961, from Cazes 2004. Fault scarps can be better visualized with LIDAR elevation data (Binselam and van Heerden 2004) to demonstrate the quick drop-off in elevation south of the interstates in coastal Louisiana. The cumulative effects of wetland and barrier island loss over the past century, made worse by man-made canals and other factors, are likely the primarily culprit bringing hurricanes 'closer in' to the coast with each passing season (van Heerden 1994, van Heerden and Bryan 2006. Although the specific metrics vary, every healthy mile of wetland will reduce hurricane storm surge and wind speed to some degree (ibid). One estimate is that for every approximate 2.7 miles of healthy wetland, one foot of hurricane storm surge reduction will be realized (van Heerden et al 2006, p. 107). Added to wetland loss and a dynamically changing landscape, Louisiana's coastal residents are exposed to relatively rapid sea level rise (van Heerden pers comm 2007); increased coastal populations and development; continuing industrial, oil and gas expansion; and the uncertain future of levee repairs and rebuilding which have become requisite to protecting their communities."}, {"section_title": "Lost in Translation: Bridging Science and Technology to MSN Decision-Makers in an Emergency", "text": "Given the health considerations and heightened hurricane risk in coastal Louisiana, an important facet of evacuation and sheltering planning for MSN patients emerges: identifying who makes the decisions to go or stay in a hurricane emergency. Once identified, further questions become: Are coastal Louisiana MSN decision-makers aware of the extent of hurricane risks to their facilities? Furthermore, are they able to access the latest science and technology, including developments in hurricane models or GIS mapping?"}, {"section_title": "MSN Decision-Makers", "text": "Some aspects of hurricane evacuation and sheltering decisions are coordinated, and to an extent decided, between local, state and possibly Federal emergency management agencies and officials. For example, decisions made on the local or state emergency management level include whether or not to recommend or call for evacuation of a risk area, and how an evacuation will be timed and executed (LA DHH 2007c). Yet, notwithstanding communication problems (e.g., the inability of a nursing home to contact local emergency management or the state health agency), miscommunication/ misunderstandings, or lack of resources (e.g. transportation assets), the ability to enforce an evacuation order remains elusive and subject to debate. In short, hospitals, nursing homes and other MSN facility managers and residents cannot be physically forced to leave an area. While some entities may be sanctioned or censured for not complying with an evacuation order; technically, all have the prerogative to shelter in place if they decide this to be in their patient(s) best interests (ibid, Hebert 2007, Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007). Therefore, local MSN facilities and residents play a significant role in determining their own risk, and also in deciding whether or not they will evacuate a risk area for a given storm. In reality, beyond individual MSN residents, those entrusted to make decisions regarding the care of medically vulnerable patients in a hurricane situation will include hospital directors and officials/CEOs, local nursing home administrators, facility owners, home health agency officials, family members, and on-site medical support personnel such as nurses and other caregivers (Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Kirkpatrick and Bryan 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006. These men and women rely heavily on information assets such as the damage history of their facility; combined experience; their local, regional and state emergency managers; sister or parent facilities; facility owners; the media; and particularly the individualized needs and potential for risk to their patients when they decide to evacuate or shelter in place (ibid). There is anecdotal evidence that family members of MSN patients weigh their decisions heavily on the media and on potential medical risks to moving or relocating their family members (Mutter andR'id 2007, Callimachi 2006). Assisting with the immediate implementation of hurricane emergency plans may be other staff, maintenance personnel, patient and staff family members, members from the community who show up at the facility, and other volunteers (Nursing Home Administrators pers comm, Butcher pers comm 2006). In summary, in the majority of cases, MSN decision-makers may actually be comprised of MSN patients themselves, as well as nursing home administrators, family members, and the many other non-governmental, non-emergency management local residents listed above."}, {"section_title": "Accessing Hurricane Research and Models", "text": "Perhaps surprisingly, even after the 2005 hurricanes, some administrators of hospitals and nursing homes have still indicated that they \"generally see evacuation as a last resort\" (Bascetta/GAO 2006, p. 5). During recent hurricanes along the US Gulf Coast, local MSN decision-makers have chosen to shelter in place rather than evacuate for a number of reasons. These are discussed in further detail in section 3.1.1; however, in one example, a nursing home administrator explained: \"\u2026the facility structure was sound enough to withstand expected winds, location limited the degree of expected flooding, staff were proficient in emergency response and willing to shelter in place with residents, the community was likely to augment facility resources, and the poor condition of residents made travel dangerous\u2026 (US DHHS/ OIG 2006, p. 9)\" Added to this were negative past experiences with evacuation (ibid). Numerous other factors appear to weigh in to decisions to evacuate or shelter in place as previously described; but the latest hurricane models and up-to-date, facility-specific information on physical hurricane or flood risks do not appear to be a deciding factor. In the case of St. Rita's nursing home in St. Bernard, a well-known example in Louisiana, thirty-five nursing home patients lost their lives and administrators were subject to a criminal investigation. They were adamant that the facility 'had not flooded in twenty years' (Parker/USA Today 2006). This indicates some reliance on past experience but points to no other reference such as the latest hurricane data, research or models. St. Rita's was but one of a number of area nursing homes in the area that did not evacuate. The fact that they sheltered in place there with extended family, including grandchildren (CNN 2006), may support the conclusion that based on experience and all other information at their disposal, they did not perceive Hurricane Katrina to pose a serious threat. Similarly, high numbers of hospital deaths under separate investigation in New Orleans appear to have resulted from complicating factors post-storm, such as flooding, loss of utilities, extreme temperatures, and general medical conditions that staff were not able to treat in the deteriorating conditions (e.g., Gray and Hebert 2007). However, while reports are conflicting, there is no evidence that any of the hospitals in the greater metropolitan New Orleans area fully evacuated for Hurricane Katrina (ibid, LA DHH 2007b). Catastrophic hurricane plans for Louisiana (drafted during the Hurricane Pam exercise of 2004) indicated that hospitals had planned to shelter in place at reduced capacity for even the most severe hurricanes, but would have enough resources on hand, including generator power, to shelter patients in place for up to seven days. This was based on the estimated time search and rescue planners felt they could get to hospitals in flooded conditions to replenish their supplies (IEM 2004). In both cases, as well as in cases where MSN residents decided to ride out the storm in their homes, levee breach or perhaps a delay in emergency response on some levels, may be argued as the primary reason plans for sheltering in place failed for this specific event. However, the increasing hurricane vulnerability to coastal Louisiana and New Orleans -including surge and wave stress on the levees during hurricanes with the potential for overtopping -had been discussed in academic research for years. Why didn't the science appear to weigh into evacuation decisions? Scientific data had been presented years earlier on topics ranging from storm surge risk (e.g., Suhayda, van Heerden andothers, various academic presentations 2003-2005) to the hurricane \"funnel\" created by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (Mashriqui 2004) to the potential filling of the New Orleans \"bowl\" from the \"Big One\" (e.g., \"Drowning New Orleans,\" Scientific American 2001). However, except for a few articles or special features, most notably, in the Times Picayune (e.g. the 'Washing Away' series by Schleifstein/McQuaid) and documentaries (e.g. NOVA in 2004), the hurricane risk which researchers were discussing does not appear to have been adequately conveyed, or received by the MSN community. Regardless of the eventual levee breaches, or other substantial problems faced by facility administrators or residents preventing them from evacuating (e.g., lack of transportation assets, a serious issue (DOT/DHS 2007, Dosa et al 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006, Bascetta/GAO 2006, the scientific data and hurricane research does not appear to have influenced local MSN decision-makers, or their perceived level of threat from a hurricane, enough to counter the risks they had calculated or associated with evacuation. In summary, there is evidence that local MSN decision-makers rely heavily on various information assets when contemplating hurricane evacuation vs. sheltering in place (Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Kirkpatrick and Bryan 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006 Administrators pers comm, Butcher pers comm 2006, LA DHH 2007c. However, there is little evidence to suggest that the latest hurricane research, science, or technologies, including storm surge models or GIS modeling, weigh in to MSN decision-making on the local or individual level. Of note, numerous decision-makers have indicated that they receive \"very little assistance in making decisions related to evacuation\u2026\" from emergency response agencies, and feel that in some respects, they are left \"entirely on their own (Dosa et al 2007, Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007.\""}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2 OBJECTIVES", "text": "The objectives of the study included four major research components. These were to: 1. Identify the risks associated with MSN evacuation vs. sheltering in place; 2. Determine current hurricane risks to coastal Louisiana MSN facilities and residences, and the threshold storm events which would prompt their evacuation. For this preliminary study, hurricane risks included mainly storm surge and wind; 3. Incorporate the latest hurricane research and models into a GIS environment; and 4. Explore ways to clearly communicate and visualize the current science to MSN decision-makers. The key research question was: Can any MSN patient shelter safely in coastal Louisiana for any level of hurricane? Or, phrased differently: Are there any areas of relative safety in coastal Louisiana, south of interstates I-10 and I-12, where MSN sheltering in place would be a \"low-risk\" or conservative option for lower order storms? Such a determination could be very useful towards MSN planning in coastal Louisiana given the health risks and costs to evacuate and operate alternate sheltering facilities. This would apply not only to the hundreds of patients from each hospital or nursing home, but to the many others in private residences and other MSN facilities. Research outcomes could potentially reduce health risks and human suffering of patients by identifying any sites that could safely shelter in coastal Louisiana and forego the risks and disruptions of hurricane evacuation."}, {"section_title": "Identify Risks: MSN Evacuation vs. Sheltering", "text": "The first objective of the study was to assess and compare the health risks of MSN patient evacuation vs. sheltering in place for hurricanes in coastal Louisiana. This was necessary to provide a greater understanding of the complexity of issues involved in both decisions, in whether to go or stay. This prompted a secondary question as well, in why MSN patients did not evacuate the risk area as Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans. A literature review commenced to identify the health risks faced by MSN patients and their caretakers during hurricane emergencies, as well as to understand their decision processes. Both were integral to answering the research question."}, {"section_title": "Determine Threshold Storm Events: Can Anyone Shelter Safely in Coastal Louisiana for Hurricanes?", "text": "A threshold storm event for this study was conceptualized as: flood and wind levels unsafe for MSN patient sheltering in place, without substantial mitigation measures taking place, such that MSN patients would be recommended to evacuate. Threshold events as determined by this study accounted only for hurricane storm surge and wind risks; they did not take into consideration other important information that MSN decision-makers would need to know, such as available personnel resources, transportation assets, supply issues, and patient vulnerability. The second study objective was to determine threshold hurricane events that would trigger MSN evacuation in coastal Louisiana. This could allow for priority levels to be assigned to the evacuation of facilities, and indicate to decision-makers which structures would be most vulnerable during certain events. With added MSN GIS data, meeting this second objective could also provide tabulated census counts of facilities and patients for MSN planning and response."}, {"section_title": "Incorporate Hurricane Research and Models into a GIS", "text": "The third research objective was to review the state of hurricane research and technology, including current models in use and available data, and to integrate the best and most relevant into a GIS environment.

Time or resource constraints may also prevent their access of physical hurricane risk models or research. Once threshold storm events were determined and supported in a GIS, methods were sought to clearly communicate and share project outcomes with MSN decision-makers. Access to similar planning tools ahead of time can better prepare decision makers to view facility or residence-specific information; to be informed of what they can reasonably expect from hurricane surge and wind; and to use this information to review time schedules and hurricane emergency plans.

For example, some evacuating nursing homes experienced \"host facilities [that] were unavailable or inadequately prepared\" (US DHHS/OIG 2006, p. ii), had \"substantial difficulty in transporting frail residents (Dosa et al 2007),\" and found that \"\u2026placing residents in alternative shelters not designed for the care of elderly and disabled posed particular challenges\" including \"problems with supplies;\" not having enough beds or appropriate beds; and not having rooms that locked to protect Alzheimer's patients from wandering (US DHHS/ OIG 2006, p. 13), as well as inadequate staffing (Dosa et al 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Risks in Sheltering in Place During Hurricanes", "text": "As introduced earlier in section 1.3, sheltering in place presents a separate set of risks in coastal Louisiana. These can be quite severe as hurricanes can rapidly intensify, shift in track, or cause a host of other unanticipated problems (Keim/SRCC 2007, NOAA 2007b Perhaps related to mental health aspects of disaster, some family members say their families had died \"of broken hearts;\" \"stress;\" \"sadness;\" or \"worry;\" from losing their homes and belongings, and seeing their neighborhoods destroyed (ibid).  Hebert 2007. Kuba et al 2004). Flooding in a nearby VA hospitals and Tulane University Hospital were disrupted by shorted out elevators, requiring medical and support staff to carry bedridden, oxygen and IV medicated patients up and down stairwells or into boats, at times needing to be moved with \"500-pound heart-pumps\" as well as \"bariatric 4 surgery patients weighing over 600 lbs (ibid, 290-292).\" Notwithstanding patient and caretaker stress, the potential for injury and lack of adequate medical care become apparent. For example, Houston shelter residents who had been evacuated from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina were asked in the Brodie et al study (2006) the reasons they did not evacuate. Their answers primarily included, \"lack of transportation\" and \"underestimation of the storm (ibid).\" In addition, 12% listed \"being physically unable to leave\" or \"having to care for someone who was physically unable to leave as the main reason they stayed behind (ibid),\" indicating medical issues may have been a substantial determining factor.  OIG 2006). This is discussed further in section 3.1.3.2. Economic hardship or lack of resources has also often been cited as a factor hindering evacuation (Beggs et al 2004, Cutter 2006. In one example, residents surveyed following Katrina indicated that they had not left the risk area because they did not have enough room in the car for everyone (Eisenman et al 2007). In another example, the loss of caregivers -who must evacuate with their own families -may make it difficult for MSN patients to evacuate on their own (Kirkpatrick and Bryan 2007). Meanwhile, emergency medical personnel and managers have documented cases of MSN patients that were dropped off, or who came in on their own to hospitals, nursing home facilities, or special needs shelters shortly before hurricane landfall (Kosak pers comm. 2007, McConnaughey/AP 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007, Prats 2003. Many of these facilities are considered hurricane \"refuges\" by the general public (Gray and Hebert 2007, p. 285), such that individuals from the community are \"admitted secondary to the storm for weather\" e.g., \"\u2026Because hospitals are some of the strongest buildings in the city, doctors often have had fragile patients admitted when a hurricane approaches, rather than trying to have them evacuated (McConnaughey/AP 2007).\" Federal reports such as Bascetta/GAO 2006, which focused mainly on transportation issues associated with vulnerable populations, and the US Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Homeland Security (DHS) 2007 \"Catastrophic Hurricane Evacuation Plan Evaluation,\" both concede that evacuation travel can take much longer than expected, particularly in procuring transportation and loading medical patients. That evacuees may face daunting traffic and associated health risks is well supported by these sources and disaster researchers such as Susan Cutter (2006) who has worked extensively with vulnerable populations, transportation and evacuation issues. \"Shadow evacuation\" is a term used to describe an evacuation plan or strategy that has been overwhelmed by evacuations from less-vulnerable areas, congesting the roadways to a near stand still (ibid). This has happened in recent storms such as Hugo in South Carolina and Hurricane Rita in Texas. In the latter, an estimated 2.7 million people evacuated the Houston/Galveston Region; yet the evacuation needs of the population were almost double that of the planning and accommodations that had been planned for (an estimated 1.2 million, according to Wells/M2MEDIA360 2006). The situation was described as follows: \"The result was a massive jam of slow-moving traffic with routes choked by voluntary evacuees who impeded the progress of those attempting to leave the storm-surge zone under mandatory evacuation orders\u2026 Texas had recently received 470,000 evacuees from Louisiana\u2026 In some instances, the trips were painfully long, as shelters filled, and evacuation busses were diverted further inland only to be redirected again at their next destination (ibid, p.1)\" After communication issues, sheltering and transportation were the main areas updated plans to ensure adequate transportation assets; transportation to move patients between shelters; and a better tracking system for evacuees -particularly if evacuated out-of-state (ibid). According to the state report, operations during the 2005 hurricanes were also hindered by an inability to effectively credential support staff and supply vendors in Louisiana (ibid), which likely constrained rescue and effective medical response to a certain degree. The procurement of emergency generators to power shelters and to serve special needs populations was an additional recommendation of the report (ibid)."}, {"section_title": "Fragile Health and Medical Issues", "text": "Not surprisingly, complications from medical issues are another major factor that prevent residents from evacuating during hurricanes. From the Eisenman survey (2007) of Hurricane Katrina evacuees in Houston, some residents indicated not being healthy enough to drive very far; that they were on medication that hindered their ability to drive; or expressed inability to make the trip. Additional questions may be raised with the discharge of patients by hospitals before hurricane landfall Hebert 2007, Kuba et al 2004); that this does not provide much time for planning and executing an evacuation on already congested roads, especially for those recovering from a medical stay or those who are elderly. Mutter and R'id 2007 provide evidence of medical reasons prompting elderly MSN residents to shelter in place. One resident was \"just out of the hospital and couldn't go to a shelter.\" Others had complications from surgery, poor eyesight, Dementia and Alzheimer's."}, {"section_title": "Underestimation of the Storm Threat", "text": "There is evidence that some MSN residents are not convinced of hurricane risks when they decide to shelter in place during hurricanes. As previously discussed, \"underestimation of the storm\" was one of the main reasons residents did not evacuate based on the Brodie et al survey (2006). Meanwhile, of over a hundred nursing home administrators in the coastal Louisiana parishes south of the interstates, only 19 facilities appear to have evacuated prior to Hurricane Katrina for an incoming Category 5 hurricane (LA DHH 2007b)."}, {"section_title": "Confusion and Fear", "text": "Eisenman et al (2007) again add insights from the Hurricane Katrina evacuation perspective, such as residents who did not receive information from emergency management on where they should go; getting mixed messages on whether they should go or stay; expressing fear of leaving their homes because of robbery or looting; or decided to shelter in place after hearing media reports of people getting injured in highway accidents and running out of gas. In other anecdotal evidence from Mutter and R'id (2007), some residents had just remodeled and were \"afraid of looters\" so they decided to ride out the hurricane. Communication issues were a major problem cited in state after action reports (US DHS & LA GOHSEP 2006). Work by Edson et al (2007) includes, \"A Systems Analysis of Special-Needs Population Evacuation during Catastrophic Events\" demonstrating in many cases how much differently execution in the Hurricane events of 2005 differed from plans as designed."}, {"section_title": "Resignation, Stubbornness or Unexplainable Factors", "text": "In yet other cases, reasons that potential MSN patients such as the elderly refused to evacuate, as described by friends and family members, were difficult to comprehend. Their explanations varied from impressions of stubbornness, apathy, denial, an unwillingness to step outside of comfort levels, shock, or resignation (Mutter andR'id 2007, Gibson andHayunga 2006, and other anecdotal evidence and accounts). It has been suggested by the initial data that elderly populations were disproportionately affected by the Hurricane Katrina event, and that elderly have age-associated medical special needs as well as disabilities. In addition, a research report prepared by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Public Policy Institute (PPI) by Gibson and Hayunga 2006, \"We Can Do Better: Lessons Learned for Protecting Older Persons in Disasters\" discovered that older residents who live independently or in larger households may generally find evacuation to be a hassle, a long trip and not suited to their needs (e.g., maneuvering an information point or rest area). They also fear being an undue burden on their families (Gibson and Hayunga 2006), and for these and many other reason may decide to shelter in place (Mutter and R'id 2007). Michael Weston, Director of Emergency Field Operations for the U.S. Administration on Aging perceives that the overwhelming inconvenience of the ordeal may cause elderly to rationalize staying through storms. In ensuring actionable plans for the evacuation of seniors, he advises: \"Many older adults feel they are ready 'if it's their time to go.' One strategy is to remind them that if it is not \"quite\" their time; they could be in for several weeks of misery while waiting for help (Gibson and Hayunga 2006, p 65).\" Additionally, some elderly indicated they had \"lived through Betsy in 1965 (Mutter and R'id 2007).\" Others did not want to leave the homes their families had built \"with their own hands (ibid);\" Some simply said \"I'm too old for this;\" \"It's in God's hands;\" \"You go on, we've lived our lives;\" and \"Whatever happens, we'll go together (ibid).\" Many did not want to leave their husbands or families (ibid)."}, {"section_title": "Factors Dominating MSN Decision-making", "text": "It has been determined that there are health risks to both evacuation and sheltering in place for MSN patients, and that MSN patients may remain in a risk area for reasons ranging from transportation availability to inconvenience. Questions necessary follow as to what decision processes MSN decision-makers apply when they weigh their hurricane health risks, and which are the over-riding factors that dominate their decisions to evacuate or shelter in place. To answer this question, it is important to review briefly that, as discussed in section 1.5.1, MSN decision makers may include hospital CEOs, nursing home administrators, parent or sister facilities, facility owners, nurses, staff, maintenance personnel, and others (Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Kirkpatrick and Bryan 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006. The public living in households or group residences and requiring varying levels of medical support and care are also decision-makers, as they must weigh the risks of evacuation and sheltering in place during hurricanes as well (Kirkpatrick andBryan 2007, Fernandez et al 2002). Additionally, it should be re-iterated that MSN facilities and residents may not have the capabilities to be in close communication with emergency management at all times. MSN decision-makers may evaluate their hurricane risk by other available sources (e.g., from past experience or the media, and other factors besides physical hurricane risks); will consider heavily the health risk to move a patient or loved one and available resources; and will determine which immediate actions they will take (Dosa et al 2007, Gray and Hebert 2007, Kirkpatrick and Bryan 2007, DHHS/OIG 2006. Thus, the decisions they make may be in direct conflict with the hurricane information and evacuation strategies of local emergency management and police. Finally, it should again be noted that in most Gulf States including Louisiana, local emergency managers, officials and the Governor can issue voluntary and mandatory evacuations. However, there is currently no mechanism to enforce an evacuation of a nursing home, hospital, private facility or residence other than, in some cases, to impose sanctions or penalties for violations such as deficiencies or fines on a facility (LA DHH 2007c, Gray and Hebert 2007, Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Hospitals Vulnerabilities in a Hurricane Emergency", "text": "Decision strategies of hospital administrators related to evacuation are based on factors which are unique to their facilities and patients. Hospital vulnerabilities in an emergency however are numerous and appear to weigh heavily into evacuation and sheltering decisions. Of import to this study, there are indications that the hospitals that experienced high mortality during Katrina differed from most other hospitals in one major aspect: they had nontraditional medical units on site including hospice and \"long-term-acute care\" patients who may have been seriously ill Hebert 2007. Kuba et al 2004). Therefore, the types of patients and their critical medical status may introduce the single largest vulnerability. Custodial institutions such as hospitals will often discharge ambulatory and stable patients ahead of a storm in anticipation of a surge of new patients, including nursing home patients and people who will come in from the community (Gray and Hebert 2007). As already mentioned, from the community perspective, both nursing homes and hospitals may still be viewed as \"refuges\" and the place to take or drop of MSN patients and family before hurricane landfall (ibid, p. 285, Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007). This is particularly true if the facility has held up well through past storms (ibid). Hospitals in a risk area therefore run the risk of exceeding patient capacity even before hurricane landfall (see also, Appendix C). However, the remaining hospital patients are generally not stable enough or able to be easily moved (ibid). Many hospital patients cannot be discharged prior to a storm and evacuated without significant planning and time, such as those \"recovering from surgery or debilitated by disease;\" those \"dependant on medical assistance to breathe\u2026 demented patients, newborn babies\" and others, including hospital patients \"requiring dialysis and those transferred from nursing homes (Gray and Hebert 2007, p. 285).\" Some detailed analyses of hurricane performance have been conducted on major Louisiana hospitals (e.g., Gregg 2006 on  \"At Charity Hospital\u2026I and nearly 60 other staff doctors, nurses, and residents were stuck in a hospital without electricity, without water, without food, for five days with about 340 patients, 50 of them critically ill. We had no ability to use ventilators, so we had to squeeze ambu bags by hand to get air into their lungs. We had no monitoring equipment, no X-ray, no laboratory, no dialysis. Compounding all this, we were unable to have families at the bedside -or even available by phone -to participate in treatment decisions for the sickest patients. It was very, very difficult (Haber/AP 2006).\""}, {"section_title": "Nursing Home Vulnerabilities in a Hurricane Emergency", "text": "An important Federal study of \"Nursing Home Emergency Preparedness and Response  2006, p. 10).\" Many had prior contracts with transportation that fell through \"days or hours\" before evacuation when vehicles were needed by other facilities more likely to be directly affected by the hurricane (ibid). In some cases, \"\u2026multiple nursing homes contracted with the same companies, typically the company used for routine ambulance services (ibid, p. 10).\" Travelers were be exposed to high temperatures in traffic and depletion of supplies such as adequate water, while medical or \"medication needs\" complicated travel such as not being \"readily available during transit\" or \"improperly packed and supervised (ibid, p. 10-11).\" During some nursing home evacuations there was an identified need to \"prevent residents from inappropriately exchanging medications (ibid, p. 11)\". Dosa et al (2007) identified even more problems ranging from difficulty in transporting frail residents to inadequate staffing. Findings released on a Federal-state survey of nursing homes in coastal Louisiana in 2006 for issues such as staffing, emergency power and supplies were summarized in the press as \"most\u2026homes had neither an adequate way to move patients out of harm's way nor a suitable place to put them once they got there\" (Shuler/Baton Rouge Advocate, Nov 2006). Later hurricane shelter suitability surveys and briefings however reported substantial progress in these areas (US DHHS/LSU HC 2007, LA DHH 2007b). Nursing home vulnerabilities specific to Louisiana in hurricane emergencies were discussed in detail by Prats 2003, \"Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Application in Evaluating Nursing Home Emergency Preparedness Plans in Louisiana,\" as referenced throughout this study. As previously discussed, she identified major problems with topics ranging from moving critical care patients in an evacuation to accommodating nursing home patients in state shelters. Her study focused specifically on Louisiana nursing homes and their preparedness plans, outlining methods to resolve the multiple criteria that must be arranged and prioritized within a meaningful framework to make better decisions on all levels regarding nursing homes. Prats identified the need to resolve the many agency and organizational disputes, both laterally, horizontally ands inter-agency, which seemed to put nursing home evacuation plans at odds when agencies viewed their directives or goals as mutually exclusive. Kuba et al (2004) \"Elderly Populations in Disasters: Recounting Evacuation Processes from Two Skilled-Care Facilities in Central Florida, Fernandez et al (2002) \"Frail Elderly as Disaster Victims: Emergency Management Strategies\" were some of the major sources for identifying evacuation risks to elderly throughout the current study."}, {"section_title": "Elderly Vulnerabilities in a Hurricane Emergency", "text": "In addition to the factors that may have hindered MSN elderly evacuations as discussed in section 3.1.2, elderly may have sensory impairments, mobility disabilities, and potential language or cultural barriers (USFA EMI 2003, p.1.9). The elderly are often \"more susceptible to heat and cold, creating potential crisis situations when air conditioning and heat are not available;\" often have \"memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's or senility;\" and may be at risk of \"transfer trauma if they are forced to leave their homes (ibid).\" Many studies have shown that dislocation without care can cause illness and even death in senior citizens (ibid).\" The elderly may experience dementia, delayed response syndrome (slow response in a crisis and poor understanding of impending danger), and fear of institutionalization (being transferred to a nursing home) when emergency responders attempt to assist them in a rescue situation (Missouri SEMA 2007). According to a 2005 US Census Bureau survey, nearly half (46.6 percent) of the household population 65 years and over in Louisiana had some form of disability. 5 Recent studies at LSU have shown that the longer an individual has lived in New Orleans, the less likely they are to leave (Beggs et al 2004). Although no clear relationship was supported, preliminary data suggests that the likelihood of evacuation declines with age (ibid). Brodie et al (2006) also present evidence that low-income, minority households with elderly or disabled residents are less likely to evacuate than other households. Specific to the elderly, surveys also indicated older residents that had made it through Betsy and Camille weren't evacuating, or had mobility or medical disabilities such that their families would not leave them behind (Beggs et al 2004, Mutter and R'id 2007, Callimachi/AP 2006. As previously discussed, reasons that the elderly refused to evacuate as described by friends and family members ranged from impressions of stubbornness, apathy, denial, an unwillingness to step outside of comfort levels, shock, and resignation (Mutter and R'id 2007). Taken in combination with section 3.1.2.4, these various explanations finally begin to make sense of why so many MSN elderly appear to have remained in the risk area during Hurricane Katrina, and why so many did not evacuate."}, {"section_title": "Disabled and Other MSN Patient Vulnerabilities in a Hurricane Emergency", "text": "MSN disabled become most vulnerable in hurricane emergencies when evacuation and sheltering systems cannot accommodate the diversity of their needs. Deal et al 2006, in \"Challenges and Opportunities of Nursing Care in Special-Needs Shelters,\" outline the care given to a wide spectrum of individuals including nursing home patients, people with mental retardation and long term physical disabilities, and those who had lost their homes (ibid). Major problems encountered included \"unavailability of medications, treatment and ancillary supplies,\" and identifying patients, as well as privacy, confidentiality, and other management concerns (ibid, 102). Medically fragile residents who depend on family members for care are subject to the resource and medical information limitations of that household in a hurricane emergency. Critical medical decisions also appear often times to be made on an emotional level (e.g., family members will shelter in place to care for medically fragile loved ones). Among the examples of Hurricane Katrina and medically fragile patients who did not or could not evacuate, one story details a son who had decided to remain in New Orleans to care for his elderly mother. She had \"broken her hip in 2000, was bedridden and had a feeding tube attached to her stomach. Because of her fragile health, her son thought it would be imprudent to move her when the city called for a mandatory evacuation, one day before the storm made landfall\u2026 (Callimachi, 2006)\" This MSN patient was ultimately exposed to heat and dehydration and later died before rescuers or medical support could retrieve her from the Convention Center. MSN patients, particularly the immuno-compromised, are almost certainly exposed to increased health risks in shelter environments (Diaz 2003-07 warned specifically of his concern for shelters due to their risk levels for infectious disease. He indicated, \"The problem is not going to be from New Orleans, it's going to be from the shelters\" where \"contagious disease\" risks are \"considerable (Barclay 2005).\" One of the other major problems he indicated were that shelter residents experienced a loss of their individual health support systems (ibid). Many sheltering in place are thus destined to become additional MSN patients. As previously discussed, MSN patients with chronic health conditions are highly vulnerable in hurricane emergencies when their access to medical care, equipment or medicines is disrupted. Some of the most common reasons for hospital admission immediately following Hurricane Katrina according to the CDC were \"heart disease (26.6%), nondiarrheal gastrointestinal illness (12.3%), mental health conditions (6.7%) and heat-related illness (6.1%) (CDC MMWR 2006a).\" Chronic diseases are being addressed more in the literature (Ford et al 2006, Mokdad et al 2005 as one of the main problems identified in follow-up care after hurricanes. Chronic conditions are common among MSN patients and the elderly as discussed throughout the current study. In review, Houston shelter surveys conducted by Brodie et al 2006 identify that \"\u202641% of all Houston shelter residents reported chronic health conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, or asthma.\" CDC reports also indicate \"\u2026during Sept 1-22, chronic illness (e.g., diabetes, asthma, emphysema, and cardiovascular disease) was the most commonly reported category in evacuation centers (ECs)\u2026(CDC MMWR 2006b).\""}, {"section_title": "Louisiana Policy Initiatives Affecting Medical Special Needs", "text": "In Louisiana, hurricane emergencies are locally managed by parish emergency managers and their partners, including police, fire and EMS. Hurricanes are also centrally managed from the GOHSEP in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which houses many state, federal and The NRP will directly affect the management of MSN evacuation and sheltering whenever it is activated. Technically the NRP is always considered \"in effect\" but the level of coordination is \"flexible and scalable\" depending on the situation (US DHS 2006b, p. 1). The NRP and NIMS are considered \"companion documents,\" in that NIMS provides a \"template for incident management\" at any level, while the ICS can accommodate multiple agency coordination when more than one have jurisdiction in an emergency event (ibid, p. 5). All hurricane emergencies begin by being managed at the local level. When resources or capabilities become overwhelmed, local emergency managers and decision-makers have established protocols in the NRP which they will use to call upon the state and then Federal government as needed for reinforcements. Response is responsible for planning and coordinating \"state-level pre-hospital medical response to disasters;\" supporting \"local response efforts by providing supplemental pre-hospital medical sources (e.g., contracted and mutual aid private and public EMS resources);\" arranging \"for evacuation of the special needs population, hospitals and nursing homes\" and for the \"movement of injured disaster victims to hospitals, SpNS and TMOSAs in areas/regions not impacted by the disaster (Blanco 2006, LA DHH Appendix 9, p.

In addition to these responsibilities, BEMS has been tasked with the deployment and maintenance of medical response equipment and supplies (ibid, A-9).\"  2006). Other changes and initiatives that may impact MSN patients include that \"Elderly residents and those with medical problems will be taken to Union Station [Union Passenger Terminal] and put on Amtrak trains out of the city (ibid).\" Additionally, \"people living in FEMA trailers will be ordered to evacuate whenever a tropical storm with winds above 40 mph approaches the city\" and \"bused evacuees will be able to take their pets if in cages or containers (ibid).\" Of note, special needs registration is being attempted with eligibility based on \"having reliable transportation\" and \"\u2026 [if individuals] cannot afford fuel or hotel costs, or have medical, physical or psychological conditions that could prevent them from evacuating (ibid).\""}, {"section_title": "MSN Initiatives in Other Hurricane-Prone States", "text": "Reviewing briefly MSN initiatives in other hurricane-prone states such as Florida, Texas and North Carolina, it is interesting to note that special needs evacuation lists have been required of many Florida counties for years, with officials updating the lists through networking and relationships with \"aging and health care facilities (Olsen 2005).\" Florida Statutes actually include: Registry of persons with special needs; whereby local emergency management agencies must: \"\u2026maintain a registry of persons with special needs, identify needs and plan for resource allocation to meet those needs\u2026 [and] \u2026to assist the local emergency management agency in identifying such persons, home health agencies, hospices, nurse registries, home medical equipment providers, the Department of Children and Family Services, Department of Health, Agency for Health Care Administration, Department of Education, Agency for Persons with Disabilities, and Department of Elderly Affairs shall provide registration information to all of their special needs clients and to all persons with special needs who receive services. The registry will be updated annually (252.355).\" Florida residents are given the option for pre-authorized entry of search and rescue personnel following disasters. Additionally, emergency and disaster planning provisions provide assistance to persons with disabilities and include the: \"\u2026designation of an emergency coordinating officer, a procedure to contact special needs citizens, registry and dispatch, and essential support services to organizations before, during and after disasters (252.356).\" Florida is also forward-thinking in its adoption of strict building codes. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Florida instituted some of the strongest building codes in the nation for its coastal parishes (Levitan pres comm 2007 prior to Hurricane Rita. These listed residents requiring ambulance transport and in some cases prescription and medical equipment needs (Olsen 2005). Houston designated the city 3-1-1 helpline prior to Hurricane Rita to register anyone needing evacuation assistance (ibid). Currently, Texas is developing a statewide special-needs database entitled the \"Transportation Assistance Registry\" to be shared with local emergency management. Local Emergency Mangers will contact the individual, arrange for transportation to a pick up point, and the state will arrange for their further evacuation location (Wells/M2MEDIA360 2006). 2-1-1 call centers are also being established with individual categories of special medical needs ranging from 1 \"minor and ambulatory\" to 5 -\"severe and requiring life support (ibid).\" Some locals are also taking the initiative to develop their own databases for their areas (Olsen 2005). Louisiana is pursuing similar initiatives with coastal parish pick-up points. Both Texas and Louisiana are developing tracking evacuation systems that may incorporate GIS. In Texas, \"At the departure points, evacuees including their pets, will receive an RFID wristband with a barcode that links them with a record entered into a template by typing the information into a laptop computer or using magnetic card readers and bar code scanners to enter Texas ID cards, drivers' licenses and other forms of state identification (ibid).\" The intent is for real-time data upload and tracking of evacuees. GPS units are a future option being explored to track buses and expected supplies, as well as to geo-code evacuation routes to provide an overall \"operational picture (ibid).\" Following Hurricane Floyd 1999 However, for those who sheltered in place to ride out the storm in coastal Louisiana, the maximum sustained winds realized were likely well over the recorded 87 mph clocked in before measurement instruments snapped for Katrina; and 120 mph for Hurricane Rita, with substantially higher wind gusts for both (Knabb et al 2006, Guidroz, et al 2006.  Boyd 2006). Hurricane Rita soon after delivered a swath of hurricane surge as far inland as Lake Charles and New Iberia in Louisiana, and reflooded parts of New Orleans through as-yet unrepaired hurricane protection structures, with both far-reaching surge and rainfall.

Prior to that, the quality of data obtained by US naval ships or buoys noting storm tracks and pressures by land and sea would have been closely proportional to the distance at which measurements could be taken (Romolo pers comm 2007), with actual intensities \"likely to be drastically underestimated (Landsea 2001(Landsea , p. 2871.\" For example, no Category 4 or 5 storms are recorded to have made landfall in Louisiana according to the dataset for the first half of the century, which is in stark contrast to the second half, where there are seven total.

Landsea also hypothesizes a \"consistent overestimation of\u2026 intensity during the mid-1940's through the late 1960's (ibid),\" and that populations in some areas of coastal Louisiana may not have been sufficient for accurate record-keeping in the earlier part of the record (2005)."}, {"section_title": "Increased Hurricane Activity Expected For Decades", "text": "On the other hand, it is valuable to capture climate cycles currently being debated in the literature when selecting a time scale over which to view the data.

As will be shown, the earlier part of the Louisiana record  is noticeably absent of any storms over Category 3 strength in fifty years, in stark contrast to later records ; which may indicate some of the major storms and intensities were not recorded, or able to be measured, prior to the late 1950's and the first-recorded Category 4 storm, Hurricane Audrey, 1957. Nonetheless, southeast regional climatologists such as Keim and Romolo (pers comm 2007) indicate that this is still an accurate representation of likely hurricane strikes in Louisiana and nationwide, in that lower order storms are much more frequent than higher order storms."}, {"section_title": "Tropical Storms and Hurricanes Strike Louisiana Every Few Years", "text": "Viewing the historical NOAA data in Appendix D, a few of the more obvious indications are that storms frequently make landfall in Louisiana, with the longest reprieve lasting only four years. It can generally be expected then that tropical storms and hurricanes will threaten the coast every few years."}, {"section_title": "Lower Order Storms Are the Most Frequent Storms Affecting Louisiana", "text": "Also from the data, although this would be expected, lower order storms such as tropical storms and Category 1 hurricanes are the most frequent storms to make landfall along the coast (Table 1). Only 2 hurricanes have been recorded to make landfall in Louisiana at or near Category 5 strength over the past Century (Ethel 1960, andCamille, 1969), and these happen to fall within the timeframe indicated by Landsea (2001) as potentially overestimated intensities. It must again be noted that records and measurements of early hurricanes may not have been captured in recent years, and that there were likely major hurricanes striking Louisiana from 1905-1945 that were missed or underestimated in the records (Keim pers comm 2007).  Storm strike intensities broken down by first, second and third strikes     ranging between 78.6 and 84.8 miles per hour (Figure 7). One unknown that may present difficulty in grasping Louisiana's hurricane history is measuring the effect of Louisiana's wetland loss and loss of protective barrier islands over the past century. With over one million acres 12 of wetlands lost since the turn of the century (van Heerden 2006Heerden , 2003Heerden and 1994, hydrologic science alone suggests storms are impacting Louisiana at greater intensity than before, in both wind speed and surge. Built into this are the damage to the coast following each major hurricane (van Heerden 2007, Barras 2006, Guidroz et al 2006, USGS 2006. Seen from this perspective, the snapshot of increasing hurricane intensities at landfall near the end of the century may to some extent be reflecting not climate change, or not only climate change, but accelerating land loss which is gradually bringing hurricanes 'closer in' to the coast. That is, storms will make landfall at greater recorded intensities than they would have previously without dampened effects.

The available data from the second half of the century , when records and measurements were improving, do however support that tropical storms and minor hurricanes (Cat 1-2) were over twice as likely (24/34 at 71% strike rate) to hit the coast as a major hurricane (Cat 3-5, 10/34 at 29% strike rate) ( Table 2). Two additional historical analyses that may yield some value in MSN evacuation and shelter planning can be estimated from the NOAA data are (1) historical track directions and 2coastal strike locations. Specifically, questions that can be posed include \"Do most hurricanes hit Louisiana tracking northwest from the Gulf of Mexico, making this storm surge analysis the most preferred?\" and \"Are southeastern Louisiana and New Orleans any more likely to be hit by future hurricanes than the rest of Louisiana?\" Storm strike locations and track directions were generalized from the NOAA CSC historical hurricane track data for Louisiana (1905 -2005) "}, {"section_title": "Hurricanes Most Often Track North and Northwest Towards the Louisiana Coast", "text": "In summary, over the century of data analyzed (1905 -2005), the data seem to support the hypothesis that southeastern Louisiana and New Orleans may be slightly more prone to tropical storm and hurricane strikes than central or western Louisiana. The data support even more the indication that hurricanes tend to track north or northwest from the Gulf of Mexico towards Louisiana, followed by northeast; but rarely due west or east; supporting that hurricane surge models, if limited by time or effort, should be run for these tracks initially. Although wind speeds were not measured with consistently high accuracy throughout the dataset, the most likely storm to strike Louisiana in any given year based on the best estimates of data, even if there are three or more storms in a given year, is still a tropical storm or weak Category 1. Historically, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita together striking the Louisiana coast as major hurricanes in a single year are a rare exception (Romolo pers comm 2007). MSN facilities should also then focus on lower order storm events which hit the Louisiana coast more frequently, as well as on the major storm events. In regards to AMO cycles and hurricanes over the past century (Appendix D), Keim (pers comm 2007) explains that viewing only Louisiana strikes will not reveal much of a pattern on which to base future hurricane strike or intensity probabilities. However, mapping landfalls along the entire US coast, from the Gulf Coast through the Atlantic East Coast (Keim, journal article in press), does reveal \"pockets\" of increased hurricane landfalls and intensities over approximate 5-10 year intervals in specific localities of Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere. For the purpose of this study, it is important to note that the theory of cyclical hurricane activity is supported by indications in the overall data, and that Louisiana, as well as the rest of the US, could experience decades more of increased hurricane activity."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Forward Track Speeds, Shifts in Track and Intensity in the Gulf of Mexico", "text": "According to scientists at NOAA's AOML Hurricane Research Division (HRD), the forward speed of a hurricane is \"very latitude dependent\" (Landsea 2007, online reference). Hurricanes also pick up speed traveling along steering currents (Keim, Romolo pers comm 2007). Approaching Louisiana from the Gulf of Mexico, the forward speed of hurricanes as taken from the HURDAT database, and averaged in 5 degree latitude bins (note: Latitudes in the Gulf of Mexico range between 20\u00ba to 30\u00baN) resulted in the following estimates (Landsea 2007, abridged):  1999, p. 2).\""}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Size", "text": "NOAA experts provide the following dimensions for a typical hurricane: \"about 300 miles wide although they can vary considerably in size;\" with a \"calm, clear area\" in the eye \"approximately 20-40 miles across;\" and \"an eyewall composed of dense clouds that contain the highest winds in the storm (ibid).\" They also indicate that hurricane-force winds (HFW) \"can extend outward to about 25 miles in a small hurricane and to more than 150 miles for a large one (ibid).\" Meanwhile \"tropical storm-force winds [TSFW] can stretch out as far as 300 miles from the eye of a large hurricane (ibid).\" Hurricane Katrina was considered \"exceptionally large\" with TSFWs extending 200 nautical miles from the center, and HFWs 90 nautical miles from the center (Knabb et al 2006, p. 3). Hurricane size and range of winds are important to keep in mind when modeling hurricane risk. Powell, NOAA HRD (2007b) indicates that overall storm size and the wind reach together affect a hurricane's destructive potential, making size and reach of winds additional important factors to consider along with the Saffir-Simpson scale when estimating potential hurricane damage."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Intensification", "text": "A variety of factors can intensify or degrade a hurricane, including sea surface temperatures (SSTs), upper level conditions, and low and high pressure systems (Keim pers comm 2007, Romolo pers comm 2007, Walker et al 2006, NOAA 1999). An historical analysis of hurricanes and their intensification before landfall in Louisiana will therefore only reveal part of the story. However, in regard to the intensification of Louisiana hurricanes, the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico may play a significant role (Keim pers comm 2007, Walker et al 2006. It has been observed that hurricanes are prone to rapid intensification over warm Gulf of Mexico waters, particularly in late summer (Robbins/SRCC 2004). Satellite technology makes it possible to map SST data, but locating the Loop Current is difficult in late summer when most hurricanes form in the Gulf (Walker et al 2006); However, sea surface height (SSH) can be used to measure hot-spots (ibid) and attempt to map the location. Warm water at deep levels such as the Loop current can intensify storms, while cold pools or \"cyclones\" can slow storms down (Romolo pers comm 2007). Storms will also lose speed and strength fairly quickly over land (ibid, Kaplan andDeMaria 1995, Gregg 2006, see also: Krayer-Marshall curve). Beyond these observations, there is a wide a variation in factors that will cause a storm to intensify or weaken. Historical Louisiana hurricanes vary widely in the degree of their intensification. Some recent benchmark storms in Louisiana are summarized in   The potential for rapid hurricane intensification is therefore a risk that must be built into any hurricane model; yet introduces a tremendous problem to MSN evacuation and sheltering strategies."}, {"section_title": "Rainfall Risk and Tornadoes Associated with Hurricanes", "text": "It is important to note that regardless of where a storm makes landfall along the Gulf Coast, there will be some risk of extreme rainfall and the possibility of tornadoes. Hammond, Louisiana experienced almost 12 inches of rain from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, while the hurricane caused two tornado deaths and numerous injuries across Louisiana (NOAA AOML 2007b). Similarly, New Orleans was seriously flooded by rainfall from a tropical storm (Allison) that made landfall in Houston in 2001 (ibid). NOAA experts have often indicated that the \"front right quadrant\" of a hurricane is the most dangerous part of the path for storm surge and winds; but this is also where tornadoes are most likely to occur (NOAA 1999); Tornadoes also form within the storm rainbands (ibid). The more intense a hurricane, the greater the tornado risk, and tornadoes can still occur for days after landfall (ibid). Most tornadoes \"occur within 150 miles of the coast (ibid, p 14).\""}, {"section_title": "Forecast of Louisiana Hurricanes: Likely Storms vs. Worst Case", "text": "Although inherent problems exist with some of the historical hurricane data, there is value in becoming acquainted with the historical records and recent hurricane research for MSN planning. In summary, Louisiana is likely to experience tropical storms and hurricanes every few years. Particularly it can be said that, while planning for unlikely or worst case events from Category 4 or 5 levels hurricanes is certainly necessary, planning for the more common, lower order storms (tropical storms and Category 1 hurricanes) that may threaten coastal Louisiana is highly relevant, based on likelihood and risk. Current study analyses support that tropical storms and Category 1 and 2 hurricanes will make landfall in Louisiana over twice as often as major hurricanes. The worst case event for Louisiana MSN planning would be a tropical storm or minor hurricane that rapidly intensified within 48 hours over warm Gulf of Mexico waters. This scenario is not far-fetched and has happened historically with Hurricane Audrey (1957), and to a lesser extent with Hurricanes Carmen (1974), Elena (1985) and Katrina (2005). Today, Louisiana scientists may be able to map the Loop Current with satellite technology and be able to better predict the rapid intensification of approaching storms (Walker et al 2006), along with other meteorological factors. Some climate scientists predict at least ten to twenty more years of increased hurricane activity in the US (Goldenberg et al 2001). Louisiana could see more hurricanes, and more intense hurricanes, in the coming years as part of a natural cycle (Landsea 2005). Hurricanes may also become more intense or frequent in the coming years due to global warming, but so far data support this will happen to only a small degree (Knutson 2004, Emmanuel 2004. 'Megastorms,' if understood to be Category 5 hurricanes, can and do form in the Gulf of Mexico, and may be explained by increased SSTs as well as other climate conditions; however, the presence of the Loop Current and increase in Gulf temperatures in summer are at the same time common phenomena. Therefore, megastorm formation is difficult to support solely with studies of global warming. Hurricane forward tracking speeds in the Gulf of Mexico approaching Louisiana average approximately 10-12 miles per hour (Landsea 2007), but hurricane forward speed, size, wind reach, and the potential for extreme rainfall will all vary. Storm surge and other models, if limited by time or cost constraints, might first be run for eastern Louisiana and model storms tracking north, northwest and then northeast. Hurricane intensification, extreme rainfall and threat of tornadoes should all be considered when evaluating a MSN facility or residence for hurricane risk. In post-Katrina Louisiana, evacuation is not likely to even be a question ( 2006). Based on the historical hurricane data and current research reviewed, such questions support the need for analyses of minor storms, a more in-depth investigation into threshold events for coastal Louisiana MSN facilities, and the development of tools such as GIS maps that can provide better analysis tools to decision-makers."}, {"section_title": "State of the Technology: Hurricane Modeling and GIS", "text": "Hurricane models are becoming increasingly available for integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

NOAA SLOSH and FEMA HAZUS were two of the major models employed in the current study that can be integrated into a GIS."}, {"section_title": "NOAA SLOSH", "text": "As discussed previously, storm surge is a major threat to coastal Louisiana during hurricanes, and thus one of the most important hurricane risks to accurately model. The NOAA Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model is a storm surge prediction tool developed by Jelesnianski and Taylor at the National Weather Service (FEMA/USACE 2007). SLOSH can be used to \"evaluate storm surge threat from different categories of hurricanes striking from various directions (NOAA 1999).\" Version 1.43 of the SLOSH model was made available on CD (May 9, 2007)  A second limitation is SLOSH accuracy, within +/-20% of peak storm surge. For example, a model output result of 10 feet would likely be observed in actual conditions within the range of 8-12 feet (SLOSH 2007). Third, SLOSH predicted surge levels do not account for additional rainfall, river flow or wind driven waves, or levee failures. Only flooding due to overtopping of levee systems is considered (ibid). It is important to note that storm track/direction is an important factor in surge generation, and may mean the difference between serious vs. minor flooding (ibid)."}, {"section_title": "SLOSH assumes all barriers hold; and is not yet capable of modeling breach (SEHTF 2007).", "text": "NOAA requires and has requested updated levee heights and status from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to update surge models for the New Orleans Hurricane Protection System (HPS) for post-Katrina (ibid). While the best available data is understood to have been incorporated into the SLOSH model, actual levee heights and status both before and after the 2005 hurricanes in SLOSH may still retain slight inaccuracies, unless based on current field measurements employing updated elevation survey methods (van Heerden pers comm. 2007). This has been acknowledged by the model developers but the possibility of error should be kept in mind also by emergency planners. Fourth, SLOSH developers note: \"The accuracy of the SLOSH model depends heavily on the ability to accurately model the topographic and bathymetric features of the basin... Inaccuracies in modeling these features will contribute directly to errors in the modeling of storm surge. \u2026The major barriers to storm surge\u2026 include natural ridges along many of the rivers and bayous and man-made features such as, levees, floodwalls, highways, and railroad embankments. The bathymetry of the coastline and the areas bays, lakes, rivers, canals, and bayous are also of importance in accurately modeling hurricane surge. Data was collected to establish the heights of both Federal and non-Federal levees and floodwalls, and to establish the existence of any gaps or other information that might affect the integrity of a barrier to hurricane surge. Other barrier heights were obtained from existing profiles or actual surveys of features critical to the limits of inundation. The bathymetry of the coastline and other bodies of water within the study area was obtained using hydrographic surveys, bathymetric maps, and U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps. Input to the model also included average ground elevations for each grid square within the basin (FEMA and USACE Comprehensive Hurricane Data Preparedness Study, online reference 15 )\" Additionally, SLOSH: \"operates on a grid having a relatively large size. Cell size varies over the grid, but a typical size might be about 1 mile by 1 mile. The model uses an average elevation for each cell, so some locations may be at 10 feet, but across the road, there might be another facility with an elevation of 6 feet. That one would flood, while [other] stays dry (Shaffer 2007, personal e-mail communication).\" The large grid may cause confusion in areas surrounding the Mississippi River or Lake Pontchartrain, where represented river or lake levels may spill over to areas that are actually leveed/may actually remain dry (ibid). This must be kept in mind when visually determining if facilities fall within a storm surge risk area. Of great import to this study, there is some disagreement among surge modeling researchers whether SLOSH MOM's accurately calculate or portray overland storm surge flooding that extends beyond the shoreline. However, SLOSH applications can be mapped more precisely \"using a fine-resolution elevation database, such as the USGS's 30 m by 30 m (or 10 m by 10 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (ibid)\" alleviating some of this concern. The current study therefore applies a LSU Hurricane Center project dataset created by S. Ahmet Binselam (2007 refinements) to tally and verify project results, discussed more in sections 4.3 and 5.2.3. Final limitations of the current SLOSH model include that no corrections have been incorporated for western Louisiana on account of Hurricane Rita. It is possible that storm surge risks have increased to some extent due to damage to the wetlands and other land features caused by the storm along the western coast (see also, sections 1.4 and 3.2.2.4). Also, mapping SLOSH shapefiles in a GIS is a relatively new feature which has some expected 'bugs,' such as problems applying or viewing symbology or layer files (.lyr) when mapping storm surge risks in New Orleans (e.g., shapefiles may not denote flooding in the city when levees are actually overtopped). Of note, Pedro (2006) The wind field model and damage estimate capability (e.g., moderate, severe) are a strong feature of HAZUS which can be exported as shapefiles into a GIS and be used for more detailed emergency planning analyses (Figure 12). The wind field model can calculate surface level wind fields for both historical and userdefined storms (Hill/Friedland 2004). Methods of incorporating HAZUS wind field data into a GIS to support the calculation of wind fields for this study are detailed in section 4.4. Limitations to HAZUS first include that wind shapefiles must be generated as single runs and may require additional input information (Friedland pers comm 2007). For the same reasons discussed for NOAA SLOSH, 'consensus model' runs would be the preferred wind modeling application for hurricane planning, to account for such factors as variations in hurricane size (and thus variations in wind fields and reach), as well as to build in tolerance for unforeseen changes in hurricane intensity and track. However again, unless a labor and time-intensive suite of hurricane tracks are run, HAZUS lacks the capacity to produce worst case, consensus model approximations for wind using many historical and hypothetical storms, etc. Such a feature for wind is as yet unavailable within the SLOSH program and cannot be mapped. Third, overall, there are computer and technical issues which must be overcome in the near future for installing, using the software, and obtaining technical support. While access to the software is not difficult (the CD is made available upon request), technical expertise and time requirements may be the most prohibitive aspects to MSN planners and decision-makers. 17 a feature currently being addressed by modelers such as John Pine at LSU, with a flood grid in GIS For the purpose of this study, HAZUS wind fields mapped from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (Friedland 2007) are mapped in GIS shapefile format to explore wind field calculation methods (section 4.4). HAZUS is further explored as a future direction to estimate maximum hurricane winds for lower order storms; and potentially to determine decreased risk zones for MSN facilities to shelter in place for storms with predicted landfall strike probabilities east or west of Louisiana at L-48 (forty-eight hours to landfall) (section 6.2.2).

Unless addressed, resultant maps may be unclear and will unavoidably reflect a difference in expertise, priorities, urgency, responsibilities, jargon (especially acronyms), management styles, and ways of doing business, among others. For example, in 2002, experimental storm surge models in development at the time 30 were used to brief to Governor Mike Foster as Hurricane Lili approached Louisiana. The Governor, similar to most emergency managers and decision-makers, had little patience for a time-series model of estimated surge flooding that presented flood levels in meters (versus feet) 31 and times in Universal Coordinated Time (UCT) or Zulu 32 . He immediately asked for depths in feet, and times to be represented in Central Standard Time (CST) for Louisiana; a reasonable request, but which had escaped the focus of the modelers as they attempted a very high resolution flood animation (Westerink et al 2004). Similarly, emergency managers (particularly the military, on critical missions) understandably prefer one to two sentence explanations of what model outputs or GIS maps actually mean in an emergency. Thus, hurricane researchers and modelers should consider abridged notes or explanations on map legends to clearly explain model outputs and maps. Maps should also spell out acronyms and be designed to suit the perspective of the user. In the case of MSN patients or planning, further study is needed to explore methods of effectively communicating and visualizing risk (see also, section 5.2.5).

Twenty-six coastal Louisiana parishes (listed in Appendix B) were selected for the study based on the elevation vulnerability of those parishes that had some portion of land south of interstates I-10 and I-12 in Louisiana. As discussed in section 1.4 (see also, Figure 5) these parishes may have elevations which drop off drastically south of the interstates, exposing them to higher storm surge vulnerabilities. The selection of these coastal parishes is also supported by the hurricane research which substantiates higher wind risk directly off the Louisiana coast (Robbins 2004, Kaplan andDeMaria 1995). Based again on project findings (sections 1.4 and 3.2), Category 1-3 level storms (see also, Appendix A) were chosen for analysis in this study in an attempt to determine threshold events that will impact coastal Louisiana MSN facilities. First, it has been determined that it is highly relevant to model lower order storms which commonly make landfall in Louisiana. Second, since tropical storms are less likely to cause severe storm surge flooding (or substantial wind damage), and Category 4 hurricanes are likely to trigger a substantial medical evacuation, the storms that fall within this range were selected for a more in-depth review. Third, there is greater uncertainty as to how these storm levels would impact specific MSN facilities and plans to evacuate or shelter-in-place. The selection of Cat 1-3 storms for modeling was determined the most effective approach to begin differentiating coastal MSN facilities south of the interstates according to storm surge, wind and other hurricane risks. A review of historical Louisiana hurricane data and related research (section 3.2) has indicated three major directions in which to proceed with SLOSH storm surge modeling for the Louisiana coast. First, due to the planning objective of the study, and to consider the risk of rapid hurricane intensification, other coastal factors, and the serious implications for MSN patients, SLOSH MOMs were selected to be modeled to provide the most conservative analysis (see also, section 3.3.1.1). Conservative modeling approaches are favored by Dr. S. Hassan Mashriqui, PE of LSU (2007) based on his experience with storm surge modeling uncertainties. Particularly, while he indicates that both SLOSH and ADCIRC storm surge models currently tend to overpredict surge values, he advises that error should always be on the side of caution for hurricane evacuation strategies due to the unpredictable nature of hurricanes and potential for rapid intensification and shift in track; potential error in the models (potentially in modeling waves and accurate barrier heights); the critical nature of MSN patients and risks to human life; and considering dramatic recent changes to the coast (ibid). In a second direction for storm surge modeling as supported by project findings in section 3.2.2.7, hurricane flood risks were reviewed for north (N) tracks (where applicable) as they approached the Louisiana coast. Finally, as discussed in SLOSH limitations (again, section 3.3.1.1) data layers which extended surge flood risks further inland from the shoreline based on LIDAR data (herein referred to as \"LIDAR-extrapolated\" SLOSH MOM datasets or GIS layers -Binselam 2007/LSU Hurricane Center) were also incorporated into the study in an attempt to tally and verify project results from SLOSH version 1.43 shapefiles. As will be discussed, Critical MSN data layers were collected and imported into a GIS and viewed with SLOSH MOM storm surge outputs for Cat 1-3 hurricanes. HAZUS shapefiles were originally explored in a GIS for the determination of winds that could impact MSN facilities under Cat 1-3 storm conditions; but overriding wind calculation factors (section 4.4) were utilized to generate final wind effects results. Given all project findings and methods, threshold events impacting MSN facilities in coastal Louisiana were determined for MSN facilities with results presented in Chapter 5."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Incorporation into a GIS", "text": "MSN facilities for this study included Louisiana: Additional MSN facilities and residences which were not mapped included facilities which house the blind, deaf, or mentally ill. These datasets were not available for Louisiana at the time of the study. Other large MSN population groups that could not be mapped included parish or zip code level counts of elderly, disabled and those with chronic conditions living in blood pressure, heart disease and mental illness. However the current mapping study excluded these maps since a complete dataset for all 26 coastal parishes is not available, but would be necessary to compare statistics, determine areas of higher vulnerability and distinguish priority areas. The data will be an important addition for future study when census totals are complete. Critical MSN data sets were collected and geo-coded for incorporation into ESRI ArcGIS 9.2. Data sources and the geocoding method used are next outlined."}, {"section_title": "MSN Location Data", "text": "Louisiana hospital and nursing home locations were compiled from various sources, including from the FEMA Geospatial Intelligence Unit CD, provided by the US DHHS; Louisiana state databases, and other online sources. Lists were converted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, where coordinate information was converted into decimal degrees (longitude and latitude); or a search was conducted using NASA World Wind 1.4 ( Figure 15) to locate coordinate data. In some cases, addresses were geo-coded using merged tiger road files (2004). DHH Regions were created and color-coded from Louisiana parish shapefiles. Cities, places, roads (including interstates I-10 and I-12) and the Mississippi River were added to the GIS. Data on licensed beds, operational beds, current census counts, status (open or closed), and previous facility names were added to the excel lists from the DHH Health Standards website. The excel files were converted to database (dbf IV) files and added to the map as x,y data. "}, {"section_title": "Critical MSN Evacuation and Transportation Data", "text": "Not surprisingly, many nursing home administrators view transportation as the most pressing need for community collaboration during disasters (US DHHS/ OIG 2006, p. 19). Current city and state plans now outline strategies to pick up MSN patients, residents and those with limited mobility in their homes, and to bring them to collection points where they will be transferred via coach to designated shelters (Gordon/Times Picayune 2007). Some of the critical points that were therefore mapped included DOTD Coastal Parish Pick-up Points (CPPPs), Figure 15. NASA World Wind 1.4 with Yahoo! search feature. information points (LA Stormwatch, http://batonrouge.lastormwatch.com), and identified Critical Transportation Needs Shelters (CTNS) (Blanco/DOTD Ex. 2). One additional critical data layer that the state is working to obtain relates to transportation assets such as ambulance service providers and EMS (Yennie pers comm 2006). Another data layer that is needed but not available in shapefile format (currently under update) relates to tiered evacuation strategies and contraflow (Figure 16). Unfortunately these data layers were not accessible at the time of the study and could not be incorporated into the GIS mapping and modeling. A pivotal transportation consideration warrants review before proceeding with the methods discussion. As discussed in section 3.2, hurricanes vary in size, speed, intensity and temporal/spatial decay, and may generate very individualized wind fields and reaches. Medical special needs patients are among the first to be evacuated for a hurricane emergency; or certainly should be; well before the onset of tropical storm force winds, rainfall, or congested roadways. Figure 16. FEMA map with shelter locations (not made public) and capacities, overlaid with Louisiana's Tier 1-3 evacuation zones to determine high threat-risks for evacuation (Blanco/DHS 2006). Ideally, decisions to evacuate will occur no later than 48 hours to hurricane landfall (L-48). National Hurricane Center storm prediction technologies and capabilities are constantly improving and becoming increasingly accurate; most recently a five-day forecast track model has been released, although it is much less certain than the 3-day (NOAA 2007). So, what level of information and warning do local facility decision-makers have in advisories at L-48? "}, {"section_title": "Critical MSN Shelter Data", "text": "Medical Special Needs Shelters (MSNS) were mapped with capacity information. General population shelter data was not incorporated or mapped in this study since the data is not made public. While there are hundreds of shelter sites across the state, community resources in place for other citizens may not be available to nursing home residents (Prats 2003) or to other MSN patients. Louisiana is among the Gulf States that \"discourage or restrict nursing homes from using State special needs shelters as evacuation sites\u2026 (ibid, US DHHS/ OIG 2006, p. 19).\" General population shelter locations are not released to the public until the site is deemed safe and able to be used; there is a \"delicate balance\" that must be achieved when deciding which shelters to open, when and where, because often soon after an announcement, the public will arrive (Downey pers comm 2007). However, there will be a benefit to analyzing shelters with hurricane risk data in future work since \"\u2026surge models could be used to help coastal parishes decide whether or not to open, and better weigh the risk vs. the benefit (ibid).\" Figure 19.

It can also be viewed with LIDAR elevation data and imagery."}, {"section_title": "Special Considerations: Levee Breach and Status, Katrina Maximum Flood Depths", "text": "Two years after Hurricane Katrina and the levee breaches, independent critics and Corps officials agree that in New Orleans, regarding the Hurricane Protection System (HPS) there is \"\u2026an incomplete levee system that could fail on its eastern and southern borders -even during smaller hurricanes\" (Schleifstein/The New Orleans Times-Picayune May 9, 2007, Figure 20a). Figures 20a-b: Levee breach locations and current problem spots viewed with LIDAR elevation contours and nursing home status (non-operational and closed facilities), based on overview data from the New Orleans Times Picayune (Schleifstein 2007). (ESRI ArcGIS 9.2,with GIS data from Yang,Peele,and Binselam). As of hurricane season 2007 \"\u2026even a strong Category 2 hurricane entering the Intracoastal Waterway from Lake Borgne could overtop levees\u2026(ibid).\" Levee problem spots circle the city of New Orleans on both the East and West Bank, with sections that remain to be rebuilt or are incomplete; remain unarmored; are too low; have gates that are lower than adjoining levee walls; have sheet piling that is insufficient, or gaps at utility and other crossings (ibid). To account for this added hurricane risk, a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) mosaic providing elevation depth in ft NAVD88 (Binselam 2006) was incorporated with data layers such as the New Orleans HPS (USACE, Yang 2004) and Katrina levee breach shapefiles (Peele/LGS, Cunningham and Braud) to be viewed in a GIS environment (Figure 20b). The LIDAR data was classified and a symbology was developed to represent elevation values in New Orleans (feet NAVD88). Levee breaches were represented as red on a new HPS shapefile that incorporated the full HPS including the Arpent levee (ibid) and West Bank levees (USACE). A separate data layer was developed to point out levee problem spots to be viewed with MSN locations (Figure 21).   (Cunningham and Braud 2006). Unfortunately, one additional data layer that was not available for this study was the shapefile for FEMA trailers located throughout coastal Louisiana, which may become threatened at approximately 50-74 mph or TSFW winds (SEHTF 2007). While FEMA trailer residents are expected to evacuate very early, they could unwarily become MSN patients in unsuccessful evacuation or other unforeseen circumstances or hazards. Hurricane tracks from the NOAA CSC shapefiles were also added to the final GIS with time fields estimating 'hours until landfall' (L-HR) added for added 'time-series' analysis."}, {"section_title": "Integration of Storm Surge Flood Layers into GIS", "text": "As explained earlier by Will Shaffer of NOAA, a generated SLOSH surge value of 10 feet would be estimated to flood a facility at 8 ft but not at 12 ft within a grid cell. Therefore, an important consideration when evaluating storm surge risk for any facility with SLOSH modeling is the facility first floor elevation. However, these data were not generally available for the current study. To support surge risk determination in this study where elevation is unclear, LIDAR data (LOSCO, LSU and LOSRADP 2007, LGS/ Binselam 2006) was applied to provide a rough estimation of facility elevation. Based on 2007 elevation surveys employing recent techniques for accurate elevation measurement, LIDAR is generally only accurate to within 1-3 feet (Cunningham et al 2003). However, it can still be used to provide an estimate of elevation in the current analysis. As discussed in section 3.3.1.1, NOAA developers have recently added a shapefile feature to SLOSH outputs, so that they can be viewed in a GIS. Entire basin files can be imported into ArcGIS as shapefiles and classified at corresponding storm levels for the MOM (Cat 1-5). Shapefiles were imported and color coded to match SLOSH outputs as they appear on the CD program then clipped along the Louisiana coast. SLOSH outputs were then viewed at selected storm levels in a GIS with other critical data layers. Hospital and nursing home census estimates were labeled and viewed with labeled surge flooding estimates in SLOSH (figure 23). Additional MSN facilities and critical locations were also evaluated, with results summarized in Chapter 5. SLOSH MOM values were calculated from input shapefiles (SLOSH version 1.43) across the Louisiana coast for all storms. As discussed in section 3.3.1.1, conservative surge MOMs will show flooding as if the storm makes landfall at every point, from every direction, worst case. MSN facilities were manually counted, with additional verification applying clipped SLOSH shapefiles (see also section 5.3), to tally facilities receiving at least 1 foot of storm surge. Figure 23. MSN facilities at serious storm surge risk from a CAT 3 hurricane are evaluated and summarized (Chapter 5, Results). (SLOSH 2007, shown with LIDAR 2006, andMSN data layers). Note facilities falling just outside of SLOSH grid cells. Mapping worst case storm surge flooding via SLOSH MOMs may be desirable in one respect, since MSN facilities are the first to evacuate and begin transport of patients as far as 48-72 hours out prior to hurricane landfall (L-HR). As discussed, although there are increasingly accurate track predictions available from the NHC, facility decision-makers still cannot be certain where the storm will actually make landfall while the storm is still so far away, OR if the storm will intensify. To err on the side of caution, many will necessarily consider evacuation. However, it should be noted that in actuality, when a storm makes landfall along the Louisiana coast (approximately 300 miles across), most hurricanes -even Katrina and Ritawill only produce surge flooding along a portion, not all, of the coastline (Figures 30a-b). Some MSN patients and residents may therefore evacuate needlessly. As much as the prediction and modeling technologies have improved, this is difficult to avoid without accepting serious risk. Due to the limitations discussed in section 3.3.1.1, a partial re-analysis was conducted for this study with LIDAR-extrapolated SLOSH MOM shapefiles provided by Binselam 2007 ( Figure 24) in an attempt to verify tally counts and incorporate any MSN critical points which may have fallen outside of the SLOSH 2007 shapefile extent. Figure 24. MSN facilities at serious storm surge risk from a CAT 2 hurricane (Chapter 5, Results) (Binselam 2007, extrapolated from SLOSH 20062) There were two major limitations with the dataset. First, analysis was only possible for Cat 2 and 3 storms, based on the original purpose of the dataset. Therefore, Cat 1 results could not be re-analyzed with the LIDAR-extrapolated SLOSH data. Second, other than the extrapolation of LIDAR, the re-analysis differed from the original SLOSH analysis in two respects: (1) north tracks only were analyzed, rather than all directions; and (2) pre-Katrina SLOSH data (2006) was used as the baseline (converted to the LIDAR NAVD88). The supplementary tally with LIDAR-extrapolated SLOSH contours was a highly valued dataset for its value in gleaning MSN facilities that may have been missed in the original SLOSH analysis. Overall results and observations are discussed in Chapter 5."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Wind Fields", "text": "A number of aspects of hurricane wind must first be understood to make adequate use of wind models for the calculation of wind fields. First, wind fields over land cannot be represented using simply Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories (Appendix A), which are wind speeds over water; but require a conversion method to represent wind speeds over land (Friedland pers comm 2007, Gregg 2006, Easley 2003, Vickery et al 2000. Further, wind speeds are averaged over one minute in the Saffir-Simpson scale, while a 3-second gust is used in the design and evaluation of building performance (Friedland pers comm 2007). Therefore, a series of conversions are necessary to translate estimated Saffir-Simpson windspeeds at landfall into peak gusts, which structural engineers will use to determine the level of damage a facility such that an MSN nursing home will likely sustain (ibid). Second, wind speeds will dissipate shortly after landfall, and at varying rates, based on the storm size, forward tracking speed and other factors (Kaplan andDeMaria 1995, Robbins 2004). Therefore, wind impacts will not be as severe the further a storm moves inland. Lastly, a very important facet of wind that is not largely known to the public in general is that the pressure exerted by winds on a structure in a hurricane does not increase proportionally to velocity, or windspeed. Aerodynamic equations reveal that wind force is proportional to the square of the velocity, where F w = the force of the wind on a surface \u03c1 = the density of the air C f = force coefficients (drag, lift, etc.) V = wind velocity (3-second gust at 33') A = projected area normal to wind such that, as windspeeds increase, the wind force increases four-fold! (ASCE 2005, Friedland pers comm 2007, English pers comm 2007. Therefore, a jump by one hurricane category (Appendix A) translates to much more damage structurally than generally perceived. The FEMA HAZUS wind data from 2005 turned out to be a fitting dataset for review in a GIS to gain a greater understanding of the wind levels and associated damage that may be realized along the coast from a major hurricane (Figure 25). Particularly, since both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall as approximate Category 3 storms, HAZUS analysis and shapefiles (Friedland 2007) demonstrate the impacts of estimated peak gusts over land and estimated percent of damage at the upper level intensity desired for this study (as Cat 1-3 storms were analyzed). Additionally, the hurricanes struck alternate end of the state, demonstrating both the limiting extent of wind effects and surge (see also section 6.2.1). Figure 25. Peak gusts over land, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005). HAZUS shapefiles provided by Friedland 2007. Katrina Data provided by ARA/FEMA directly after the storm. Rita data from NHC Advisory #28. As determined from the mapped 2005 data for HAZUS peak gusts (Figure 25), associated damage estimates for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were also calculated and mapped ( Figure 26). Damage estimates approximated the percent range of residential structures that may have been impacted by 'at least moderate damage' but potentially severe damage from winds ( Figure   26). As supported by the mapped findings, this study determined that all Louisiana coastal MSN facilities and residences south of the interstates are likely to be impacted by the peak wind gusts of hurricane force winds for each hurricane category. Peak gusts (3-sec) on buildings, as converted from Saffir-Simpson maximum sustained wind values over water (1-min) revealed upper gusts of 108, 130 and 156 mph for Category 1, 2 and 3 hurricanes respectively, as hurricanes approach land ( Figure 25 and Table 7). sheltering in a recently designed or mitigated facility such as a multi-story hospital. Following a review of the 2005 wind data, it was determined that hurricane characteristics and the baseline wind equations that go into the HAZUS determinations, as well as NOAA NHC HRD surface wind products (Figures 33a-c, section 6.2.2), could be applied in the current study. These provide a conservative methodology in GIS to determine added wind risk from hurricanes at the Category 1-3 level. The methodology was further developed along the following basis: The distance from the Louisiana coast to interstates I-10 and I-12 was estimated in a GIS to range between 25 and 100 miles. As discussed in section 3.1.3.1, hurricane-force winds (HFWs) \"can extend outward [from the eye] to about 25 miles in a small hurricane and to more than 150 miles for a large one (NOAA 1999, p.2) ( Figure 27).\" Regardless of hurricane size, it is assumed for this study that the HFWs that extend outward from the hurricane eyewall (1) will make landfall well before the eyewall and (2) will not likely dissipate until the hurricane hits, i.e., approaches the shallow waters of the coast and then traverses land (Friedland pers comm 2007). Thus, in this case, the current study assumes that the maximum or peak wind gust over terrain will be realized on MSN residences and facilities for each Category hurricane at least as far inland as the interstates."}, {"section_title": "Sharing Hurricane Research and Modeling Tools in GIS", "text": "Methods were also explored to present hurricane research and models with facilityspecific data, MSN locations and other critical data for local facility managers and other planners to access and use. Further study and one-on-one discussions are needed on this topic to identify effective methods of communicating and visualizing risk data to MSN populations, perhaps with GIS. However, some preliminary identified strategies could include preparing data layers on CD and supplying these; or providing the data layers online for download, with options for downloadable GIS readers. The intention would be to make as much of the data available, able to be managed locally by users, and freely available and read by GIS readers; yet still preserve the ability of local users to view and manipulate input tables of data as well as add their own data. The following formats were tested for this application with methods briefly reviewed here. Versions of Arc Explorer are freely available for download. Selected project shapefiles were imported into ArcExplorer 9.2 and maps were saved as .axl files. Basic shapefiles were loaded and saved as maps for viewing, but with little ability to edit or manage the files, view multiple layers, or add symbology.

From preliminary plans, the first load of MSN patients are set to depart from airfields at L-48 (LA DHH ex 9).

In a GIS, these demonstrated that a more precise analysis of MSN locations may be possible in the future, throughout the study set (26 coastal LA parishes, see also Appendix B listing). For example, the LIDARextrapolated SLOSH data in some cases helped to visualize additional MSN facilities that may flood at Category 2 storm surge levels. These would not have been included in the first tally ( Figure 28). However, in other cases, the detail of the new datatset also results in the exclusion of some facilities. Both SLOSH shapefiles and the LIDAR-extrapolated dataset introduce problems when attempting to \"clip\" layers by MSN facility locations in a GIS (e.g., the large grid cell size of SLOSH shapefiles tend to over-count facilities, such as in the New Orleans \"bowl;\" while clips of the high-resolution LIDAR-extrapolated SLOSH dataset so far have a tendency to undercount, even though previously unidentified facilities may be added in).   (Binselam 2007) will affect future counts; although the concept can be applied in further detailed study. Storm surge re-analysis alone is not likely to change future outcomes. Combined surge and wind effects; the uncertainties of hurricane track and intensification; and the timeline for decision-making, taken together, place all coastal Louisiana MSN facilities at risk. Determination of the extent of risk zones, and differentiating or prioritizing individual facility risk falls outside of the scope of the current project, but remains an important future objective. It is hoped the current methods and findings will help to support future studies.

The remaining twelve house as many as 1,431 additional patients according to the 2007 census data. Two hospitals have over 100 patients each, one with over 200 and two others have over 300 patients each. An estimated eighteen more nursing homes with 1,282 patients could also be affected in New Orleans, although four are closed. Expected flood depths at the hospitals and nursing homes can be modeled for various scenarios with more detail from the Katrina flood mask data (Cunningham and Braud 2006). Levee problems have also been viewed in a GIS for proximity to their location. Over one hundred other MSN facilities are located within New Orleans (east bank) which could be additionally impacted by levee breach or flood inundation, as well as six critical MSN locations: two MMP-As (airfields), three CPPPs and the MMP-T (Amtrak Union Passenger Terminal). MSN individuals in residences are not included in this count, but elderly counts may be estimated with the census data; e.g., as of 2006 there were an estimated 21,032 elderly (over 65) in Orleans Parish (US Census 2006b). SLOSH 2007 and other storm surge models support that potentially all of these additional MSN patients would be exposed to serious flooding from levee overtopping from a Category 3 Hurricane. Flooding of the New Orleans west bank could impact four additional hospitals (although one may be closed) with an estimated 319 patients; including one hospital that has over 200 patients. An estimated fourteen additional nursing homes (although 2 are closed) could be impacted by levee breach, surge or flood inundation, with approximately 1,156 patients. Of these, nine nursing homes have approximately one hundred patients each. Over forty other MSN locations could be impacted, and three critical MSN locations: two CPPPs and an MMP-A. Jefferson Parish also has three times the estimated elderly population as New Orleans, at 66,265 individuals (US Census Bureau 2006b). Table 12 summarizes all of these scenarios and counts."}, {"section_title": "Clear Communication and Visualization of the Data", "text": "It has been discussed that MSN decision-makers are not always emergency managers or state officials, but can range from the nursing home administrator, to the elderly or disabled MSN patient sheltering in their residence. What has become apparent is that while these MSN facility decision-makers often look to emergency management for guidance, they essentially make their own determinations of risk, and whether they will evacuate or shelter in place. Given that MSN facility mangers and residents remain very independent in their desire to assess and determine their own risks, it is important to: (1) acknowledge that they are indeed local decision-makers, whether or not this works within the framework of local emergency plans that are in place, (2) ensure that they have access to crucial information and decision tools capable of conveying hurricane risk, and (3) ensure that the information provided to them is clear -particularly emergency instructions or contact numbers -as well as expectations or requirements. It is also crucial that indications of the seriousness of the threat and instructions be clearly conveyed (Eisenman et al 2007). Publisher map files were determined to be the best initial method of sharing critical hurricane risk data with MSN communities (Figure 30). Most relevant would be that LIDARextrapolated SLOSH data, as it becomes more refined, could be shared via Arc Reader, a freely available and easily accessible GIS reader. However, further study is still needed, as well as more interaction with MSN communities, to determine additional methods of risk communication and visualization. Figure 30. Critical MSN sites can be viewed with Category 2 storm surge risk layers (Binselam 2007) in ArcReader as an ArcPublisher (.pmf) map file. Hurricane risk layers may be shared in this type of free GIS format.

Counts were thus subject to human error, where facilities may have been missed in original counts, counted twice, etc. Although a model was successfully built for this project to clip SLOSH for MSN facilities and verify counts, the counts were far overestimated, since SLOSH resolution 1 mi by 1 mi grid cells often 'spill over' from rivers or other water features (see also section 3.3.1.1) and include many more MSN sites than are actually at risk. Thus, urban areas, levees and canals had to be scrutinized for flood interpretation. As discussed in section 6.2.4, models and scripts will be further explored as a future direction to eliminate tedious tallying and provide immediate counts for MSN GIS applications, including applying the LIDARextrapolated datasets when completed (Binselam 2007). Additionally, as mentioned, multi-level structures such as hospitals were still included in surge risk determinations as recommended to evacuate. Some hospitals and other multi-level structures may be adequately equipped to shelter in place on upper floors, based on hurricane assessments. The location of the generator would also be an important consideration for future work, but could not be included in the scope of the current study. Finally, mitigation measures are important. Mitigation projects have been explored and implemented at many facilities, but these could not be considered in the current study. This does however add support to the value of supplying facility-specific hurricane risk data to MSN decision-makers on the local and individual level. This would allow them to evaluate their facilities for potential mitigation measures, as well as to revisit their physical hurricane risks against implemented measures, and update hurricane emergency plans."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Modeling in GIS: Threshold Events for MSN Facilities -Can Anyone Shelter Safely in Coastal Louisiana for Hurricanes?", "text": "Coastal Louisiana MSN facilities and residences vary on some level regarding individual risk from storm surge, wind and other hurricane threats. They also vary widely by decision-strategies; both by decision criteria, and dominating factors that will ultimately prompt evacuation or support sheltering in place. However, what coastal Louisiana MSN facilities, residences and their patients share in common, based on the research evidence and outcomes of this study, is that ALL are exposed to serious flood and/or wind risks from hurricanes, and ALL will be exposed to less risk if they successfully evacuate a risk area well ahead of an approaching storm. The literature has supported that MSN patients everywhere are likely to share common risks to their health, regardless of setting, when hurricanes threaten, as both evacuation and sheltering in place carry risks. However, coastal Louisiana MSN sites are set apart in that they face severe threats from hurricanes when they shelter in place; they are perhaps among the most at-risk sites nationwide, given all compounding factors reviewed in this manuscript. The devastating impacts of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana support the urgency of conveying such findings to MSN decision-makers well before each hurricane season. While Category 3 hurricanes appear at first glance to be a threshold event for MSN facilities along the Louisiana coast as a whole (based solely on storm surge risk), this study has determined that a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico at 48-hours to landfall is the actual threshold storm event which should trigger MSN patient evacuation. Most concerning is that at 48 hours to hurricane landfall, the location where storms will make landfall across the Louisiana coast, and whether storms will undergo rapid intensification is unclear. Yet MSN decision-makers will need to decide whether they will evacuate or shelter in place by this time, or prior to this 48-hour window. The severity of storm surge risks; wind risks; the time needed to successfully evacuate; and additional added risks specific to coastal Louisiana as reviewed in this study together warrant the evacuation of MSN patients, regardless of cost, accepting (albeit, with the goal of greatly reducing) evacuation risks, for most storms."}, {"section_title": "Future Directions", "text": "The following examples briefly highlight some additional future directions which could help to further and improve upon this research."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Modeling in GIS", "text": "Modeling specific hurricane tracks and intensities for planning will be increasingly valuable as prediction technology, satellite technology and ocean monitoring evolve and improve. For example, the ADCIRC model 38 previously discussed is a very high resolution storm surge prediction tool ( Figure 31) with versions that were developed specifically for southeast Louisiana flooding, http://www.hurricane.lsu.edu/floodprediction/. As discussed, state and local emergency officials usually count down to hurricane landfall or \"L-hour\" (e.g., LA DHH), or to \"H-hour\" -the onset of tropical storm force winds (TSFW) on the coast (SEHTF 2007). The LSU experimental ADCIRC model has been run on subsequent updated advisories released by the NHC to support operational response, just as with SLOSH actual track model runs by NOAA, as hurricanes approach. It can also be run on 38 developed by Luettich, Westerink, Kolar and Dawson in partnership with numerous federal and academic partners (ADCIRC Development Group webpage, http://www.nd.edu/~adcirc/index.htm). hypothetical tracks and intensities for planning, to support training exercises, and to explore and identify threshold events that would overtop levees or flood certain areas. Briefly, ADCIRC has proven to be a reliable surge estimation model in recent storm events, such as Isidore, Lili, and Ivan, but most notably prior to Hurricane Katrina, as well as in current studies . However, the process to submit the model is complex and time intensive, even with direct access to supercomputing resources. 39 Improvements are continuously being made to the model, which has recently quadrupled in nodes (increasing resolution even more and enhancing other aspects of the model physics). However, refinements introduce new complexities and time constraints to running the model operationally. ADCIRC outputs, which provide latitude, longitude and predicted elevation values, can now be imported into a GIS for analysis. Model outputs (at 340,000 nodes) were provided by Dr. S. Hassan Mashriqui, PE, through the HPHC in a text file (x,y point data) for this study, to demonstrate future directions in hurricane GIS modeling (Figures 31a-b).  This method could be used to further refine analyses for MSN patient evacuation and sheltering decisions for both surge and wind fields (which are another ADCIRC output), and be viewed with SLOSH outputs in a GIS. Potentially, this analysis could offer finer resolution and insight for planning, to identify more precisely the priority evacuation sites for some storms based on storm surge risk. However, the analysis would necessarily incorporate added risk to MSN evacuation (since track and intensity at landfall are unknown at L-48), would be much more dependant on prediction and other technologies, and is still a single track model. Likely there would be few storm events before the analysis would begin to incorporate increasing levels of risk. Figure 32. Historical hurricane tracks which can be edited for central pressure, to modify storm strength and run as hypothetical storms in ADCIRC (NOAA CSC historical hurricane tracks in ERSI ArcGIS)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Wind Modeling", "text": "Similar to future directions in ADCIRC, specifically defined tracks (as in Figure 32) with input wind fields for Category 1, 2 and 3 hurricanes could be generated and run within the HAZUS model (Figures 12,(25)(26), to estimate wind and damage levels to structures in Louisiana for reference or future study. Coastal Louisiana MSN facilities that may opt to shelter in place perhaps outside of risk zones for storm surge could be more specifically evaluated with this data for planning purposes. Such analysis could also be valuable for future planning of storms where there is (1) high confidence of a landfall probability and (2) low potential for rapid intensification or other risks (such as rainfall and tornadic activity). Likewise, such an analysis could demonstrate a methodology for determining priority and risk zones if medical evacuation resources become limited, or if unforeseen problems arise in evacuating patients. As prediction technologies improve, and as difficult decisions are made regarding the balance of risk and cost between MSN evacuation and sheltering, such analyses will become more important. They could also hold value operationally. In addition to applying FEMA HAZUS as a potential future direction in wind field estimation, the NOAA NHC Hurricane Research Division (HRD) has started to release experimental surface wind field products in shapefiles, beginning with Hurricane Ivan in 2004 ( Figures 33a-c). The products are currently for research use only. These can be edited for hurricane symbology and imported into a GIS to be viewed with hurricane tracks, SLOSH models, MSN facilities, and other data layers. Similar to HAZUS, the surface wind fields are generated as part of the H*Wind experimental product in near-real time, combining surface weather observations from \"ships, buoys, coastal platforms, surface aviation reports, [and] reconnaissance aircraft data adjusted to the surface\" (NOAA AOML 2007d). Future directions may include a way to more accurately model hypothetical Cat 1 -3 hurricane tracks and wind intensities with HRD surface wind analysis layers to potentially demonstrate 'windows of opportunity' that would exist for MSN residents to shelter in place; although as discussed, this would be hard to apply at L-48, unless under special considerations or circumstances (e.g., a determined very low risk event). The same limitations would apply to using such a wind representation in a GIS for local planning; both in maintaining focus on surge and hurricane risk factors even before wind; and accurately explaining and representing data."}, {"section_title": "Incorporating MSN Data into 3D Image Viewers", "text": "3-dimensional imagery interfaces are hoped to be explored in future directions as well.

Another feature of model builder and scripting includes the output of results into not only tables, but reports, as well as creating new feature datasets for facilities impacted at each storm level."}, {"section_title": "Enterprise GIS for Medical Planning and Response", "text": "The future of GIS mapping of medical data for response is likely to develop out of a greater framework of databases in Enterprise GIS. In one of the paramount examples, GIS experts at the Louisiana State Department of Social Services (DSS) have been implementing \"TINA-GIS\" since Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005(McKeefry 2006, Lemoine pers comm 2006. TINA-GIS was developed as an anti-fraud system, using WebFOCUS -business intelligence (BI) software from Information Builders -along with GIS technology. However, it has since been developed to provide 'Disaster Business Intelligence and GIS' to numerous Federal and state agencies, including interdepartmentally (ibid). Through this award-winning system, Louisiana DSS can extract, transform and load or 'ETL' mainframe data, query and create graphs and reports, run spatial analysis, and \"interpret complex relationships that might otherwise be difficult to detect (ibid).\" Similar systems could provide invaluable information to state and local health officials and decision-makers and be applied towards MSN planning. Data can be queried and mapped, gathering information from databases across the state in seconds. Data can also be further analyzed, added to reports, or mapped. A similar application would be pivotal in medical response and mapping. There is an increasing level of GIS coordination and collaboration among Louisiana State agencies. Examples include the Louisiana GIS Council and expanding GIS capabilities centralized at the Louisiana GOHSEP. Critical response capabilities of GIS were tested during Hurricane Katrina in everything from search and rescue emergency GIS mapping to GIS maps for future recovery. However, medical GIS data can be used for many of the same emergencies, including hurricanes/flood; technological disasters; pandemic flu planning; and bioterror events/terrorism. Each has critical datasets, and some that could apply to all. For example, hospital surge capacity is a critical dataset which can be used in many levels of planning and response. Data integration in an enterprise GIS system will allow for increased interaction and access to critical data among agencies. Data management, querying, reporting and mapping database information, creating and sharing data layers, epidemiologic study support, and patient or evacuee tracking are just a few examples of the \"multimedia functionality\" (ESRI 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Refining the Science to Reduce MSN Evacuation in Coastal Louisiana", "text": "As hurricane prediction technologies improve, including methods for tracking not only the predicted landfall of a storm, but intensity, rainfall and other risks, there may be increased opportunity for hurricane research and models to be implemented towards more precise MSN planning for evacuation and sheltering. While the current study has concluded a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico to be the trigger for coastal Louisiana MSN facility evacuation, many may find this outcome excessively conservative or unrealistic. However, until the science further improves, refinements to planning that would allow facilities to shelter safely in place for hurricanes are difficult to support without accepting serious risk. van Heerden and Bryan (2006a), in discussing the National Hurricane Center hurricane \"projection cone\" indicate \"\u2026the best our science can ever achieve will be an error of 30 miles at one day (p. 48).\" This will likely always result then in at least a sixty mile error possibility at 48 hours to landfall, the difference between a hurricane strike in Lafayette versus Baton Rouge versus New Orleans, Louisiana. Meanwhile, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, which intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 4 Hurricane before making landfall on the Louisiana coast, may be an exception historically, representing only a small percent of storms that intensified this dramatically before landfall. Yet, hurricane intensification is not only based on warm Gulf waters or the presence of the Loop current, but also on climate conditions such as upper level winds. Climate will vary every season. Therefore, any hurricane, given the right conditions, could intensify as Audrey, and cause devastating impacts on MSN facilities. Nonetheless, in the future, with combined improvements in coastal restoration, the implementation of mitigation measures, and advancements in technology, hurricane research, modeling and methods, more MSN individuals in coastal Louisiana may be able to shelter safely in place. It is hoped the current project conclusions will prompt further investigation and action, exploring future possibilities of MSN sheltering in place. As an example, with increasingly better science, risk and evacuation priorities might be assigned to longitudinal zones based on increasing proximity to, and surge and wind impacts from, actual storm landfall; while assigning less risk and decreasing the evacuation priority of longitudinal zones further from actual landfall. In the interim, assessment of risk by applying hurricane modeling and GIS methods may help to prioritize MSN and medical evacuation for individuals and local decision-makers. Planning is also supported by overall risk zones or regions (either state health regions, or western, central and eastern coastal regions, etc) which can help to effectively manage increasingly complex public health threats. In another example, according to Lapolla (2003), evacuation and shelter strategies are not so limited, but may include different phases or levels such as \"sheltering in place without moving from a facility; sheltering in place vertically (moving up); evacuating just outside of the facility; evacuating to a nearby, like facility; evacuating to a distant facility; or evacuating to a shelter facility.\" These may become another area for study in reducing MSN evacuation. Other options open to MSN individuals and facilities include hurricane mitigation strategies, further assessment of their facilities, designing and building for hurricanes, and holding training for MSN decision-makers. Due to transportation agency and university research collaborations, hurricane evacuations are becoming increasingly efficient and successful. Estimates are that the Hurricane Katrina evacuation time of New Orleans was \"cut nearly in half, exceeding even the most optimistic prior projections by at least 40%; that is, an anticipated 72 hour evacuation was able to be executed in 28-36 hours (Wolshon/HPHC Report, .\" Meanwhile, across the board, MSN decision-makers note that early evacuation works. For example, home health patients and agencies that left 72 hours before projected hurricane landfall for Katrina \"avoided long waits,\" \"experienced less stress,\" and \"easily found\u2026 shelter space for their patients (Kirkpatrick and Bryan, 2007, p. 309).\" Nursing homes that left early reported having plenty of water and supplies, and even being able to open the windows on the school buses they were using on account of the pleasant weather (Nursing Home Administrators pers comm 2007). Patients experienced minimal stress, even approaching the trip as a welcome break or 'field trip (ibid).' Evacuating every time, and evacuating early, one coastal Louisiana nursing home demonstrates a culture of preparedness and practice which makes it possible to envision MSN evacuation without traffic, without serious accidents or injuries, and the safeguarding of patients against daunting hurricane risks.   by Maximum Windspeed at Landfall 40 Hurricane strikes in Louisiana in the first part of the past century .
