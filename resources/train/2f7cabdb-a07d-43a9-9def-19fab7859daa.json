AD is characterized by early loss of synapses in specific brain regions, beginning in the hippocampus and spreading to the neocortex and limbic system, eventually leading to memory impairments [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The loss of synapses in AD is greater than the loss of neurons in the cortex, indicating that the synaptic damage precedes the loss of neuronal cell bodies [6] [7] [8] [9] . Neuropathological studies have revealed that synaptic loss is already evident at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of AD [10, 11] . In addition, synaptic loss is closely related with the severity of clinical disease [5] . In view of the above reasons, if there is a biomarker that reflects this pathophysiological process, it may be used to study disease mechanisms, improve tools for early diagnosis, predict progression of disease, and monitor the effects of drugs on reducing the rate of synaptic degeneration in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD [12] . Therefore, biomarkers that can track synaptic dysfunction in AD may prove useful for more accurate disease staging as well as population enrichment of disease-modifying clinical trials [5] .\nSynaptic damage can be detected at the earliest stages of AD. MCI patients exhibit loss of presynaptic proteins such as synaptophysin and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 and postsynaptic markers such as postsynaptic density-95 and Shank 1 [13] . SNAP-25 is a widely distributed membrane-associated protein that is mainly localized in nerve terminals in the brain. Within the nerve terminals, SNAP-25 is involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasmalemma, a process essential for synaptic vesicular exocytosis [14] . A study has recently reported increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 in AD patients [15] .\nHowever, it is still unknown whether CSF SNAP-25 levels increase at the early clinical stage of AD, and whether CSF SNAP-25 is correlated with other core features of AD such as amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology, structural brain changes, and cognitive decline. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that CSF SNAP-25 levels and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio increase at every stage of AD and improve the diagnostic accuracy for AD compared with other core biomarkers. We also tested the hypotheses that CSF SNAP-25 levels and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio have associations with A\u03b2 pathology and changes in AD cognition and brain structure, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database description", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

The results demonstrate that SNAP-25 markers increase with disease severity and are able to distinguish between diagnostic groups. Finally, markers of synapse loss were predictive of clinical progression to dementia and neurodegeneration. For many years, the classic definition of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD was limited to the discovery of selective neuronal loss and astrogliosis. This concept, however, has now been extended to include neuroinflammation and synaptic loss [9] . Synaptic loss precedes neuronal loss and correlates with early deficits in memory formation [22] . SNAP-25 is a characteristic component of synapses and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. The absence of SNAP-25 may not stop neurotransmission, but it is associated with several physiological functions including synaptic vesicle release and recycling, neurite extension, neuron repair, and synaptogenesis [23, 24] . SNAP-25 is involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation and formation of long-term memory in the hippocampus CA3 region, which is consistent with its role in learning and memory functions in the hippocampal CA1 area [25] . Since previous studies have shown that SNAP-25 was detectable in CSF [26] , this presynaptic protein can be used as a biomarker to monitor the molecular pathogenesis of AD that was previously difficult to assess in living patients.\nCSF SNAP-25 was significantly increased in pMCI and AD compared with the cognitively normal. In the present study, we also show that pMCI patients had increased CSF SNAP-25 levels compared with sMCI individuals. SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio had the same trend in every diagnostic group. Interestingly, 19 cognitively normal subjects who progressed to MCI or AD during follow-up had increased SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio (but not SNAP-25) compared with the other cognitively normal subjects. This finding suggests that CSF SNAP-25, especially the SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio, is an early pathophysiological indicator of AD-related synaptic loss.\nTo investigate whether CSF SNAP-25 levels correlated with underlying A\u03b2 pathology, each group included in the study was dichotomized into A\u03b2 + and A\u03b2 -. As expected, the CSF SNAP-25 levels were significantly increased in the CSF AD A\u03b2 + group. Similarly, high CSF SNAP-25 levels were also found in the pMCI A\u03b2 + group. In addition, SNAP-25 and A\u03b242 were negatively correlated in pMCI patients. Currently, the general view is that AD progresses from CN A\u03b2 -to CN A\u03b2 + , MCI A\u03b2 + , and finally AD A\u03b2 + , while non-A\u03b2-dependent cognitive decline may progress from CN A\u03b2 -to MCI A\u03b2 -and AD A\u03b2 - [27] . In addition, t-tau and p-tau were strongly correlated with SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio in every diagnostic group, suggesting that SNAP-25 [28] or SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio may be a surrogate biomarker for future clinical treatment studies with tau-modifying drugs. Interestingly, we observed the strongest correlation between SNAP-25 and tau in sMCI patients. We do not know the specific reason for this, but we speculate that tau protein pathology plays a more important role in the pathogenesis of sMCI.\nIn the present study, our results show that CSF SNAP-25, especially SNAP-25/A\u03b242, offers diagnostic sensitivity for AD that is comparable with that of CSF A\u03b242, t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/A\u03b242, and p-tau/A\u03b242. CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 also have high diagnostic sensitivity for pMCI. In addition, SNAP-25/A\u03b242 appears to offer diagnostic sensitivity at least as well as the current \"gold standard\" prognostic biomarkers for AD, such as t-tau/A\u03b242 and p-tau/A\u03b242. These findings, therefore, suggest CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio as diagnostic biomarkers for the earliest symptomatic stage of AD.\nThere is accumulating evidence that synaptic loss is a surrogate for disease progression in AD [7] . To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the predictive value of SNAP-25 for the conversion from MCI to AD. Here, we demonstrate that CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 offer predictive value for future disease progression in MCI subjects. Our findings suggest that CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/A\u03b242 may complement the prognostic utility of CSF A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau in predicting the evolution of cognitive impairment.\nEvidence suggests that progressive neuronal and synaptic loss are the surrogate markers for cognitive deterioration in AD [7] . In the present study, although CSF SNAP-25 does not correlate with cognitive decline at baseline and follow-up, our results suggest that the SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio may offer predictive value for future cognitive impairment in cognitively normal subjects. In our study, 19 cognitively normal subjects who progressed to MCI or AD during follow-up had increased SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio compared with stably cognitive normal subjects, which implies that the combination of SNAP-25 and A\u03b242 (SNAP-25/A\u03b242) might be useful to follow progression of cognitive decline. However, SNAP-25 levels were similar between stably cognitive normal subjects and progressively cognitive normal subjects, and A\u03b242 levels in progressively cognitive normal subjects were less than those in stably cognitive normal subjects. Thus, these results do not suggest that SNAP-25 has added predictive value on top of A\u03b242 alone for cognitively normal subjects. We also found associations between high SNAP-25/A\u03b242 ratio and an increased rate of hippocampal atrophy. Given that synaptic dysfunction and loss are probably the major causes of the loss of neuropil underlying hippocampal atrophy [12] , we believe that SNAP-25/A\u03b242 may be an independent novel biomarker for synaptic pathology in AD, and the clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment and later dementia appear after neuronal injury and synaptic loss has reached a threshold in vulnerable brain regions. This study has limitations. First, our cases do not include non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and our study is not a pathological study; thus it lacks pathological evidence. Second, the ADNI database was volunteered by highly educated individuals for research focused on AD research. This may give rise to bias in choice because the study population is a self-selected individual who may have concerns about their cognition. Third, the convenience samples used in this study may limit the universality of our findings. Finally, the sample size of this study is relatively small. Therefore, it is necessary to replicate our results in larger population-based cohorts and to conduct research on the related mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, CSF SNAP-25, especially the SNAP-25/ A\u03b242 ratio, was already increased in the predementia stages of AD, and higher concentrations correlate with a higher rate of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy at some stages of AD.
