[{"section_title": "", "text": "This paper addresses the potential of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to measure education reforms in the United States through the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The overarching questions are: How can SASS best measure school reform? Should it measure the implementation or the effects of school reform? What are the elements of school reform that would best serve the needs of state and federal policymakers? To answer those questions, we describe school reform, suggest why it is important to measure, and describe the challenges and appropriateness of using SASS to assess its progress and effects. Section II describes eight reform elements that we propose as a framework for examining reforms that are important to measure. Section III examines the extent to which SASS and other large-scale surveys already measure reform, and Section IV summarizes our analysis and recommends how SASS could better collect data to provide a national window on the status and progress of reform. Appendices A and B summarize our framework of school reform elements and provide background information about the surveys we reviewed. Appendix C lists items from SASS and other surveys that could be used or modified to measure important school reform elements."}, {"section_title": "I. Defining School Reform", "text": "School reforms are changes occurring in schools and education administrative agencies that are designed to improve educational programs or outcomes or to correct institutional problems or defects. They include changes made to the programs, processes, and organizational systems where teaching and learning occur. According to education historians Tyack and Cuban (1996), reforms are either provoked by social or political upheavals or reflect internal improvements that individuals or institutions undertake in response to changing circumstances. Tyack and Cuban (1996) argue that reforms survive because they adhere to the \"pedagogical speed limit\" and quickly become a familiar part of the landscape and known elements of \"real school.\" Reforms that are institutionalized are typically noncontroversial programs and organizational add-ons that do not disrupt the status quo. Significantly, they have a following of policy leaders and influential educators who support their stability. Once reforms become an accepted part of the structure of schooling, they might be criticized, but they are rarely abolished. The high visibility of the federal reform policies of the 1990s and questions about their impact on districts and schools suggest the need for a nationally-representative data base on reform to guide policy making. Such reforms as state academic standards, aligned assessments, and systemic policies all indicate a growing need for data on how school and district operations have and will change in response to local, district, state, and national policy changes. The SASS surveys of teachers, schools, and districts may be adaptable to that task since SASS has already established a baseline of data on several key reform themes. Accessibility of up-to-date, accurate information about education outcomes has made data an essential element of the equation at many points in the policy planning and implementation process (Elmore, 1996). Policymakers, impatient with past uneven successes and frequent education policy changes, are seeking to ground new education initiatives on more solid evidence of program outcomes and student achievement (Odden & Clune, 1995). As analysts and practitioners become increasingly proficient in data-based decisionmaking, they become committed to using a respected data source such as SASS for periodic progress reporting on implementation. Although researchers and policymakers routinely conduct studies to assess the effects of new education initiatives and program innovations, it has been difficult to sustain a nationwide data collection effort about school change. Many reforms are often short-livedintroduced with great fanfare but only partially implementedand quickly replaced by a new reform before survey instruments can be adequately piloted and data collected, cleaned, and analyzed. Other reforms are ill-defined or illusive, requiring what Tyack and Cuban (1996) call \"careful detective work\" to assess the actual impact of proposals to improve schools. In the early phases of reform it is difficult to know exactly what to track. Tyack and Cuban (1996) suggest three reasons why this may be so: (1) the time lag between initiation and implementation of a reform; (2) the uneven penetration of reforms in various educational settings and communities; and (3) the difference in impact across social groups. In addition, as Baker (1996) and Jennings and Stark (1995) point out, educational reform as a political process is always in flux: \"What is 'hot' today is not tomorrow, but it may be back in ten years, \" Baker observed (1996, p. 33). In studying reforms during the 1960s and 1970s, McLaughlin (1990) concentrated on the policy impacts of the reforms. Retrospectively, she acknowledges that while her research to understand how reform occurred concentrated on how policies changed, it was the embedded structures in which teachers and schools worked that most influenced change (McLaughlin, 1990, p. 14). Reforms often fade for a number of reasons: because they are ill-defined, incompatible with assumptions about how schools work, or institutionalized and, therefore, they become invisible features of the educational landscape. Fluid terminology and education reform concepts make it difficult to collect national data about those initiatives that most affect schools, especially in the early stages when changes are just beginning to take shape. Common understandings of new and modified terminology evolve slowly and in concert with reform priorities, posing obvious problems when data collection requires a high level of specificity with which to construct reliable instruments."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "In the next sections, we describe general and specific criteria for selecting potential survey items for SASS that would track reform. We next distinguish between types of items that measure the implementation of school reform and the effect of that reform. Finally, we summarize the current SASS coverage and gaps in measuring reform, and then do the same for other large-scale and publicly available surveys. Appendix B summarizes the surveys we examined; Appendix C contains items from SASS and other surveys that hold potential for measuring reform."}, {"section_title": "Measurement Criteria", "text": "Recommendations from Boe (1996), Jennings and Stark (1996), , and Mullens (1995) provided general and specific criteria for selecting or developing SASS survey items on school reform. According to these general criteria, survey items should: School has formal mechanisms for coordinating with community agencies, for example, offering services dealing with child care, drug and alcohol abuse, and parental employment and training, etc. School participates in an external mentoring program, such as \"I Have a Dream,\" which follows students for several years School offers adult education programs and recreational opportunities for the community School has formal parent and community volunteer program School has formal arrangements with local employers to place students in career-ladder jobs during the school year, summers, and following high school graduation School has formal arrangements with institutions of higher education to assist students in continuing their schooling o Charting Reform, Principal Survey, 1994 In comparison, responses to a different sort of question provide information with which to measure the effect of school reform. The following question, for example, asks about one type of effect resulting from a restructured class schedule. Fifty-minute periods were introduced at the beginning of this school year. Now that most of the year has passed, please mark how you feel about them: (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly agree) The 50-minute period: Provides greater opportunity for student learning Reduces opportunities for teachers to work together Overall, is better for students Overall, is better to teachers I Charting Reform, Principal Survey, 1994 S S For measurable school reforms, SASS may be a very useful instrument. SASS was first administered in 1987-88 to provide data that would inform state and federal decisionmakers and the educational research community about public and private elementary and secondary schools. Its linked set of surveys and survey processes provide a network of interlocking data sets from different organizational elements at the classroom, school, and district levels. The surveys generate recurrent information on public and private elementary and secondary schools, teachers, and administrators that would be ideal for monitoring school reform or change over time. The data collected by the 1993-94 SASS fall into four general categories: Teacher supply, demand, and attrition, with attention to critical shortage areas and the 5 policies and practices to meet the demand in those areas The professional characteristics, preparation, and experience of teachers and administrators, their perceptions of school conditions, professional responsibilities, decision making, and compensation The conditions and characteristics of the school as a work and learning place, including characteristics of the student body, curriculum, special programs, and organizational structure The availability of school programs and policies such as English as a second language, bilingual education, diagnostic and prescriptive services, and programs for the gifted and talented  These topics remain an important core of the next SASS, and the survey could provide a proper home for items exploring related reform issues. In two separate efforts, experts have suggested that NCES would be wise to improve the scope and the usefulness of all data collection on school reform efforts (Hoachlander, Griffith, & Ralph, 1996;Mullens & Kasprzyk, 1996). Participants in the 1996 NCES seminars on new directions for SASS suggested that SASS investigate school reform efforts within broad educational categories at district, school, and teacher levels in four distinct dimensions of reform (Mullens & Kasprzyk, 1996): Classroom curriculum and instructional processes"}, {"section_title": "Elements of school organization and resource allocation Professional development of teachers", "text": "The use of technology in classrooms Collecting data on specific elements of education reform will establish a baseline for a continuing analysis of the evolution of schools, teachers, and students. SASS evidence about the presence or absence of key features of schooling can provide the first large-scale base of information on the existence or evolution of education reform. To date, studies of reform have typically relied on case studies and more limited surveys than SASS. A survey data base developed through SASS could describe the impact national education reforms have at the school and district levels in ways heretofore impossible. Significantly, a SASS data base on reform could also make possible systemic studies on the relationships between educational outcomes and specific reform practices."}, {"section_title": "Delineating School Reform", "text": "Our review of recent research on education reform catalogued a wide array of topics that have been, or are being, actively explored and promulgated by education experts. The topic list below places school reforms within the broadened educational context in which they occur. We have 6 13 organized the framework into eight topics that affect student learning through teachers, classrooms, and schools. The topics reflect (1) Baker's (1996) and Boe's (1996) suggestion that SASS concentrate on the changes that occur at the district, school, and teacher level, and (2) other analysts' emphasis on studying reforms that help set high expectations for learning among children and capacity building among professionals (Choy, 1996;Stodolsky, 1996). The eight topics are: "}, {"section_title": "Technology", "text": "This framework is intended to be comprehensive and include the major issues currently being advocated. Many of the most visible reforms are relatively new, tried in comparatively few schools and districts, and still being defined. Final discourse about which of these reform components SASS should track depend on selection criteria that we address in Section DI of this paper. This section reviews briefly the research underlying each topic. Appendix A summarizes the framework.\nTechnology is a critical resource for restructuring school organization, management, teaching and learning, and evaluation. David (1991) observes that technology can transform what organizations look like, how they function, and how people interact within them. Introducing technology into schools connects teachers, students, and managers to vast information resources, and provides tools for changing the ways schools accomplish their goals, including using computers, distance learning mechanisms, and various media and technological tools and instruments used in all content areas. Fulton (1996) states that educational use of technology accomplishes three goals: it (1) enhances instruction by providing teachers with new ways of teaching; (2) results in greater teacher productivity; and (3) supports teacher learning. To these we add a fourth: educational use of technology contributes to more efficient and responsive management decision making by organizing the flow of resources into classrooms; planning and scheduling classes, teams, and activities; and collecting, evaluating, and using data. Fulton also points out that, to date, the primary information gathered by SASS about technology are counts of computers available in schools. This is only one piece of a more complex puzzle. She concludes that data collection should also define the effect of state policies on access to technology; how computers are actually used by teachers and students; and their impact on teaching and learning. We suggest incorporating these themes into five broad areas that can yield information about how technology supports student learning by streamlining management and reforming how teachers and students work in schools: Developing and using technology-based information systems in school and district management and communication To assess the potential for documenting reform through SASS, we first reviewed items in the 1993-94 SASS to identify (1) existing items that address reform themes and (2) gaps in reform III measurement in the current SASS. We then reviewed instruments used in recent large-scale surveys of reform to identify other items that could be adapted for SASS. SASS already measures many aspects of reform topics in our framework. The largest number of SASS items addressing reform are in governance and infrastructure; the delivery of professional development; programs and services for varied populations; and career patterns, mobility, and compensation. There are fewer items on classroom instructional practices; certain dimensions of professional development among teachers; family and community partnerships; educational productivity; and technology. No SASS items document school finance reform, but there are SASS items on labor markets, compensation, and recruitment. SASS items for each of the eight reform areas are examined in further detail below. Governance and organizational infrastructure. SASS currently has a substantial number of questions about governance and organizational infrastructure (see Appendix C1); most focus on policy-making structures, such as the item below. They target reforms dealing with school-based management, teacher authority and autonomy, and the perception of decision-making power within a II school. However, SASS currently collects no information on waivers or the flexibility of rules."}, {"section_title": "Governance and Organizational Infrastructure", "text": "Hannaway and Carnoy (1993, p. 232) describe policymakers' affection for altering the governance of schools as a \"fatal attraction.\" These authors note that when schools and society appear to be \"in trouble,\" policymakers seek \"solutions\" by changing the organizational structures of schools. The result is that governance has become the major policy instrument of recent reforms, offering a smorgasbord of choices for how to organize and manage schools. Our review of the research highlighted six clusters of governance and organizational activity:"}, {"section_title": "Policy making structures", "text": "Organizational arrangements of schools Staffing and managing of state and local education agencies and schools Organizing uses of learning/teaching time in schools (see also classroom instructional practices) Institutional capacity building for managers and school leaders Organizational influences of the courts New policy making structures for guiding schools have emerged since the 1960s when the federal government began to insist on equal access to good schools for minority and poor children. Federal activism began with the government's oversight of its investments in civil rights and stepped up with its support for curriculum innovation and services to students with special needs resulting from poverty, limited-English speaking ability, or disability (Odden, 1991). Eventually the federal government tightened its program monitoring and reporting requirements, and state and local governing agencies adapted their policies to meet evolving federal standards. With each new program strategy and funding cycle, both federal and state government officials sought to shape how districts and schools administered supplementary funds. Federal and state agreements on policy implementation escalated the policy making at every layer in the governance structure, strengthening the influence over school policy making by legislatures, state and local school boards, and various interest groups. Moreover, new stakeholders--business alliances, political groups, and collaboratives-have become more influential partners in school policy making ( Fuhrman, Clune, & Elmore, 1988, in Odden 1991). Evolving policy making structures also promote staffing and management autonomy with incentives and sanctions to improve student and school accountability for educational outcomes (Fuhrman & O'Day, 1996). Inducements such as regulatory flexibilityespecially when combined with adequate professional development, collaboration, and continual retraininghave also changed the policy making structures that influence school improvements (Wohlstetter & Mohrman, 1994). Alternative organizational arrangements of schools grew out of the lessons learned from the effective schools movement of the 1970s. Emerging private sector management concepts contributed focused ideas about how schools can be better organized and more efficiently managed . Some districts encouraged dividing schools with large populations into small, personalized groups taught by teaching teams in \"houses\" or \"cadres.\" Others altered traditionally graded elementary and junior high schools into developmentally responsive primary (for example, multi-graded kindergarten through second or third grades), upper elementary, and middle school programs to reflect emerging research on the specialized educational needs of children at different phases of development. State legislatures established laws promoting publicly-funded alternative structures such as magnet programs, schools-within-schools, or private or quasi-private schools 8 15 a 111 chartered by groups of parents or teachers to create ways for parents to increase their school choices (Hannaway & Camoy, 1993). Such laws allow students to (a) move within and between districts to attend schools; (b) take college or university courses; (c) enroll in residential and special high schools for academically talented students; and (d) participate in academies and special focus schools for students who need special help or who have talents that would benefit from intensive training (Fossey, 1992). The federal government encouraged \"systemic\" staffing and management reforms to bring increased coherence to how federal, state, and local education agencies use funds to improve school efficiency and responsiveness (Smith & O'Day, 1991). The 1994 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) reauthorization, National Science Foundation funds, and Goals 2000 encourage states to re-examine policies on school and district organization, curriculum and evaluation, teacher preparation, licensure, and retraining (Massell, Kirst, & Hoppe, 1996). Systemic reforms include decentralization policies that replace regulation with flexibility and emphasize site-based management that gives principals, staffs, and community decision-making teams greater autonomy over the day-today decisions that affect student learning (Wohlstetter & Mohrman, 1994). The premise of these reforms is that deregulation and program flexibility can lead to more effective classroom and school instruction that (1) is content-focused, (2) is well-planned and organized, and (3) emphasizes student mastery of rigorous curriculum content (Corcoran & Wilson, 1986;Purkey & Smith, 1983), even in schools with high concentrations of low income and educationally disadvantaged students . Recent governance reforms have even examined traditional time constraints that rule the school day, the school year, and teachers' use of time for teaching and planning, finding that traditionally structured schedules are the \"unacknowledged design flaw in American schools\" (National Education Commission on Time and Learning, 1994). Despite efforts to make substantial adjustments, however, only marginal changes occur in the quality and quantity of students' time for learning or in how teachers allocate their own professional time (Adelman, Has lam, & Pringle, 1995). Studies of the effects of operating schools year-round also fail to provide conclusive information about the relative merits of changing how schools distribute time across the 12-month calendar year (Pechman, O'Brien, & Mullen, 1995). This suggests the need for an information base on the (1) amounts and ways teachers use time while \"on the clock\" in school and on unpaid, personal time; (2) the ways student time is allocated in the day, the week, and the year; (3) the extent to which communities experiment with alternative uses of the school building during low-use periods throughout the year; and (4) the effects on student learning, especially achievement among children with different learning needs, and teachers' beliefs about their working conditions. Institutional capacity building is necessary to prepare school personnel at every point in the system --from school to school board--for new leadership roles and different kinds of managerial responsibilities. If schools are to become high performance organizations, managed by teachers and principals, all the players within and surrounding themstate and district managers, staffs, and community memberswill need to develop a common vision that significantly alters current expectations about the goals of schools and the means to accomplish those goals. Moreover, for decentralized management to be effective, there must be tight policy coordination among the three levels of governance to which schools are accountable, and adequate organizational capacity building through technical assistance, professional development, and resources (GAO, 1993). These adjustments are large in scale, and, thus far, the evidence suggests that the likelihood of stabilizing such dramatic organizational reforms remains an open question. According to Wohlstetter & Mohrman, \"there is scant evidence that schools get better just because decisions are made by those closer to the classroom\" (1994, p. 1). Finally, the courts are expected to have a substantial effect on American schooling as school reforms are designed to address equity issues.  speculate that \"the bold education reforms of the 1990s could very well stimulate a wide array of new federal court decisions on education policy,\" and that \"the courts could become the surprise partner of education reform,\" requiring programs that eliminate educational differences across racial lines and equalize funding (p. 325). Four organizational areas where the courts are most likely to act are: (1) school funding and resources allocation; (2) desegregation and educational equity; (3) racially or ethnically related differences in students' achievement of educational standards, as measured by new assessments; and (4) private and parochial school programs, including the uses of vouchers and charters to support nonpublic school programs. Governance and organizational infrastructure are lively arenas of policy making reform, but many of the initiatives receiving the greatest policy attention are relatively new and still developing. Interest in collecting data about these reforms through SASS must be tempered by the uncertainty about which components will become long-term features of schools and educational organizations."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Instructional Practices", "text": "If improved outcomes are the evidence that school reform is benefiting students, measuring the curriculum enacted in classrooms and the instructional approaches selected by teachers are the best information sources about the progress of school reform. Organizational structures can shift and professional development in reform methods can occur, but no reform will have been achieved if students' learning activities in school remain unchanged. Mullens (1995) and Mullens and Leighton (1996) reviewed the evidence of reforms in the broad realm of classroom instructional process and identified four dimensions that have potential value for understanding the evolution of professional practices in classrooms and the opportunity of students to learn: Conditions and context of learning"}, {"section_title": "Course content and emphasis", "text": "Instructional activities of teachers and students"}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": "The current reform movement appears to be emphasizing new models of instruction that engage students actively in learning higher-order thinking skills. Past emphasis on \"basic\" skills, minimum competencies, and passive drill and practice teaching has shifted toward high expectations for all students to develop proficiency in problem-centered and rigorous academic courses. Systemic reforms assume that the intended curriculum is set at the district level and is constant within classrooms and across contexts within the district. While a curriculum emphasizing problem solving, reasoning, and long-term projects may be common within a school or district, the instructional pedagogy to achieve that curriculum may differ across classrooms (Stodolsky, 1996). High-quality instruction also requires adequate educational resources, including physical materials and technology that work in tandem with skilled pedagogy (Corcoran & Goertz, 1995, among others). Adequacy of resources is a cross-cutting theme central to high-quality classroom instructional practice and several other dimensions in this taxonomy. These dimensions are potential priority areas for SASS assessment because they are strongly related to student achievement and amenable to policy making. Collecting information about reform effects on the teaching that occurs behind the classroom door is an elusive base of information that researchers are still learning about (Porter & Smithson, 1995). Current and recent NCES-funded projects explore data collection about curriculum and classroom pedagogy within one content area and a limited range of grade levels (Mullen & . A challenge for SASS will be to select those aspects of classroom activities that can be adequately captured in a periodic survey, conducted across all subjects and grades."}, {"section_title": "Professional Development of Teachers", "text": "In a recent review, Mullens, Leighton, LaGuarda, and O'Brien (1996) established the following taxonomy of measurable elements of professional development: Design of professional development: the connection with broad school improvement goals and responsiveness to teacher and organizational needs Delivery of the professional development: the options for teachers, types and duration of activities, and uses of available professional resources Content of the professional development: the subject matter, instructional strategies, and organizational skills Context in which professional development occurs: the institutional support, financing, and school culture Outcomes of development activities, including changes in teachers' knowledge/attitudes and classroom practices, in schools, and in students Reformers are calling on teachers to make radical changes in their curriculum and instructional practices and professional development is the proposed vehicle (Corcoran & Goertz, 1995). Professional development entails increasing the ability of teachers and the supportive institutions around them to work more effectively, expanding the substantive knowledge of what is to be taught, and providing better pedagogical tools to ensure that all students accomplish the goals set by their teachers and communities. Cohen (1995) and Corcoran and Goertz (1995) (see also Fuhrman & O'Day, 1996) suggest that building professional capacity to meet emerging standards requires changing at least two aspects of instruction. First, teachers need to improve their knowledge of the content they teach and their knowledge of content-related pedagogy. Second, teachers must relinquish low expectations for students with special educational or language needs and from poor and minority families. Data about the professional development of teachers provides the basis for charting and understanding the professional capacity building in schools, its prevalence, and its change over time. Collecting such data assumes that the goal of professional development is to improve the quality of teaching by improving teachers' skills in assessment, classroom management, pedagogy, and content expertise. Indicators about the content and quality of teachers' professional advancement activities show the degree to which the capacity-building initiatives that schools and districts are undertaking amidst reform occur in the areas of instruction that researchers advocate."}, {"section_title": "I Programs and Educational Services for Varied Populations", "text": "Social change will place new pressure on schools to provide all students with expanded school services. The changing needs of students in public and private schools will require systems to address intense stress factors in students' lives. Poverty, unstable family structures, and increasing numbers of students with special needs make clear that schools will be called on to cope with the resulting challenges. SASS can offer a descriptive data base about the changing services that schools are providing."}, {"section_title": "Data are needed in six categories:", "text": "Services for students with special educational needs, learning disabilities, and learning abilities Services for limited-English speaking students Services for youth and families Services for individual students at risk of educational failure Cross-cultural programs to serve various immigrant populations Supplementary educational and recreational services (including preschool and before and after-school programs) During the past several decades, educators separated special services for high needs students into remedial or supplementary programs. Unfortunately, this approach unnecessarily stigmatized students and diluted rather than enhanced their opportunities for learning (Milsap, Moss, & Gamse, 1993). As a result, current reforms encourage the \"inclusion\" of at-risk students in the same programs as their age peers to reduce isolation and increase the substantive quality of their opportunities for learning. Instruction for all children is expected to focus on solving complex, meaningful problems that connect \"everyday\" and \"school\" knowledge; embed basic skills instruction in context; make connections between students' prior knowledge and their culture; build on the social nature of learning through small and whole group discussions; and focus on developing thinking skills from the earliest grades. The 1994 Improving America's Schools Act (IASA) deliberately encourages a \"schoolwide\" approach to serving students at risk, and, in time, future special services and resources may be wholly integrated within mainstream academic programs. Data collection should track information on school trends in serving at-risk students; classroom strategies and school district supplementary services for high-risk students; and services for students and families at risk, including preschool programs, extended school-day activities, and recreation programs."}, {"section_title": "Family and Community Partnerships", "text": "Researchers have documented the strong connection between parent and community participation in schools and higher achievement among students. Regardless of student age, family income, or parent education, family involvement in schools seems to increase the likelihood of students' academic success (U.S. Department of Education, 1994, September). National (Epstein, 1992) and international studies (Stevenson & Stigler, 1992) indicate that parent involvement and student motivation improve when schools welcome parents and reach out to help parents improve children's learning at home. Epstein's research (1995;Epstein & Hollifield, 1996) establishes a conceptual framework for understanding the expanded, two-way context in which parents and communities can and need to support schools. Those elements include: The evolving concept of family and community partnerships draws together three overlapping \"spheres of influence\" on childrenfamilies, schools, and communitiesthat influence their learning and development (Epstein, 1995). These partnerships involve schools and community members collaborating in large and small ways on behalf of children. Schools help parents develop their skills as children's \"first teachers;\" parents and community members volunteer in classrooms as assistants and teachers or mentors. Communication occurs through various means, including newsletters, cable television broadcasts, and written \"compacts\" that define shared expectations and responsibilities among schools and parents. Schools formalize new decision-making roles for parents that routinely involve parents and community representatives in planning and program implementation. Community groups devise collaborations among businesses; social services agencies; and universities, colleges, and community colleges to lend support to students and families (Epstein, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "I I I I", "text": "The federal government under Title I of IASA is encouraging states, districts, and schools to write constituency-based partnerships plans that describe how parents and other community representatives can become involved in designing and implementing continuous school improvements.

Other IASA components encourage schools to develop linkages with health and social services agency linkages and business partnerships to advance schoolto-work alliances. We can expect expanded programs to help parents support their children's learning at home (LaGuarda, Funkhouser, Stief, Gonzales, Goldstein, & Murphy, 1996). SASS can be a resource to determine the extent of these practices and to assess their impact in varied school contexts."}, {"section_title": "Finances and Human Resources Development", "text": "Education reformers are likely to call for redesigned finance systems and new strategies for identifying, recruiting, and compensating school staffs. Three priority areas have emerged: Finance strategies, including changes in federal, state, and local finance systems Equity attained by expanding programs and increasing resources to prevent school failure and enhance school success New salary structures, policies for recruitment, compensation, and certification Finance and resource data collection involve the scope of public school funding: programmatic, human, and capital resources, and the mechanisms to account for per pupil spending (Chambers, 1996). As education funding increases, the amount states and districts allocate varies across school districts within states, and it varies unequally. Site-oriented fiscal policy initiatives such as charter schools, public choice, vouchers, private contracting, and school-site budget management influence the equitability of resources distribution (Odden, 1990). In addition, if decentralized management places greater fiscal and administrative burdens on schools and local districts, there will be further need for comparative finance and resource data. Legislatures and local school districts are likely to call for data they can use to identify new strategies for equalizing school funding and to set equity targets for distributing state and federal aid . Teacher compensation policy, incentive systems, and certification programs are three resource issues likely to increase in importance. Massell et al. (1996)  in which states are developing new policies: salaries and incentives, preservice training, inservice training, certification, and evaluation. States continue to experiment with teacher incentive systems. They are seeking to incorporate principles of skill-based pay, school-based performance awards, and pay for the specific job (Kelley & Odden, 1995), making school-based incentive programs such as those in South Carolina, Kentucky, and Texas may become more widespread (Massell et al., 1996). Certification programs are becoming more complex as states add new dimensions or requirements to traditional certification. By 1990, 30 states mandated some form of testing as part of their certification requirement; life-time licensure had been virtually abolished; and recertification required teaching experience and continued formal training. Finally, more states and districts are compensating teachers for participating successfully in national or state board certification programs, with interest growing in the certification program offered by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (Massell et al., 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Productivity", "text": "Educational productivity refers to educational results, usually indicated by important outcomes such as: the number and competence of high school graduates; overall student achievement; the number of students enrolling in higher education and postsecondary career development programs; achievement in high poverty schools; and the performance gap between minority and white students (Odden & Clune, 1995). Attention to productivity is consistent with the results orientation advocated by educational reformers (Smith & O'Day, 1991). Reformers advocate that schools set new, more ambitious expectations for students, including: rigorous \"standards\" that define a broader and deeper core of content expectations; pedagogy that emphasizes group work, discussion and writing, and discourse and debate (Fuhrman & O'Day, 1996); student assessment as a component of instruction (Boe, 1996;Chambers, 1996); indicators of school-level accountability and the rewards and sanctions that motivate educational productivity (Odden & Clune, 1995). Research suggests four aspects of educational productivity can inform our understanding of reform: New approaches to productivity analysis reflect changing expectations for what schools should be accomplishing. \"Standards\" have become an important component of instructional reform. The initial conceptualization of systemic reforms in the early 1990s made content and performance standards (the material students could demonstrate \"they know and can do\" as a result of a rigorous academic program) the centerpieces of policies for raising expectations for learning (Fuhrman, 1993;Smith & O'Day, 1991). How student achievement is measured is an important and changing component of the standards-based reforms initiatives. The reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act requires that all states receiving federal education funding test students at least once during the early elementary, middle school, and high school years in reading or language arts and mathematics. States and LEAs increasingly use a variety of standardized and teacher-made tests to monitor local performance, report outcomes for accountability, and provide evidence that Title I schools are achieving \"adequate yearly\" academic progress. Testing is also changing in type and purpose. Policymakers are now looking toward tests referenced to specific standards or objectives that measure students' extended performances via short tasks, essays, and individual and group \"projects.\" Some states are developing combination assessment systems that report both norm-referenced and criterion-based performance information to meet both state and federal expectations (Massell et al., 1996). States such as Arizona, California, and Vermont that took the lead in developing ambitious performance tests in the early 1990s encountered considerable political opposition and are again rethinking their testing programs. Still other states (among them Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, and Massachusetts) continue to press forward with innovative testing on variously modified time schedules (Blank, Pechman, & Goldstein, forthcoming). SASS data on types of student assessments will aid policymakers in their efforts to understand the effects of the changes they make. Indicators of school accountability and student progress include the number of academic courses required for graduation; postsecondary education participation; minority participation in postsecondary education programs; and the achievement of students on national and international tests (Massell et al., 1996;Odden & Clune, 1995). Rewards and sanctions are being explored as mechanisms for ensuring an accountability and outcomes orientation. \"In a perfect world,\" writes Cohen (1995), \"one would not need to discuss rewards and penalties,\" but rewards and penalties are mechanisms used increasingly to signal what is most valued and to recognize those who achieve the valued goals. Questions about what rewards and penalties are best suited to improving student achievement, and who should be rewarded, have become important aspects of current reforms ( Fuhrman & O'Day, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "25.", "text": "Using SASS also includes a number of items regarding the organizational arrangements of schools, asking questions about the existence of magnet programs, vocational programs, and early childhood education programs, as well as seeking classification of school type and class type. One of these SASS items --the item below on tech-prep programshas been criticized for not being specific enough in its definition of such programs (Choy, 1996). The item defines tech-prep broadly and omits a unique and defining aspect of such programs. The resulting data may overestimate the prevalence of such programs since \"almost any school with a vocational program could respond affirmatively to this question.\" 29c.

These items could be modified to generate more detail, and expanded to include other alternative organizational arrangements such as year-round schooling, charters, vouchers, and schools within schools. The SASS surveys also contain a few items regarding the availability of medical services, alternative scheduling, and uses of learning /teaching time. Some SASS items also explore an organization's capacity to build and sustain the ability to respond appropriately to social and organizational demands (see Appendix C1).

SASS. currently collects information about student requirements for graduation, school graduation rates, and rates of student applications to college (see Appendix C7). SASS does not seek information on student assessment and achievement, rewards, sanctions, and competition to motivate achievement. Technology. School reforms in technology, like programs and services for varied populations, can initially be measured by learning about the existence and availability of technologically advanced materials (Appendix C8).

We examined more than 25 surveys; only 17 were appropriate for our purposes. We sorted items by the reform elements they addressed, then compared stems, response options, and formats. We found substantial duplication II among surveys; for instance, several surveys use items that are very similar to SASS items in areas such as perceptions of decision making power within schools or the existence of programs for special populations. Many of the existing survey items on reform are perception questions, subject to types of response bias that limit accuracy and reliability. Other items are more descriptive, showing the outcomes of reforms in more measurable terms, such as the extent of teachers' knowledge and use of standards. There were also major gaps in the collection, with no items addressing some of the framework elements. Some survey items cover more than one element and sometimes several elements are addressed within a single item. The items included below are examples of the best items currently available. Governance and organizational infrastructure. In the surveys examined for this study, the issues of policy making structures, staffing and management, and uses of time are covered more thoroughly than the issues of organizational arrangements of schools and court influences on school organization (see Appendix C1). Seventeen survey items collect information on policy making structures, with most items soliciting teacher and principal perceptions about influence and control. As mentioned earlier, several items appear to be modeled after SASS items. For example, variations of the following SASS item appear in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS), the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Charting Reform, Reform Up Close, and Prospects: 44.

Most of the items in this category collect information about the existence and availability of programs for varied populations. They do not provide detailed information about the characteristics of such educational services or school strategies to prepare varied populations to achieve high academic standards within mainstreamed classrooms. Family and Community Partnerships. This element of reform is covered extensively in other surveys (see Appendix C5), primarily through the research of the Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning (Epstein & Salinas, 1993) and recent Fast Response Surveys from NCES that focus on education reform and family-school partnerships. Most of these items are couched in terms of traditional parent roles, such as attending teacher association meetings, parentteacher conferences, and attending or chaperoning school events. a a S I S Some items cut across the reform themes identified in our framework, addressing communication with families and communities and volunteering in the schools. Several items listed in the framework under Governance and Organizational Infrastructure section also address parent involvement in decision-making structures.

Parents are given written information about the school's overall performance on standardized tests. Few items attempt to learn about the critical two-way partnerships that schools are building with homes and communities, which some researchers say are essential for ensuring that all students attain high academic standards. Only one item solicits information on the practice of school staff in conducting home visits (Appendix C5) and four items collect data on parent-school compacts (Appendix C5). These are the only attempts at documenting such two-way partnerships. Another item, shown below, collects data on schools' interactions with community groups.

We found no items that addressed the use of technology in school and district communication or establishing and maintaining program and student accountability."}, {"section_title": "IV. Summary and Recommended Approach", "text": "For this study, we reviewed the literature on education reform and identified eight elements of reform that directly affect schools and can potentially be measured by SASS: governance and organizational infrastructure; classroom instructional practices; professional development (of teachers); programs and educational services for varied populations; family and community partnerships; finances and human resource development; educational productivity; and technology (Appendix A). We then reviewed the 1993-94 SASS and over 25 additional large-scale survey instruments measuring components of reform (Appendix B) to identify potential survey items that could be used to document the status and evolution of these topics (Appendix C). In this section, we summarize our findings and offer recommendations on how SASS can collect data on the status and progress of education reform. SASS already measures some aspects of school reform. The largest number of items addressing reform are in governance and infrastructure, the delivery of professional development, and programs and services for varied populations. NCES-sponsored development work that has already occurred and other available large-scale survey instruments offer potential items to measure classroom instructional practices, dimensions of professional development among teachers, family and community partnerships, and a selection of topics within finance, educational productivity, and technology. While we identified numerous items in other large-scale surveys that measure some aspects of reform topics, many would need modification to measure school reform comprehensively. Items that address some reform subtopics are too narrowly focused or elicit perceptions instead of direct evidence of reform implementation. Documenting school reform more fully requires additional developmental work such as expanding existing items and designing and pilot testing new items. Governance has become the major policy instrument of recent reforms, offering a wide array of proposals for modifying traditional policy making structures, school organizational arrangements, and professional roles and relationships. This is also the area with the largest number of existing SASS items on reform. For example, questions in the current SASS track policy making structures, school-based management, shared decision making, and teacher authority and autonomy, but there are aspects of each of these subtopics that are not measured. No items gather information on year-round schools, charter schools, vouchers, and schools within schools. Furthermore, no items generate information on how waivers, a key feature of the recent federal legislation, increase the flexibility of school programs and instructional options, especially in schools serving students at risk. Finally, no items address the influence of the courts on schools, although policy researchers anticipate the courts will continue to be a strong influence on education nationally, especially in matters related to the equitable distribution of state and local resources. The enacted classroom curriculum and teachers' instructional approaches to help students become competent thinkers in core content areas can be indicators of school reforms. Previous NCES item development to measure classroom instructional practices and teachers' professional development has resulted in draft items in these areas. The proposed instructional processes and professional development items will be piloted in 1997 . The current SASS and other survey instruments include items for collecting basic information about programs and educational services for varied populations and family and community partnerships. These items, however, do not capture adequate information about the characteristics of before-and-after school programs, preschool and other early childhood education, and expanded health and human services for youth, families, and students at risk, among other educational services. They also do not generate information about the strategies schools use to prepare varied populations to achieve high academic standards within mainstreamed classrooms. Although researchers suggest that helping all students attain high academic standards is strengthened by two-way partnerships between the school and the parents/community, available items primarily capture information about traditional connections between home and school such as parent conferences, participation at school meetings, and volunteering. Missing are items to document those partnerships and other new initiatives in parent education. Many schools and districts are rethinking their finance systems and initiating new strategies to identify, recruit, and compensate professional staff. SASS gathers interesting data on recruitment and compensation of teachers, but it could collect more on financing structures, taxation policies, and new mechanisms for distributing resources. There exist a rich set of questions about standards setting, testing, and teachers' use of standards, but items do not capture quality indicator information about the alignment of accountability policies, standards, and methods for assessing and reporting students' achievement of harder content and thinking capacities. Upgrading available technology and applying technological tools to a wide array of management and instructional functions in schools is recognized as essential to achieving the national education goals. With few exceptions, however, available technology items collect information at such a fine level of detail that they may not be appropriate for a general K-12 survey. Moreover, they do not address the wide array of emerging technology applications to management, assessment, productivity analysis, classroom instruction, or professional development."}, {"section_title": "Recommended Approach", "text": "Although specific reforms are sometimes amorphous and difficult to define, education reform is big business and affects how schools, teachers, and students work. NCES needs to be in the forefront of data collection about school reform. We recommend a framework (Appendix A) for defining the central topics that reflect current reforms which most directly influence classroom instruction and student learning. They can be used to determine which items in SASS and other large-scale surveys can be used or modified to measure the progress of reform through SASS. We identified items from the 1993-94 SASS that could be used to measure school reform within the eight reform topics (Appendix C). Some SASS items that only touch on reform topics can be modified or extended to increase their utility to measure school reform; other items require substantial revision to reflect the language and structure of reform. Assessing the existence and the extent of school reform with a large-scale nationally representative survey is vital yet difficult. Researchers have discovered the trials of anticipating in the early stages which reforms will endure since some reforms are transitory, ill-defined, invisible, and create their own terminologies. Nevertheless, recent federal legislation has actively promoted innovation in state and local policy making to achieve systemwide improvements to the nation's schools, and researchers and other educational policy analysts and advisors have encouraged NCES to document the resulting implementation and enduring effect of reforms. The next SASS provides a unique opportunity to monitor the effect of these major initiatives on conditions in classrooms, schools, and districts, and to create a nationally and state-representative data base from which policymakers, education officials, and researchers can identify and understand school reform in the  Grade-level configurations: Traditionally graded configurations (elementary, junior/middle, high school); career/vocational centers/schools/components; community and \"middle\" colleges 1.22 New choices in public school organizational arrangements: charter schools; specialized academies and magnet programs; schools-within-schools; yearround schools; charter schools Organizing uses of learning /teaching time in schools (see also classroom instructional practices) 1.41 Supplemental academic programs for students 1.42 New calendar arrangements (longer school days; before and after school program courses and student assistance; longer school years) 1.43 Flexibility of schedules for children and teachers within the school day 1.44 Creating time for professional planning and within-school collaboration  (Mullens, 1995;Mullens & Leighton, 1996) "}, {"section_title": "7.4", "text": "Rewards, sanctions, and competition to motivate achievement 7.41 Alternative high school diplomas (for students) 7.42 Awards for teachers and schools (for school staffs) 7.43 School takeovers and other strategies for reforming failing schools 7.44 Intra-and interdistrict competition for students"}, {"section_title": "8.", "text": "Technology: This is a cross-cutting theme that both supports and promotes reform and changing instructional practices.
