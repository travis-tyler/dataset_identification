[{"section_title": "", "text": "The canonical drivers of population genetic structure, or spatial genetic variation, are isolation by distance and isolation by environment. Isolation by distance predicts that neighboring populations will be genetically similar and geographically distant populations will be genetically distinct [1]. Numerous examples also exist of isolation by environment, a phenomenon in which populations that inhabit similar environments (e.g., same elevation, temperature, or vegetation) are genetically similar even if they are distant, whereas populations that inhabit different environments are genetically distinct even when geographically close [2][3][4]. These dual models provide a widely accepted conceptual framework for understanding population structure [5][6][7][8]. Here, we present evidence for an additional, novel process that we call isolation by navigation, in which the navigational mechanism used by a long-distance migrant influences population structure independently of isolation by either distance or environment. Specifically, we investigated the population structure of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) [9], which return to nest on their natal beaches by seeking out unique magnetic signatures along the coast-a behavior known as geomagnetic imprinting [10][11][12]. Results reveal that spatial variation in Earth's magnetic field strongly predicts genetic differentiation between nesting beaches, even when environmental similarities and geographic proximity are taken into account. The findings provide genetic corroboration of geomagnetic imprinting [10,13]. Moreover, they provide strong evidence that geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation help shape the population structure of sea turtles and perhaps numerous other long-distance migrants that return to their natal areas to reproduce [13][14][15][16][17]."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Neither of the two classical drivers of population structure readily explains the enigmatic pattern of spatial genetic variation that exists within the largest sea turtle rookery in North America. Specifically, the genetic structure of the loggerhead turtle population in the southeastern United States appears inconsistent with isolation by distance in that turtles nesting on beaches that are relatively close together are often genetically distinct, while those that nest on beaches that are farther apart (including some on the east and west coasts of Florida) are often genetically alike [9]. Similarly, isolation by environment cannot readily account for the pattern, as nesting beaches that are close together but used by genetically distinct populations often appear to be physically identical. An interesting possibility is that the unusual genetic structure arises through a mechanism involving navigation to natal beaches [9,12]. After departing from their natal beaches as hatchlings and migrating across vast expanses of open ocean, loggerhead turtles return as adults to nest on the same stretch of coastline where they themselves hatched, a behavior known as natal homing [9,12,[18][19][20][21]. Natal homing in sea turtles appears to be accomplished largely through the mechanism of geomagnetic imprinting, in which turtles learn the magnetic field of their home area when young and use this information to return years later as adults [10][11][12]. Geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation back to the natal beach are possible because Earth's magnetic field varies predictably across the globe [22,23]. Thus, most coastal areas are marked by different magnetic signatures ( Figure 1) [10,11], which turtles can detect because of their ability to perceive specific elements of Earth's magnetic field, such as intensity and inclination [24][25][26]. Geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation have interesting but largely unexplored implications for the genetic structure of populations. In many parts of the world, the geomagnetic field varies more from north to south than it does from east to west (Figure 1). Consequently, the geographic distance between two nesting beaches is not a reliable predictor of the magnetic difference between them. Thus, if turtles do indeed locate their natal beaches by returning to the magnetic signature on which they imprinted, then the potential for navigational errors arises whenever two different nesting beaches have very similar magnetic fields. Under such conditions, geomagnetic imprinting predicts that within a given oceanic region, populations of turtles nesting on beaches with similar magnetic fields should be genetically similar and populations of turtles nesting on beaches with different magnetic fields should be genetically distinct. Moreover, this pattern of geomagnetically mediated population structure might persist regardless of either the geographic distance between two nesting areas or their environmental characteristics. To investigate the hypothesis of isolation by navigation, we analyzed data from an extensive study of loggerhead turtle population genetics [9] in which mtDNA samples were obtained from 834 nesting females across 20 different locations along the southeastern US coast (Figure 1). We extracted F ST values from the reported pairwise comparisons between each possible combination of nesting beaches. F ST is a widely used metric of genetic differentiation that ranges from zero to one, with low values indicating genetic similarity and high values indicating genetic differentiation. The magnetic field at any location on earth can be described by a field intensity and an inclination angle (the angle that the field lines make with respect to Earth's surface), both of which turtles detect [24,25]. We calculated a historical average of the magnetic intensities and the magnetic inclination angles that have existed at each of the 20 nesting beaches for the last 425 years and used these data to calculate the magnetic distance between each possible combination of nesting beaches. For the same combinations of beaches, we also calculated (1) the shortest possible oversea distance (i.e., the minimal distance a sea turtle would have to swim to travel from one location to the other) and (2) the environmental distance. Environmental distance describes variation in the environment between nesting beaches and incorporates 21 environmental variables (Table S1), including sea surface temperature, ocean primary productivity, and 19 other standard bioclimatic variables (e.g., annual mean temperature, annual precipitation). Analyses revealed a striking relationship between genetic differentiation, as estimated by F ST , and spatial variation in Earth's magnetic field ( Figure 2). Populations of turtles nesting at beaches with similar magnetic fields tended to be genetically similar; nesting populations at beaches marked by larger differences in magnetic fields had greater genetic differences. Indeed, multiple matrix regression with randomization [27][28][29] revealed a highly significant relationship between spatial variation in Earth's magnetic field and F ST but found no effect of geographic distance or environmental distance (Table 1). In other words, the difference between the magnetic fields at two nesting beaches was a strong predictor of the genetic differentiation between the turtle populations that nest in the two locations, regardless of the geographic proximity of the nesting beaches or their environmental similarities. Moreover, bootstrap confidence intervals for each regression coefficient (see STAR Methods) show that magnetic distance had a significantly stronger effect on genetic differentiation than did either geographic or environmental distance when all three are considered together (Table 1). These results provide strong evidence that spatial variation in Earth's magnetic field influences spatial genetic variation in loggerhead turtles through a process most likely mediated by geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation. A plausible interpretation of the findings is that, because some geographically separated beaches have similar magnetic signatures, adult females searching for the magnetic signatures of their natal beaches sometimes nest mistakenly on beaches located elsewhere that also have the ''correct'' magnetic field. Consistent with this possibility, some loggerheads nest in widely separated locations during their lifetimes, including sites on both the east and west coasts of Florida [30]. The concept of isolation by navigation, in which a navigational process such as geomagnetic imprinting drives population genetic structure, is fundamentally different from isolation by environment. In the latter, the environmental characteristics associated with genetic differentiation are intrinsically coupled to physiology, survival, and fitness; for example, in sea turtles, air temperature and rainfall influence embryonic development [31][32][33][34], primary production in the ocean determines food availability [35], and water temperature influences nesting behavior [36,37]. By contrast, slight differences in Earth's magnetic field, as occur in different geographic locations, have no known effects on either ecosystems or physiology, with the single exception of the processes involved in magnetic navigation. For this reason, the relationship we observe between spatial variation in Earth's magnetic field and genetic differentiation cannot be attributed to isolation by environment, but instead must be considered the result of a separate, independent driver of population structure arising from a navigational strategy. This concept may be Inclination angle refers to the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect Earth's surface; it varies between 0 at the geomagnetic equator and 90 at the magnetic poles. In this map, each black line represents an isoline of an inclination angle (i.e., a line along which an inclination angle is constant). Adjacent isolines represent increments of 1 . Because the coastline trends north-south and magnetic isolines trend east-west, each area on the Atlantic coast has a different inclination angle and thus a different magnetic signature. Evidence suggests that sea turtles use these magnetic signatures to return to nest on their natal beaches through a combination of geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation [10,11]. Intensity isolines are not shown, but the pattern is similar to that of inclination isolines [12]. Each black dot represents one of the 20 nesting beaches included in our analyses. Note that some nesting beaches on opposite sides of the Florida peninsula are close to the same isoline and therefore have similar magnetic signatures. As a result, a returning turtle might mistakenly nest on a beach that has the ''correct'' magnetic field but is actually far from its natal location. important not only for sea turtles, but also for other animals that use magnetic positional information in navigation [38][39][40][41]. Although our results provide genetic evidence for geomagnetic imprinting, it is not yet possible to identify with certainty the exact magnetic parameter(s) that turtles use to identify their natal beaches. The most likely candidates appear to be intensity, inclination, or both together [10,11]. We note that if intensity and inclination are considered separately and analyses are carried out in which each is used as the sole basis for magnetic distance between beaches, then strong relationships are found between each magnetic parameter and genetic differentiation ( Figures  S1A and S1B). Although it is tempting to conclude that sea turtles imprint on both parameters, an important caveat is that intensity and inclination vary together across the globe, and particularly along the Florida coastline. For this reason, our multivariate analysis used a single metric of magnetic distance that incorporates both inclination and intensity in order to account for the collinearity between them. Moreover, due to the nature of Earth's magnetic field, intensity and inclination are also inherently coupled to other geomagnetic parameters such as horizontal and vertical intensity. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn yet about which parameters of Earth's magnetic field are of the greatest importance. Similarly, our results do not imply that geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation to natal beaches are the sole determinant of sea turtle population structure. The mechanisms that underlie spatial genetic variation are complex; thus, numerous factors are likely important. For example, even if two nesting beaches have similar magnetic fields, strong ocean currents or other environmental barriers might impede movement between the two and lead to greater genetic differentiation than would be expected through magnetic navigation alone [42]. Conversely, if a population bottleneck or founder effect results in reduced genetic variation across a broad geographic region, then nesting beaches with distinct magnetic fields might harbor genetically similar populations, even though the two locations should, in principle, be easily distinguished by magnetic signatures. Additionally, although our multivariate analysis found no significant relationship between environmental distance and genetic differentiation (Table 1), we note that the trend is in the expected direction when environmental distance is considered alone. In other words, genetic differentiation between nesting beaches tends to increase with environmental distance ( Figure 2C). Environmental factors are indeed critical to success at a nesting beach; both temperature and humidity are known to influence embryonic development [31][32][33][34]. Furthermore, at least some evidence suggests that thermal differences between nesting beaches might promote local adaptation under certain conditions [43]. Thus, the possibility remains that environmental distance might affect population structure of sea turtles in the southeastern United States, even though our analysis failed to detect an effect. Another intriguing aspect of using magnetic navigation to accomplish natal homing is that Earth's field changes over time; this can cause the magnetic signatures that mark natal locations to drift along the coast and might lead to navigational errors. Several studies, however, have revealed that typical rates of field change are compatible with geomagnetic imprinting [10,11,44]. Regardless of these considerations, our results provide a powerful, independent new line of genetic evidence for geomagnetic imprinting in sea turtles. In addition, the findings reveal a previously undescribed process that can influence population genetic structure: isolation by navigation.

Regression Analyses Showing the Relationship between F ST and the Magnetic Distance, the Geographic Distance, and the Environmental Distance Each data point represents a pairwise comparison between two nesting beaches with the genetic differentiation between nesting beaches on the y axis and the magnetic, geographic, or environmental distance between the nesting beaches on the x axis. (A) There is a strong positive relationship between magnetic distance and genetic differentiation (p = 0.001); nesting beaches with similar magnetic fields harbor populations of turtles that are genetically similar, while nesting beaches with different magnetic fields are home to populations of turtles that are genetically distinct. (B and C) By contrast, no significant relationship is observed between genetic differentiation and either geographic distance (B) or environmental distance (C) (p = 0.533 and p = 0.185, respectively). Moreover, the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of each regression coefficient indicate that magnetic distance has a significantly stronger effect on genetic differentiation than do geographic and environmental distance ( Table 1). p values were calculated with multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) that incorporated all three distance metrics together and used 1,000 permutations (Table 1). In addition, we used the results from all seven possible models (Table S2) to partition the variation in genetic differentiation explained by the full model (Table S3).
