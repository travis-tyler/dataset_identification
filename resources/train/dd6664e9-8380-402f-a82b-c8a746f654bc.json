However, the question, what actually determines teacher quality, i.e. what makes one teacher more successful in enhancing her students' performance than another, has not been settled so far (Aaronson et al., 2007) . Different categories of teacher variables have been analyzed. Some studies focus on the impact of a teacher's gender and race on teacher quality (Dee, 2005 (Dee, , 2007 .\nOthers try to uncover the relationship between student outcomes and teacher qualifications such as teaching certificates, other paper qualifications or teaching experience (Kane et al., 2008) . Such observable teacher characteristics are, however, generally found to have only little impact on student achievement and can only explain a relatively small part of overall teacher quality (Aaronson et al., 2007; Rivkin et al., 2005) . Most of the variation in teacher quality can be attributed to unobserved factors. 1\nWhile most of these studies focus on characteristics of the teacher, this paper directly peers into the black box of educational production by focusing on the actual teaching process. More specifically, we contrast two teaching practices, teaching by giving lecture style presentations with teaching based on in-class problem solving, and investigate the impact on student achievement. Giving lecture style presentations is often regarded as old-fashioned and connected with many disadvantages: Lectures fail to provide instructors with feedback about student learning and rest on the presumption that all students learn at the same pace. Moreover, students' attention wanes quickly during lectures and information tends to be forgotten quickly when students are passive. Finally, lectures emphasize learning by listening, which is a disadvantage for students who prefer other learning styles. Alternative instructional practices based on active and problem-oriented learning presumably do not suffer from these disadvantages. National standards (NCTM, 1991; National Research Council, 1996) consequently advocate engaging students more in hands-on learning activities and group work. Despite these recommendations traditional lecture and textbook methodologies continue to dominate science and mathematics instruction in US middle schools (Weiss, 1997) . This raises the question whether student achievement could be raised by reducing the high share of teaching time devoted to lecture style presentations.\nBy addressing this question, this study adds to the literature analyzing the impact of teaching process variables such as teaching practices on student outcomes. 2 Despite the importance of teaching practices for student performance as recognized by educational researchers (Seidel and Shavelson, 2007) and their potential relatively low-cost implementation, economists have only recently begun to analyze the impact of teaching methods on student achievement. 3 Various dimensions of teaching practices have been shown to be able to explain a large share of the between-teacher variation in student achievement (Schacter and Thum, 2004) . However, to our knowledge no rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of lecture style teaching on overall student achievement exists.\nTo study the effect of lecture style teaching relative to teaching based on in-class problem solving we use information on in-class time use provided by teachers in the 2003 wave of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in US schools. Estimating a reduced form educational production function and exploiting between-subject variation to control for unobserved student traits, we find that the choice of teaching practices matters for student achievement. We find that a 10 percentage point shift from problem solving to lecture style presentation results in an increase in student achievement of about 1 percent of a standard deviation.\nThis result is highly robust. Consistent with other studies in this literature, we find no evidence for significant effects of commonly investigated observable teacher characteristics such as teaching certificates or teaching experience. While we are able to control for a huge array of observable teacher traits, selection of teachers based on unobservable characteristics into teaching methods remains an issue. The bias resulting from potential selection of teachers with different unobservable attributes into different teaching methods is assessed following the technique pioneered in Altonji et al. (2005) . The results indicate that only relatively low selection on unobservables compared to the selection on observables is necessary to explain the entire estimated effect. We would thus not formulate policy conclusions that call for more lecture style teaching compared to problem solving in general. However, a negative causal effect of giving lecture style presentations that is hidden in our results due to selection based on unobserved teacher traits is also not very likely. It can only exist if \"good\" teachers (teachers with favorable unobserved characteristics) predominately select themselves into an inferior teaching technique. This scenario, however, lacks any intuitive or theoretical support and thus appears extremely implausible. We therefore conclude that the high share of total teaching time devoted to traditional lecture style teaching in science and mathematics instruction in US middle schools has no detrimental effect on student achievement. Our findings imply that simply changing the teaching method from lecture style presentation to problem solving without concern for how the methods are implemented has little potential for raising overall achievement levels. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the following section reviews the literature on teaching practices. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 describes the estimation strategy. Headline results are presented in Section 5, while Section 6 provides a sensitivity analysis. Section 7 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Literature on Teaching Practices", "text": "There are two strands of literature that are closely related to our study. The first strand analyzes the impact of different teaching styles on student achievement. In these studies teaching style variables are meant to proxy for broader pedagogical concepts. A certain teaching style may consist of a combination of different teaching practices, where the term teaching practice indicates the actual classroom activity, like giving a lecture style presentation or reviewing homework. The effects of single teaching practices are analyzed by the second strand of the related literature.\nFindings of the first strand of literature on teaching style speak in favor of modern, interactive teaching styles. Smith et al. (2001) find that primary school students in Chicago had higher test score gains when they were taught with an interactive teaching style compared to didactic or review-oriented teaching styles. Similarly, McGaffrey et al. (2001) find that a teaching style in accordance with a reform promoted by the National Science Foundation during the 1990s can be beneficial for student achievement in math in 10th grade. Their finding suggests that a change from traditional teaching to the reform-based style only enhances student achievement if the curriculum is changed in accordance with the reform in addition to changing the teaching style.\nAnother study that analyzes a simultaneous change in both, structure and content of teaching, is Machin and McNally (2008) . This study analyzes the effect of the introduction of the \"literacy hour\" in English primary schools in the late 1990s. This policy intervention by the British government changed how primary school students are taught to read. Using the fact that not all schools started the literacy hour at the same point in time in a difference-in-difference framework, the authors show that the literacy hour significantly increased reading skills for low ability student while high ability students were not affected.\nAccording to the findings of these studies the overall teaching style that teachers use in class seems to matter for student achievement. As these styles are, however, composed of different individual teaching practices it is hard to come up with recommendations to teachers what exactly they should do in the classroom.\nThe second strand of literature analyzes individual teaching practices. A first group of studies in this area analyzes the use of computer based instruction. The evidence on the use of computer programs is mixed for different subjects. On the one hand, Rouse and Krueger (2004) find that literacy skills of 3rd and 6th grade students in a large US urban school district do not profit from the use of computer programs for teaching language and reading. Students' math skills, on the other hand, are shown to increase due to computeraided instruction as shown by Banerjee et al. (2007) for India and Barrow et al. (2009) for the US. Computer-based instruction might thus be more effective in some than in other subjects.\nOther teaching practices that have received some attention in the literature are accountability measures. Wenglinsky (2000 Wenglinsky ( , 2002 finds that frequent testing of students is positively related to students' test scores taking into account student background and prior performance. Additional evidence for the importance of testing is presented in Kannapel et al. (2005) : High-performing high-poverty schools in Kentucky payed more attention to student assessment than other high-poverty schools. In addition, there is some evidence that not only testing itself is important but also how the tests are graded. Bonesr\u00f8nning (2004) analyzes if grading practices affect student achievement in Norway and finds evidence that easy grading deteriorates student achievement. The design of tests might also matter. This hypothesis is supported by findings of Newmann et al. (2001) and Matsumura et al. (2002) . Both studies find evidence for a positive link between the quality of assignments that students are asked to do and overall student performance. These findings emphasize the importance of taking into account other categories of in-class time use such as accountability measures when studying the effect of teaching by giving lecture style presentations in comparison to in-class problem solving.\nMore closely related to this paper in terms of the teaching practices analyzed and identification strategy are the analyses by Brewer and Goldhaber (1997) and Aslam and Kingdon (2007) . Brewer and Goldhaber (1997) estimate different specifications of education production functions for tenth grade students in math with data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988. They conclude that teacher behavior is important in explaining student test scores. Controlling for student background, prior performance and school and teacher characteristics, they find that instruction in small groups and emphasis on problem solving lead to lower student test scores. Aslam and Kingdon (2007) analyze the impact of different teaching practices on student achievement in Pakistan. Their identification strategy rests on within pupil across subject (rather than across time) variation, which is similar to the identification strategy employed in this analysis. They find that students taught by teachers who spend more time on lesson planning and by teachers who ask more questions in class have higher test scores.\nSimilar to this second strand of studies we focus on a comparison of single teaching practices, namely time devoted to teaching by giving lecture style presentations versus time devoted to teaching by problem solving. As lecture style teaching is a teaching practice that is often associated with more traditional, didactic or teacher-centered teaching styles, while problem solving is connected to more modern, interactive or student-centered approaches to teaching, our results might be also of a more general interest. Strictly speaking, however, our data only allows to draw conclusions about actual classroom activities."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data used in this study is the 2003 wave of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). In this study we focus on country information for the US. In TIMSS, students in 4th grade and in 8th grade were tested in math and science. We limit our analysis to 8th grade students, because 4th grade students are typically taught by one teacher in all subjects.\nWe standardize the test scores for each subject to be mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\nIn addition to test scores in the two tested subjects, the TIMSS data provide background information on student home and family. For the purpose of this analysis it is crucial that TIMSS allows linking students to teachers. Each student's teachers in math and science are surveyed on their characteristics, qualifications and teaching practices. Additionally, school principals provide information on school characteristics.\nThe key variable of interest in this paper is derived from question 20 in the teacher questionnaires in the 2003 wave of TIMSS. Unfortunately, this precise question was not asked in previous waves of TIMSS. We therefore limit our analysis to the 2003 wave.\nTeachers are asked in 2003 to report what percentage of time in a typical week of the specific subject's lessons students spend on eight in-class activities. Our three main categories of interest are listening to lecture style presentation, working on problems with the teacher's guidance and working on problems without guidance. The overall time in class spent on these three activities likely provides a good proxy for the time in class in which students are taught new material. The main interest of this study is to contrast teaching by giving lecture style presentations to teaching based on problem solving. The two problem solving categories are thus combined into a single teaching practice: teaching based on problem solving. To allow a comparison of the two categories we construct a single variable, lecture style teaching, that is the percent of time spent giving lecture style presentation relative to the percent of time spent on either of the two activities ( lecture(%) lecture(%)+problemsolving(%) ). The key advantage is that a change in this variable can directly be interpreted as a shift from spending time on one to spending time on the other practice holding constant the overall time spent on these two practices. For example, an increase in this variable of 0.1 indicates that 10 percentage points of total time devoted to teaching new material are shifted from teaching based on problem solving to giving lecture style presentations.\nThe remaining 5 activities include reviewing homework, listening to the teacher reteach and clarify content, taking tests or quizzes, classroom management and other activities. We simply group these activities and construct a single variable, other class activities, which measures the share of total time in class spent on other activities. We include this variable as a control in all specifications. To analyze the robustness of our results we also estimate specifications that include the individual shares of all categories. Moreover, teachers also report the total time in minutes per week that they teach math or science to the class, which we also include as a control variable in most specifications.\nThe TIMSS 2003 US data set contains student-teacher observations on 8,912 students in 232 schools. 41 of those students have more than one teacher in science. These students are not included in the estimation sample. 8,871 students in 231 schools in 455 math classes taught by 375 different math teachers and in 1,085 science classes taught by 475 different science teachers remain in the sample. Not all of the students and teachers completed their questionnaires. In order not to lose a large amount of observations we impute missing values of all control variables and include indicators for imputed values in all estimations. 4 2,561 students have, however, missing information on our teaching practice variable of interest. These observation are dropped from the analysis. 6,310 students in 205 schools with 639 teachers (303 math teachers and 355 science teachers, where 19 teachers teach both subjects) remain in the sample. Furthermore due to the sampling design of TIMSS, students are not all selected with the same probability. A two stage sampling design makes it necessary to take probability weights into account when estimating summary statistics (Martin, 2005) . All estimation results take the probability weights into account and allow for correlation between error terms within schools. 5 Table 1 reports descriptive statistics on observable teacher characteristics separately for math and science teachers. Mean differences are reported in the last column of table 1. The share of teachers with math or science majors naturally differs between those two groups. Apart from mean differences in majors only a few other variables are significantly different between the two groups.\nTo investigate which teachers teach using relatively more lecture style presentations and which students are more exposed to this method tables 2 and 3 display averages of student, school, class and teacher characteristics grouped by the share of lecture style presentation.\nThe last column of tables 2 and 3 presents the mean differences between characteristics of students, schools, classes and teachers with more and less than the median share of time spent on lecture style presentation. Table 2 reveals that the only student characteristic which shows significant differences between the two groups is the number of books that families have at home. Students who are taught with relatively less lecture style seem to have a little less books at home. Furthermore, the share of students in schools for which the principal reports very low involvement of parents in school activities is higher among students taught with relatively less lecture style presentations. Students exposed to below median lecture style teaching are also slightly more likely to be in tracked classes. Table 3 reports teacher characteristics by the intensity of lecture style teaching. Students taught with relatively less lecture style teaching have a higher share of female teachers, more teachers who are at least 50, teachers who have the maximum number of years of teacher training, and teachers who have taken pedagogical or content knowledge classes in the last two years. All other teacher characteristics do not differ significantly between the two groups.\nTables 2 and 3 indicate some potential for selection into different teaching practices.\nTo control for the confounding impact of these differences in observable characteristics, we include all variables presented in the tables above and additional information on teaching limits (see A-1 in the appendix) in our empirical analysis."}, {"section_title": "Estimation Strategy", "text": "To estimate the effect of giving lecture style presentations relative to teaching based on problem solving we estimate a standard education production function:\nThe test score, Y ijk , of student i in subject j in school k is explained by student background characteristics, B ijk , school characteristics, S ijk , teacher and class characteristics,\nT ijk , and the variable Lecture ijk . The last variable constitutes the focus of this analysis. It represents teaching time spent on lecture style presentation relative to problem solving. The error term, ijk , contains all unobservable influences on student test scores.\nIn particular, it contains the effects of unobservable student, \u00b5 i , teacher, \u03be j , and school characteristics, \u03bd k :\nEstimating equation (1) by ordinary least squares produces biased estimates if unobserved school characteristics, \u03bd k , and Lecture ijk are correlated. This can be the case if the choice of the teaching practice is partly determined by the school and if there exists sorting of high ability students or effective teachers into schools.\nTo eliminate the effects of between-school sorting, we use school fixed effects, s k , to exclude any systematic between-school variation in performance or teaching practice, whatever its source:\nThe estimates produced by equation (3) could still be biased by within-school sorting wherever schools have more than one class per subject per grade. We therefore eliminate the influence on constant student traits by differencing between subjects:\nIn our headline specification we follow Dee (2005 Dee ( , 2007 by assuming that coefficients for each variable are equal across the two subjects: 6\nThe estimate of the effect of teaching practice on student achievement produced by equation (5) is not biased due to between or within school sorting of students based on unobservable student traits. We do, however, have to make the identifying assumption that unobservable teacher characteristics that directly influence student achievement are not related to the choice of the teaching method. In other words, \u03b7 i is uncorrelated with all other right-hand side variables. This is a strong assumption and we therefore refrain from interpreting \u03b2 4 as causal effect. We rather interpret \u03b2 4 as a measure for the link between a teaching practice and student achievement that is not driven by between or within school sorting of students. It might, however, be partly driven by sorting of teachers into a special teaching method based on unobservable teacher traits.\nWe evaluate the concern of selection on unobservables by borrowing a procedure from Altonji et al. (2005) which allows to evaluate the bias of the estimate under the assumption that selection on unobservables occurs to the same degree as selection on observables. As developed in the appendix the asymptotic bias of \u03b2 4 in our application is\nwhere indices are omitted for simplicity and where \u2206Lecture is the residual of a linear projection of \u2206Lecture on all other between subject differences of control variables, represented by \u2206T . The second equality holds if the other controls (T ) are orthogonal to \u03b7.\nThe condition that selection on unobservables is equal to selection on observables can be stated as\nEquation (7) can be used to estimate the numerator of the bias of \u03b2 4 , once we have consistent estimates for \u03b2 3 . Under the assumptions that the true effect of lecture style teaching is zero and again that T is orthogonal to \u03b7, \u03b2 3 can be consistently estimated (see appendix).\nThe estimated bias displays the effect we would estimate even if the true effect was zero when selection on unobservables is as strong as selection on observables. In addition, we report the ratio of the estimated \u03b2 4 from equation (5) and the estimated bias giving a hint of how large selection on unobservables would have to be compared to selection on observables to explain the entire estimated effect. A value higher than one indicates that selection on unobservables needs to be stronger than selection on observables to explain the entire estimate, in case of a ratio lower than one already weaker selection on unobservables than on observables suffices to explain the entire estimate."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Estimates of the effect of teaching practices based on the different methods advanced in Section 4 are presented in Tables 4 and 5 . Each regression is performed at the level of the individual student and each of the estimations also takes into account the complex data structure produced by the survey design and the multi-level nature of the explanatory variables. Table 4 reports results from estimating equation (1) and equation (3). We estimate both equations separately for math and science. Columns 1 and 3 present regressions results for math and science based on equation (1). These regressions include a complete set of student-and family-background variables, controls for teacher and class characteristics as well as characteristics of the school. Given the purpose of this study, only estimated coefficients for the teaching practice variable of interest and selected teacher characteristics are reported.\nOur key variable of interest, teaching time devoted to lecture style presentation relative to time spent on problem solving, is estimated to have a positive impact on test scores in both subjects. In math the estimate is highly significant, while the estimate in science falls short of achieving statistical significance at any common significance level.\nAs discussed in the previous section, these results might be confounded by between school sorting based on unobservable characteristics of students. Column 2 and 4 therefore report estimation results based on equation (3), which includes school fixed effects. Lecture style presentation is now highly significant in science and the point estimate significantly increased compared to column 3. The estimate in math, however, did not change but lost its statistical significance due to increased standard errors.\nTo gain statistical power we pool both estimation samples and estimate equations (1) and (3) with the joint sample. This approach assumes that the effects of all right-hand side variables are identical in both subjects. Based on this estimation sample the relationship between more lecture style presentation and test scores is positive and significantly different from zero in both specifications.\nThe evidence presented in table 4 suggests a positive relation between more lecture style presentation and student achievement. However, within school selection of students based on unobservable student characteristics might drive this relationship. For instance, it is reasonable to assume that teachers adjust the use of teaching practices according to class composition and average student ability. We therefore difference out unobserved constant student traits by taking between-subject differences of test scores and all right-hand side variables as presented in equation (5). Table 5 presents estimation results of the between-subject differences approach. We start out with a very basic specification without further controls in column 1 and successively add more controls that vary between subjects to account for subject-specific differences. In particular column 6 presents our headline results. In this specification we additionally control for all observable teacher and class characteristics presented in tables 1 and A-1. It is quite astonishing to see that adding more control variables in the betweensubject specification leaves our estimate for the effect of more lecture style teaching almost unchanged. Moreover, in contrast to most other control variables the share of lecture style teaching is estimated to be statistically significant throughout all specifications presented in table 5. Apart from lecture style teaching, additional minutes per week spent teaching the subject to the class also seem to have a substantial positive effect on student test scores. This is a very intuitive result as it simply suggests that students learning is an increasing function of total teaching time.\nThe specifications in columns 2 to 6 also include other class activities, i.e. the share of total time in class spent on other activities apart from lecture style presentation or problem solving, as a control variable. Other class activities include time spent on any of the other five categories in question 20. In particular, these other activities include reteaching material and accountability measures like reviewing homework and test and quizzes. Naturally, not all students understand material when it is taught for the first time so that reviewing can be beneficial for student achievement. Moreover, previous research has shown that accountability measures might have positive effects for student achievement (Wenglinsky, 2000 (Wenglinsky, , 2002 . The overall average effect of all other class activities is, however, estimated to be small and insignificant.\nThe estimate of teaching time devoted to lecture style presentation relative to time spent on problem solving decreases in comparison to the regression results presented in table 4. This indicates that within school sorting matters for the estimation of teachers' choice variables such as the degree of lecture style teaching. Estimates for the effect of more lecture style teaching on student learning in table 5 range from 0.14 to 0.1. Our headline estimate is reported in column 6 with an estimated size of 0.1. 7 This parameter suggests that shifting 10 p.p. of time from problem solving to teaching by giving lecture style presentations while holding the overall time devoted to these two activities constant is associated with an increase in student test scores of one percent of a standard deviation.\nIn turn, our results imply a negative correlation between more in-class problem solving and student achievement. This is consistent with the finding in Brewer and Goldhaber (1997) that more in-class problem solving for tenth grade students in math is related to lower test scores on a standardized test. Furthermore, the other commonly investigated teacher characteristics (e.g. gender, experience, credentials etc.) do not show significant or robust impacts on student achievement as can be seen in table 5. This is in line with previous findings in this literature and emphasizes the importance of the statistical significant relationship between more lecture style teaching and student achievement.\nAs pointed out in the previous section, estimates might still be biased due to selection of teachers into more (or less) lecture style teaching based on unobservable teacher characteristics. This concern is fostered by previous findings in the literature that emphasize the importance of unobservable teacher traits for student achievement. This raises the question: How can these results be interpreted?\nThe bias and ratio at the end of table 5 allow us to shed some light on the question of the influence of unobservables. The underlying assumption for the estimation of each bias is that selection on unobservables occurs to the same degree as selection on observables.\nIn all columns the estimated bias is larger than the point estimate of the impact of lecture style teaching on student test scores. This is reflected in the ratios at the end of each column that are always smaller than one, indicating that selection on unobservables that is weaker than selection on observables suffices to explain the entire estimated coefficient.\nIn our headline specification in column 6 selection on unobservables that is only 0.07 times 7 It should be noted that the lecture style teaching variable is based on self-reported time-use by teachers, which is likely measured with error. If time-use is measured with classical measurement error, the estimate of the effect of lecture style teaching is biased towards zero. Hence, 0.1 might be interpreted as a lower bound for the true effect of lecture style teaching.\nas strong as selection on observables would explain the entire estimated coefficient given that the true effect is zero. On the one hand, we have included a great amount of control variables so that we believe that selection on unobservables is likely weaker than selection on observables. On the other hand, only very little selection on unobservables compared to the selection on observables suffices to explain the entire effect. Given this uncertainty, we refrain from interpreting the results as evidence for a causal effect as the positive coefficient could also reflect selection of teachers with desirable unobserved characteristics into lecture style teaching.\nThis raises another question: Why would teachers with different desirable unobserved characteristics select different degrees of lecture style teaching compared to problem solving? While a reduced form approach of educational production cannot mirror the full complexity of the choices involved in the teaching process, we are, nevertheless, able to pin down the relationship between potential selection based on unobserved teacher traits and the causal effect of lecture style teaching as our estimation approach eliminated all other likely biases. If no selection based on unobservable teacher traits exists, our estimates speak for a positive effect of lecture style teaching. Our estimates might, however, be biased upwards if teachers with desirable unobserved characteristics more frequently base their instruction on lectures. Theoretically, this selection bias could be large enough to hide a true negative effect of lecture style teaching, which would imply that teachers with desirable unobserved characteristics predominately select themselves into an inferior teaching practice. This scenario, however, lacks any intuitional or theoretical support. We thus argue that this scenario is highly implausible and can be excluded, which allows a conservative interpretation of our results: We find no evidence for any detrimental effect of lecture style teaching on overall student learning.\nIt is important to stress that our results are limited to student achievement as measured by TIMSS test scores. 8 Moreover, our results for lecture style teaching are based on a comparison with teaching based on in-class problem solving. Loosely speaking our results suggest that on average lecture style teaching is at least not worse than teaching based on in-class problem solving. The comparison of average effects might, however, hide significant effect heterogeneities. Depending on the teacher, the students, the content taught, or other factors the one or the other teaching practice might be more effective. Furthermore, our information on teaching practices, which is based on in-class time use reported by teachers, does not allow us to distinguish between different implementations of the teaching practices.\nOne worry might be that especially the implementation of problem-based teaching differs substantially within our sample. Thus, while a certain teaching practice may be very effective if implemented in the correct way, an empirical analysis that is based on the actual average implementation of this teaching practice might not reveal any positive effects. Our results, therefore, do not call for more lecture style teaching in general. The results rather imply that the high share of traditional lecture style teaching in US middle schools is presumably less of a problem than often believed. The findings also suggest that simply reducing the amount of lecture style teaching and substituting it with more in-class problem solving without concern for how this is implemented is unlikely to raise overall student achievement in math and science."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Checks", "text": "This section tests the sensitivity of the results presented in section 5 with respect to other definitions of the lecture style variable and with respect to specifications allowing for heterogeneous effects. The results of these robustness checks are presented in tables 6 and 7.\nAs our grouping of the response categories available to the teacher in question 20 of the 2003 teacher questionnaires in TIMSS could be criticized, we provide evidence on the effect of interest based on different approaches to construct the lecture style variable. We test four alternative definitions of the lecture style variable with corresponding estimation results presented in each of the four columns of the upper panel of table 6.\nIn column 1 time spent re-teaching and clarifying content/procedures is included in the proxy for lecture style teaching. In column 2 taking tests or quizzes is added to the problem solving category. Hence, the lecture style teaching variable in column 2 is defined in relation to the enlarged definition of teaching based on problem solving. In column 3 we decompose the variable other class activities into its elements and separately control for each category. In column 4 lecture style is defined as the share of overall time in class spent on giving lecture style presentation.\nThe coefficients in the upper panel of table 6 reveal that redefining our key variable of interest does not change the estimated impact of more lecture style teaching on student achievement. While the main purpose of this study is to analyze the teaching of new material by giving lecture style presentations rather than by letting pupils solve problems, it is reassuring to see that increasing the total amount of time in class devoted to lecture style presentations (in contrast to all other in-class activity) is also associated with higher student achievement.\nAdditionally, we present evidence for various sub-samples in the middle panel of table 6. In column 1 and 2 we estimate equation (5) for pupils with the same peers in math and science and pupils with different peers, respectively. This distinction is motivated by the concern that the main effect might be driven by differences in the classroom composition.\nIn the sub-sample with identical peers in both subjects our within-student between-subject identification strategy takes care of any potential peer effects. For students with the same peers in both subjects, shifting 10 p.p. of teaching time from problem solving to lecture style teaching is associated with an increase of almost 4 percent of a standard deviation.\nThe estimate in the sub-sample with different peers decreases to 0.08 and lacks statistical significance. The results indicate that peer effects do not drive the positive coefficient of lecture style teaching. Column 3 and 4 of the middle panel of table 6 report estimates separately for students in schools where either no or both subjects are tracked by ability and for students in schools where tracking on ability exists in only one of the two subjects. This distinction is motivated by the consideration that tracking on ability might induce teachers to choose different degrees of lecture style teaching. The results indicate that the positive association between more lecture style teaching and student achievement holds in both types of schools.\nThe point estimate is the same for the two groups. In schools with differential tracking policies, however, it is not statistically significant.\nIn the lower panel of table 6 we investigate subject-specific effects. Column 1 and 2 present estimation results from estimating versions of equation (4), where we abandon the assumption that coefficients for each right-hand side variable are equal across subjects. As all science variables enter negatively on both sides of equation (4), a negative coefficient for any variable in science masks a positive relationship between the variable and the science test score. All estimates thus have the expected signs. They are not statistically significant for science, though. We thus find evidence for a stronger effect of lecture style teaching in math. A possible interpretation of the differential effects in the two subjects is that science with its natural emphasis on experimentation might just be better suited for problem solving.\nSo far all specifications measured time devoted to certain class activities in shares while additionally controlling for total teaching time. The specification in shares is mainly motivated by the data itself as TIMSS asks teachers to report what percentage of time in a typical week of the specific subject's lessons students spend on various activities. The data also contains information on the total time in minutes per week teachers teach math or science to the class. Thus, we can also construct a proxy for minutes per week devoted to each activity based on the information on total time per week and the shares reported by the teachers. While this constructed measure presumably suffers from larger measurement error than the reported shares alone, we nevertheless estimate a version of equation 5 that is based on variables indicating various teaching practices measured in minutes per week as a further robustness check.\nThe results of this robustness check can be seen in table 7. All specifications measure class activities in minutes per week. Otherwise the specifications are identical to the specification estimated in column 6 of table 5. In column 1 of table 7, minutes spent per week with lecture style teaching and minutes spent on other class activities are included in the specification while minutes spent on problem solving are excluded as a reference category. One additional minute per week spent on lecture style teaching instead of problem solving is associated with an increase in test scores of 0.0007 percent of a standard deviation. Column 2 of table 7 reveals that increasing the overall time devoted to lecture style teaching leads to an increase in test scores of the same magnitude as in column 1 when explicitly including the two problem solving categories and the other class activities. Columns 3 and 4 control again for total teaching time, but use either problem solving with the teachers guidance (column 3) or problem solving without guidance (column 4) as reference categories.\nThe point estimate of lecture style teaching remains positive in both specifications, but loses significance. The point estimates for the two problem solving categories in columns 3 and 4 suggest that problem solving with guidance is slightly more effective than problem solving without guidance. The difference is, however, not statistically significant.\nIn sum, we find positive relationships between more lecture style teaching and student achievement in all robustness analyses. The magnitude of the estimated effects varies between specifications and between sub-samples, with insignificant point estimates in some specification. Importantly, we do not find evidence for any detrimental effect of lecture style teaching in any specification."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Existing research on teacher quality allows two conclusions: First, there exists a large variation in teachers' ability to improve student achievement. Second, this variation cannot be explained by common, observable teacher characteristics. The results presented in this study confirm that these observable teacher characteristics have little potential for explaining the variation in student achievement. We provide, however, new evidence on a significant link between teaching practice and student achievement.\nThe specific teaching practice variable analyzed in this paper is the share of teaching time devoted to lecture style presentation (in contrast to in-class problem solving). We construct this variable based on information on in-class time use provided by teachers in the 2003 wave of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in US schools. Exploiting between-subject variation to control for unobserved student traits and estimating a reduced form educational production function, we find that a 10 percentage point shift from problem solving to lecture style presentation results in an increase in student achievement of about one percent of a standard deviation. We further show that this result is extremely robust to definitional changes in the construction of the main variable of interest as well as to specifications allowing for heterogeneous effects.\nThis finding suggests that students taught by teachers, who devote more teaching time to lecture style presentation rather than letting students solve problems on their own or with the teacher's guidance, learn more (in terms of competencies tested in the TIMSS student achievement test). This result stands in contrast to constructivist theories of learning. It is, however, in line with previous findings in the literature (Brewer and Goldhaber, 1997) showing that instruction in small groups and emphasis on problem solving lead to lower student test scores.\nWe emphasize, however, that our results demand a careful interpretation and need to be taken for what they are: Evidence for a positive association between more time devoted to lecture style teaching and student achievement that is neither driven by selection of particular students into schools or classes nor by selection of teachers based on various observable characteristics into a particular teaching method. However, selection based on unobservable teacher characteristics remains a worry. Following the method developed in Altonji et al. (2005) , we show that only a relatively small selection based on unobservables suffices to explain the entire estimated coefficient. We thus refrain from formulating any policy conclusions that call for more lecture style teaching in general.\nWe are nevertheless able to draw an important conclusion about the nature of the causal effect of lecture style teaching on student achievement as we eliminated any potential biases arising from sorting of students, differences in schools and observable differences in teacher traits in our empirical approach. The existence of a sizeable negative causal effect of lecture style teaching would only be consistent with our results if teachers with favor-able unobserved characteristics predominantly select themselves into an inferior teaching practice. Such a scenario, however, lacks any intuitional and theoretical support. We can thus exclude the possibility of a sizeable detrimental effect of lecture style teaching in math and science instruction on overall student achievement in US middle schools. We believe that this result is relevant for the debate on optimizing the teaching process.\nVarious dimensions of teaching practices have been shown to matter for student achievement. Moreover, the low-cost implementation of changes in the teaching process compared to other policy measures designed to foster student learning makes improvements in the teaching process particularly appealing. There exists, however, little consensus about what measures could improve the teaching process. Reducing the amount of traditional instruction based on lecture style teaching is typically a key candidate. Lectures are potentially connected with many disadvantages and might therefore be an inferior teaching method.\nNational standards (NCTM, 1991; National Research Council, 1996) also advocate engaging students more in hands-on learning activities and group work but traditional lecture and textbook methodologies remain dominant in science and mathematics instruction in US middle schools. This raises the concern that the high share of total teaching time devoted to traditional lecture presentations has a detrimental effect on overall student learning in US middle schools. Our results, however, show that there exists no empirical support for this concern. Moreover, while newer teaching methods might be beneficial for student achievement if implemented in an ideal way, our findings imply that simply inducing teachers to shift time in class from lecture style presentations to problem solving without concern for how this is implemented contains little potential to increase student achievement. On the contrary, our results indicate that there might even be adverse effects on student learning. .104\n.080\n.0738 * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01\nNote: a) Bias estimated as in equation (6) using condition (7) Note: All teaching practice variables are rescaled as minutes per week divided by (10 3 ).

Standard errors clustered at the school level in parentheses.\nSelection on unobservables following Altonji et al. (2005) Formally, in our application the assumption that selection on unobservables occurs to the same degree as selection on observables as imposed by Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005) can be stated as:\nWhere \u2206Lecture captures the between subject differences in the teaching time devoted to lecture style presentation relative to problem solving and \u03b2 4 indicates its coefficient while T includes all other k control variables (teacher characteristics and effective teaching time as well as class characteristics) and \u03b2 3 is a kx1 vector of coefficients. When \u2206T \u03b2 3 is orthogonal to \u03b7 the assumption (9) is equal to\nWe proceed now to answer the question how large selection on unobservables relative to selection on observabels would have to be in order to explain the entire estimate of \u03b2 4 under the assumption that the true \u03b2 4 is 0. Following Altonji et al. (2005) we regress \u2206Lecture on \u2206T , to get \u2206Lecture = \u2206T \u03b4 + \u2206Lecture.\nPlugging this into our equation (5) yields: \u2206Y = c + \u2206T (\u03b2 3 + \u03b4 * \u03b24) + \u2206Lecture \u03b2 4 + \u03b7\nAs \u2206Lecture is by construction orthogonal to \u2206T the probability limit of \u03b2 4 can be written as as \u2206T is orthogonal to \u03b7.\nTo estimate the numerator of the bias we can use the equality (10):\nCov(\u2206T \u03b2 3 , \u2206Lecture) V ar(\u2206T \u03b2 3 ) * V ar (\u03b7) .\nFor this however, we need a consistent estimate of \u03b2 3 which we obtain by estimating equation (11) under the assumption that \u03b2 4 = 0. Note: Probability weights and within school correlation are taken into account when estimating means and standard deviations. Class variables are weighted by the number of students in each class."}]
