[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Driven by a broadly based easing of rich-country immigration restrictions for skilled workers and booming high-tech economies, the decade of the 1990s saw a substantial increase in skilled emigration from emerging economies. To take an example, the Indian-born population in the United States aged 25 and over increased from 304,000 in 1990 to 836,000 by 2000-80 percent of whom have a tertiary education.\n1 A key factor behind this increase has been the introduction and expansion of the H-1B temporary visa program for skilled workers. 2 The resulting outflow rekindled fears, prominent in the 1960s and 1970s, of a development-stunting \"brain drain.\" The development costs of talent outflows are certainly hard to dispute when it comes to richcountry recruitment of African doctors, given already staggeringly high doctor-to-patient ratios and worsening disease environments. But the loss of talent in high-tech sectors such as software has produced a more ambivalent reaction, with commentators pointing 1 We estimate from the 2001 March CPS that 38 percent of Indians aged between 25 and 64 have a graduate degree. This compares with 9 percent in both the US-born and other foreign-born populations. In the 18 to 64 age group, 37 percent of the Indian born have incomes more than 200 percent of the US-born median income ($23,925 in 2001) ; only 20 percent of the US-born and 13 percent of the other foreign born have incomes above this level (see Desai, Kapur, and McHale, 2001) . 2 The most widely discussed case of skill-focused immigration reform was the expansion of the H-1B professional worker temporary visa program in the US. But skilled-focused immigration policy change was a much wider phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s (see e.g., McLaughlan and Salt 2001) . Germany introduced a 20,000 a year \"Green Card\" program for IT professionals (now ended), and its parliament passed legislation introducing permanent residency for high-earning skilled workers (now under court challenge). The United Kingdom announced at the end of 2001 that it is implementing a points-based Highly-Skilled Migrant Programme on a pilot basis, and has dramatically increased the number of work permits it issues to skilled workers since the mid-1990s. Canada recently revamped its points system to make it more focused on education and adaptability to the Canadian skill market, and put in place a pilot program for fast tracking temporary visas for IT workers. Australia introduced a major new class of employer sponsored temporary visa in 1996, in addition to increasing the share of its permanent migration visas that are granted on the basis of skills. Although the current high tech slump and post September 11 fears have stemmed this reform momentum, continued skill-biased technical change, educational system deficiencies (particularly in science and computing), and aging populations make it a fair bet that the competition for skill will reassert itself before long.\nto benefits as well as costs. 3 In this paper, then, we explore the implications of skilled emigration on the development of the software sectors in three emerging economiesIndia, Ireland, and Israel. What are the benefits of skilled emigration to high-tech sector like software? We emphasize three classes of benefit. First, there are the benefits that result from the prospect of emigration, as young people are induced by the higher expect return to skills to invest in more (and more internationally marketable) human capital. 4 Second, there are the economic benefits that stem from close links to the diaspora. The diaspora can be a direct source of advantage when its members have the desire and ability to trade with, invest in, and outsource to domestic businesses. It can also be an indirect source of advantage as its members act as \"reputational intermediaries\"-matching trading partners, supporting contracting by leveraging its long-term relationships with people from their new and former homes, and, possibly most importantly, overcoming negative national stereotypes through demonstrations of their capabilities. Finally, there are the benefits that result when emigrants return with enhanced skills, connections, business ideas, and savings.\nBefore becoming overly excited about the potential benefits, we hasten to add that there are real costs to a country from having a sizable portion of its talent absent from the economy. The reduced supply pushes up domestic wages making it more difficult to compete on costs, leads to fiscal losses as net fiscal contributors leave, and undermines local knowledge spillovers. Possibly most damaging is the loss of specialized skills, talents and energies that have few or no domestic substitutes, including the loss of crucial \"institution builders.\" Recent work in economics has also stressed the importance of complementary skilled workers to the incentive to \"import\" high-tech capital equipment and know how (see, for example, Caselli and Wilson, 2003, and Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 2001 ).\nThe loss of skilled workers may pose a particular challenge to an emerging economy that has managed to attain a surprising comparative advantage in a skillintensive sector like software. A useful way to think about this advantage is in terms of a multi-sector Ricardian model (see Dornbush et al, 1977) . Compared to other sectors in the economy, the software sector has relatively high productivity (for reasons explored in other chapters in this volume). But skilled wages are low because of low average productivity. High productivity and low wages are an ideal basis for profitability. But the resulting international wage gap is also a threat as talent gets lured abroad by the prospect of higher living standards. As talent leaves-or even has the option of leaving-wages rise and productivity falls as specialized skills are lost."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "The tension between the costs and benefits of skilled emigration for an industry that relies heavily on outsourced business comes out clearly in a recent paper by Gene\nGrossman and Elhanan Helpman (Grossman and Helpman 2002) . Their paper actually does not address emigration at all, but rather the extent and location of international outsourcing by rich-country firms. Firms outsourcing activities such as software development face the problems of finding qualified outsourcing partners and getting them to make relationship specific investments in customization without recourse to complete contracts. Emigration is clearly relevant to the extent of such outsourcing difficulties. 4 Potential entrepreneurs may also be induced to take greater risks with start-up companies by the prospect of being able to move their companies abroad with foreign takeovers or stock market floatations. 5 It is sometimes said that these countries have an \"excess supply\" of human capital. However, care must be taken in using this term as it draws attention to just one side of the skill market. Successful economies can absorb large increases in human capital through such changes as complementary capital accumulation, induced skill-biased technology adoption (and even technology invention), and increases in the share of skill intensive industry. One indicator of \"excess supply\" is a large negative differential between domestic and foreign wages. But given the forces pushing towards factor price equalization in an open economy, a sustained wage gap is more likely to be due to country-specific factors that affect the utilization of skills than their overabundance.\nOn the negative side, it \"thins\" skill markets, making it less worthwhile to search for partners in the skill-losing country. On the positive side, diasporic networks can improve \"technologies\" for partner search and communication of customization requirements between the outsourcing firm and its suppliers, and also help overcome difficulties of contractual incompleteness by acting as \"reputational intermediaries\"-ideas we explore in Section 3 below.\nNotwithstanding the costs, we argue that international skill mobility has probably been on net an advantage for at least some of the countries in this project. For India, we think that the most important factor has been role of the diaspora in overcoming reputational disadvantages in an industry where ex ante quality is very hard to discern.\nFor Ireland, there is convincing evidence that returning Irish professionals with enhanced human capital helped propel the booming high-tech sector in the latter half of the 1990s and early 2000s. More directly, there is evidence that a very high number of the founders of indigenous Irish software companies had international experience. For Israel, the immigration of almost one million members of the human capital rich Jewish diaspora from the former Soviet Union provided an unprecedented increase in the supply of skills to the Israeli economy. Although it is hard to find an overt footprint of this inflow on the Israeli software sector, it must have helped to maintain cost competitiveness at a time of rapid economy-wide skill upgrading."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "We have organized the rest of the paper around four sections. Section 2 describes the evolution of the emigrant stocks in some key destination countries. Section 3 reviews the economics of the costs and benefits of emigration with a focus on the welfare effects on home-country populations. Section 4 applies the economics from Section 3 to better understand the effects on software industry development of the migration episodes in Indian, Ireland and Israel noted in the previous paragraph. Finally in Section 5 we outline areas for future research."}, {"section_title": "Section 2. Emigrant Stocks and Flows", "text": "The data on emigration stocks and flows are notoriously poor. In this section, we nonetheless try to piece together a rough quantitative picture on the relevant stocks and flows to get a sense of absent Indian, Irish and Israeli human capital. We start with crude estimates of broad Irish and Jewish ancestral diaspora and then try to narrow our focus to measurements of overseas nationals that are more directly relevant to the development of high-tech industries in the three countries."}, {"section_title": "The Broad Diaspora: Ancestry", "text": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has estimated that there are as many 70 million worldwide that claim Irish decent (Government of Ireland 1996) . 7 Although this diaspora is in many ways the sad result of Ireland's politically and economically turbulent history, the Irish government considers it a valuable resource: \"The existence of this vast extended Irish family creates an immense reservoir of goodwill towards Ireland and is one of our main assets as a nation,\" (Government of Ireland, 1996, p. 1) .\nClose to half of this broad diaspora reside in the US. In the 2000 US census, some 30.5 million-10.9 percent of the population-claimed Irish ancestry (though curiously this was down from 15.6 percent of the population-38.8 million-in the 1990 census). From results released from the 1990 census we know that the vast majority of those claiming Irish ancestry were not born in Ireland, with some 98.8 percent born in the United States. Among the 270,000 foreign-born (not necessarily all Irish-born) claming Irish ancestry, just less than 50,000 had entered between 1980 and 1990. We return to 7 The department also estimates that there are roughly three million Irish citizens living outside Ireland. 7 Of these three million, around two-thirds live in United Kingdom and one-sixth live in the United States. It is estimated that 1.2 million of the total number of overseas citizens were born in Ireland. The entitlement to Irish citizenship is relatively generous compared with other countries. People born in Ireland, their children born abroad, and in some cases their grandchildren and great grand children, are entitled to Irish citizenship (Government of Ireland 1996) . the cohort of Irish who were driven to emigrate by poor economic conditions in the 1980s in Section 4.\nThe Jewish diaspora is estimated to have been 8.4 million at the beginning of 2000, with a further 4.7 million Jews living in Israel (DellaPergola 2000). Israel's Law of return, the legal framework for acceptance and absorption of immigrants, defines a Jew for the purpose of the law as any person born to a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism. The law's provisions extend to all current Jews (as defined above) and to their non-Jewish spouses, children, and grandchildren, as well as to the spouses of these children and grandchildren (DellaPergola 2000) . 8 As we discuss in Section 4, this broad diaspora has been a vast source of additional skill for the Israeli economy in the 1990s."}, {"section_title": "The Narrow Diaspora: Emigrants", "text": "We now turn to look more closely at characteristics of emigrant (or native born)\nIndian, Irish and Israeli populations. We initially concentrate on US-resident emigrants because of their importance to each of the three countries and also because the US data is best. We then briefly discuss some other important destination countries. So far we have concentrated on emigration to the US, both because of its importance as an emigration destination and the quality of the available data. But of course there are other important destinations for emigrants from these countries as well.\nThe United Kingdom, for example, is an important destination for emigrants from both Ireland and India. 10 Dobson et al., 2001 ).\n2,616 of the Indian nationals receiving work permits were classed as \"engineers and technologists\" and 5,973 were classed as \"computer analysts/programmers\" (Dobson et al. 2001) . No other country came close to India in number of work permits received for these highly skilled technical occupations."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Technically skilled Indians were in high demand in other countries as well. In Canada, 5,738 Indians gained permanent residency under the points system for skilled workers in 2000. 12 In 1999/2000 Indians were the third leading recipient (after the UK and the US) of employer sponsored temporary business visas for skilled professionals in Australia. And Indians were the largest beneficiaries of visas issued in the early stages of 10 Indeed, the Irish born and Indian born populations are respectively the first and second largest foreign born populations in the UK 11 The US sent 1,767 \"engineers and technologists\" and 1,004 \"computer analysts/programmers.\" The US sent many more \"managers and administrators, however: 5,247 compared to 1,203 in this category from India. 12 6,649 Indians came as the dependents of skilled workers in 2000. Across all categories of permanent immigration to Canada-skilled, business, and family-26,064 Indians immigrated to Canada (11.5 percent of total permanent immigration in that year). Indians account for a relatively small share of temporary workers in Canada. In 2000 the stock of Indian temporary workers was 1,358 (1.7 percent of the total). India is also not among the top senders of students to Canada (Citizenship and Immigration Canada 2001) . "}, {"section_title": "Section 3. Emigration and Industry Development: A Framework", "text": "How does the international mobility of a country's skilled workers affect its capacity to develop a domestic skill intensive industry such as software? In this section we briefly and selectively piece together what the economics literature has to say about the economic effects of emigration. Actually, much of the literature we draw from focuses on the effects of immigration rather than emigration. But since many of the effects are the same with the sign reversed there is much to be learned from this literature as well. In measuring the effects of emigration, our focus is always on the welfare of domestic residents-people referred to sympathetically in the literature as \"those left behind\" or TLBs. Thus we ignore the (important) effects of emigration on the emigrants themselves unless their success or failure has some impact on home country residents.\nWe aim for a broad coverage of the effects of home country residents, which we discuss under four headings. The first deals with the impact of the prospect of emigration on the decision to accumulate human capital that may or may not be eventually taken abroad. The second deals with the direct effects of the absence of skilled workers on the domestic economy in terms of such factors as lost surplus, larger skill premiums, fiscal losses, diminished scale economies, and changed comparative advantage. The third considers how the diaspora can be an asset as a source and facilitator of international business. That is, we look at the ways that immigrants can have an impact on their home economies from afar. We finally turn to the part played by emigrants when they return to the home economy with augmented human capital, financial capital, foreign connections, and entitlements to foreign social insurance benefits."}, {"section_title": "Prospect", "text": "How does the prospect of emigration affect the incentive to invest in human capital? A number of recent papers have developed models in which the prospect of emigration increases the expected return to human capital investment (see e.g., Beine et al. 2001 , and Stark and Wang 2001 . This increase in the expected return can raise the overall level of human capital in the economy if the subsequent actual emigration is not too high. One example is where potential emigrants face a lottery for visas such as the diversity lottery run by the US State Department. The chance of winning, and thus of gaining access to a labor market with higher rewards to skill, induces more study and onthe-job learning. But many of those enticed by the prospect of a visa actually fail to win one, so that a portion of this increased human capital stays behind. The possibility of emigration may actually increase human capital if this portion is large enough. Beine et al. (2001 Beine et al. ( , 2002 provide evidence that is consistent with an overall positive effect on human capital for a number of countries, though they readily admit their data has many limitations. Without forming an overall judgment on the empirical importance of this prospective channel, we note three factors that work to diminish its importance.\nFirst, there will be income as well as substitution effects from an increased expected return to human capital. An Irish secondary (high) school student deciding on how hard to study to win a place at university might, for example, be enticed to slack off by the fall back of a relatively high paying job as a construction worker in London or a nanny in New York.\nSecond, an overall positive effect on human capital depends on the prospect of emigration inducing study but then many of these more skilled individuals deciding not to go or not qualifying to go. To the extent that the desirable destination countries screen immigration applicants with objective criteria (e.g., the Canadian or Australian point systems) or with jobs offers (e.g., UK work permits or US H-1Bs) the degree of uncertainty is diminished. In other words, those who want to go and make the necessary investments are likely to qualify to go (see Commander et al. 2002) .\nLastly, there is evidence that the value of human capital acquired in one country-especially if it is a developing country-does not always travel well with an emigrant. Looking at the case of immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union, Friedberg (2000) finds that education and experience acquired in the former Soviet Union is significantly less valued than human capital acquired in Israel. This suggests that would-be emigrants should wait to acquire their more advanced human capital abroad if possible. Interestingly, Friedberg does find that education acquired in the adopted country raises the return to education acquired at home. This suggests that the prospect of emigration could still provide some incentive to acquire human capital provided that the individual is willing to pursue further education while abroad. 13 We return to the fascinating case of Israel-bound emigration from the former Soviet Union in the third of our applications in Section 4.\n14 Our discussion has focused on how the prospect of emigration affects the expected return to human capital. Having a (potential) emigration option might also affect an individual's willingness to take more risks with their human capital accumulation decisions. Suppose, for example, that the global software industry is growing strongly, but is at a nascent stage domestically. Investing in computer programming skills may be quite risky if options are limited to the domestic economy, which may fail to develop a substantial computer industry. Having the fall back option of emigration may make a young school leaver more willing to take a risk on an emerging industry. From the national perspective, such a propensity to take a more forward looking perspective in developing skills may help the country break out of traditional patterns of comparative advantage, and also to increase the national proclivity to \"explore\" new industries for which the country's characteristics might turn out to make it particularly well suited. "}, {"section_title": "Absence", "text": "How are TLBs affected by the absence of a sizable portion of the native-born skilled labor force? Figure 1 shows the simple case of a closed economy producing a single good (GDP) with skilled workers and other factors under constant returns to scale technology, competitive markets, and no fiscal system. With diminishing returns to skilled workers, skilled emigration pushes up the domestic wage. 16 The size of the aggregate loss to TLBs is shown by the shaded area in the diagram. 17 A loss stems from a difference between an emigrant's marginal value product (their benefit to TLBs) and the wage they were paid (their cost to TLBs). Since in a competitive labor market skilled workers are paid their marginal product, the loss of single skilled worker will have no effect of the aggregate surplus of TLBs. It is clear from the diagram that this is not true for the loss of multiple skilled workers. Moreover, is easy to show that the total loss (approximately) rises with the square of the number of emigrants. 18 To understand better the source of this loss, note that in measuring this loss we are comparing the value lost from someone leaving with the wage they were paid before anyone left. The real source of the emigration loss is not that the wage is pushed up (though it will be in a competitive 14 skill market) but that the marginal value product of remaining workers is pushed up as others leave (see Figure 1) . 19 For example, the emigration of a few software engineers will drive the value of remaining software engineers above what they were all initially being paid. If then more software engineers leave, the loss in value to TLBs will be strictly greater than the amount of money they had been handing over to the engineers before any of the engineers had left."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "We now consider a number of complications to this simple model of emigration loss. The key to understanding the loss to TLBs is to compare the domestic marginal value product of an emigrant to the wage they were paid. Unlike in our simple model, the first three complications show how the loss of even a single skilled worker can harm , where \u03b5 is the elasticity of the skilled wage with respect to the skilled labor supply and s is the skilled worker share of GDP (see Borjas 1995) . 19 There is a large empirical literature that attempts to measure the effect of immigration on local wages (see Borjas 1994 and Hunt 1995 for surveys) . There are three main types of studies: area studies that compare wages across labor markets receiving different numbers of immigrants; natural experiments that look for immigration changes that are independent of developments in local labor markers; and calibration studies that estimate how relative factor supplies affect relative wages for different skill groups and then calculate how immigration with a given skill mix affects relative wages.\nAdvocates of the latter method argue that the first two types of study fail to account for native outflows in response to immigrant inflows. The first two types of studies tend to find small wage effects (see Altonji and Card 1991, and Card 1990) . The third type of study tends to find larger wage effects (see Borjas et al. 1996) . 20 The key to identifying such losses is that we consider the skilled emigration in total with the initial wage as our reference point rather than taking each emigrant one-by-one taking previous emigration as given.\nloss to Indian TLBs from skilled Indian emigration to the US. Their method is to infer what fiscal contributions emigrant Indians would be making had they stayed in India by\ncombining estimates of what their Indian incomes would be and summary measures of the progressive tax and expenditure system. Using their preferred income inference method and a conservatively high estimate of expenditure saving, they find a tax loss equal to 0.58 percent of GDP and a net fiscal loss equal to 0.24 percent of GDP. The largest component of the tax loss is the loss of central government income tax revenues (0.44 percent of GDP), which represents a substantial fraction of central direct tax revenues.\n(ii) Scale effects The assumptions of constant returns to scale and strictly diminishing returns to skilled workers may lead us to miss important channels through which emigration harms domestic industry. The scale of the skilled labor may affect an emerging software industry in a number of ways. As examples, the \"thickness\" of skill markets could affect the willingness of foreign firms to search the economy for investment locations or outsourcing partners (Grossman and Helpman 2002) , or there may be uncompensated knowledge spillovers between skilled workers.\n(iii) Non-competitive wage setting and heterogeneous skills: In our simple model we assume that skilled workers are paid their marginal product so that the emigration of a single worker will not (assuming no fiscal effects) harm the welfare of TLBs. Another situation where this is unlikely is when particular worker skills are uniquely matched to a particular firm. This skill specificity is important for knowledge intensive industries such as software, where competitive advantage can turn attracting and retaining \"core competents\" (not to be confused with core competence). In this case it is more appropriate to assume that the wage is determined by bilateral bargaining, with the surplus between the worker's value to the firm and their next best wage offer being split according to their relative bargaining power. Assuming the firm has at least some bargaining power, the wage will be set below the workers marginal value product. Thus the loss of this worker to emigration will result in a loss to TLBs. 21 The likelihood that it is uniquely talented workers that are lost to emigration also suggests that we can't look simply at the number of emigrants, or even the number of emigrants in broadly defined skill categories. The loss of even a few \"institution builders,\" for example, might have large development effects. Studies of the graduates of the elite Indian Institutes of\nTechnology provide a good illustration of this concern. The acceptance rate in these institutions is between 1 and 2 percent of an applicant pool that is already highly open economy facing given terms of trade, internationally equalized factor prices and using the same technologies as its trading partners, the emigration of skilled workers will cause a reallocation of resources away from skill intensive sectors. But in contrast to our simple closed diminishing returns to skill model there is no change in the skilled wage or any other factor price. Since software is a skill intensive sector, this model predicts that emigration shrinks the software sector, but does not harm the welfare of TLBs as factor 21 Monoponistic wage setting-where wages are set by a single buyer in the relevant skill market-provides another example of non competitive wage setting in which the skilled wage will be below the marginal value product. Employers with monopsony powers in the labor market will weigh increases in the quantity of skilled offered to them when they increase the wage with the cost of raising the wage for everyone. (We assume that the monopsonist employer must pay the same wage to everyone.) The optimal employment equates the marginal cost of hiring more workers with the marginal value product. At this optimal employment the wage is again less than the marginal value product. Such a incomes are unchanged. The mechanism at work is that described by the well-known Rybczyznski Theorem: output is reallocated away from the skill intensive sector until the demand for skill is reduced to match the shrunken supply. (1998) ). An open economy setting moves attention away from current income losses to TLBs, to shifts in the allocation of remaining resources to industries with lower growth potential."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "monopsony skill market could develop where a large firm, say a Microsoft or an Intel, is a dominant presence in the area. 22 Trefler (1997) examines the effects of migration in a variety of trade models. Though he focuses on immigration in an attempt to dismiss the myth of an \"immigration surplus, his results can be turned around to examine the effects of emigration in an economy open to trade. Trefler's results show that an emigration surplus loss is present in a specific factors trade model, whether skilled workers are the mobile factor or one of the specific factors. He also shows how the Heckscher-Ohlin results change when technologies differ across countries. It turns out that it matters whether the technological (or productivity) differences are inherent to workers (so that the any technological backwardness travels with them) or to countries (so that an emigrating worker can leave their backwardness behind.) When technology differences are inherent to workers, he shows that the standard Heckscher-Ohlin results are not affected as factor price equalization occurs for productivity adjusted factor prices. This is not true when technology differences are specific to countries as emigration leads to favourable movements in the terms of trade and an increase in the welfare of TLBs. 23 In a provocative recent paper, Davis and Weinstein (2002) have examined the impact of balanced flows of factors to an economy (they focus on the US) with a superior CRS"}, {"section_title": "Diaspora", "text": "It is increasingly recognized that a country's overseas nationals, and even those who claim distant ancestral heritage, can be a valuable economic asset (see e.g., Rauch, 2001, and Saxenian 2002) . 24 In this part, we briefly explore the broad mechanisms through which such a connected diaspora can be a boon to a country's emerging hightech industries in doing international business. technology. To the extent that the resulting increased size of the economy leads to a worsening of its terms of trade, the balanced inflow of productive factors leads to lower welfare (see also Trefler 1997) . They argue that the US has been made worse off due to its openness to foreign capital and workers. On sending side, a balanced outflow of factors will lead to an improvement in welfare provided it is large enough for its terms of trade to change. A welfare loss to the sending country could reemerge if the factor outflows are unbalanced (say all skilled workers) or if there are economies of scale. 24 Rauch (2001) provides a comprehensive recent survey. 25 In passing we note that although conventional transportation costs may be lower for \"weightless\" output such as software, its often non-standard nature makes it subject to substantial non-transport related transaction costs, increasing the potential importance of a trade-facilitating diaspora.\nSuch attachments to home country products are probably not of great importance for the high-tech sector. Of more importance is the knowledge that emigrants have of trading and investment opportunities back home, possibly combined with a desire to put business and advice the way of emerging home country businesses where feasible. This willingness to trade and invest goes beyond preference and information; it also reflects ability to pay. Skilled emigrants from poorer countries often earn substantially more in their adopted countries than they earned prior to leaving-which can grow into substantial purchasing/investing power as the emigrants sacrifice consumption to accumulate financial wealth. To the extent that this wealth leads to business with home country firms, the origin country gets to share in the emigrant's gains from leaving or \"emigrant's surplus.\"\nThe transnational economic role of disaporas is the subject of a good deal of informal speculation but little formal analysis formal analysis. 27 26 A recent paper that looks at the determinants of US foreign direct investment in Ireland is Gunnigle and McGuire (2001) . The main source of information is interviews with high ranking executives from 10 major US multinationals. The paper addresses more objective determinants of the decision to invest such as the corporate tax regime and labor cost and quality. Intriguingly, Table 3 in the paper does list one vice president for strategy of an electronics firms as listing \"culture and identity\" as one of the key factors behind the decision to locate in Ireland. 27 Among other examples of diaspora influence, Breznitz (2003) describes how the a member of the American Jewish diaspora, venture capitalist Fred Adler, was instrumental in arranging an important early IPO for the technology firm Elscient in the early 1970s."}, {"section_title": "Reputational Intermediaries", "text": "International business is greatly complicated by poor information on distant trading partners and the difficulties of contracting across national boundaries. To examine how a connected diaspora might facilitate such business, we take the example of a US software firm looking to outsource a once-off software development project, with all the attendant difficulties modeled in the Grossman and Helpman paper referenced in the introduction. The US firm lacks information on the capabilities of the software firms in various locations, and is worried about being \"held up\" by any overseas party due to difficulties in writing and enforcing contracts with opportunistic trading partners. We note three distinct ways in which members of the diaspora can serve as what we loosely call \"reputational intermediaries.\" his own as a network intermediary (i.e., becoming an entrepreneur) or staying in 28 As far as we know the term \"reputational intermediary\" was first introduced in Kapur (2001b) . 29 An interesting Fortune magazine article profiling the Indian Silicon Valley businessman and technologist Kanwal Rekhi describes a reputational intermediary of the form we have in mind in action (Warner 2000) . Rekhi is the former CTO for Novell and a founding member of the Silicon Valley professional organization The Indus Entrepreneurs, or TiE. Commenting on one Indian-American businessman who had come to him looking for a reference to investors, Rekhi is quoted as responding, \"I wouldn't send you to anyone until I figure out your plan. I have to feel good about someone when I refer them. Or else people call me up and say 'Why did you send me that one?'\" Rekhi's value as a reputational intermediary comes out clearly in the article employment. A network intermediary sells the service of matching buyers with suppliers. Members of the diaspora might be well placed to act as such intermediaries if they have richer knowledge of home country firms or ways of finding this information out. Reputational intermediaries are likely to matter more where knowledge is tacit.\nInformation is distant invariant, knowledge is more contextual. Unlike many manufacturing sectors where ex ante knowledge of quality is more easily discernible through third party certification (like ISO, ASTM etc\u2026.) this is much less the case with services where quality can only be discerned after use.\n(ii) Contract fulfillment: Moving beyond the search process, reputational intermediaries can ensure that each side lives up to its side of the deal. 30 Once the deal has been signed, the supplying firm may be willing to act opportunistically with its outsourcing partner, but may be unwilling to risk its reputation with the member of the diaspora vouching for their trustworthiness. The power of the vouching party can be greatly enhanced if they can \"blacklist\" an offending home country businessperson within the diasporic network.\nOn the other side of the deal, the outsourcing firm may also value its reputation for fair dealing with the intermediary and the diasporic network they belong to. In essence, the intermediary is leveraging its long-term relationship with each party to overcome the often severe difficulties with one-shot contracts across weak legal systems.\nA diaspora's influence is a function both of its own characteristics as well as of the country of origin. There are five features of a diaspora's reputational role that are important to note. First, there is a threshold of the country of origin's economic openness, below which diaspora's have little effect. The three countries examined in this paper (as well as China) were all closed economies for many years during which period their diasporas played little role. It is only after the countries began to open up that the effects of disaporas became more important. Second, the disapora can play a reputational role only when it itself has a reputation. A good proxy for this is the size and education of from the number of Indian entrepreneurs that come to him seeking his help. The aforementioned quote also shows how seriously he takes the value of reputation. the diaspora. Thus despite their sizes, the diasporas from Central America and the (2001) for a game theoretic model of such intermediary-based contract enforcement. 31 The fact that the share of India's IT exports-North America 62 percent, Europe 24 percent Japan 4 percent-is roughly the average of these regions share of India's skill migration and the region's share of global IT industry-is suggestive that incorporating the size and skills of diasporas in gravity models of global IT trade may be worthwhile.\nbelongs to. These prior beliefs can be altered through contacts with members of the diaspora. For example, if a firm dealing in the US with Indian engineers from the elite IITs, show them to be excellently trained, this experience can lead to upward revision of priors about the quality of Indian engineers in India from these institutions, and possibly other institutions as well. This mechanism will be especially important if the industry and firms in question do not share the negative attributes of other more prominent industries in their country-a fact that may be poorly appreciated by the outsourcer."}, {"section_title": "Return", "text": "Lastly we turn to the impact of returned emigrants. Our interest is how the fact that some part of the population spent time abroad affects the welfare of that population, including the welfare of the returned emigrants themselves. This is consistent with our intention to examine how emigration-prospective, present, and past-affects the existing population at a particular point in time. Time spent in work or study abroad can augment human capital as emigrants acquire knowledge of frontier technologies and market opportunities, management know-how, languages, business contacts, and so on.\nIn addition to direct individual productivity enhancing effects, emigrants may have saved part of their \"emigration surplus,\" accumulating financial capital they can bring back with them for investment at home. If they have been away for long enough they may also have acquired entitlements to foreign social insurance benefits. For example, 10 years of contributions to the US Social Security system creates entitlement to retirement income benefits. The return on contributions can actually be quite high for returned emigrants given that the average monthly earnings used in the benefit formula is an average of the worker's highest earning 35 years, and the benefit formula is a progressive function of thus calculated average earnings. 32 However, the available evidence suggests that the probability of migrants returning declines with time -hence very few of those who stay for a decade return in the first place. In contrast, most of those who do return do so well 32 Many returned emigrants will have worked far less than 35 years meaning that there are many zeros in the numerator of the average wage calculation.\nwithin 10 years -in which case the loss from uncollected social security taxes is substantial.\nOf course the benefits from past emigration must be weighed against the negative impacts on the economy during the time they were gone. One factor increasing the probability of an overall positive balance is that temporary emigrants engage in a form of inter-temporal substitution-leaving when times are bad (and the domestic value of their skills is low) and returning when the domestic demand for their skills is higher. This seems a reasonable description of the well-educated Irish graduates who a slumping Irish economy in the 1980s, many of whom returned to propel the \"Celtic Tiger\" economy of the 1990s. We return to this example of \"brain circulation\" as the second of our applications in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Section 4: Applications", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Transnational connections: India's Silicon Valley diaspora", "text": "In Section 2 we outlined the large increase in the number of highly skilled Indians residing in the US. The Indian-born population in the US increased by more than half a million over the course of the 1990s alone, and an analysis of the March 2000 CPS reveals that 78 percent of these recent arrivals had a Bachelors degree or better-with exactly half in the \"or better\" category.\nIn a widely discussed study Saxenian (1999) drew attention to the impact these absent Indians (and Chinese) were having on economic success of high tech industries in Silicon Valley. One fascinating finding was that Indians were running 9 percent of Silicon Valley start-ups from the period 1995 to 1998-almost 70 percent of which were in the software sector. These findings have, however, raised obvious questions about the effect that such absent talent and entrepreneurship is having on the domestic Indian economy. But the study also hints at the connections that these \"absent\" Indians retained and cultivated with people and businesses back home. Saxenien (2002) Before reviewing Saxenian's findings, we first recap the ways our framework suggests that a human capital rich diaspora could be an international business asset. We saw that the combination of preference, knowledge, and ability to pay may make members of the diaspora willing customers, investors and purveyors of information.\nTheir knowledge of the needs and capabilities of both US-and India-based firms make them potentially useful intermediaries in the search and matching process. Taiwanese who received their highest degree from US institutions.\nIn Table 6 we reproduce a sample of Saxenien's findings on the degree of connectedness of these admittedly elite Indian professionals to those in India. 77 percent of the Indian born had one or more friends who returned to India to start a company. 52 percent travel to India on business at least once a year. 27 percent report regularly Valley resident Indians and those in India, should however, be interpreted with care.\nThere are strong problems of self-selection into such associations and in the choice to respond to the survey. 34 There is also reason to believe that diasporas will exaggerate their contribution to the country of origin. These figures contradict what is known about the activities of Indian diaspora from other sources. One problem is that the investment data is silent on the magnitude of investments. Foreign direct investment from the Indian diaspora is less than 5 percent of its Chinese counterparts-even though the propensity to invest is comparable for the two diasporas in Saxenian's survey. Similarly, the finding that 45% would consider returning is belied by reality. While aggregate data on return migration is unavailable, segment specific data such as NSF longitudinal data on PhD students suggests a number closer to 10 percent.\nThese survey results indicate that the Silicon Valley based Indian diaspora have transnational links with the Indian IT sector. At least for this group, skilled emigration is not simply a one-way \"brain drain.\" Although the results are revealing, we are still left with the question of whether the loss of such evident productive/entrepreneurial potential form the Indian economy in counterbalanced by the diaspora's role in breaking down barriers to international business for Indians who remain. One suggestive piece of evidence from the survey itself is that 73 percent of Indians responding to the question \"Which factors would figure most importantly in your decision to start a business in your country of birth?\" listed the \"availability of skilled workers.\" 35 This answer is interesting in the context of the tradeoff we discussed earlier between emigration thinning domestic labor markets (and thus reducing the incentive to search for business opportunities) and the role of the diaspora in helping to facilitate and fund such opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Fueling the Tiger: Irish grads come home", "text": "Showing few hints of the \"Tiger\" economy that would emerge in the 1990s, Irish economic performance through much of the 1980s was anemic. Between 1982 and 1989 employment actually fell by 5 percent, and the unemployment hovered in the mid-teens (OECD 2000) . Throughout this period tertiary education enrollments continued to expand strongly, growing by 64 percent over the course of the decade (Clancy 2001 ).\nThis growth followed rapid growth in the 50s (56 percent), 60s (129 percent), and 70s (92 34 The overall response rate was 21 percent. 35 Of the Indian born who had actually set up business relationships in India, 85 percent listed the availability of skilled workers as a key contributing factor to their decision. 73 percent listed the low cost of labor. percent). It is not surprising that with such a dire labor market, and Ireland's tradition of emigration in hard economic times, a number of new graduates choose to emigrate. The most plausible explanation is that Ireland was on a long-term fast growth path for some time, underpinned by its initial relative backwardness and thus opportunity of catch-up growth, increased investments in the education starting in the 1950s, and its openness to trade and foreign investment. The 1980s debacle was the result the result of poor macroeconomic conditions-partly brought on by earlier fiscal profligacy-and the percent of returnees had a third level education compared with 26 percent in the nonreturnee population. Thus returning emigrants provided a significant boost to human capital resources at a time that skill shortages were becoming more apparent.\nHow does their time spent abroad affect the productivity of these returnees? Barrett and O'Connell (2001) have estimated an earnings equation to examine how emigration affected the 1992 cohort of graduates. Using earnings data from 1998, they found that returnees earned 5 percent premium over those who never left. The premium differed sharply between men and women, with male returnees earning a 10 percent premium and female returnees earning no premium at all. For emigrants who were working through of a process of creative destruction of older labor intensive manufacturing industries in the context of rigid and excessive real wages in low productivity firms.\ndeemed to have left for labor market reasons the premium was even higher-8 percent overall and 15 percent for men. Again, the premium for women was essentially zero (with a point estimate of -1 percent).\nOf particular interest to the present study, Barrett and O'Connell also separately examine the premium for different industries. The computer sector had the highest overall premium at 16 percent. In contrast to the all-industry results, women actually had a higher premium in computers (21 percent) than men (11 percent)."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "There is also evidence that returning skilled emigrants have significantly limited the rise in skill premiums at a time of strongly rising demand for skill (Barrett et al. 2000) . Since the increase in surplus to existing factors of production in Ireland from returning emigrants depends, in part, on their effect on domestic wages, this is consistent overall beneficial effect from returnees. Barrett et al. (2000) show that with net immigration of 16,000 per year between 1996 and 1999, and assuming that all of this net immigration is skilled, the supply of skilled labor increases by 3.2 percent and skilled wages decrease by 4.7 percent. A standard social surplus calculation based on these estimates yields a total gain to the preexisting population of less that one-tenth of one percent of the skilled wage bill. 39 This calculation, however, ignores any fiscal benefits from bringing in individuals likely to make positive net fiscal contributions, any benefits 31 37 36 percent of total were between the ages of 25 and 39 on census night. 38 Barrett and O'Connell considered different explanations for why returnees have higher earnings than those who stay. In addition to the human capital accumulation story, they also considered the possibility of emigration as a signal of quality (positive or negative) and the possibility that it is the more able (with ability unobserved by econometrician) that choose to emigrate. Although they are cautious in their conclusions, they view their results as more supportive of the human capital based explanation than the signaling or self selection explanations. 39 Applying the standard social surplus calculation (ignoring fiscal effects and externalities) yields a small surplus gain equal to 0.07 percent of the skilled wage bill. We can calculate the surplus gain as a share of the initial skilled wage bill as\n, where \u03b5 is the elasticity of the skilled wage with respect to the skilled labor supply, N is the net immigration of skilled workers, and S is the initial supply of skilled workers (see Borjas 1995) . The elasticity of the wage with respect to the supply from increased scale or spillovers from the expanded skilled labor supply, the benefits of providing unique skills to the Irish economy, or the investment induced by larger (and cheaper) supplies of skills. of skilled labor is given by the ratio of the percentage change in the wage divided by the percentage increase in skilled labor, approximately 1.5. 40 On the other hand, it also ignores negative spillovers from rising road congestion and increased pollution. It also ignores any distributional effects that stem from rising housing and land prices. 41 74 percent of Irish software companies have a founder who worked abroad. Not surprisingly, company founders are also highly educated: 83 have a Bachelors degree, 31 percent a Masters degree, and 9 percent a PhD (Sands, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "4.1: Almost one million Soviets come to Israel: What boost to Israeli software?", "text": "Between 1990 One would expect that such a huge inflow of skilled workers was a boon to\nIsrael's emerging high tech sector including its software sector. However, finding a large immigration footprint turns out to be harder than, at least we, expected.\nThe first surprise is that this skilled-biased inflow has not lowered the skilled wage premium (Weiss 2000 , Friedberg 2001 ). Gandal et al. (2000) explore two open economy mechanisms that could explain this puzzling absence of a wage effect. The first explanation is that the timing of the inflow coincided with a global burst of skill biased technical change (SBTC) that increased the demand for skilled workers across sectors."}, {"section_title": "43", "text": "This technical change explanation is consistent with a gain from skilled immigration as the increased supply of skill moves the economy down along the (now higher) skill demand curve. Put another way, the immigration prevents the rise in skilled wage costs that would have occurred due to surging skill demands.\nThe second explanation applies the Rybczynski Theorem to predict a sectoral reallocation of resources towards industries intensive in the use of the newly abundant 42 60 percent of these scientific and academic workers are classed as engineers or architects (Central Bureau of Statistics 2001).\nfactor of production. 44 The resulting expansion of skill intensive sectors increases the demand for skill sufficiently to offset the increased supply, which could explain the lack of wage change. 45 Gandal et al. note their \"mild surprise\" that the latter mechanismsectoral output changes-did not play a role in absorbing immigrant inflows. 43 That is, there is a broad shift in production methods towards using relatively more skilled workers, though the extent of the relative shift can differ across industries. 44 In other words, rather than within-industry changes in the use of skilled workers, industries that use skilled workers intensively expand at the expense of other industries. This leads to an overall increase in the demand for skill. 45 Weiss (2000) offers the additional explanation that an increase in skill-complementing capital accumulation led to the offsetting increase in the demand for skill. He also considers the possibility that immigrant inflows did not initially compete strongly with domestic skill due to the poor transferability of Soviet skills and qualifications. He finds evidence of increasing substitutability between the skills of veteran Israelis and immigrants over time. 46 One puzzling aspect of the Gandal et al. results stems from the fact that skill-biased technical change has raised the skilled wage premium in the US. If factor price equalization was truly operating and Israeli firms had access to the new technologies, then skilled wages should rise in Israel as well-no matter what was happening to skill supplies. The mechanism to bring about the increase in Israeli wages given the common skill-biased technical change and Israel-specific increase in skill supplies should have been a reallocation of resources to skill intensive industries. 47 The share of computers & related services and R&D sector employment in total employment remained small: the share was 1.7 percent in 1995 and rising to 2.8 percent in 1999.\nrequirements of these industries and the skill intensity of the immigrants, we might expect that immigrants would be overrepresented in these sectors. PhDs from U.S. universities had dropped to 61, though the percentage planning to stay had risen (57 percent with plans to stay and 41 percent with firm plans to stay)."}, {"section_title": "Section 5. Concluding Comments", "text": "Although the details of the software industry development stories differ a great deal between the three countries, the broad outlines are similar. All three countries produce impressive levels of high-end human capital; country-specific inefficiencies had meant that the human capital was poorly utilized and thus relatively cheap; and the software sector, for reasons that other papers in this volume examine, has proved relatively effective in taking advantage of this cost advantage. This is the opportunity side of the story. Yet the same international wage gap that created the opening for high-tech industry overall, and 43 percent in the total economy (authors' calculations from Table 3 of Central Bureau of Statistics 2002).\nsoftware also creates a strong incentive to emigrate, possibly undermining the competitive advantage. But although skilled emigration is usually seen in such threatening \"brain drain\" terms, its effects are multi-faceted and poorly understood. In addition to the harm done by the absence of domestically produced human capital, we must also consider such factors as the commerce facilitating effects of diasporas and the possibility of skill-enhanced emigrant return. Overall, the evidence is strongly suggestive that the benefits of skilled migration have outweighed the costs for the three countries. The Indian experience in Silicon Valley, for example, shows how the diaspora can be a valuable national asset in facilitating international commerce, especially where the business is transactionally complex and reputation concerns are paramount. Although a full cost-benefit analysis is beyond our scope, our judgment is that highly skilled Indian emigration has played a key part in the development of an internationally competitive Indian software sector. The Irish experience shows how one decade's lost human capital can, under the right conditions, become a skill reservoir that can be tapped to ease resource constraints and sustain economic expansion as domestic labor markets tighten.\nThe experience also suggests a positive productivity effect of time spent abroad that is especially pronounced for the computer sector. And although it is difficult to find a substantial entrepreneurial footprint of Russian emigrants in Israeli software industry, such a massive influx of skilled workers almost certainly has helped to relieve wage cost pressures in this rapidly expanding sector, in part by easing supply constraints in competing sectors.\nThe foregoing sections have reviewed available measures of international human capital flows for the three countries, provided a (hopefully) comprehensive list of the channels through which such flows could help or hinder the development of their software industries, and applied parts of the framework to look at some specific episodes that we think have been especially important for the countries in this project. In closing we note some questions relating to each of the three countries we think provide opportunities for fruitful research. 50 Statistics are un-published tabulations from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, Division of Science Resources Statistics.\nThe Saxenian (2002) study has painted an optimistic picture of the role played by the Indian diaspora in facilitating international business for home-country firms. Our assessment is that the Indian diaspora is less tightly linked than suggested by her survey respondents. More work is needed to confirm and extend our understanding of the diaspora's role. In this vein, we are currently using data on the location of patenting inventors and the location of patent citations to investigate the extent of knowledge flows to inventors' formers homes (see, for example, Agrawal et. al. 2003) . We are also beginning a project that uses comprehensive lists of ethnic surnames to track knowledge flows between co-ethnics. Too little is also known about the negative effects from the absence in the Indian economy of some of the country's most talented individuals.\nTogether with a colleague (see Desai et al. 2001) , we have taken a modest step to measuring part of this loss by describing the characteristics of the US-resident Indian- Turning to Ireland, we need to know more about the backgrounds of Irish software workers from detailed survey evidence to gauge the impact of returning emigrants on the development of Irish software firms (see, however, the work of Sands, this volume). How many software professionals are returned emigrants? And how has their international experience increased the value of these returnees through further education, frontier firm exposure, business contacts, etc? What is the importance of the multinational sector as supplier of talent to indigenous firms? On the issue of the multinationals more generally, it would be interesting to go beyond anecdotal evidence about the role of the Irish, Indian and Israeli diasporas in tilting foreign direct investment in their country's favor to some harder evidence. One possibility is to adopt a differencein-difference approach, comparing, say, the difference in gap between US-investment per employed worker in Ireland and Scotland and the gap between Japanese investment per employed worker in these two countries. Of course, a significant difference-in-difference could be due factors other than a larger Irish diaspora. But a significant finding would be highly suggestive nonetheless.\nFinally the work of Gandal et al. (2000) has provided some intriguing evidence of how mass skilled immigration affected the Israeli labor market and industry structure.\nTheir industry analysis, however, was conducted at too aggregated an industry level to get a good feel for how the software sector was affected in particular. A more disaggregated analysis would give a better idea of how this immigration affected Israeli comparative advantage in software."}, {"section_title": "51", "text": "Other issues we think are worth exploring in greater depth are the extent of \"hollowing out\" of skills due to foreign takeovers of emerging Israeli software firms and Israeli company listings on US stock markets, the role of prospect of a foreign takeover or stock exchange listing on the incentive to pursue a high-tech start-up in the first place, and the long-run human capital impact of Israeli students getting advanced education abroad."}]
