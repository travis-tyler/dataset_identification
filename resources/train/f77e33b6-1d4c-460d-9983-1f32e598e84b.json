In the future climate projections, hypothetical sea surface temperature (SST) is assumed where the interannual variability of SST remains same as in the present climate. The annual maximum 1-day precipitation total (R1d) over the western North Pacific is largely associated with tropical cyclone activity and positively correlated to the Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies. It is found that climatological mean R1d will only modestly increase in the western North Pacific in the future, but interannual variability of R1d will largely increase compared to the present due to enhanced association with El Ni\u00f1o. This implies an increasing risk of heavier rainfall events by global warming around the western North Pacific countries.\n(Citation: Kitoh, A., and H.

Present-day reproducibility of ENSO and its future change varies much among the models. By analysing 34 climate models participating in the Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), Taschetto et al. (2014) find no consistent changes across the models in the location and magnitude of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, frequency, or temporal evolution of El Ni\u00f1o events in a warmer world. IPCC (2013) assessed that natural modulations of the variance and spatial pattern of ENSO are so large in models that confidence in any specific projected change in its variability in the 21st century remains low. It is also assessed that ENSO will still be the most dominant year-to-year variations of the future tropical climate system and due to increased moisture availability, the associated precipitation variability on regional scales likely intensifies. Cai et al. (2015) showed that mean state change of the tropical Pacific will cause an increased frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events and an eastward shift of the ENSO rainfall teleconnections with a likely increased intensity. The CMIP5 models project a strengthening ENSO effect on the northwest Pacific and East Asia summer climate (Hu et al. 2014) .\nThe western North Pacific is the most active region of tropical cyclones. There are numerous studies on the variability of tropical cyclones. Under the global warming, global maximum wind speed and precipitation rates are projected to increase (IPCC 2013) . The ENSO is known to affect the western North Pacific tropical cyclone (typhoon) activity in its location (Takaya et al. 2010 ) and intensity (Camargo and Sobel 2005) . Therefore, changes in both ENSO and tropical cyclones on local precipitation in a warmer world should be investigated to assess changes in natural hazards to cope with possible risk increases.\nA global high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model with grid size about 20 km is used to project future changes in rainfall extremes associated with El Ni\u00f1o at the end of the 21st century. As reliable projections of future ENSO characteristics are not available, we use hypothetical SST in the future climate projections where the interannual variability of SST is assumed to remain as in the present climate. This strategy is used to assess future changes in weather and climate extremes including tropical cyclones (Murakami et al. 2011 (Murakami et al. , 2012 and heavy precipitation (Kitoh et al. 2009; Kitoh and Endo 2016) as well as changes in teleconnections such as the ENSO-forced Pacific-North Pacific pattern (Zhou et al. 2014 )."}, {"section_title": "Model and experiment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MRI AGCM", "text": "We used a global 20-km mesh Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) version 3.2 (MRI-AGCM3.2, .

For cumulus parameterization scheme, a new mass-flux type scheme (Yoshimura et al. 2015) is used.\nThis model has superiority than the previous version in reproducing global distribution of strong tropical cyclones (TC) such as categories 4 and 5 (Murakami et al. 2012) . In a warmer climate, genesis frequency of TC is projected to significantly decrease in the western North Pacific and South Pacific, and increase in the tropical central Pacific (Murakami et al. 2012) . Endo et al. (2012) showed an increase in extreme precipitation in South Asia and Southeast Asia in future climate. Kitoh and Endo (2016) further investigated future changes in precipitation extremes. They found that South Asia is the region of the largest extreme precipitation increase, while heavy precipitation increases in all regional domains even where mean precipitation decreases."}, {"section_title": "Experiment method", "text": "The present climate simulation used the observed interannually varying monthly mean SST and sea-ice concentration during 1979\u22122003 based on the HadISST1.1 data (Rayner et al. 2003) . Two 25-year ensemble simulations were made from different atmospheric initial conditions, thus we have 50-year present-day simulation data.\nFor the future climate (2075\u22122099) , the boundary SST data were prepared by superposing the future change in the multimodel ensemble of SST projected by CMIP5 models to the present-day observed SST. See Mizuta et al. (2008) for the details. In order to assess the uncertainty in projections, we made other three simulations with different SST spatial patterns. Three SST patterns are obtained by a cluster analysis of 28 CMIP5 RCP8.5 experiments (Mizuta et al. 2014 ): cluster 1 is characterized by a nearly uniform warming in the both hemispheres, cluster 3 is dominated by a larger warming in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, and cluster 2 shows a larger warming over the central equatorial Pacific (El Ni\u00f1o-like pattern). Overall, four-member 25-year simulations were performed for the future, "}, {"section_title": "Observation data", "text": "In order to investigate precipitation extremes associated with ENSO, we use daily precipitation data. For observed precipitation data, we used Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 product in version 6 (Huffman et al. 2007) , which covers 1998\u22122013. The TRMM data resolution is 0.25 degree and is very close to the model resolution.\nFor the observed TC tracks, we used International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) v03r06 (Knapp et al. 2010 )."}, {"section_title": "Present-day R1d associated with El Ni\u00f1o and tropical cyclones", "text": "MRI-AGCM3.2 shows good skill in simulating monsoon circulations and precipitation. The model also reproduces various characteristics of TC such as their intensity and global distribution ). Kitoh and Endo (2016) showed that the 20-km mesh MRI-AGCM3.2 has good skill in reproducing precipitation extremes such as R1d in its present-day simulation. Note that all figures in the portrait format are drawn with 1 degree by 1 degree box averaging for visual easiness. Observation is given in Fig. 3a , which shows large R1d over the western Tropical Pacific and South China Sea, the Bay of Bengal, South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The 20-km mesh MRI-AGCM3.2 well reproduces spatial distribution as well as intensity of R1d compared with TRMM 3B42 data, although the model overestimates R1d over SPCZ and ITCZ. Area average R1d over 50\u00b0S\u221250\u00b0N, 0\u00b0\u2212360\u00b0 is 74.5 mm by the model, which is close to the observation (76.7 mm).\nresulting in 100-year data for future climate. Kitoh and Endo (2016) investigated projected changes in regional precipitation extremes such as annual maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5d) and annual maximum 1-day precipitation total (R1d) over 22 regional land domains using the above ensemble simulation data, showing an increase in all regional domains, even where mean precipitation decreases. They also noted that different SST patterns resulted in large precipitation changes in some domains, possibly related to changes in large-scale circulations in the tropical Pacific. Heavy precipitation events in the tropics often occur associated with TC. We define TC-associated precipitation as that within a 500 km radius of TC centers because precipitation concentrates within a 5-degree radius around the TC centers (Kamahori 2012) . As TC track data is available every 6 hours, calculation is made 6 hourly, and then accumulated daily precipitation is used to calculate TC-associated R1d. The criteria defining simulated TC are model-dependent in such a way that the present-day global annual mean TC number matches the observed number (84 per year) as shown in Murakami et al. (2012) . In our definition, in years when TC does not exist within a 500 km radius of a given grid, TC-associated R1d becomes zero. Figures 2b and 3b show that the 20-km mesh MRI-AGCM3.2 reproduces well the observed TC-associated R1d quantitatively. The ratio of the TC-associated R1d to the total R1d is greater than 80% over the western Pacific (the Philippines Sea and the South China Sea), off Mexico, northwest of Australia and east of Madagascar. There exist the years in which non-TC-associated rainfall contributes the R1d. Over the western Pacific, simulated TCassociated R1d is displaced northward compared to the observation. This may be related to the model's bias of a northward shift of typhoons (Murakami et al. 2012 ).\nNext we investigate interannual variations of precipitation extremes associated with El Ni\u00f1o. Figure 2c shows regression coefficients of R1d on Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies. Here annual mean data in calendar year is used because R1d is calculated in an annual basis. As is well known, total precipitation anomaly in El Ni\u00f1o years is positive over the central equatorial Pacific and ITCZ in the eastern Pacific, and is negative over the western Pacific and maritime continent. This feature is well reproduced by the model (not shown). Simulated spatial regression map of R1d on Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies is overall similar to that of total precipitation, except for the western Pacific where R1d is positively correlated to Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies (Fig. 2c) . This feature is also seen in the observed data for a period 1998\u22122013 (Fig. 3c) , although a strict comparison cannot be made because of different data periods between the observation and the model.\nPositive R1d anomalies over the western Pacific in El Ni\u00f1o years come from heavy precipitation associated with TC. Figure  2d shows the regression coefficients of TC-associated R1d on Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies in the present-day experiment. Simulated TC-associated R1d in El Ni\u00f1o years is large positive to the east of the Philippines while negative in the South China Sea. It is also positive over the oceans northeast of Australia, while negative northwest of Australia. Over the Indian Ocean, it is positive over the western Indian Ocean and negative over the eastern Indian Ocean. Simulated TC-associated R1d in El Ni\u00f1o years is generally negative in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most of these features, in particular large contribution of TC for heavy precipitation in the western North Pacific, are seen in the observation (Fig. 3d )."}, {"section_title": "Future changes", "text": "Here we investigate future changes in R1d, TC-associated R1d, and their regressions on Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies. R1d in the future climate will increase almost everywhere (Fig. 4a) . Global average R1d increases about 25% from 61.6 mm to 77.5 mm. As the global annual mean surface air temperature increases 3.49\u00b0C in this experiment, the rate of R1d change is 7.4%/\u00b0C, which is close to the change of saturated vapor pressure by the ClausiusClapeyron relationship.\nLarge R1d change is projected over the central-eastern equatorial Pacific and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. India, central China, Sahel, equatorial South America and southern Brazil are the region of large R1d increases over land. The change is not significant over the western North Pacific. Future R1d is projected to decrease in some regions such as the South China Sea, the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the southern Atlantic Ocean. The latter two regions correspond to the oceanic regions where climatological R1d is small (Fig. 2a) . Similar to the spatial pattern of the total precipitation changes, which roughly follows the \"wet-gets-wetter\" (Held and Soden 2006) or \"warmer-gets-wetter\" pattern (Xie et al. 2010; Chadwick et al. 2013) , future changes in R1d also follow the climatological R1d pattern (Fig. 2a) . The exception is small change or reduction of R1d over the western North Pacific where the present-day R1d is large climatologically. This peculiar change may be related to changes in TC activity there. Murakami et al. (2012) investigated the TC changes by the MRI-AGCM3.2 using the mean SST warming by the CMIP3 models under the SRES A1B scenario. They found a 15% decrease of global TC number at the end of the 21st century compared to the present-day conditions. Regionally, they noted a decrease of TC frequency in the western North Pacific and in the South Pacific Ocean, and a marked increase in the central Pacific. Using the same experiment results, Murakami et al. (2013a Murakami et al. ( , 2013b discussed physical mechanisms and found that changes in large-scale environmental conditions are responsible to regional TC genesis frequency changes.\nIn our experiment, the global TC genesis number is projected to decrease by 24%. A larger reduction in TC number than that in Murakami et al. (2012) is consistent with a larger warming in our experiment as our experiment is based on the RCP8.5 scenario. Figure 4b shows the changes of TC-associated R1d in the future. The TC-associated R1d is projected to decrease in the western North Pacific, off the east of Australia, and tropical Indian Ocean. It is projected to increase near Hawaii, northern Indian Ocean. In other regions, changes are not statistically significant. This spatial pattern of TC-associated R1d change resembles the TC density change in the future (Fig. 5) . Therefore, less activity of TCs in the western North Pacific in the future climate may have resulted in decreased TC-associated R1d.\nNext we investigate R1d changes associated with El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 4c) . Regression coefficients of R1d on Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST anomalies are projected to increase over the northwestern Pacific, the equatorial Pacific and SPCZ. They will decrease off Mexico and off the east of Australia. Generally, the present-day pattern (Fig.  2c) is enhanced in the future climate, but statistical significance of changes in regression is low because of large interannual variability and small samples. There are some regional differences. For example, the positive anomalies in the South China Sea (Fig.  4c) imply weaker regressions in the future climate as compared to large negative regression coefficients in the present climate (Fig.  2c) .\nIn the present climate, TC-associated precipitation is particularly large in the western North Pacific in El Ni\u00f1o years (Fig. 2d) . In the future climate, this TC-associated precipitation in El Ni\u00f1o years will become much stronger (Fig. 4d) . On the other hand, changes in regression coefficients of TC-associated precipitation to Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST are negative over SPCZ and the Arabian Sea, and are positive over the Bay of Bengal and the southern Indian Ocean, tending to weaken the present-day relationship.\nWe have noted that R1d over the western North Pacific is very large in the present climate, but does not increase much in the future climate. Over there, TC-associated R1d actually decreases. Figure 6 shows the time-series of R1d averaged over the western North Pacific (120\u00b0E\u2212180\u00b0E, 0\u00b0N\u221225\u00b0N) for the present and the future. Here both the total R1d and TC-associated R1d are shown. The area average R1d increases by 11% from 106.8 mm to 118.5 mm, which is far less than the global mean R1d change (25%). In this region, the TC-associated R1d decreases by 25% from 52.4 mm to 39.4 mm, related to the TC density decrease by 47%.\nOn the other hand, interannual variability (denoted as standard deviations) increases both for total R1d and TC-associated R1d. A large increase is found in year 19, which corresponds to El Ni\u00f1o year (1997). The same is true for other three El Ni\u00f1o years (year 4, 13 and 24), but not so in year 9."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "A global 20-km mesh MRI-AGCM is used to project future changes in rainfall extremes associated with ENSO and TC. About 3\u00b0C warming in SST is given in future scenario, embedded on the same interannually varying SST to the present.\nRainfall extremes such as R1d are projected to increase in the future warmer world, with larger increase over the regions where it is climatologically large. The exception is the western North Pacific where there is only small change or even reduction of R1d is projected. This is mainly related to a decrease of TC frequency in this region.\nFor interannual variability, R1d over the western North Pacific is larger in El Ni\u00f1o years than in other years. This is related with variability of TC activity. In the future warmer climate, mean R1d in the western North Pacific does not change much, but interannual variability of R1d greatly increases associated with ENSO. Therefore heavy precipitation such as once in a 10-year event can largely increase. This implies a drastic increase in risk of heavy-rainfall induced disasters under by global warming over the western Pacific countries. As non-inclusion of air-sea interaction may affect magnitude of precipitation (Kitoh and Arakawa 1999; Zou and Zhou 2016) , more research is needed for quantitative discussions. It is also noted that statistical significance of changes in regression is low. One of the reasons is small sample size of the experiment, so that a large ensemble experiment is needed. "}]
