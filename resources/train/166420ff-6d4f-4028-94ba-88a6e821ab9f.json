During the disease process, synaptic function is altered early, relative to the manifestations of cognitive and clinical symptoms [1, 2] .\nNeuronal activity and more specifically presynaptic activity are reflected in glucose utilization [3] . Clinical 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detects this altered cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) [4, 5] , providing an accurate clinical tool for the noninvasive prognostic and diagnostic assessment in the evaluation of patients with AD [6] . A large body of literature confirms that AD is characterized by a specific regional pattern of CMRgl reductions, including CMRgl deficits in the parietotemporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe [6] [7] [8] . As the disease progresses, frontal association cortices become involved, while the cerebellum, striatum, basal ganglia, primary visual and sensorimotor cortices remain preserved [6, 8] . Despite some overlap, the characteristic AD pattern of CMRgl reductions yield high sensitivity in distinguishing AD from controls and other neurodegenerative diseases [6, 9, 10] . Furthermore, progressive CMRgl reductions are observed years in advance of clinical symptoms and the onset of dementia, and predict cognitive decline leading to conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD with high accuracy [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , supporting the role of FDG-PET as a biomarker of neuronal activity for early detection and disease monitoring in AD.\nA wide range of animal studies as well as double-tracer in vivo human imaging studies established the relationship and close correlation between local CMRgl and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) [20, 21] , termed neurovascular coupling [20] . Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) provides a noninvasive, quantitative measure of CBF by exploiting the endogenous spins of arterial water as a proxy for blood flow [22] . This is achieved by selectively inverting the magnetization of the arterial spins using MRI principles. ASL-MRI studies of AD patients and individuals with MCI have reported a similar pattern of regional hypoperfusion to that described in previous PET studies [23] [24] [25] . Given that ASL-MRI is entirely noninvasive, is free of ionizing radiation exposure, intravenous contrast agents and radioactive isotopes, is widely available and easily incorporated into clinical MRI sessions, it is potentially more suitable for screening and longitudinal disease tracking than FDG-PET. In support of this, recent studies have demonstrated that ASL-MRI and FDG-PET identify similar regional abnormalities and have comparable diagnostic accuracy in AD [26, 27] , yet emphasizing the regional variability in agreement between the two modalities [28] .\nThese studies focused on either the correlation between modalities in cognitively normal (CN) individuals or the discriminative power of each modality between CN subjects and patients with clinical AD diagnosis. Previous studies of AD suggested neurovascular decoupling [29] ; yet, the agreement between these modalities in the AD continuum, which is an important concept for early detection and disease monitoring, is unclear. Furthermore, these studies restricted their quantitative analyses to univariate region-of-interest or voxel-based statistics to determine the power of each modality to discriminate between AD patients and control subjects. Although this approach provides a good estimation of the differential pathology in the region mostly affected by the disease, it does not at all reflect the whole pattern of disease-related pathology over the whole brain. Yet, exactly this wholebrain pattern is crucial for the detection and differentiation of patients in the AD path from healthy aging.\nIn this study, we examined the ability of the CBF measures from ASL-MRI and CMRgl measures from FDG-PET in distinguishing patients in the AD continuum from healthy controls. This included asymptomatic controls and patients with early MCI, late MCI and AD, all with significant levels of cortical A\u03b2 based on their florbetapir PET scans to restrict the study to patients truly in the AD continuum. The discrimination power of each modality was based on the whole-brain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes identified by partial least squares (PLS) logistic regression, a multivariate analysis technique."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Materials", "text": "Subjects Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multisite study (see Appendix).

There was a greater agreement in the wholebrain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes, including parietotemporal regions, that best discriminated the A\u03b2+ subjects from the A\u03b2-CN subjects in the later disease stages. (2) Despite the differences in the whole-brain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes, discriminative powers of both modalities were similar with statistically nonsignificant performance differences in sensitivity and specificity. Taken together, the results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that ASL-MRI and FDG-PET have a similar sensitivity to detect A\u03b2+ subjects in the AD continuum. Our findings that ASL-MRI and FDG-PET show changes in different brain regions may be due to methodological differences or to alterations in neurovascular coupling. Our first finding was that ASL-MRI and FDG-PET have similar discriminative power to detect A\u03b2+ subjects in the AD continuum. Other studies also reported area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve greater than 0.9 for discriminating AD versus CN for both modalities [26, 27, 33, 34] . Reports of accuracy in classifying CN subjects and MCI using both CBF and CMRgl vary widely, with AUC ranging from 0.66 to 0.78 [33] [34] [35] . Unlike these studies where diagnostic groups were defined on clinical diagnosis, we limited diagnostic groups to A\u03b2+ subjects in the AD continuum and only included A\u03b2-CN subjects in the reference cohort, potentially minimizing the within-group heterogeneity and improving the power of biomarkerbased discrimination. We should note that small sample sizes might introduce type II error in our analysis.\nOur second finding was that ASL-MRI and FDG-PET showed changes in different brain regions in A\u03b2+ subjects including CN subjects as well as individuals with MCI and AD, when compared to A\u03b2-CN subjects. There are two possible explanations for this: methodological differences and alterations of neurovascular coupling. First, the discrepancy between whole-brain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes especially in early disease stages might be related to methodological differences in the way the ASL-MRI and FDG-PET data were preprocessed and analyzed. CBF and CMRgl data are strongly affected by the underlying atrophy pattern. A reduction in gray matter volume in a specific region would lead to a reduction of the observed metabolic signal due to increased partial volume contamination from other tissue types [36] . If not accounted for, this effect strongly restricts the interpretation of the observed functional signal due to a high susceptibility to the underlying atrophy. Yet partial volume correction of FDG-PET is not commonly practiced in the clinical setting. Therefore, we chose to assess noncorrected CBF and CMRgl quantitative maps for their independent contribution to identify A\u03b2+ subjects in the AD continuum. However, the results from two modalities might be affected differently by the failure to account for partial volume effects coupled with differences in signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. Furthermore, it is critically important to choose a reference region that robustly removes the unwanted variance in both CBF and CMRgl measures but not the effects of the disease. The reference regions used in FDG-PET studies, such as pons and cerebellar vermis, are not used in ASL-MRI studies due to ASL-MRI's limited field of view and low signal-to-noise ratio in inferior aspects of the brain (i.e. arterial blood water is magnetically tagged below the brain). A common reference region selection scheme is necessary to enable a valid comparison of these imaging modalities. The second potential explanation for the discrepancy between whole-brain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes could be due to compromised normal vascular coupling in the AD continuum. The assumption that ASL-MRI results should mirror FDG-PET results relies on the existence of a tight coupling between regional changes in brain CMRgl and regional CBF [37, 38] . Animal models suggest that low levels of A\u03b2 disrupt basal CBF and neurovascular coupling before affecting neuronal activity as assessed by rates of glucose utilization [39] . Furthermore, neuroimaging studies in AD patients suggest that neurovascular uncoupling occurs before neurodegenerative changes [40, 41] . Therefore, agreement between the whole-brain patterns of CBF and CMRgl changes and the discriminative power of each modality would rely on the existence of a tight coupling between regional changes in brain CMRgl and regional CBF at each disease stage. In conclusion, our results comparing measurements of CBF to CMRgl add to previous reports that MRI-measured CBF has a similar diagnostic ability for detecting AD as does FDG-PET. Our findings that CBF and CMRgl changes occur in different brain regions in A\u03b2+ subjects across the AD continuum compared with A\u03b2-CN subjects may be the result of methodological differences. Alternatively, these findings may signal alterations in neurovascular coupling which alter relationships between brain perfusion and glucose metabolism in the AD continuum, suggesting that it is important to consider the potential effects of altered neurovascular coupling due to AD pathology or other age-related conditions in the interpretation of CBF and CMRgl functional findings. The interpretation of our findings is however limited to the AD continuum with proven A\u03b2 pathology. Implications of our findings for the real clinical AD continuum require further assessment as, especially at MCI stages, clinical populations could show heterogeneity in the underlying pathophysiology, and therefore heterogeneity in how neurovascular coupling is being affected.\nBiomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations, as a USD 60-million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, University of California -San Francisco. The ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the USA and Canada. The initial goal of the ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but the ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1,500 adults, aged 55-90 years, to participate in the research, consisting of CN older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.
