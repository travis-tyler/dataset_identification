This report highlights some of these features of the ECLS-B by providing basic demographic information on the children, information on some of their specific mental and physical skills, a brief profile of their experiences in child care, and, since the ECLS-B is one of the first national studies to collect information specifically from fathers, some descriptive information on the percentage of children with fathers in their lives.\nThe data analyzed in this report are now available to researchers for their own use in Electronic Codebook (ECB) format on CD-ROM (NCES 2004-093).\nWe hope that the information provided in this report will be useful to a wide range of interested readers, including both researchers and policymakers.

Together, these cohorts provide the depth and breadth of data required to describe children's health, early learning, development, and education experiences.The kindergarten cohort study (ECLS-K) measures aspects of children's development and their environments (home and school) as they enter school for the first time and examines how these aspects relate to their academic achievement and experiences through the fifth grade. 1 The birth cohort study (ECLS-B) focuses on those characteristics of children and their families, as well as children's early health care and in-home and out-of-home experiences, that relate to children's first experiences with the demands of formal school (i.e., kindergarten and first grade). It provides important information about the way America raises, nurtures, and prepares its children for school.\nThis study was designed to inform an array of issues and research questions pertaining to children's early education, development, and care. Issues that can be addressed over the life of the study include: \u25a0 What are children's skills and abilities at different ages during the first six years of life? What are most children in the United States able to do in the domains of physical, cognitive, socioemotional, and language development at key points during these first years of life? Do the knowledge, skills, and behaviors children demonstrate differ by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family structure, and other child and family characteristics? \u25a0 How do children's early health care and health status, including characteristics of children at birth (e.g., low birth weight, multiple birth, and premature birth), relate to their preparedness for formal school? Which groups of children seem to have more developmental difficulties and to what extent are involvement in early intervention, early childhood education programs, and health promotion and prevention programs associated with positive growth and development for the most vulnerable children? \u25a0 When do children first receive regular care from someone other than their parents? What are the characteristics of this care? How do parents make choices in determining both the timing of this care and the nature of the child care arrangements? At what point do parents decide to place their preschool-age child in an early childhood program? What are the characteristics of the programs that children attend? What factors do parents consider in making this decision and in evaluating alternative programs?\n\u25a0 What role do fathers play in early child care and child-rearing and how does their involvement with their children and the family relate to children's school readiness? What role do resident and nonresident fathers play?

However, information was collected from a few children as young as 6 months and as old as 22 months. Young children's mental and physical skills develop rapidly. Therefore, this E.D. TAB presents information on young children's skills by their age at assessment, in several ways. First, this E.D. TAB presents information on the children in the sample 8 to 10 months of age at the time of assessment. Next, the E.D. TAB presents information on the children in the sample who were 11 to 13 months of age at the time of assessment. Tables 4 and 5 present a breakdown by age (i.e., age at assessment, month by month). 8 This E.D. TAB does not present information on children's mental and physical skills by characteristics such as children's sex, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. Preliminary analyses revealed that, for the most part at this age the mental and physical skills discussed in this report do not significantly differ by children's sex, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. A future NCES report will examine group differences in children's mental and physical skills in more detail, presenting information from the 9-month collection and the 2-year collection of the ECLS-B. Percentage of children demonstrating specific cognitive abilities \nWhen children were about 9 months of age, approximately one-half (50 percent) were in some kind of regular child care arrangement, such as a center-based care arrangement or care provided by a nonrelative or relative in a private home (figure 6, table 6).\nBlack children (63 percent) were more likely to be in some kind of child care arrangement, compared to White (49 percent), Hispanic (46 percent), and Asian children (47 percent). Children whose mothers work (full time or part time) are more likely to be in child care than children whose mothers do not work or who are looking for work. Children in families who were not poor (at or above the poverty threshold) (52 percent) were more likely to be in child care than children from poor families (43 percent) (table 6).\n\u25a0 Among children about 9 months of age (figure 6, table 6) -26 percent were in relative care as their primary arrangement, 10 where they received care from someone related to them other than the parent, such as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, sibling, or some other relative. Relative care could be in the child's home or in the home of the caregiver.\n-15 percent were in nonrelative care as their primary arrangement, care provided by someone who is not related to them, such as a nanny, home-based care provider, regular sitter, or neighbor. This does not include day care centers or preschools. The care could be in the child's home or in the home of the caregiver.\n-9 percent were in center-based care as their primary arrangement, such as early learning centers, nursery schools, and preschools (including Early Head Start).\n-1 percent had a primary arrangement that was actually multiple arrangements, where they spent equal numbers of hours across different care arrangement types (such as 20 hours a week with a relative and 20 hours a week in a center-based program).\n9 Parents include biological and adoptive parents as well as stepparents and guardians.\n10 Primary care arrangement is where the child spends the most hours. If the child spent equal time across two or more arrangements, primary care was classified as multiple arrangements.\nThe type of child care children receive varied by their race/ethnicity. Black children were more likely than White, Hispanic, or Asian children to be in center-based care. White children were less likely than Black, Hispanic, or Asian children to be cared for by a relative (table 6) .\nOf children in child care, 39 percent began when they were younger than 3 months, 47 percent were three to six months old, and 14 percent started care when they were older than 6 months (figure 7, table 7). In terms of hours per week in child care, 19 percent of children about 9 months of age were in an arrangement 10 hours or fewer, 27 percent were in an arrangement 11 to 30 hours, 31 percent were in an arrangement 31 to 40 hours, and 24 percent were in an arrangement more than 40 hours (table 7) .\nThe age at which children entered child care and the number of hours they spent in the arrangement varied by their race/ethnicity. Asian children were more likely than White, Black, or Hispanic children to enter a child care arrangement when they were younger than 3 months of age. Asian children were more likely than White, Black, or Hispanic children to spend more than 40 hours a week in care, and Black children were more likely than White or Hispanic children to spend more than 40 hours a week in care.\nChildren in relative care were more likely to be in care for 10 hours or fewer a week than children in nonrelative care or a center-based program. Children in multiple care arrangements were more likely to be in care more than 40 hours a week than children in a single care arrangement. Age first began care Total hours in child care arrangement(s) 11 In the ECLS-B, this was by design. When the home visit was conducted, the interviewer specifically asked for the biological mother to be the respondent. Data not shown in table.\nWhen children were about 9 months of age, 1 in 5 (20 percent) lived in households with no father (table 8) .\n\u25a0 Black children (58 percent) were more likely than White children (10 percent), Hispanic children (20 percent), or Asian children (6 percent) to live in a household with no father present (figure 8, table 8). Forty-five percent of children living below the poverty threshold lived in households with no father present, while 12 percent of children living at or above the poverty threshold lived in households without a father.\nIn the ECLS-B, in about 99 percent of the interviews, the biological mother was the respondent.\nOf children with no resident father, 6 percent of Black children had nonresident fathers who had never had contact with them, compared to 18 percent of White children, 21 percent of Hispanic children, and 25 percent of Asian children (figure 9, \nFather Questionnaires. Although the information in this E.D. TAB comes largely from the child assessment and the parent interview, the ECLS-B also collected data from fathers directly through two separate father questionnaires: the resident father questionnaire and the nonresident father questionnaire. Both father questionnaires were self-administered with telephone follow up. The father questionnaires were available in English and Spanish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily type [derived from: X1MARSTA; P1PARTNR; P1NFTHHH] In order to construct this family type variable, information from X1MARSTA (marital status of parent-married, separated, divorced, widowed), P1PARTNR (spouse or partner living in the household), and P1NFTHHH (confirmation of biological father not living in household) was used. Married, two biological parents includes biological mothers and biological fathers who are married. Married, two parents includes biological mother and other father, biological father and other mother, two adoptive parents, or two same sex parents. Cohabiting, two biological parents includes unmarried biological mother and father. Cohabiting, two parents includes unmarried biological mother and other father, biological father and other mother, or two same sex parents. Single parent live alone includes a single biological mother, a single biological father or a single adoptive parent. Other (guardian) includes related guardians or unrelated guardians, and/or foster parents.\n\nFather's education [X1FTHED] This composite presents the highest level of education the father completed. Information on father education was collected directly from fathers. If the father was the respondent to the parent interview, the information from the parent interview was used. If the father was not the respondent to the parent interview, information from the father questionnaires was used. If the father was not the respondent to the parent interview and father education was missing on the father questionnaires, information on father education provided by the respondent to the parent interview was used.This variable includes only birth, adoptive, step-, or foster fathers residing in the household. For example, if the child did not have birth, adoptive, step-, or foster parents but was living with another relative (such as an aunt) who served as the parent respondent, the education of the relative and his or her spouse was not used in the creation of the composites. At 9 months of age, less than one percent of the children did not have at least one parent in the household.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mental scale includes items designed to assess early cognitive and language ability. These included memory, means-end behavior (e.g., ringing a bell to hear a sound), problem solving, concept attainment, exploration of objects, and preverbal communication (both vocalizations and gestures). Children were presented with tasks such as putting blocks in a cup, ringing a bell, and responding to a parent's request (e.g., peek-a-boo). The main factor assessed by the mental scale is general mental ability. The reliability of the estimate of the 9-month BSF-R mental scale (IRT-based theta) was .79.\nThe motor scale includes items designed to assess gross and fine motor skills (e.g., picking up objects, crawling, walking), perceptual-motor integration, and problem solving. Children participated in tasks such as picking up small objects, grasping a pencil, rolling over from being on their backs, sitting and standing unsupported, and walking with help. The reliability of the estimate of the 9-month BSF-R motor scale (IRT-based theta) was .92.\nSpecific Mental and Motor Skills-Proficiency Level Probability Scores. Proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing status in specific skills within a content area from the developmental status measured by the IRT scale scores. Clusters of two to five test items having similar content and difficulty were included at several points along the score scale of the BSF-R mental and motor assessments. Clusters of items provide a more reliable test of proficiency than do single items because of the possibility of children getting the item correct by chance. The nature of the BSF-R (with basal and ceiling supplements) is that not all children receive all items. To calculate proficiency estimates for all children, an IRT model was employed. For the purpose of IRT calibration, the item clusters were treated as single items. The hierarchical nature of the skill sets justified the use of the IRT model in this way."}, {"section_title": "Percentage of children demonstrating specific motor abilities", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Children's First Experiences in Child Care", "text": "As part of the parent interview, information was collected on children's first experiences in child care.

The ECLS-B is designed to provide detailed information on children's development, health, and in-and out-of-home experiences in the years leading up to school. The children participating in the ECLS-B are being followed longitudinally for 6 years (through first grade). Estimates in this report are based on data collected from and about children during the first wave of data collection when they were approximately 9 months old. Westat, Incorporated conducted the first wave of the study.\nA nationally representative sample of 10,688 children born in the United States in 2001 and/or their parents participated in the ECLS-B. The sample includes children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and includes oversamples of Chinese and other Asian and Pacific Islander children, American Indian children, twins, and children with moderately low and very low birth weight.\nThe sample of infants was selected using a clustered, list frame sampling design. The list frame was registered births in the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) vital statistics system (from lists provided by state registrars). Births were sampled from 96 core primary sampling units (PSU) representing all infants born in the United States in the year 2001. The PSUs were counties and county groups. To support the American Indian oversample, 18 additional PSUs were selected from a supplemental frame consisting of areas where the population has a higher proportion of American Indian births (for more information see section 4.1.3 in the ECLS-B 9-month Data File User's Manual 12 ). Sampling was based on occurrence of the birth as listed on the birth certificate. Sampled children subsequently identified by the state registrars as having died or who had been adopted after the issuance of the birth certificate were excluded from the sample.\n13 Also, infants whose birth mothers were younger than 15 years at the time of the child's birth were excluded.\nThe 9-month data were obtained from October 2001 through December 2002, during a visit in the child's home. This E.D. TAB presents information from the child assessments, parent interviews, and father questionnaires. Each of these are described below. \u25a0 Child Assessments. Children participated in a variety of activities, with the parent's permission, to assess their early cognitive (e.g., mental status), physical, and socioemotional development. This report uses information from the mental and motor assessment. Children's mental and physical skills were measured through an untimed one-on-one assessment of the child in his/her home. A trained staff member assessed each child. Information was gathered using hard copy materials. Information about the child was recorded in a Child Activities Booklet that also contained administration and scoring instructions. The assessment-the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R)-measured children's mental and physical skills. For families whose primary language was not English, the assessment was still administered. A Spanish version of the Child Activities Booklet was developed. If the family spoke a language other than English or Spanish, interviewers used an interpreter. \u25a0 Parent Interviews. Parents/guardians were asked to provide key information about their children and themselves on such topics as family demographics (e.g., age, relation to child, race/ethnicity), family structure (household members and composition), parent attitudes, home educational activities, child care experience, child development and health, and parental education and employment status. In 99 percent of the cases, the biological mother was the parent respondent completing the interview. The parent interview included two instruments: the parent interview instrument and the parent self-administered questionnaire (PSAQ). The first was conducted in person by trained field interviewers using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) as part of the home visit. The PSAQ was a paper-andpencil instrument, presented during the parent CAPI instrument for the respondent to complete and return in a provided envelope, and contained 23 questions on topics some people might prefer to answer privately. The parent interviews were conducted primarily in English, but provisions were made to interview parents who spoke other languages. Bilingual interviewers were trained to conduct the parent interview in either English or Spanish. A Spanish CAPI instrument was used when needed as the parent CAPI instrument was programmed in both English and Spanish. An interpreter, either a community or household member, was used for families who spoke languages other than English or Spanish. Fewer than 0.1 percent of the cases were not completed due to language difficulties."}, {"section_title": "For more information on any of the components of the ECLS-B, please refer to the ECLS-B 9-month Data File", "text": "User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of the nearly 4 million children born in the United States in the year 2001. The response rate for the 9-month data collection was 74.1 percent, based on weighted data (i.e., using the base weights). The response rate is the number of completed parent interviews divided by the total eligible sample. To be considered complete, the first three sections of the parent interview had to be completed."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "With the exception of key variables the ECLS-B does not impute. The item response rate for all variables used in this report exceeded 90 percent.\nEstimates produced using data from the ECLS-B are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population.\nNonsampling Errors. Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations, as well as data collection, processing, and reporting procedures.\nThe sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems like unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of the questions, response differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted, and mistakes in data preparation.\nIn general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. In the ECLS-B, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible. The design phase entailed a pilot test of the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R) and a field test that evaluated the implementation of the study. In the main study administration of the BSF-R, there was rigorous training, certification, and monitoring of the assessors administering the instrument.\nAnother potential source of nonsampling error is respondent bias that occurs when respondents systematically misreport (intentionally or unintentionally) information in a study. One potential source of respondent bias in this survey is social desirability bias. If there are no systematic differences among specific groups under study in their tendency to give socially desirable responses, then comparisons of the different groups will accurately reflect differences among the groups. An associated error occurs when respondents give unduly positive assessments about those close to them. For example, parents may give higher assessments of their children's motor accomplishments (like feeding themselves) than might be obtained from direct assessment.\nReaders should be aware that respondent bias may be present in this survey as in any survey. It is not possible to state precisely how such bias may affect the results. NCES has tried to minimize some of these biases by conducting one-on-one, untimed assessments, and by asking some of the same questions about the sampled child of both the mother and father (e.g., activities the father engages in with the child). The analysis benefited from the unusually rich information available on the frame. The birth record contains a number of important variables on the mother and the child that support many comparisons between respondents and nonrespondents. Findings from these analyses suggest that there is not a bias due to nonresponse.\nSampling Errors and Weighting. The sample of children born in the United States during 2001 was just one of many possible samples of 2001 births that could have been selected. Therefore, estimates produced from the ECLS-B sample may differ from estimates that would have been produced from other samples. This type of variability is called sampling error because it arises from using a sample of children, rather than all children born in 2001.\nThe standard error is a measure of variability due to sampling when estimating a statistic. Standard errors for estimates presented in this report were computed using a jackknife replication method. Standard errors can be used as a measure for the precision expected from a particular sample. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent.\nIn order to produce national estimates from the ECLS-B data collected during the 9-month data collection, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the child level and the weights are adjusted for unit nonresponse. The parent weight (W1R0), which is the weight used to produce all estimates found in this report, is the weight that accounts for the probability of selection in the sample as well as nonresponse to the parent interview. Only those cases with completed parent interviews in the 9-month data collection are included in this weight. A parent interview is considered complete if the first three sections were finished (IN, FS, CD) . The parent weight sums to the population of all parents of children born in the United States in 2001. The approach used to develop weights for the ECLS-B is described in Chapter 4 of the ECLS-B 9-month Data File User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-B, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables.\nReplication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLS-B. A form of the jackknife replication method (JK2) using 84 replicate weights was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report, using WesVar version 4.0. Jackknife methods were used to estimate the precision of the estimates of the reported national percentages and means. The standard errors of the estimates are presented in appendix B of this E.D.
