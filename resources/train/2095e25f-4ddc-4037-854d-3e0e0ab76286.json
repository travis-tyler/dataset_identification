[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Motivation: Network-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify functional modules from biological networks that are enriched by top GWAS findings. Although gene functions are relevant to tissue context, most existing methods analyze tissue-free networks without reflecting phenotypic specificity. Results: We propose a novel module identification framework for imaging genetic studies using the tissue-specific functional interaction network. Our method includes three steps: (i) re-prioritize imaging GWAS findings by applying machine learning methods to incorporate network topological information and enhance the connectivity among top genes; (ii) detect densely connected modules based on interactions among top re-prioritized genes; and (iii) identify phenotype-relevant modules enriched by top GWAS findings. We demonstrate our method on the GWAS of [\n18 F]FDG-PET measures in the amygdala region using the imaging genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and map the GWAS results onto the amygdala-specific functional interaction network. The proposed network-based GWAS method can effectively detect densely connected modules enriched by top GWAS findings. Tissue-specific functional network can provide precise context to help explore the collective effects of genes with biologically meaningful interactions specific to the studied phenotype."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify genetic markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with common diseases. In brain imaging genetics, an emerging field that studies how genetic variation influences brain structure and function, GWAS also have discovered genes susceptible to brain imaging quantitative traits (QTs) (Lambert et al., 2013; Saykin et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014) . Each identified imaging QT locus (iQTL), however, often has a small effect size and is hard to be individually interpreted. These iQTLs can potentially interact with one another to jointly have an impact on QTs. To address this challenge, integrative analysis of GWAS data with prior-knowledge has gained recent attention to test collective effects of multiple genes on targeted phenotypes. Using biological networks and pathways as prior knowledge, construction and identification of functionally interacted network modules have been performed to discover phenotype-relevant network modules enriched by the GWAS findings. This promising strategy can potentially enhance the statistical power of the GWAS and help biological interpretation (Akula et al., 2011; Hirschhorn, 2009; Ideker and Krogan, 2012; Jia et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015) .\nExisting module identification studies typically search for disease-or QT-relevant modules by mapping GWAS statistics onto a functional interaction network. After that, candidate modules are formed across the entire network and evaluated on whether they are enriched by the GWAS findings. A successful example is dense module GWAS (dmGWAS) (Jia et al., 2011) , which first loads gene-level p-values onto human protein-protein interaction network as node weights, then applies dense module searching strategy to identify modules that locally maximize the proportion of genes with small enough P-values. Network interface miner for multigenic interactions (NIMMI) is another network-based GWAS approach (Akula et al., 2011) , where phenotype-relevant modules are constructed from high-scored genes and their scores are computed by combining GWAS P-values with node weights calculated based on their network connectivity. The integrative protein-interaction-networkbased pathway analysis (iPINBPA) method is also a network-based GWAS approach (Wang et al., 2015) and is an extension of the original PINBPA (Baranzini et al., 2009) . It starts from a seed and expands the module by adding one neighbor at a time to reach an aggregate score meeting a given statistical significance. Note that all these approaches employ a bottom-up strategy that examines a large number of candidate modules in order to identify enriched ones, and their efficiencies could become suboptimal when large-scale networks are present.\nAlmost all the network-based GWAS are using tissue-free interaction networks such as the human PPI network without taking tissue specificity into consideration. The precise functions of genes are highly related to their tissue context, and human diseases often result from the disordered interplay of tissue-specific processes (Greene et al., 2015) . Recently, tissue-specific genome-wide functional interaction networks have been constructed in order to identify the changing functional roles of genes across tissues (Greene et al., 2015) . One application of tissue specific networks is to reprioritize disease-gene associations by constructing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to re-rank GWAS results based on tissuespecific network information. This strategy is named as NetWAS, and has been applied to analyze hippocampus volume in Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that tissue-specific networks could provide helpful context for understanding complex human diseases (Song et al., 2016) . Note that SVM classification requires a pre-defined threshold to partition GWAS P-values into significant and nonsignificant groups, and important information embedded in the continuous spectrum of these P-values get lost during the procedure.\nWith the above observations, we expand the NetWAS work into a new framework to achieve two goals at one time: (i) introduce regression models in addition to classification models for reprioritizing GWAS results with network information; (ii) use the reprioritized results to identify GWAS-enriched network modules. In short, we propose an innovative phenotype-relevant module identification method by integrating GWAS data and tissue-specific network with effective machine learning models. First, in addition to traditional NetWAS using SVM, we re-prioritize GWAS results by constructing two regression models (support vector regression and ridge regression) using tissue-specific functional interaction network as features and continuous GWAS P-values as responses. We then extract densely connected modules from top NetWAS findings based on their functional interactions. Finally, GWAS findings are used to test the enrichment significance on these candidate modules to identify phenotype-relevant ones.\nCompared with traditional GWAS-based module identification methods and SVM-based NetWAS, the novelty of the proposed new framework is threefold: (i) Our framework expands the NetWAS scope from re-prioritizing GWAS findings to module identification.\n(ii) Our framework introduces regression models into NetWAS to embrace the complete coverage of the continuous P-value spectrum. (iii) Our framework offers a more efficient, top-down strategy to identify phenotype-relevant network modules, given that the top findings from NetWAS are designed to be both GWAS-enriched and densely connected.\nTo show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare support vector regression (SVR) and ridge regression (Ridge) with SVM to illustrate that continuous GWAS P-values supply more valuable information than binary significant/non-significant labels. We also compare the NetWAS re-prioritized results with original GWAS findings to show that the former is more densely connected than the latter. Identified modules are further tested for functional association by KEGG pathway, Gene Ontology Biological Process and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) disease databases, to demonstrate that tissue-specific networks may provide helpful context for understanding the mechanisms behind complex diseases."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "To demonstrate the proposed NetWAS-based method for identifying phenotype-relevant functional interaction modules, we apply it to the amygdala imaging genetic analysis in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amygdala is located in the medial temporal lobe region of the brain and has been implicated in emotional processes, survival instincts and aspects of memory, especially for emotional components. Analyses on amygdala have indicated that it is prominently related to AD and its progression (Fjell et al., 2010; Palmer et al., 2007; Poulin et al., 2011) and has been used to assist the clinical diagnosis of AD (Tang et al., 2014) . Studies on fluorodeoxyglucose [\n18 F]FDG-PET have demonstrated different usage patterns of glucose metabolism in amygdala between AD and healthy control subjects (Johnson et al., 2012) . Genotype data of both ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2 phases were also obtained from LONI, and quality controlled, imputed and combined as described in (Kim et al., 2013) . 989 nonHispanic Caucasian participants (Table 1) with complete baseline FDG amygdala measurements were studied. Associations between amygdala measures and SNPs (allelic dosage) were examined by performing GWAS using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) , where a linear regression model with sex, age and education as covariates was employed. To facilitate the subsequent network-based analysis, a gene-level P-value was determined as the 2nd smallest P-value of all SNPs located in 620K bp of the gene (Nam et al., 2010) . In addition, 10 GWAS permutations were performed to illustrate that only the original GWAS data yielded promising findings."}, {"section_title": "Imaging data, genotyping data and GWAS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Amygdala-specific functional interaction network", "text": "Genome-wide functional interaction networks for specific human tissues and cell types had been generated to specialize protein functions and interactions of specific human tissues by integrating a collection of datasets covering thousands of experiments contained in more than 14 000 distinct publications (Greene et al., 2015) .

Briefly, the functional network connectivity matrix was used as feature data and significant/non-significant status based on the nominal P < 0.01 was used as class label.\nIn addition to SVM, we trained two separate regression models, support vector regression (SVR) and ridge regression (Ridge). In both models, we used the functional network connectivity matrix as feature data and continuous GWAS P-values as responses. SVR, different from SVM, does not require a pre-defined threshold to convert P-values to a binary variable indicating significant/nonsignificant status. SVR is designed to find a hyperplane that has a deviation of at most e from the actual data. Ridge is a widely used linear regression approach using the L 2 -norm based regularization to stabilize the result.\nTo train SVM, SVR and Ridge models, we first selected a set of genes with P-value < 0.01, denoted as A, then randomly partitioned the remaining genes (i.e. P-value ! 0:01) into five equal groups B To demonstrate the effectiveness of the patterns discovered from the real data, we also trained these models on permuted GWAS results using the same strategy. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to compare the reprioritization performance obtained from the original GWAS data with those from permuted GWAS data. Similar to (Song et al., 2016) , ROC curves and AUCs were calculated using 66 documented AD candidates as gold standard positives (See Supplementary Materials for more details). In addition, mean statistics of functional interaction measures among top genes were used to estimate the functional relevance of these genes."}, {"section_title": "Identification of GWAS-enriched modules", "text": "The goal of the NetWAS re-prioritization is twofold: (i) The original GWAS gene ranking is used to supervise the training of the classification and regression models and ensure that the top genes in the reprioritization remain GWAS-enriched; (ii) tissue-specific functional interaction connectivity matrix is used as data to train the models and encourage genes with similar interactions to be re-prioritized with similar ranks. Thus NetWAS is designed to yield top gene findings that are both GWAS-enriched and densely connected; and these top genes become the candidates for us to identify GWAS-enriched network modules. We performed clustering on these top genes to first identify candidate modules. Since one gene could play roles in multiple pathways or functional modules, we applied the Link Clustering algorithm (Ahn et al., 2010) to detect communities as groups of links rather than nodes. The resulting candidate modules consisted of only top NetWAS genes and could overlap each other. After that, top GWAS findings were used to test each candidate module. Only those modules significantly enriched by the GWAS results were identified as phenotype-relevant ones. See Supplementary Materials for details.\nAs mentioned earlier, many existing network-based GWAS approaches employ a bottom-up strategy that examines a large number of candidate modules in order to identify enriched ones, and their efficiencies could become suboptimal when large-scale networks are present. Our module identification approach proposed above overcomes this limitation. On one hand, it examines only a small number of candidate modules generated from clustering the top NetWAS findings. On the other hand, the NetWAS strategy is designed to yield promising candidate modules with strong potential to be densely connected and phenotype-relevant."}, {"section_title": "Functional evaluation and visualization", "text": "To determine the functional relevance of the identified modules, we tested whether genes from each module were overrepresented for specific neurobiological functions, signaling pathways or complex neurodegenerative diseases.

Using P 5E-8 as the threshold, nine SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with the average FDG-PET measure in the left amygdala (see Supplementary Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Materials for the Manhattan plot), including two within the APOE gene (rs429358 with P \u00bc 1.99E-11, rs769449 with P \u00bc 3.28E-09), one within the SDK1 gene (rs148359108 with P \u00bc 2.02E-09), one between the APOE and APOC1 gene (rs10414043 with P \u00bc 8.56E-09), and five within the APOC1 gene (rs7256200 with P \u00bc 8.56E-09, rs12721051 with P \u00bc 1.11E-08, rs56131196 with P \u00bc 1.11E-08, rs4420638 with P \u00bc 1.11E-08 and rs73052335 with P \u00bc 3.50E-08). No significant findings were identified on the right side.\nAfter mapping the 2nd smallest SNP-level P-values to genes (Nam et al., 2010) using hg19 gene annotation, gene-based P-values were obtained for 24 766 genes and transcripts. Using P (0.05/ 24 766)\u00bc2.02E-6 as the threshold, the APOC1, APOE, PVRL2, TOMM40 and APOC1P1 genes were identified to be significantly associated with the average FDG-PET measure in the left amygdala. Note that PVRL2 and APOC1P1 were identified since some of significant SNPs were within 620K bp of their boundaries. In addition, we compared the 2nd smallest strategy with three other gene-based association approaches (see Supplementary Materials).\nAll the findings except SDK1 are either from or proximal to the APOE region, which is the best known genetic risk region in AD.

SDK1 was shown to specifically phosphorylate 14-3-3f at serine 58 (Hamaguchi et al., 2003) , where the latter played an important role in amygdala cell death (Jeong et al., 2010) . SDK1 also showed high expression in medial amygdala relative to other tissues from the Allen Brain Atlas Adult Mouse Brain Tissue Gene Expression Profiles dataset (http://www.brain-map.org/). The connection between SDK1 and AD-related amyloid and glucose metabolism markers in the amygdala region warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "NetWAS re-prioritization", "text": "Amygdala-specific functional interaction network among 25 825 nodes was downloaded from GIANT, with interaction weights ranging from 0 to 1. There were totally 20 168 nodes used in our analysis after matching GWAS genes and transcripts with those from the network. After preprocessing, we obtained an amygdala-specific genome-wide functional interaction matrix with size of 20 168 \u00c2 20 168 and two lists of 20 168 gene-level P-values for left and right amygdala QTs respectively. In addition, GWAS were performed 10 times on permuted data for each of the bilateral amygdala measures. The same procedure was applied to the permuted data as the real data, in order to demonstrate that only the GWAS findings from the real data yielded promising results.\nFive sets of regression predictions by SVR and Ridge or classification decision values by SVM (i.e. distances from the separating hyperplane) were obtained from running these machine learning models using functional interaction connectivity matrix as the feature data and the GWAS results as regression responses or classification labels. For each model, genes were re-prioritized based on their average regression predictions or classification decision values across five experiments, on both original and permuted GWAS results.\nAs we hypothesized, top predictions would conserve both strong functional interaction and high phenotype-relevance (i.e. ADrelevance in this work, given amygdala FDG measures as promising AD biomarkers). We compared the re-prioritization performances of three machine learning models and GWAS using both original and permuted data. Figure 2 (A, B) shows the ROC curves and the AUC performances. For the original data, the re-prioritization results of all three NetWAS models demonstrated much higher concordance with documented AD risk genes than the GWAS findings. This indicates that integration of tissue-specific functional interaction network with GWAS can promote the identification of phenotype-relevant genes. For the permuted data, where the mean and standard deviation of AUCs together with one example ROC are shown for each model, no high concordance with AD genes was achieved by either GWAS or any NetWAS model. This suggests that the NetWAS procedure is not biased and only original data can yield meaningful findings. In addition, original GWAS and permuted GWAS obtained similar AUCs, showing the limited power of GWAS alone on the detection of disease risk markers. Ridge, although showing similar AUC with SVR and SVM, gained higher true positive rate and lower false positive rate at the beginning of the ROC. That is, Ridge gained higher concordance when taking look at top re-prioritized results. Figure 2 (C, D) shows the mean functional interaction of the top findings. We used a series of thresholds from top 50 to top 3000 (of note, $3000 genes with P-value < 0.01 were identified for either left or right amygdala) to extract different scales of top genes as well as their interaction matrix. NetWAS approaches, no matter whether using original or permuted data, clearly demonstrated denser interactions among top findings than GWAS. This confirms our hypothesis that NetWAS yields more densely connected top findings."}, {"section_title": "Amygdala-relevant top predictions", "text": "We investigated top 50 re-prioritized genes obtained from three machine learning models, and compared their functional interactions in detail.

Taking left amygdala as example, each row shows results from different methods: Ridge, SVR, SVM and GWAS. Heatmaps show interaction matrices using the data from amygdala functional network without any filtering. Two interaction networks among top 50 genes after filtering out weak interactions using different scales (here using weights ! 0.1 and 0.2 as thresholds) are shown. In interaction networks, nodes are colored by their ranks in the original GWAS.\nBoth heatmaps and networks show much denser interactions among top 50 findings from three models than original GWAS under any scale of filtering. That facilitates the promise of our proposed method for comprehensively examining the disease-relevant genes and interactions between them. Ridge, compared with SVR and SVM, yielded much higher interactions (network density across multiple scales) and also obtained more GWAS top genes (more nodes are colored by top GWAS findings). This, combined with statistics summary from Figure 2 , indicates the outstanding performance of Ridge."}, {"section_title": "Amygdala-relevant modules", "text": "The results shown above demonstrate the phenotype-relevance and dense functional interactions of the top findings obtained from integrating amygdala-specific interaction network and amygdala FDG GWAS result.

We analyzed top 50 findings from Ridge-based NetWAS given its prominent performance. In candidate module identification, only interactions with weights ! 0.1 were considered while weak connections were removed. We identified five modules: four from left amygdala, and one from right amygdala. All five modules were significantly enriched by top 50 GWAS findings. Supplementary Table S1 (see Supplementary Materials) shows details of these modules.\nIn this work, we applied our method on only top 50 predictions and used a relatively stringent selection of GWAS significant findings (top 50) to test phenotype-relevance of the candidate modules.

We performed pathway enrichment analysis from three aspects: (i) functional pathways, (ii) GO terms and (iii) diseases, based on KEGG pathway, GO-BP and OMIM disease databases respectively.\nSupplementary Figure S2 (see Supplementary Materials) shows the KEGG pathway enrichment results mapped to 19 categories. From the results, two modules from left amygdala and one module from right amygdala have a number of significant functional enrichments, while the other two modules of left amygdala do not have obvious KEGG functional enrichment. Several enriched pathways are directly related to the neurodegenerative disease and its development, e.g. Alzheimer's disease enriched in Modules 03 and 04 and Huntington's disease enriched in Module 04. A number of pathways from three large categories are enriched by one or more modules, and these categories are endocrine system, nervous system and signal transduction. These major categories have been studied and shown close relation to AD. For example, the endocrine and the nervous system were highly related as hormones played a role in maintaining brain homeostasis at the senile age which might help explain the gender difference in AD (Blair et al., 2015; Mielke et al., 2014; Peri and Serio, 2008) . Signal transduction like calcium signaling pathway (Modules 04 and 05) playing key role in short-and long-term synaptic plasticity, had shown abnormality in many neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease and so on (Bezprozvanny, 2009) . Neuroinflammation emerged as an important component of AD pathology recently, and immune system indicated a crucial role in the progression of AD (Heneka et al., 2015) . Platelet activation, enriched in Modules 04 and 05, had been studied about its involvement in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD through enzymatic activities to generate amyloid-b peptides (Gowert et al., 2014) .\nSupplementary Figure S3 (see Supplementary Materials) shows top GO-BP enriched terms for all five modules. As Modules 03-05 had significantly enriched a large number of GO-BP terms, only top 20 of each module were selected. Here only GO-BP terms that are significantly enriched (corrected P-value <0.05) by >1 module are listed and linked with corresponding modules. Here we observe that a large number of BP terms are related to neurological system process (e.g. cognition, learning), behavior (e.g. learning or memory), nervous system development (e.g. positive regulation of neuron projection development) and signal (e.g. regulation of synaptic transmissions). All of these have direct or indirect relationships with neurodegenerative diseases or phenotypes.\nOMIM disease enrichment analysis results are shown in Supplementary Table S2 (see Supplementary Materials), where three modules (Modules 01, 02 and 04) are significantly enriched by various types of diseases including heart disease (Myocardial infarction), cancer (Prostate cancer), mental disorders (Autism), eye disease (Macular degeneration) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease). A number of studies suggested that there exist connections between heart diseases and dementia including AD (Heneka et al., 2015; Licastro et al., 2011) .

At the global level, machine learning models were applied to re-prioritize genes which facilitates the detection of genes with both phenotype-relevance and dense interactions. After that, candidate modules were extracted using link community clustering algorithm. At the local level, each candidate module was tested for enrichment significance using GWAS findings. This study is among the first to incorporate tissuespecific context with GWAS data to understand underlying functional relevance in a precise way. Our strategy is different from previous network module identification methods that define and examine candidate modules by forming sub-networks based on individual genes (e.g. genes with promising P values or high scores). We start from the whole interaction network to re-rank genes so that the top findings are not only densely connected and but also enriched by highly scored genes. Machine learning methods can facilitate the re-prioritization using network data as features. This step makes use of both the functional network information and GWAS discoveries to ensure the phenotype-relevance and dense connection of the top re-prioritized genes. The second step is designed simply for assigning an enrichment score to each candidate module so that modules not enriched by GWAS findings can be filtered out. We treat the whole process as a single discovery step. In order to validate the findings, replication analysis in independent cohorts should be performed.\nAs to the NetWAS comparison among three machine learning based models on our data, Ridge performed better than SVR, and SVR generally outperformed SVM. This suggests that continuous GWAS P-values supply more valuable information than binary significant/non-significant labels. Re-prioritization results show the strength of the NetWAS framework from another perspective that top predictions hold denser interactions and are matched to more disease risk genes than GWAS findings. Our experimental results on permuted data also suggests that the NetWAS procedure is not biased and only original data can yield meaningful findings.\nGiven that we only have one tissue-specific network available for the studied phenotype, we are limited on validating the stability of the findings. In the future, if multiple tissue-specific interaction networks can be obtained independently for a studied tissue, stability study can be performed to check whether similar network modules can be identified from multiple networks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed a top-down module identification method by integrating tissue-specific functional network with imaging GWAS A B results.
