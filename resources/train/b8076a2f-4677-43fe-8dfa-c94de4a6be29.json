Introduction", "text": "This report summarizes statistics on access and attainment in higher education, focusing particularly on community college students, using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which follows a nationally representative sample of individuals who were eighth graders in the spring of 1988. A sample of these respondents was surveyed through four follow-ups in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 2000. The 2000 survey collected information on both education and job outcomes of respondents. The NELS:88 database includes transcripts of individuals in the sample who enrolled in any postsecondary education. NELS:88 is a survey of a sample cohort of students, most of whom graduated high school in spring 1992. This report provides a detailed statistical analysis of the cohort's enrollment in and completion of higher education over the eight-year period from 1992 through 2000, with emphasis on the access and attainment of low-income and minority students. The majority of these students entered higher education in the 1992-93 school year or shortly thereafter. Therefore, NELS:88 represents a sample of young postsecondary students, much like the imagined \"traditional\" undergraduate student. Note that this is different than a true representative sample by age of undergraduate students. In community colleges especially, many students are older individuals either returning for further education or beginning their postsecondary education at a later stage in life. 1 We expect this will also reduce the proportion of minority students, low-income students, and first-generation college students than would be representative among all undergraduate students. All these groups are found in larger proportions among older students. The report includes detailed charts showing rates of enrollment and completion of various outcomes (certificate, associate degree, bachelor's degree, and transfer to baccalaureate institutions) for students by race/ethnicity, income level, and parents' highest level of education, and by initial type of institution in which students enrolled. We highlight students who began in community colleges while comparing their enrollment and completion rates to students at other types institutions. The findings in this report should be compared to those in the companion report, What we know about community college low-income and minority student outcomes: descriptive statistics from national surveys, which provides enrollment and credential completion information for all undergraduate institutions for various years (from IPEDS) and for a representative sample of all first-time beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96 (from BPS:96/01). At the beginning of each lettered section of this report is a summary that highlights the important findings from all the tables and figures in that section. The tables and charts in the main body of the report are derived from the detailed data tables found in the Appendix. Throughout the report we use the term community colleges to refer to two-year public institutions. To measure a student's household background, we use the derived socioeconomic status (SES) variable from NELS:88. It is calculated using parents' income, occupations, and highest level of education. 2 Students who come from low-SES households are also referred to as low-income. The following is a key to institution type abbreviations used in this report: 4yr = four-year 2yr = two-year <2yr = less than two-year pub = public p-nfp = private not-for-profit p-fp = private for-profit"}, {"section_title": "B. Postsecondary Student Enrollment Patterns", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This section reports enrollment rates by institution type crossed with students' race/ethnicity, SES, and parents' highest level of education. Community college enrollment rates are also broken out by initial degree program type and initial major type crossed with race/ethnicity, SES, and parents' highest level of education. Finally, enrollment rates are shown for remediation crossed with race/ethnicity, SES, and parents' highest level of education at both community colleges and four-year public institutions. Of the NELS:88 cohort members who went on to postsecondary education by 1994, 40 percent enrolled first in a community college. This is slightly more than the 37 percent whose first enrollment was in a public four-year institution. All other four-year, two-year and less than twoyear institutions accounted for the initial enrollment of the remaining 23 percent of NELS:88 postsecondary students. While four-year public institutions and community colleges each enrolled about the same proportion of white and black first-time undergraduate students in NELS:88, the percentage of Hispanic students in community colleges was more than twice the percentage of those in fouryear public institutions. Specifically, four-year and two-year public institutions both enrolled 38 percent of white postsecondary students. For black undergraduates, the respective percentages were 37 and 38. Meanwhile, only 26 percent of all Hispanic undergraduates began in four-year public colleges, while fully 55 percent enrolled initially in community colleges. Therefore, the NELS:88 young cohort of Hispanic students overwhelmingly favored community colleges as their initial postsecondary institution. 3 More than half of all young first-time undergraduates in the lowest two SES quartiles enrolled in community colleges, by far the most popular type of institution among these student populations. And while community colleges enrolled a fairly even distribution of students from across all four SES quartiles, still 62 percent of all NELS:88 first-time enrollees in community colleges were from the middle two quartiles. The lowest two quartile students dominated at the less than twoyear institutions and the for-profit two-year institutions. Students in the top two quartiles represented over 70 percent of NELS:88 students who enrolled initially in four-year public and non-profit institutions. Community colleges were also the primary gateway to higher education for first-generation NELS:88 students; about half of all such students enrolled initially in community colleges. This represented slightly less than one-third of all first-time NELS:88 students enrolled in community colleges. However, first-generation students represented far higher proportions of the first-time student populations at less than two-year and two-year forprofit institutions -in some cases over 50 percent. Eighty-five percent of NELS:88 students who enrolled in associate degree programs were in community colleges. Ninety percent of all community college students were in associate programs; the remainder were primarily in certificate programs. Variations within community colleges by race/ethnicity and SES between degree programs for these students were insignificant. However, first-generation college students were more likely to enroll in a certificate program than students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or some college. About half of all NELS:88 community college students declared an occupational major, which was not much different than the 45 percent at four-year institutions. However, occupational majors dominated at for-profit and less than two-year institutions, reflecting the career education focus of these institutions. Within community colleges, black and Hispanic students, low-SES students, and first-generation college students all were more likely to declare an occupational major than were their peer groups. Remedial course-taking was a part of postsecondary education for vast numbers of this young population of community college students. About 60 percent of all NELS:88 community college students took some remediation in their first year. For black and Hispanic students, that percentage exceeded three-fourths. Together community colleges and public four-year institutions accounted for over 85 percent of all students who took remediation. While more low-SES and first-generation students at two-year and four-year public institutions took remediation than did their peer populations at these schools, the differences by student background were not as large at the two-year schools (community colleges). Specifically, while 70 percent of the lowest SES community college students took remedial courses, between 55 and 60 percent of community college students in the other SES categories also took remediation. And the range was between 56 and 67 percent among community college students by parents' highest level of education. The ranges at four-year public institutions were from 52 percent of lowest SES students to 19 percent of the highest SES students and between 41 percent and 19 percent by parents' education. These findings suggest that student socioeconomic background played a less important role in determining need for remediation among community college students compared to those at four-year institutions. This indicates a tendency for a larger proportion of more academically well-prepared students with less advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds to attend community colleges, while academically well-prepared students from higher SES backgrounds are much more likely to attend four-year institutions.\nThe charts in this section present the eight-year postsecondary outcomes of the eighth graders in 1988 who entered undergraduate programs by 2000. Among students who initially enrolled in two-year or four-year institutions, students at four-year non-profit and four-year public institutions were the most likely to earn a credential within eight years, followed by students at two-year private for-profits and non-profits. Only 45 percent of first-time community college students earned a credential by 2000, a rate that exceeded only that of students who started at four-year for-profit institutions. Among the community college enrollees, 15 percent earned a bachelor's degree by 2000, another 11 percent had transferred to a four-year institution but had yet to earn a degree, and another 13 percent had earned an associate degree. Six percent attained a certificate in the time period. Degree attainment rates were not equal by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status categories. While 50 percent of all NELS:88 white students starting in community colleges had a successful outcome (degree, certificate, or transfer) by 2000, only 28 percent of black students and 37 percent of Hispanic students had similar success. The bachelor's degree attainment rates for the latter populations were only 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively -far below the 17 percent rate among white students. Interestingly, among the BPS:96/01 community college student population, which is representative of all first-time students in higher education, including older students, black students earned certificates at much higher rates than they did among the NELS:88 population of first-time students (17 percent versus 3 percent). Over 60 percent of community college students in the highest SES quartile or those whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher earned a credential by 2000. In both cases, nearly half of those students earned a bachelor's degree. In contrast, attainment rates were below 40 percent for the lowest SES quartile students and for students who were first-generation college students. In both cases the proportion of bachelor's degree recipients was about one-fifth of all completers. Such students were as likely or more likely to earn a certificate and were much more likely to earn an associate degree. The pattern exhibited at both two-and four-year colleges was that the higher the degree program in which a student initially enrolled, the higher the success rate in attaining any credential or transferring. For example, only 32 percent of all NELS:88 students who started in community college certificate programs earned a credential or transferred by 2000, while 50 percent of those who started in associate degree programs completed or transferred. Also, students initially enrolled in academic majors were more likely to complete than were those who declared an occupational major or had no initial major declaration. One exception to this pattern was among black students, for whom the success rate among occupational students was close to 40 percent, while the rate for academic students was less than 30 percent. In all cases, occupational students at community colleges were more likely to earn a certificate or an associate degree, while academic students were more likely to transfer and earn bachelor's degrees. NELS:88 students who took at least one remedial course completed at lower rates than students who took no remedial courses. This pattern was consistent across all two-and four-year institution types. Among community college students, those who took at least one remedial course were less likely to earn an associate degree or a bachelor's degree than their peers who did not take remediation. Interestingly, black students at community colleges who took remediation were more likely to complete than those who took no remediation, though the sample size of black community college students who did not take remediation is small, which may make the figure unreliable.

Most notably, 55 percent of Hispanic students were in community colleges while only 26 percent were in four-year public institutions. Note: See Table A2 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Ten percent of NELS community college enrollees were black and 15 percent were Hispanic. In comparison, 10 percent of NELS enrollees in four-year public schools were black while only 8 percent were Hispanic. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Compared to other postsecondary institutions, community colleges enrolled the largest proportion of NELS postsecondary students from the two lowest SES quartiles (55 percent and 53 percent, respectively). Less than one quarter of students from the highest SES quartile attended community colleges.  Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A4 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 The majority of NELS postsecondary enrollees in community colleges were from the middle two quartiles: sixty-two percent from the second and third quartiles, compared to 38 percent from the lowest and highest quartiles combined. \u2022 The vast majority of NELS enrollees in two-year for-profits and less than two-year institutions were from the lowest two SES quartiles. \u2022 Students from higher income quartiles predominated in all types of four-year institutions. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Among all institution types, community colleges enrolled about half of all NELS postsecondary enrollees who were first-generation college students (those whose parents' highest level of education was high school or less). Four-year public colleges enrolled 26 percent of such students. \u2022 Over three-fourths (76 percent) of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher enrolled in a four-year institution.   Table A6 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Nearly one third (29 percent) of NELS enrollees at community colleges were firstgeneration college students. This compares to 16 percent of NELS enrollees at four-year public institutions and only 12 percent at four-year private non-profit institutions. However, for-profit two-year and all less than two-year colleges enrolled higher proportions of first-generation students than did other types of institutions (including community colleges). \u2022 Only one in five NELS students who enrolled in community colleges had parents with a bachelor's degree or higher. In comparison, 45 percent of NELS enrollees at four-year public institutions and 58 percent at four-year private non-profit institutions had parents with a bachelor's or higher degree. In general, students whose parents had at least some college were overrepresented in community colleges while first-generation college students were overrepresented in all two-year and less than two-year institutions. Key facts:\n\u2022 NELS enrollees from the lower SES quartiles at community colleges were about as likely as all NELS students at community colleges to enroll in associate degree programs. Only a slightly higher percentage of NELS community college enrollees in the second SES quartile were enrolled in certificate programs (12 percent) than were students in the other SES quartiles. Note: See Table A9 in Appendix for details. Key facts: \u2022 Fourteen percent of NELS community college students who were first-generation college students were enrolled in certificate programs compared to only 6 percent of NELS community college students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher. Generally, the higher the level of parents' education, the less likely that a community college student would be in a certificate program (and more likely the student would be in an associate degree program). Note: See Table A10 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 NELS students in the lowest SES quartile at community colleges were much more likely to indicate an occupational major than were the highest SES students, although they were less likely to indicate no major. In comparison, in four-year public colleges, the choice of major type (occupational, academic or none) was fairly evenly distributed across all SES quartiles (see Table A11 in the Appendix). Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A12 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 First-generation NELS students at community colleges were more likely to indicate an occupational major (49 percent) than were NELS students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or more (36 percent). As with SES, at four-year public colleges, the choice of major type did not seem to be correlated with the education level of a students' parents (see Table A12 in the Appendix). Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Community colleges enrolled by far the largest number (about 60 percent) of NELS postsecondary students who took at least one remedial course in their first year. Public four-year institutions enrolled about 26 percent of remedial course takers. \u2022 About 60 percent of NELS students at community colleges took at least one remedial course in their first year, compared to 29 percent at four-year public institutions and 21 percent at four-year private institutions. \u2022 Over three-fourths of black (76 percent) and Hispanic (78 percent) NELS students at community colleges took at least one remedial course, compared to 55 percent of white community college students. Black and Hispanic NELS students at four-year public institutions were also more likely to take remedial courses than were white students. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A14 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Students from the lowest SES at community colleges were only slightly more likely to take remedial courses than were those in the highest SES quartile. The gap is much larger at four-year public institutions, where there is a distinct decline in the proportion of students taking remediation from the lowest to the highest SES quartile. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A15 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 NELS students at community colleges who were the first in their families to attend college were more likely to take remedial courses than were students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher, though even well over 50 percent of the latter enrolled in remediation. At four-year public institutions, 41 percent of NELS students who were first-generation college students took remedial courses compared to 19 percent of students whose parents earned at least a bachelor's degree.\n\u2022 NELS postsecondary students who started in a public four-year institution were less likely to earn a bachelor's degree in eight years than were students who started at private, non-profit four-year institutions, but nearly twice as likely as students who started at fouryear for-profits. Students who started at four-year for-profit institutions were much more likely than students who started at community colleges to earn an associate degree within eight years. However, the bachelor's degree completion of community college students was greater than that of the four-year for-profit students. \u2022 NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college were less likely to earn a certificate or an associate degree than were students who entered private two-year institutions. However, only 10 percent of students who started at two-year for-profit colleges transferred to a four-year institution and only 2 percent earned a bachelor's degree, while 26 percent of students who started at community colleges transferred and 10 percent earned a bachelor's degree. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Only 4 percent of black NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college earned a bachelor's degree compared to 17 percent of white students. Less than half as many black students as white students transferred to four-year institutions, which is one cause of the low bachelor's completion rate for blacks. In contrast to the pattern evident in the BPS:96/01 sample, black NELS postsecondary students earned proportionally fewer certificates (3 percent) than did whites (6 percent) or Hispanics (6 percent). \u2022 Hispanic NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college had higher rates of completion than did blacks, but not as high as whites, at nearly all credential levels. \u2022 Asian NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college earned bachelor's degrees at nearly twice the rate (30 percent) as did white students (17 percent).  \n\u2022 Black students who start at community colleges completed at less than half the frequency of those who started in four-year public and non-profit institutions. \u2022 NELS does not contain enough data points to draw conclusions about the outcomes of blacks in private two-year and private, for-profit four-year institutions.  \n\u2022 Hispanic NELS postsecondary students who started at a public four-year institution were less likely to earn degrees than were such students who started at private, non-profit fouryear colleges, but more likely than were Hispanics who entered four-year for-profits. \u2022 Hispanic NELS postsecondary students who started at two-year for-profit colleges had a better chance of earning a certificate or an associate degree than did Hispanic students who started at community colleges. However, almost 10 percent of those at community colleges earned bachelor's degrees while another 11 percent transferred to a four-year institution. Few such students at the for-profits achieved either of these completions. Figure 18a.  Table A18a in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students, those in the lowest SES quartile were more likely than students in the higher SES groups to earn certificates and less likely to transfer to a four-year institution or earn a bachelor's degree. A higher proportion of NELS students in the second SES quartile earned associate degrees than did students in the other quartiles. \u2022 Unlike the pattern observed with the BPS sample, NELS community college students in the lowest SES quartile were least likely to earn a credential or transfer. In BPS, it is students in the second SES category who had the lowest completion rates. \u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college, only 11 percent of those in the lowest SES quartile transferred to a four-year institution compared to 48 percent of those in the highest SES quartile (includes students who earned a bachelor's degree after transfer). Key facts: \u2022 Low-income NELS postsecondary students who started at community colleges were far less likely to earn a certificate or associate degree than were such students who started at private two-year colleges, although they were more likely to transfer and earn bachelor's degrees than were private college students. \u2022 Among NELS students who started in four-year public colleges, 36 percent of students in the lowest income quartile earned bachelor's degrees within eight years compared to 75 percent of students in the highest income group. A similar pattern was evident among NELS postsecondary students who started at private, non-profit four-year institutions and at for-profit four-year institutions. Figure 19a. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at community colleges, firstgeneration college students were actually somewhat more likely than NELS students whose parents have college degrees to earn certificates or associate degrees in eight years, but were far less likely to transfer to a four-year institution or earn a bachelor's degree. Key facts: \u2022 First-generation NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college were less likely than were first-generation students who started at private two-year colleges to earn a certificate. \u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started in four-year public colleges, 43 percent of first-generation college students earned bachelor's degrees within eight years compared to 77 percent of students whose parents had at least a bachelor's degree. A similar pattern was evident among BPS students who started at private, non-profit fouryear institutions.\n\u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college, less than one third (28 percent) of those initially enrolled in certificate programs actually earned a certificate within six years. Very few students initially enrolled in certificate programs earned an associate degree (7 percent), transferred to a four-year institution (6 percent), or earned a bachelor's degree (1 percent). \u2022 Less than one fifth (17 percent) of those who initially enrolled in an associate degree program at a community college ended up earning an associate degree within six years. Nearly one third (30 percent) of students initially enrolled in associate degree programs transferred to a four-year institution, although only 17 percent earned a bachelor's degree in eight years. \u2022 Hispanic NELS postsecondary students who started in a community college associate degree program had better eight-year outcomes than did black students who started in an associate program. Note: See Table A21 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college the completion rate was higher among students who initially declared an academic major (60 percent) than among those who initially declared an occupational major (49 percent) or no major (42 percent). This contrasts with the pattern observed with the BPS sample, where the success rates of the three groups were more similar. \u2022 NELS community college students who initially indicated an occupational major were much more likely than those who indicated an academic major to earn a certificate (9 percent versus 2 percent) and more likely to earn an associate degree (16 percent versus 12 percent). However, occupational major students were not as likely to transfer to a four-year institution (24 percent versus 46 percent) and less than half as likely to earn a bachelor's degree (11 percent versus 27 percent). \u2022 NELS community college students who were black and who declared an occupational major were slightly more likely than Hispanic occupational majors to earn a certificate within eight years and much more likely to earn an associate degree. Hispanic NELS community college students who declared an academic major were somewhat more likely to earn an associate degree and much more likely to earn a bachelor's degree than were black academic majors. See Table A22 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at a four-year public institution, a lower percentage (52 percent) of those who did not initially declare a major earned a bachelor's degree in eight years than did those who declared either an occupational major (64 percent) or an academic major (69 percent). \u2022 White and black students at four-year public institutions who declared an occupational major were more likely than those who declared an academic major or no major to earn a bachelor's degree within eight years. Hispanic students who declared an academic major were more likely than those who declared an occupational major to earn a bachelor's degree in eight years. \u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started in a four-year public institution, those who did not declare a major initially were somewhat less likely to earn a bachelor's degree in eight years than were those who did declare a major. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A23 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 NELS postsecondary students who took at least one remedial course graduated at a lower rate than did students who took no remedial courses, regardless of institution type. \u2022 Among NELS postsecondary students who started at a four-year public institution, only 44 percent of those who took remedial courses earned a bachelor's degree in eight years compared to 58 percent of those who did not take remedial courses. \u2022 Among NELS students who started at community colleges, those who took at least one remedial course were slightly more likely to earn a certificate than were those who did not need remediation (6 percent versus 5 percent), but less likely to earn an associate degree (12 percent versus 16 percent) and far less likely to earn a bachelor's degree (12 percent versus 20 percent). Note: See Table A24 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among all NELS postsecondary students who started at a community college, those who took at least one remedial course were less likely to earn an associate degree or a bachelor's degree than those without remediation. \u2022 Black NELS community college starters who took remedial courses were actually more likely than those who didn't take remediation to earn a certificate, associate or bachelor's degree. This may be an artifact of the relatively small numbers of black community college students in the sample who did not take remedial courses. \u2022 Among community college students who took remedial courses, white students (46 percent) had greater success in earning a credential or transferring than did black (32 percent) or Hispanic (36 percent) students.
