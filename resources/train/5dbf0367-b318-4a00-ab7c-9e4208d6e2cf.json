[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "With the rapid development and popularization of enabling technologies (e.g. smart phones that are location-aware and interconnected to the Internet), average citizens nowadays are actively contributing voluminous geo-referenced observations of geographic phenomena around the world (See et al., 2016). Such geographic information was termed \"volunteered geographic information\" (VGI) (Goodchild, 2007). VGI broadly encompasses geographic information created through public participatory geographic information systems, citizen science, crowdsourcing, and social media, amongst other mechanisms; VGI has been revolutionizing the way geographic data, information, and knowledge are generated and disseminated (Sui, Elwood, & Goodchild, 2013). Moreover, VGI is an important source of geospatial big data that could potentially shift geographic research to a new \"data-intensive\" or \"data-driven\" paradigm (Kelling et al., 2009;Miller & Goodchild, 2014). There are a wide range of VGI applications. Examples include mapping streets and roads across the globe (Haklay & Weber, 2008), documenting bird species around the world (Sullivan et al., 2009), mapping wildlife habitat (Zhu et al., 2015;, mapping and validating land use/cover (Fonte, Bastin, See, Foody, & Lupia, 2015;Arsanjani, Jamal, Bakillah, Hagenauer, & Zipf, 2013), supporting disaster relief (Zook, Graham, Shelton, & Gorman, 2010), studying human mobility patterns (Huang & Wong, 2015), etc. For any meaningful VGI application, understanding the data semantics and application semantics of VGI is essential. Various definitions have been proposed for the notion of data semantics. For example, data semantics is defined as the \"meaning and the use of data\" (Wood, 1985), or as the \"meaning of data\" and \"a reflection of the real world\" (Sheth, 1997). Moreover, there is a distinction between \"data application semantics\" and \"data semantics\", emphasizing that applications provide the context of the use of data (Sheth, 1997). It is thus important, for any VGI application, to fully understand the meaning of VGI observations and, more importantly, how well these VGI observations reflect the interested spatiotemporal dynamics of geographic phenomena in the real world. Understanding the meaning of VGI observations falls within the extent of geospatial semantics (Kuhn, 2005). Geospatial semantics is the foundation and enabler of geospatial semantic web (Egenhofer, 2002), linked spatiotemporal data (Janowicz, Scheider, Pehle, & Hart, 2012), spatial data infrastructure and sharing (Janowicz et al., 2010;Zhang, Li, & Zhao, 2007), geospatial semantic search (Li, Goodchild, & Raskin, 2014), automatic composition of geospatial web service chains (Yue, Liping, Yang, Genong, & Zhao, 2007), etc. The meaning of VGI observations (i.e. what they are) is often clear and can be easily represented. For example, the meaning of VGI observations regarding a bird species is simply the occurrence time/locations of the bird. Such data semantics can be used to share, search, link the VGI dataset to other relevant data, or even automatically compose the VGI dataset an input to a species distribution modeling (SDM) web service to generate a distribution map of the bird species. However, assessing the application semantics of VGI observations in terms of their ability to reflect the real-world geographic phenomena is more challenging. Unlike geographic samples collected following well designed spatial sampling scheme such as stratified random sampling (Jensen & Shumway, 2010), VGI observations are usually accumulated in an \"opportunistic\" manner (Zhu et al., 2015). That is, individual VGI contributor decides where to carry out observation at their own will without following a coordinated sampling plan. As a result, the spatial distribution of VGI observations is often biased. For example, most VGI observations tend to cluster in certain geographic areas such as cities and their vicinities, or areas with better accessibility (Zhang & Zhu, 2019). Or, the density of VGI observations differs across different areas (Beck, B\u00f6ller, Erhardt, & Schwanghart, 2014) simply because some areas are more interesting to the observers. The implication is that the spatial distribution of the geographic phenomenon of interest to the application cannot be accurately inferred from the VGI observations (i.e. a spatially biased geographic sample) (Kadmon, Farber, & Danin, 2004). For instance, SDM requires species data that adequately represent the habitat use of the species (Franklin & Miller, 2009). Ideally, such species data should be collected following rigorous spatial sampling such as line transect sampling (Anderson, Laake, Crain, & Burnham, 1979) with a balanced spatial coverage of the study area. Yet volunteer-contributed species observations are subject to spatial bias and therefore may not meet the requirement of SDM. Spatial bias thus degrades the application semantics of VGI. The spatial bias in VGI observations need to be accounted for to enhance VGI application semantics. This study argues that the spatial bias in VGI observations, spatial clustering in particular, adversely affects VGI application semantics and that accounting for the spatial bias can enhance VGI application semantics. Data from the eBird citizen science project (Sullivan et al., 2014) were used as an example of VGI. Spatial bias in the eBird data was investigated by comparing eBird data against the data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), which can be conceived as being resulted from a stratified random sampling design (Robbins, Bystrak, & Geissler, 1986). Moreover, occurrence locations of the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) extracted from the eBird data were used for SDM. As a comparison, spatial bias in the occurrence data was reduced using a grid-based strategy. Performance of the model trained using the bias-reduced occurrences was compared to that of the model trained using the biased occurrences to examine whether accounting for spatial bias improves model performance (i.e. enhancing VGI application semantics)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "2.1. ebird data 2.1.1.

Checklist locations within the contiguous U.S. were filtered by time, protocol type, and locality type. Records in June 2012 (matching the timeframe of the BBS data; see next section), with protocol types \"stationary count\" and \"casual observation\" and locality types \"plot specific locations on a map\" and \"choose existing locations from a map\" were selected from the eBird database. Filtering by protocol type and locality type intended to reduce positional uncertainty in the checklist locations. After removing duplicate locations, a set of 31767 checklist locations remained (Figure 1). Obviously, the checklist locations tend to cluster in populous regions in the contiguous U.S., such as the northeast, the west coast, and the vicinity of large cities in the mid-west.

The occurrences were reviewed and approved by regional experts (Sullivan et al., 2009). T. migratorius was selected as the target species in this study because it is a migratory bird that is widely distributed throughout North America (Dewey & Middleton, 2002). Due to the biased spatial distribution of the checklist locations, the T. migratorius occurrence locations are also biased toward populous regions. It is more likely an artefact of the spatial bias in the observation efforts (as represented by the checklist locations) instead of a reflection of the true distribution of the species. These occurrence locations were used to training species distribution models to predict the geographic distribution of the species."}, {"section_title": "BBS data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BBS routes", "text": "The BBS project has been monitoring the status and trends of bird populations in North America since 1966 (Wikipedia, 2016).

The surveys take place during the peak of the nesting season, that is, June (or May in countries with warmer temperatures). At each stop, the observer records on prepared forms the total number of each bird species heard and seen within a radius of 0.25 mile (400 m). BBS routes are distributed following a stratified random design to ensure roughly uniform spatial coverage and to sample habitats representative of the entire region (Pardieck, Ziolkowski, Hudson, & Campbell, 2016;Robbins et al., 1986;Sauer et al., 2013). BBS 2012 survey data (Pardieck, Ziolkowski, Lutmerding, & Hudson, 2018) were downloaded from www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/rawdata.

The species was recorded at multiple stops on each of the routes as it is a common species in North America.

Due to the stratified random design of the routes, the results of the bird survey along these routes are thus regarded as representative of the true distribution of bird species.

Equivalently, one can examine the corresponding L function: For statistical significance test, the points were repeatedly randomly resampled with replacement to generate bootstrap samples (e.g. 100 bootstrap samples). L h \u00f0 \u00de is estimated on each bootstrap sample and confidence intervals of L h \u00f0 \u00deare then compared to h to determine whether the observed point pattern is statistically significantly different from CSR (i.e. whether L h \u00f0 \u00de is statistically significantly different from h).
