[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Current models posit a sequence of amyloid b (Ab), tau, atrophy, and cognitive change leading to Alzheimer's disease, but ambiguities remain. We examined these sequences via serial mediations. Methods: We studied normal controls, early mild cognitive impairment, and late mild cognitive impairment individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 database for the mediation of baseline cerebrospinal fluid Ab effects on 2-year cognitive change via regional longitudinal atrophy rate (AR) alone or AR and tau. Results: In normal controls, Ab correlated directly with regional ARs and memory loss, with no mediations. In early mild cognitive impairment, tau and lateral temporal ARs serially mediated the influence of Ab on memory while Ab affected memory via hippocampal AR. Late mild cognitive impairment consistently showed serial mediations of tau followed by atrophy. However, Ab effects on memory also continued to be specifically mediated by medial temporal ARs without intermediate tau.\nDiscussion: Biomarker sequences vary by region and disease state, suggesting the need to refine current cascade models."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Recent biomarker cascade models [1] [2] [3] depict biomarker evolution as a sequence of sigmoid abnormality curves, in which amyloid b (Ab) abnormality precedes abnormality in tau, which in turn leads to elevated brain degeneration and accelerated cognitive decline (changes in cognition [DCog] ). The earliest model [1] featured a strict succession of abnormality curves, with Ab always in the lead, but a later refinement acknowledged that preexisting tau abnormality might occur before Ab while still remaining below threshold levels of detection [2] . Alternatively, a combined neurodegeneration category of tau with other markers-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy and [18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) measures of hypometabolism-might exist in levels that are barely detectable before Ab abnormality [3] . Although these models acknowledge that tau may be independently deposited in brainstem, locus coeruleus, and medial temporal lobe regions (MTL), all models nonetheless make explicit predictions about biomarker sequences. The first is that Ab is the necessary inducer of increasingly elevated tau/neurodegeneration [3] . Second, to the extent that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain atrophy and FDG decline can be distinguished from effects of aging [3] , these will not occur without abnormal tau. Finally, cognitive decline will not be present without abnormal neurodegeneration (see Fig. 5 in [2] and Fig. 2A -C in [3] ). These predictions therefore posit a very clear ordering, in which the only possible deviation may be the presence of age-related medial temporal tau or neurodegeneration before Ab abnormality.\nThere have been several studies investigating the sequential predictions of these models [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The main difficulty for definitive verification is that there does not exist a dataset with sufficiently long follow-up to monitor longitudinal changes, given that the buildup of brain Ab is postulated to take decades [10] . In response, studies to date have relied implicitly or explicitly on the concept of mediation-the direct effects of baseline Ab on cognition could be largely explained or attenuated by one or more intervening variables such as tau, MRI atrophy, or FDG-using crosssectional or longitudinal study designs.\nMediation effects have been inferred using hierarchical models [4, 5] , in which variables are successively introduced one at a time to see if they diminish the effects of variables which were significant in a preceding model. Alternatively, an explicit mediation model incorporating a pathway of the form A / B / C (see Fig. 1C in [11] ) estimates whether the product of the effects A / B times B / C significantly reduces the direct unmediated effect A / C. Studies using explicit modeling have investigated the roles of cortical atrophy [8] , regional atrophy and FDG [7] or regional baseline and change in FDG [6] as mediators of effects of Ab or tau on cognitive change.\nThe full sequential hypothesis of Ab / tau / atrophy / DCog has been previously investigated [5] . These authors found partial support for the full sequence but also some unexpected deviations. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab and tau had independent effects on hippocampal baseline volume and longitudinal atrophy as well as on ventricle baseline volume and longitudinal enlargement. Meanwhile, CSF tau had an independent effect on baseline cognition. The study of the partial sequence Ab / tau / atrophy for hippocampus, precuneus, and (as a control) the precentral gyrus [4] also found some deviations; for example, in normals, Ab directly predicted hippocampal atrophy without the mediation of tau. Meanwhile, all the explicit mediation studies [6] [7] [8] found regionally significant mediation effects of regional cortical atrophy [7, 8] or FDG decline [6, 7] for the effects of baseline Ab or tau on cognition. This brief survey of current literature suggests that a systematic study of the full biomarker sequence, including regional variation of atrophy rates in different diagnostic categories, may be useful to clarify the extent of applicability for the posited succession of events [1] [2] [3] . Serial mediation models-incorporating pathways of the format A / B 1 / B 2 / C and all possible subpathways (see [11] , Fig. 1D )-offer the means to simultaneously test alternative mediations of the effects of Ab on DCog via selected regional atrophy, with and without the influence of tau, and of tau, independent of regional atrophy. This allows evaluation of competing hypotheses. By comparison, previous mediation studies [6] [7] [8] did not incorporate all these factors and thus provided only partial tests of the full biomarker cascade, whereas the hierarchical model analysis [5] examined only a few regions of interest (ROIs). Our models included 2-year atrophy rates of 10 selected brain regions known to be involved in early tau deposition independent of Ab [12, 13] as well as of others known to be associated with the trajectory of cognitive decline in AD [7, [14] [15] [16] [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "Data were obtained from the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Three mediation tests were performed simultaneously. They were the triangle pathways Ab / t-tau / DCog (b1), Ab / ROI atrophy / DCog (b3), and the 4-pathway Ab / t-tau / ROI atrophy / DCog (b2). Each edge weight in Fig. 1 was derived by linear or mixed effects of regression (depending on outcome) of an outcome box against one or more covariates from input boxes, in models controlling for age, gender, and education.

Conversely, its nonsignificance would suggest that much of the effect of Ab is mediated by pathways (with or without tau) that include the ROI in question. The b2 pathway Ab / t-tau / Atrophy / DCog models the serial biomarker cascade proposed by Jack et al. [3] for specific ROI atrophy rates. Thus, b2 refines the biomarker cascade hypothesis by examining effects in local brain regions.

We recall that our serial model simultaneously tested three mediation pathways: b1, with tau mediating the effects of Ab on cognition, independent of regional atrophy; b2, showing the full serial mediation of Ab, tau, regional atrophy, and cognition; and b3, with regional atrophy mediating the effects of Ab without tau.\nAmong CNs, we found no significant mediations of Ab / DCog. We then tested simple regressions using the bootstrap sampling with 10,000 iterations. CSF Ab correlated significantly with atrophy in several regions such as the amygdala, ERC, hippocampus, LTR, PHG, superior longitudinal fasciculus, parieto-temporal, and thalamus. The amygdala, hippocampus, and PHG (all regions within the MTL) remained significant at the 99% confidence level. Ab also significantly predicted DMEM (which remained significant at the 99% confidence level) but not DEF.

There were no significant mediations of Ab / DEF. Mediation effects for EMCI appear in Fig. 2 .\nWe also found four significant b1 mediations for the models involving atrophy in the insula, posterior cingulate, splenium, and thalamus, relative to the effect of Ab on MEM in EMCI (data not shown). These pathways suggest that for atrophy in those ROIs, tau mediated the effects of Ab on MEM via some other means, either through atrophy in other ROIs or directly rather than through the mechanism of regional atrophy. This was the only diagnostic group that had any significant b1 pathways.\nAmong LMCI, we found significant b2 mediations of Ab / DMEM by LTR, amygdala, and PHG atrophy. The amygdala and PHG also had additional significant b3 mediations of DMEM. For each of these two regions, the b3 effect was roughly twice the magnitude of the b2 effect.

We performed 3-means clustering, and in each group, we found clusters roughly representing the ranges of normal Ab with normal t-tau as well as abnormal Ab coincident with both normal and abnormal t-tau. However, the incidence of normal Ab with high t-tau or PART was low to absent. We found 11 such participants in CN group (14%), but only three of these had t-tau levels greater than 20% above the cutoff. We found no PART participants in EMCI and only two (3%) in LMCI."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study using serial mediation to test predictions of biomarker sequence hypotheses. Novel findings include evidence that the succession of biomarker abnormality varies both by anatomical regiondistinguishing between medial temporal and neocortical locations-and by disease state (i.e., CN vs. EMCI vs. LMCI). Ab has a direct effect on regional atrophy in normals, prominently and most significantly in MTL regions, and also in some neocortical and white matter ROIs and independently on DMEM (Tables 2 and 3 ). Furthermore, Ab has continued direct effects via atrophy without tau in EMCI and LMCI, as represented by the significant b3 mediations of DMEM by atrophy of MTL ROIs (Figs. 2 and 3) . However, in EMCI, the sequence Ab / t-tau / LTR atrophy / DMEM also occurs, and in LMCI, this expands to other regions for both DMEM and DEF. These b2 mediations are consistent with the predictions [1] [2] [3] .\nThese results are consistent with, and extend, an earlier study that examined temporal relations of CSF Ab and tau, longitudinal MRI change in hippocampal and ventricle volumes, and cognition, using hierarchical modeling [5] . The findings of early influence of Ab on MTL atrophy in normals also corroborate the previous study examining CSF biomarker associations with volume change in hippocampus and precuneus [4] . The independence of tau and amyloid processes in normal individuals is supported by a recent study of the relations of CSF Ab and tau with T807 brain tau uptake among a group of cognitively normal individuals [22] . The authors found significant associations between CSF tau and local ERC tau uptake as well as between CSF Ab and PiB cortical SUVR, but the association of CSF Ab and T807 in MTL regions was not significant [22] .\nAmong the previous explicit mediation studies, our study is closest to the approach [6] which modeled baseline and longitudinal FDG change as mediators for effects of baseline CSF Ab and tau on change in cognition. The other two studies [7, 8] used cross-sectional brain measures to estimate mediation of regional cortical thickness [8] for effects of Ab on memory or mediation of regional gray matter volumes and FDG [7] of Ab effects on cognitive baseline and change. As in our study, they found regional variation of the strengths of mediation effects. However, none of the previous studies used serial mediation and hence did not evaluate the full sequence of biomarker predictions or the competing subsequences simultaneously.\nAccording to recent imaging results [12, 22, 40] and established literature [13, 23] , tau deposition in MTL regions may initially be independent of Ab but may propagate to neocortical regions under the influence of Ab and is thus more strongly associated with it in these locations. Consistent with this picture, our findings suggest two scenarios for mediation of the effects of Ab on DCog. First, by the effect of Ab directly on regional atrophy without t-tau (b3 pathway; Fig. 1 ) in MTL regions until late MCI and later, by the effect of Ab on t-tau leading to atrophy (b2 pathway) in neocortex ROIs, starting among EMCI in LTR and expanding to posterior limbic (thalamus and splenium) among LMCI. Regions of the b3 scenario correspond to the locations of the early Braak stages (I and II) of neurofibrillary tangle deposition, whereas those of the b2 scenario correspond to neurofibrillary tangle propagation in Braak stages III and above [16] .\nOur findings therefore suggest the following hypothesis. In MTL regions, Ab is the determining factor for atrophy because it is interacting with t-tau that is already present. This favors b3 mediation, whereas b2 mediation is weaker or nonsignificant because tau deposition in MTL is independent of Ab [12, 22, 40] . In terms of our model in Fig. 1, b2 is small because the regression coefficient \"a\" of Ab / t-tau is weak, whereas b3 is large because the coefficient \"a 2 \" is strong. Conversely, in neocortical regions, tau may be propagated there by Ab. There, the presence of tau depends on Ab and effectively absorbs the effect of Ab on local atrophy, leading to b2 significance. In terms of our Fig. 1, \" a\" is strong, and b2 is large. Our findings of increasing association between Ab and t-tau in EMCI and LMCI also support this hypothesis.\nThe low incidence of PART in CN and its virtual absence in EMCI and LMCI favor the view that this is occurring in the AD trajectory rather than from nonamyloid PART. In particular, Supplementary Fig. 1 suggests that the weak association of CSF Ab and t-tau in CN is not due to PART (i.e., subjects with normal Ab and high t-tau) but rather is due to high variability of t-tau among subjects with abnormal Ab. That being said, there are nonetheless some individuals in the PART category among the normals who could be weakening our results, and so caution is appropriate.\nBecause MTL tau deposition has been shown to be independent of CSF Ab in cognitively normal individuals [22] and because abnormal CSF t-tau (and hence MTL tau deposition [22] ) occurs mainly in our subjects with abnormal Ab, our data likely reflect the early effects of abnormal Ab in the AD spectrum with and without early MTL tau. We conclude therefore that our hypothesis about Ab interacting with preexistent tau early in the AD spectrum is plausible.\nThe atrophy rates significant for the b2 and b3 mediations may therefore reflect the dual nature of Ab 0 s influence to synergize with already-present t-tau in MTL areas while catalyzing the propagation of t-tau to neocortical areas. This is consistent with the hypothesized role of Ab in late-onset AD (see [3] , Fig. 2B ,C) and also with recent findings based on cross-sectional analysis [40] suggesting that Ab interacts with hippocampal and cortical tau deposition to produce neurodegeneration and also that in the absence of Ab, hippocampal tauopathy alone may not lead to neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Besides atrophy, at least two recent studies have also looked at mediation effects of FDG [6, 7] . This is indeed an important topic for investigation, but in the interest of simplicity, we omitted any focus of FDG in this article. This also has some justification in that the more recent biomarker model refinements combine structural MRI atrophy and FDG under the umbrella category of neurodegeneration [2, 3] . Fig. 3 . LMCI patterns of mediation. Small diagrams above the table indicate b2 pathways (red color code) and b3 (blue) (see Fig. 1 ). b2 and b3 effects express change in cognitive outcomes (units of standard deviation) per unit differences in CSF Ab (pcg/ml). A decrease of Ab correlates with exacerbated cognitive loss, so b2 and b3 are both positive effects. All mediation effects and significance are computed by bootstrap sampling with 10,000 iterations. Effect sizes and 95%\nLack of positron emission tomography imaging of local t-tau and Ab deposition is another limitation to our study. Our findings and their interpretation, therefore, require further confirmation. That noted, cross-sectional t-tau imaging data are consistent with our findings [12, 22, 40] . Furthermore, recent publications lend support to the hypothesis that global indices of Ab and t-tau may be used to make regional inferences without imaging of local deposition. First, CSF t-tau is significantly correlated with MTL tau deposition in normals [22] . Second, cortical uptake of Ab in widely separated brain regions has been shown to be nonlocally associated with increased tau deposition, especially in temporal and frontal-parietal regions [41] . Third, image-based tau staging [42] suggests that in vivo spreading of tau deposition follows Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages and that these stages depend on global measures of tau. Consequently, CSF measures of Ab and t-tau may be representative of predictable brain states, in which (1) the level of CSF Ab is more crucial than regional deposition and (2) the level of CSF t-tau is correlated with predictable locations of tau deposition in the Braak staging order. However, a caveat is warranted. Although CSF Ab levels may develop over decades, changes in CSF t-tau may be faster, which calls for caution in using it as a measure of a static brain state over the period of observation.\nA third limitation relates to the unusually low incidence of PART in our cohort. Although our results are consistent with our hypothesis that in CN, high brain amyloid is enhancing toxicity of tau which is already present for subjects in the early AD spectrum, confirmation is needed. Larger studies of cognitively normal individuals, using combined tau and amyloid positron emission tomography imaging and including populations where PART is more common, will likely clarify the impact of PART on longitudinal atrophy and cognitive measures. We must also caution that PART was not entirely absent in our CN group, and so it still could have reduced the association between Ab, tau, atrophy, and cognition in this relatively small group of subjects.\nA fourth concern may be that our models combined baseline measures for Ab and t-tau with longitudinal values for regional atrophy and cognitive change. Because Ab deposition takes place on a time scale of decades [10] , while early MTL deposition of tau may be age dependent [12] , mediation studies of change in these variables must await the availability of decades-long datasets. In the meantime, for reasons cited in a previous paragraph, we propose that baseline measurements of CSF Ab variables are not likely to evolve much over a 2-year period and so can validly test predicted sequences of biomarker abnormality within each group studied (i.e., CN, EMCI, and LMCI). However, changes in CSF t-tau over the lag interval between CSF measurements and our structural scans may not be negligible, and this suggests caution in the interpretation of our results.\nLongitudinal atrophy and cognitive decline, in contrast to change in CSF measurements of Ab and tau, are robustly measurable over a 2-year interscan interval, and changes in brain structure may be more strongly correlated with future cognitive changes than baseline measurements [43] . Thus, a considerable strength of our study is the incorporation of longitudinal regional atrophy and cognitive change in serial mediations to simultaneously test alternative pathways between Ab and cognition. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses within diagnostic categories emphasize the dynamic nature of progression along the hypothesized biomarker pathways and are, by definition, less susceptible to limitations introduced by group differences into crosssectional analyses commonly used as the basis for various sequential biomarker models.\nOur study may also reflect a limitation from reduced statistical power because of smaller samples sizes necessitated by analyzing each diagnostic group separately. We acknowledge this issue but note the importance of testing for patterns in each group to capture the time (i.e., sequential degree of cognitive impairment) dimension of biomarker progression. We also underline that the cognitive groups were defined by very precise changes in diagnostic scores (Clinical Dementia Rating 5 0.5 for both MCI, and in addition, reduced scores for LMCI on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory II). Our results therefore imply that the specific changes in these cognitive measures correlate with a progressive unfolding of biomarker sequences. A limitation may also result from the fact that because of ADNI exclusion criteria, this cohort may not accurately reflect a broader population with respect to white matter lesions and vascular disease. For these reasons, future studies are necessary to test our results on larger and differing samples.\nFinally, because we performed separate mediation analyses for atrophy in each ROI and each cognitive domain for each cognitive group, resulting in a large number of fitted models, it would be natural to incorporate a penalty for multiple comparisons to correct for potential false indications of significance (type I errors). We did not do so, however, for two reasons. First, bootstrapping [11] does not provide actual P values for the effect sizes but rather the distribution of their estimated values, enabling confidence intervals that estimate the significance for each mediation. As a result, we do not have the ability to rank the significances by P value as is typically done in corrections based on false discovery or family-wise error rates. Second, multiple comparisons corrections may be undesirable because the regions and cognitive domains were strategically chosen to be those primarily confidence intervals are displayed for each ROI. Mediations significant at 95% confidence level are in bold and color coded by pathway. Significance at 99% confidence level is further indicated by an asterisk. = affected by AD. Although corrections may reduce type I errors, they can also increase type II errors in situations where patterns of associations exist [44] . Nonetheless, our estimation of two confidence intervals at 95% and 99% was designed to give a sense of the hierarchy of effect strengths for our associations and mediations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We have found that serial mediation analyses show regional differences in the interaction of Ab, t-tau, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. These findings support the prominent biomarker cascade model in neocortical areas while suggesting that Ab remains an important or even determining factor in MTL atrophy leading to loss of cognition. Future biomarker models, therefore, should take into account both temporal (disease state) and spatial (anatomical regions) dimensions."}]
