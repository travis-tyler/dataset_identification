We examined the effects of APOE 4 allele on cognition in biomarker-confirmed late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and mild AD subjects in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and North American ADNI (NA-ADNI). Methods: The \"early AD\" (ie, combined LMCI and mild AD) cohort of 649 subjects from J-ADNI and NA-ADNI were selected based on positivity of A confirmed by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid testing. The rates of cognitive decline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog) from baseline were examined using mixed-effects model.

Among the three genetic polymorphisms of the human APOE gene causing variation in two amino acid residues, that is, 2, 3, and 4, 3 possession of one or two 4 alleles increases the risk of developing AD by \u223c3 to 4 and >10 times, respectively. [4] [5] [6] [7] Furthermore, carriage of one 4 allele is estimated to advance the symptomatic onset of AD by \u223c10 years. 8, 9 In contrast to the well-established effects of the 4 allele on the onset age of AD, it is controversial whether 4 allele affects the speed of cognitive decline after the symptomatic onset. Some studies have suggested the accelerating effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of AD: The cognitive decline in 4 homozygotes has been reported to progress faster compared with 4 heterozygotes 10 ; a meta-analysis study showed that the 4 allele is one of the significant risk factors for rapid cognitive decline in AD. 11 Furthermore, the rates of decrease in the hippocampal volume of patients with AD were shown to be greater in 4 carriers compared with those in non-4 carriers, suggesting that carriage of 4 allele potentially accelerates the progression of neurodegeneration in AD. 7, 12 In sharp contrast, other studies have suggested that the 4 carriage does not affect the rate of symptomatic progression in AD, 13 or even may slow it down. 14, 15 Of interest, some studies have documented a longer disease duration and less mortality of 4-positive patients with AD, 16, 17 which should, however, be carefully interpreted, because it might reflect the longer life expectancy of 4-positive AD patients resulting from the younger onset.\nIn view of the needs for earlier intervention into the pathophysiology of AD using mechanism-based therapies, the earlier stages of AD are being highlighted. Clinically, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a stage between the cognitively normal stage and dementia, 18 and amnesic MCI has been highlighted as a state that exhibits high likelihood of the prodromal stage of AD (MCI due to AD) with A pathology. 19 Carriage of the 4 allele also has been shown to increase the risk of development of MCI. 20, 21 Although the effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of MCI have not been established yet, some studies have suggested that 4-positive MCI individuals show faster cognitive deterioration, higher rate of conversion to dementia, and faster brain structural changes than the 4-negative individuals. [22] [23] [24] Statistical simulation based on 19 clinical studies has suggested that possession of the 4 allele could slightly accelerate the rate of progression of MCI and AD dementia, although the effect was small. 25 However, previous clinical studies on MCI and AD, in which the diagnosis was not necessarily based on amyloid biomarkers, have been inaccurate in the diagnosis of the early stages of AD. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) data in recent phase 3 trials of solanezumab showed that \u223c22% of subjects diagnosed as mild AD by clinical criteria did not show evidence of amyloid accumulation. 26 Furthermore, a number of recent clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD target \"early AD,\" combining MCI due to AD (prodromal AD) and mild AD as a single continuous entity. Especially, in the recent phase 2 trial of an anti-A protofibril antibody BAN2401 on early AD participants, the restriction of enrollment of 4 carriers in the highestdose, active-drug arm but not in the placebo group, raised a question if the observed significant effects of the antibody treatment were due in part to the difference in the rates of progression in cognitive decline between 4 carriers and non-carriers. 27 This prompted us to examine the effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of early AD population with biomarker confirmation of A pathology.\nIn this present study, we aimed at elucidating the impacts of and can be compared and integrated because they were conducted with nearly identical protocols. 28 We further analyzed the regional difference, allele-number dependency, and disease-stage specificity of the effects of 4 alleles on the progression rate of early AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample datasets", "text": "The data set of the J-ADNI (Research ID: hum0043.v1, 2016) was obtained from the National Bioscience Database Center (Tokyo, Japan)\nwith approval from its data access committee (https://humandbs. biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0043-v1).

We compared the slopes of decline in MMSE, CDR, and ADAS-Cog between 4 carriers and non-carriers using a mixed-effects model, and found that the rates of decline in the above three cognitive scales were not significantly different between 4 carriers and non-carriers, suggesting that the carriage of 4 alleles does not affect the rate of progression after the symptomatic onset in early AD (Table 2A) . To see the effects of regional difference, we compared the slopes of decline in 4 carriers and noncarriers separately in the J-ADNI and NA-ADNI data sets. No significant differences were observed in the slope of decline between 4 carriers and non-carriers in J-ADNI or NA-ADNI (Table 2B ), suggesting the lack of regional differences in the effect of the 4 alleles on the progression rate in early AD.

We then asked whether carriage of 4 affects the time to conversion to dementia, another indicator of cognitive decline of LMCI. Time to conversion of 4 carriers and noncarriers were shown as the Kaplan-Meier plots (Figure 3 ), suggesting that carriage of APOE 4 may slightly accelerate the progression of LMCI, but the association was not statistically significant (log-rank test P = .1623).\nFinally, we analyzed the rate of progression in 301 AD subjects, including 216 4 carriers and 85 non-carriers.

The levels of CSF p-tau and total tau, markers of tau-related neurodegeneration, 35 were significantly higher in the 4 carriers than non-carriers in LMCI subjects, raising the possibility that 4-positive LMCI subjects had more advanced pathology compared with the non-carriers; in contrast, CSF levels of p-tau and total tau were similar between 4 carriers and non-carriers in mild AD. These findings may suggest that the 4 allele accelerates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in the LMCI stage, but no longer in the mild dementia stage. Previous studies on the effects of ApoE 4 alleles in cognitively normal individuals suggested that 4 contributes to lower cognitive performance and faster progression of cognitive decline. 36, 37 It has also been shown that the accelerating effect of 4 on cognitive decline was observed in A -positive cognitive normal individuals, but not in A negatives. 38 Taken together, our results suggest that the 4 allele may contribute to neurodegeneration and associated cognitive decline in relatively earlier stages of AD pathophysiology, ranging from cognitively normal to amyloid-positive MCI stages.\nPrevious clinical studies, including ADNIs, have shown a strong association between carriage of 4 alleles and positive amyloid biomarkers in cognitive normal, MCI, and dementia. 28, 39, 40 Experimental studies in mice models of AD also have suggested that the APOE 4 alleles affect the biological process of A accumulation to increase its deposition. 41 Although at least one study suggested the effects of APOE 4 on tau-mediated neurodegeneration, 42 our results may be consistent with the view that the APOE 4 alleles do not directly affect the process of neurodegeneration including the tau pathology, the latter being more directly linked to the cognitive decline.\nThere are a couple of limitations in our study. First, the observation period of our analyses was limited to 2 to 3 years, which might have characterized a limited duration of the early stages of AD, although we believe that our data might have implications in the interpretation of results in clinical trials at the early AD stage, which usually have a maximum follow-up of 2 years. Second, the combined analysis of the J-ADNI and NA-ADNI data, which exhibited a couple of minor differences, 28 might have caused some inconsistencies; however, the impact of merging these two cohorts should be minor, because (1) we included data source as a fixed effect in the mixed-effects models and (2) the analyses separately performed in J-ADNI and NA-ADNI drew almost the same conclusions. Finally, our study focusing on the composite cognitive battery may have missed the differential effects of 4 on specific cognitive domains; considering the previous report suggesting that 4 might specifically affect the episodic memory, 43 further analysis on the domain-specific effects will resolve the problem.
