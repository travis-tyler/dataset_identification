Several mechanisms could help to explain this proposed link; however, our focus is on insulin resistance and deficiency. Studies have shown that insulin resistance and deficiency can interact with amyloid-\u03b2 protein and tau protein phosphorylation, each leading to the onset and development of AD. Based on those epidemiological data and basic research, it was recently proposed that AD can be considered as \"type 3 diabetes\". Special attention has been paid to determining whether antidiabetic agents might be effective in treating AD. There has been much research both experimental and clinical on this topic. We mainly discuss the clinical trials on insulin, metformin, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in the treatment of AD. Although the results of these trials seem to be contradictory, this approach is also full of promise. It is worth mentioning that the therapeutic effects of these drugs are influenced by the apolipoprotein E (APOE)-\u03b54 genotype. Patients without the APOE-\u03b54 allele showed better treatment effects than those with this allele."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is currently extremely common due to the prevalence of obesity, as well as the aging of the population. 1 Prevention and treatment strategies for the classical macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus have significantly improved. Therefore, people are living longer with diabetes mellitus, which might lead to the emergence of new complications. Dementia is one example of these emerging new complications. 2 Compared with the general population, the increased risk of dementia is 50%-150% in people with T2DM. [3] [4] [5] Prince et al 6 predicted that people living with dementia worldwide would increase from 35.6 million in 2010 to 115.4 million in 2050. If current studies have correctly predicted the association between dementia and T2DM, then the future burden of dementia, eg, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia, might be even greater than that estimated as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to rise. 7 AD is the most common form and cause of dementia, accounting for 60%-80% of all cases. deficiency, impaired insulin receptor and impaired insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling, glucose toxicity, problems due to advanced glycation end products and their receptors, cerebrovascular injury, vascular inflammation, and others. [11] [12] [13] In this review, we discuss insulin resistance and deficiency. Currently, the drugs available are able to slow worsening of symptoms for 6-12 months but are effective in only about half of the treated population.\n14 Also, no effective drugs are expected to be approved soon, given that several promising new agents have failed in Phase III clinical trials. 15, 16 Therefore, it is important to accurately define the role of T2DM in the development of AD for preventing and treating the disease. In this review, we discuss the clinical trials on antidiabetic agents, ie, insulin, metformin, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, in the treatment of AD."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease", "text": "Clinically, AD is manifested by progressive memory loss and a gradual decline in cognitive function, eventually leading to premature death of the individual, that occurs typically 3-9 years after diagnosis. 17 The neuropathological features associated with the disease include the presence of extracellular senile plaques containing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein, neurofibrillary tangles that consist mainly of intracellular and abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a dramatic loss of neurons and synapses, especially in the hippocampus and cortex. [18] [19] [20] [21] Considering these pathological changes, the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" is certainly the most popular current view. This hypothesis proposes that accumulation of A\u03b2, as either a consequence of increased production or decreased removal of A\u03b2, instigates all other downstream AD-associated phenomena and ultimately the disease itself. [22] [23] [24] Despite the indistinguishable clinical symptoms of dementia, there are two different types of origin-based AD. In a small proportion (familial early-onset AD), the disease has a genetic origin and is caused by missense mutations in three genes, ie, A\u03b2 protein precursor, presenilin-1, and presenilin-2. 25 These genes affect less than 5% of cases of AD, that usually happen in middle age. 26 The great majority of AD cases are sporadic in origin, with older age, being female, vascular disease, head trauma, family history of dementia, and genetic factors (eg, apolipoprotein E [APOE] \u03b54 allele) as the mainly immutable risk factors. Aside from these factors, there are several controllable risk factors. In a recent study, international experts reached an agreement that more than half of sporadic or late-onset AD cases were related to seven controllable risk factors, ie, depression, diabetes, smoking, and obesity in middle age, high blood pressure in midlife, lack of exercise, and a lower level of education."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "T2DM and its related conditions", "text": "When considering the links between T2DM and AD, it is important to consider the natural history that leads to T2DM. There are two underlying mechanisms involved, ie, insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells. 28 Initially, pancreatic \u03b2-cells increase insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance, causing hyperinsulinemia, and are able to effectively maintain glucose levels below the T2DM range. When \u03b2-cell function begins to decline, insulin production is inadequate to overcome insulin resistance, and blood glucose levels rise, resulting in prediabetes and T2DM. Being overweight or obese is the major reason for insulin resistance. 29 This natural history is also part of the metabolic syndrome, which includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and elevated systemic inflammation. 30 From a mechanistic standpoint, it is difficult to discern whether the main mechanism linking T2DM to AD is glycemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, or factors specifically related to adipose tissue. Because they are related sequentially and often occur simultaneously, understanding this relationship is fundamental to the study of the role of adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes in AD.\nEpidemiological studies linking T2DM, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic syndrome to AD T2DM\nIn the 1990s, the Rotterdam Study, aiming to determine the influence of T2DM on the risk of dementia and AD, found that T2DM almost doubled the risk of dementia and AD. 31 In a longitudinal study of 1,138 subjects, they explored the relationship between the aggregation of vascular risk factors (hypertension, heart disease, current smoking) and AD and showed that diabetes and smoking were the strongest risk factors and the risk of AD associated with diabetes was stronger than previously reported (relative risk 3.8), independent of other vascular conditions. 32 So far, numerous prospective epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between diabetes and AD, and most have identified diabetes as a risk factor for AD 33 (Table 1 ). Studies specifically assessing the incidence of dementia in people with diabetes mellitus, adjusting for glycemic control, microvascular complications, and comorbidity (eg, hypertension and stroke), have also demonstrated an increased risk; eight of 13 longitudinal population-based studies were reviewed and "}, {"section_title": "552", "text": "Li et al an excess risk for AD in adults with diabetes was found, ranging from 50% to 100%. 3 In a comprehensive meta-analysis, with a total of 6,184 people with diabetes and 38,530 without diabetes, the aggregate relative risk of AD for people with diabetes was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.8). 34 While the relationship between diabetes and the major types of dementia is controversial, T2DM is a complex metabolic disorder that is closely associated with other identified risk factors for dementia, including atherosclerotic vascular disease, the APOE-\u03b54 allele, and some indicators of diabetes, such as diabetes duration, high glucose level, and insulin treatment, may also be risk factors of dementia. A study in Japanese Americans found no association between diabetes in middle age and dementia; 35 however, both Whitmer et al 36 and Schnaider et al 37 found that diabetes in middle age increased the risk of dementia in the elderly when considering prospective studies with a large sample size. The causes of such differences are still not known. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study also found that diabetes in old age was related to a higher risk of AD (relative risk 1.8) and AD pathology on autopsy, particularly in subjects with the APOE-\u03b54 allele. 38 Several other studies have shown that diabetes with the APOE-\u03b54 allele was associated with increased risk of dementia. [39] [40] [41] One study in postmenopausal women found that the risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia increased with each 1% elevation in glycosylated hemoglobin, a marker of glucose control, even in women without T2DM. 42 One study from Sweden analyzed 1,301 community dwellers aged 75 years and older and found that diabetes had no significant relationship with AD, but was related to vascular dementia. 43 This association was stronger in subjects with diabetes who reported treatment with insulin. In a meta-analysis, the aggregate relative risk of AD for people with diabetes was 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.8), while for vascular dementia the relative risk was 2.5 (95% CI 2.1-3.0). 34 Another meta-analysis found a similar result, ie, the relative risk of developing AD was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.7) and vascular dementia was 2.3 (95% CI 2.0-2.7). 33 In general, it is clear that T2DM has a higher dementia risk, but the associations are stronger for vascular dementia compared with AD. The association is also influenced by many factors, including ethnicity, the APOE-\u03b54 allele, diabetes duration, glycemic level, and insulin treatment. Determining what factors and what percentages of these factors contribute to this link is also quite important."}, {"section_title": "T2DM-related conditions Obesity", "text": "Many studies have explored the association between obesity and AD. Obesity, especially obesity in middle age, usually assessed by body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference, has a strong and independent association with an increased risk for AD. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging showed that the incidence of AD increased in men who gained weight between the ages of 30 and 45 years and in women with a BMI \ue02e30 at ages 30, 40, and 45 years. 9 A meta-analysis reported an increased risk (95% CI 1.59-2.62) of AD with obesity (BMI \ue02430), and people with the APOE-\u03b54 allele had a higher level of risk. 44 The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study reported that groups with and without dementia showed no differences in weight from midlife to late life. 31 The explanation for this difference may be ethnicity, ie, Asians may be more susceptible to the effects of obesity compared with Europeans. 45 A meta-analysis of 16 papers found that many types of abnormal body weight in midlife, including underweight, overweight, and obesity, increase the risk of dementia. 46 The results of studies of late-life obesity with AD have been conflicting, and the following four conditions have been suggested: an increased risk, a reduced risk, no relationship, and a U-shaped relationship, with both high and low BMI related to an increased risk of AD. Higher BMI at ages 70, 75, and 79 years predicts a higher dementia risk; 47 however, an analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Study of subjects \ue02465 years of age found a 40% decreased risk with BMI \ue02e30 compared with subjects of normal weight. 48 Whitmer 49 reported a decreased risk of dementia with increasing BMI in subjects \ue02476 years of age, but a U-shaped association in subjects \ue02c76 years of age. They also found that a higher waist circumference is related to a higher AD risk in the younger elderly, but not in the oldest population. The causes for this paradox remain unclear. There may be weight decreases with aging and frailty. 50 It has been suggested that changes in body composition with age make BMI a poor measure of obesity in the elderly; 49 survival bias related to high obesity may be an important factor, and midlife studies had a much longer period of follow-up prior to diagnosis of dementia. The average length of follow-up for the late-life studies was 7.13 years, which would include the prodromal phase of AD in particular. 51 Further data are required from studies with longer durations of follow-up in late life, and more suitable weight indicators are needed for the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Hyperinsulinemia", "text": "Recent attention has turned to the question of whether hyperinsulinemia may directly increase the risk of cognitive decline.

The first molecular clue as to how the brain might become insulin-resistant in AD came from studies demonstrating that A\u03b2 oligomers bind to hippocampal neurons and trigger the removal of dendritic insulin receptor substrates (IRs) from the plasma membrane, 68 which was subsequently demonstrated in AD brains. 69 Lower levels and sensitivity of insulin, IGF, and IRs were observed in AD neuropathology. [70] [71] [72] Greatly increased biomarkers of peripheral insulin resistance in the hippocampus of nondiabetic AD patients further implicated insulin resistance in AD. 73 In T2DM, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 signaling activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase, 74 resulting in IRs-1 serine phosphorylation and peripheral insulin resistance. 68 Similarly, A\u03b2 oligomers cause abnormal activation of the TNF-\u03b1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and inhibition of IRs-1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. 75 Recently, it was even proposed that AD can be an \"insulin-resistant brain state\" or even a \"type 3 diabetes\". 76 Insulin was found to modulate A\u03b2 protein precursor expression and processing both in vivo and in vitro. Insulin and IGF-1 inhibited A\u03b2 production through Akt-mediated phosphorylation/inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 77 and prevented abnormal intracellular accumulation of A\u03b2 by increasing its extracellular secretion in the brain and accelerating its trafficking from the Golgi and trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. 69, 78 Insulin and IGF-1 also prevented accumulation of A\u03b2 by promoting the transport of A\u03b2-binding carrier proteins, including transthyretin and albumin, into the brain. [79] [80] [81] Devi et al 82 demonstrated that streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficient diabetes accelerates A\u03b2 accumulation via the translational upregulation of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme, BACE1, and its substrate, amyloid precursor protein, in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Another potential mechanism could be the interference of insulin with extracellular proteolytic A\u03b2 degradation occurs via the insulin-degrading enzyme, a metalloprotease that also catabolizes insulin and IGF-1. 69, 79, 80, 83, 84 Under insulin resistance conditions, insulin may competitively inhibit the insulin-degrading enzyme, thus impairing degradation of A\u03b2, increasing its neurotoxicity and promoting AD. 69, 79, 80, 83, 84 Besides A\u03b2, insulin resistance and deficiency also increases tau protein phosphorylation through activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2. 85, 86 Considering the above, neurons in the T2DM brain could be more vulnerable to the toxicity of A\u03b2 due to insulin "}, {"section_title": "554", "text": "Li et al resistance and deficiency. 87 Conversely, insulin resistance and deficiency could lead to increased production of A\u03b2 and A\u03b2-induced oxidative damage at the mitochondria. 88 Therefore, the current hypothesis regarding insulin resistance and deficiency may represent a critical contributing factor in the acceleration of A\u03b2 production during the progression of sporadic AD (Figures 1 and 2) , and thus insulin resistance and deficiency may be an important therapeutic target in patients with AD."}, {"section_title": "Implications for treatment of AD with or without T2DM", "text": "Given the role of insulin resistance and deficiency in the pathogenesis of AD, it could be possible that a drug currently approved for T2DM may also be useful for AD (Figure 3) .

Thus, intranasal delivery of insulin is a viable long-term therapy for AD. A 2008 study reported that intranasal insulin (20 IU, twice a day) for 21 days improved story recall, attention, and caregiver-rated functional status in cognitively impaired subjects or individuals with AD. 90 In another study, 40 individuals with AD and 64 with mild cognitive impairment received either placebo, 20 IU of insulin, or 40 IU of insulin administered via nasal spray over the course of 4 months. The between-subject comparison showed that intranasal insulin improved delayed memory and cognitive function. Based on positron emission tomography findings, the authors also provided evidence that both doses of insulin had a higher 18F fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus regions of the central nervous system following administration of intranasal insulin compared with placebo, linking the enhancement in function of those brain areas. 91 Given what is known about AD and diabetes, it is not surprising that intranasal insulin could have different effects depending on the APOE-\u03b54 genotype. In a study by Reger et al 92 the participants were further subdivided based on APOE-\u03b54 genotype (APOE-\u03b54 negative or positive allele), and cognitive function was measured 45 minutes after administration of intranasal treatment. Participants with the APOE-\u03b54 negative allele displayed significant cognitive improvement on the 20 IU and 40 IU doses when compared with the placebo group and the APOE-\u03b54 positive group, and patients in the APOE-\u03b54 negative group taking 40 IU of insulin performed better than patients in the other groups. In the APOE-\u03b54 positive group, cognitive function (working and verbal memory) was reduced with treatment.
