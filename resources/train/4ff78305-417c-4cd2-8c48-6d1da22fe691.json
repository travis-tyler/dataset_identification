[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There are several factors that influence wetland species presence and the transition/loss of wetlands through time. The primary driving factors that influence coastal wetlands are land cover change, sedimentation, relative sea-level rise (RSLR), tidal regime, topography, and location of the salt wedge [1]. Sediment accumulates naturally on wetlands from tidal inflow and runoff from upland areas. Under natural conditions, coastal wetlands accrete sediment from these sources and transgress inland at the same rate as RSLR [1]. If RSLR surpasses the rate at which coastal wetlands accumulate sediment, wetlands will transition to intertidal mudflats or open water [2][3][4]. Additionally, the salt wedge dictates the freshwater/saltwater boundary while the tidal range, ground elevation, and topography influence the duration and extent of tidal inundation and salinity. Specifically, low relief coastal areas experience vegetation changes with slight changes to the tidal range while this change is not as expansive in high relief locations. The coastal counties surrounding the Cape Fear River have experienced a large increase in urban population where, from 1970 to 2010, New Hanover County experienced a 144% increase in population and Brunswick County a 343% increase [24]. With population growth, and the potential loss of natural areas including forested wetlands, there is an increased coastal vulnerability to storm surge inundation and pluvial flooding. To investigate land cover change under increasing tidal range, relative sea-level rise, and urban development, two tidal creeks of the Cape Fear River estuary, Smith Creek (34.257029, -77.929373) and Town Creek (34.135822, -78.001620) were investigated in this study (Figure 1). Town Creek, 33 km from the mouth of the Cape Fear River, is characterized by expansive wetlands, and is very long for a tidal creek at 53 km [25]. Further upstream, 18 km from Town Creek, is Smith Creek which is much shorter in length (17 km) and is surrounded by urban development. While Smith Creek and Town Creek have notable differences, these creeks were chosen because: (1) they are in close proximity, which is good for comparison purposes; (2) field work could be accomplished over the same time frame; and (3) other studies have conducted some short-term salinity and vegetation analysis on these creeks (Figure 1) [20,26], but they were not spatially inclusive and did not cover a long time frame. distichum) [20,21]. Located furthest upstream, beyond the influence of tides, are non-tidal/riverine wetlands. The coastal counties surrounding the Cape Fear River have experienced a large increase in urban population where, from 1970 to 2010, New Hanover County experienced a 144% increase in population and Brunswick County a 343% increase [24].

Gathering water level data was important in order to document how far tides extend up-creek and to measure the time differences between the creeks and the NOAA gauge. Five HOBO U20 Water Level Logger pressure transducers [29] were installed and recorded measurements every six minutes from 10 August 2018 to 9 September 2018. Three devices were installed in Smith Creek and only one device was placed in Town Creek because of extremely limited access to the creek. At Town Creek, one device was located on an upland site adjacent to the creek in order to convert barometric pressure to water level. We used HOBOware Pro 3.7.13 Barometric Pressure Assistant [30] to convert the barometric pressure data from the four devices to water level. Additionally, we used water temperature to account for fluid density to more accurately convert pressure to water level [31]. Tidal lag was calculated by measuring the time difference between consecutive high tides at the pressure transducers and the NOAA tide gauge in downtown Wilmington. To measure salinity, three HOBO U24-002-C Salinity Data Loggers [32], two on Smith Creek and one on Town Creek, were installed and recorded every six minutes from 10 August 2018 to 9 September 2018 (locations are shown in Figure 1). Upon retrieval, conductivity was converted to salinity using HOBOware Pro 3.7.13 Conductivity Assistant [30] using a salt water for temperature compensation where water temperature was obtained from the pressure transducers [33]."}, {"section_title": "Compute Physical Geography Metrics", "text": "To identify if there was a change in tidal range over time, daily water levels were obtained from 1936-2018 for the NOAA gauge located on Eagle Island [14] and tidal range was calculated based on the differences between high tide and low tide. To understand the characteristics of the two tidal creeks, we computed several physical geography metrics: sinuosity, creek width through time, floodplain width, floodplain elevation, and upstream to downstream creek slope ( Supplementary Figures S1 and  S2). These metrics were compared with the change in land cover to identify patterns in the study areas. Sinuosity (S) describes the curviness of a line (Equation 1): where L S is stream length and L E is Euclidean distance. A higher sinuosity corresponds to a creek that meanders more. The stream channel was defined using stream centerlines from the 2012 National Hydrography Dataset [34]. For each creek segment, a straight line was digitized to calculate the Euclidean distance which was compared with the length of the creek centerline. To calculate floodplain width, transects were generated at 100 m intervals perpendicular to the Euclidean distance and then clipped to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-yr floodplain boundary [35]. To calculate the average elevation within the floodplain, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 5x5 ft cell size was obtained from the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management [36] and then clipped to FEMA's 100-yr floodplain boundary [35]. To calculate creek width, transects were generated perpendicular to the creek centerline and then clipped to the water extent. Creek width change through time was calculated using multiple dates of imagery (see dates and detailed imagery information provided below in Table 1, Section 2.3). To calculate the slope of each creek, we identified the upper headwater location, buffered this point using a 50 m radius, and computed the average elevation. Similarly, we identified the mouth of the creek, buffered it 50 m, and computed the average elevation. Next, the slope between the headwater and mouth was the change in elevation divided by the length of the creek. The forest/emergent wetland boundary indicates the upper extent of salinity due to the sensitivity of forested wetlands to salt, where exposure to >1 ppt for more than 25% of the time can initiate a change in vegetation [20]. Therefore, to determine if saltwater moved upstream through time, the location of the boundary between forest and emergent wetland was identified in each date of imagery. To determine if the rate of migration upstream was influenced by relative sea-level rise, or other factors, a tidal extension formula (Equation 2) was created using information provided in previous research [37]: where E is the rate of tidal extension (meters per year), R is the rate of relative sea-level rise, and S is the slope of the creek."}, {"section_title": "Map Land Cover", "text": "A variety of image sources (aerial photography and satellite imagery) with differing spatial and spectral characteristics were used to map land cover since the mid-1900s (Table 1) [38][39][40]. Aerial photography was used in this study in order to get a long time frame, which was important to capture when land cover transitions occurred, and historic aerial photography was useful for documenting habitat change in coastal environments [7,19,41,42]. WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite imagery was used to map land cover due to the high spatial and spectral resolutions relative to other commercial satellites, and its success in mapping coastal habitats [43][44][45][46][47]. Due to the inherent differences between the aerial photography and satellite imagery, we used a variety of methods to map land cover ( Figure 3). Aerial photography was rectified in ArcMap 10.5.1 to 2016 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) orthorectified aerial photography (using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system, North American Datum (NAD) 83, and cell size 2 m) [48]. A minimum of 50 ground reference points per image were used to perform rectification. We tested several approaches to deriving land cover through automated techniques, such as unsupervised, supervised, and object-based classifications, but none were successful with black-and-white aerial photography. Others have successfully used automated methods using natural color [49] and multispectral aerial photography [50,51], but black-and-white photography does not have the spectral information needed for successful automated mapping of coastal habitats [7,42,52]. Therefore, for each year, images were mosaicked and land cover polygons were digitized using a map scale of 1:1,000. Digitized polygons were classified into six categories: water, emergent wetland, forest, upland grass, developed, and bare ground. Black-and-white aerial photography was interpreted using textural differences while color infrared photographs were primarily interpreted using the vegetation response in the near-infrared band. Unfortunately, it was impossible to distinguish upland forest from freshwater forested wetland in the black-and-white imagery; therefore, both were grouped into a forest category. After digitization and classification, numerous topological error checks were conducted to ensure there were no gaps or overlapping features in the data. To assess digitizing accuracy, 1 randomly selected polygon for each land cover type, for each year, was redigitized. This resulted in between 8% and 24% of the study area being redigitized for each year. Next, points were generated every 25 m along the new digitized land cover boundary and the distance from the new points to the original digitized polygon boundary was computed (Supplementary Figure S3). Spatial error was assessed by computing the positional uncertainty (Equation (3)) [49-52]: where U T is the total positional uncertainty, D is the digitization error, and R is the rectification error. WV-2 imagery collected on 19 July 2018 was used to generate the most recent land cover map of each study area. The imagery had 8 spectral bands with 2.29x2.29 m spatial resolution and 16-bit radiometric resolution [53]. Each image was preprocessed to convert digital numbers to surface reflectance by first radiometrically calibrating to absolute radiance, then ENVI's fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes (FLAASH) was used to remove atmospheric scattering and absorption effect [54] and then the images were mosaicked together. To assist with image classification, 2014 QL2 Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data [36] were used to generate a DEM, Digital Surface Model (DSM), and Normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). Bare Earth returns were used to generate the DEM while the first returns were used to create the DSM. The nDSM was calculated as: DSM -DEM. Image classification was performed using eCognition [55], an image segmentation and object-oriented classification software. eCognition has been successfully used to map wetland habitats [56,57] and, unlike per pixel classification methods, the object-oriented approach uses spectral and spatial parameters to define objects. Using the 2018 WV-2 imagery and 2014 Lidar terrain layers, the multi-resolution segmentation algorithm (scale, 75; shape, 0.1, compactness, 0.5) was used to merge neighboring pixels into objects based on their relative homogeneity. The objects were then classified into the six land cover classes (water, emergent wetland, forest, upland grass, developed, and bare ground) using a defined rule set. The specific values used in the rule set were determined from trial and error using several band indices and threshold values. The rule set incorporated the 8 bands from the WV-2, a Normalized Difference Bare Soil Index (NDBSI) (Equation (4)), two Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) (Equations (5) and (6)) [58], and the Lidar derived DEM and nDSM. Lastly, a classification accuracy assessment using 30 randomly located points per land cover type with a minimum distance of 10 m between points for Smith Creek and 20 m between points for Town Creek was conducted on the final WV-2 map classifications."}, {"section_title": "Multi-Temporal Change Analysis", "text": "Five transition periods were analyzed for Smith Creek (1949Creek ( -1956Creek ( , 1656Creek ( -1966Creek ( , 1966Creek ( -1980Creek ( , 1980Creek ( -1998Creek ( , and 1998Creek ( -2018 and three for Town Creek (1964Creek ( -1980Creek ( , 1980Creek ( -1998Creek ( , 1998Creek ( -2018. For each transition period, change matrices were created for the entire creek and each creek segment. The transitions were analyzed by gain, loss, total change (sum of gains and losses), net change (difference between gains and losses), and swap change (total change minus the absolute value of the net change). Classification change matrices are useful for quantifying change; however, they do not identify transitions that changed more or less than expected [59]. To determine the transitions that changed more than expected, we calculated the expected gain (G, Equation 7) and expected loss (L, Equation (8)) between land cover types based on the observed percentages of each land cover in time 1. We then tested the amount of change (deviation) by computing the difference between observed and expected change (C, Equation (9)). A high value of the deviation/expected ratio represents a greater amount of change than expected [59]. When the ratio of deviation/expected was greater than 1 standard deviation, the change between land cover types was considered significant. where G B is the expected gain in class B, O B is the observed gain in class B, T A is the observed total of class A during the first time, and T B is the observed total of class B during the first time. where L A is the expected loss of class A, O A is the observed loss of class A, T B is the observed total of class B during the second time, and T A is the observed total of class A during the second time. where C is the amount of change, O is the observed change (gain or loss) between land cover types, and E is the expected change (gain or loss) between land cover types."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tides and Salinity", "text": "Since the installation of the NOAA tide gauge in 1936, the average tidal range has increased 0.41 m, the average high tide has increased 0.4 m, and average low tide has decreased 0.01 m.

We compared the control pressure transducer, located adjacent to the creek shoreline, with the nearest airport, and there was no significant difference in barometric pressure.

These results are comparable to previous research where the RMSE ranged from 0.5-3 m [49][50][51][52]. The average distance between the original polygon boundary and the redigitized boundary was under 1.6 m (Table 3), which was similar to the digitizing error reported in other research that interpreted historical aerial photography [49,52]. Overall, the positional uncertainty (U T ) was 2.6 m for Smith Creek and 2.7 m for Town Creek. The overall classification accuracy for all imagery dates was over 90% for both creeks (Table 3). There was no correlation between source scale and accuracy and, therefore, we concluded that the varying scales of aerial photography did not influence the digitizing and classification accuracy of the resulting map products.

There was also an upstream movement of the forest/emergent boundary. In comparing the two creeks, the percentage of transition from forest to emergent wetland was significantly different (P = 0.01) between Smith Creek and Town Creek, but conversion to water (P = 0.69) and the rate of saltwater migration up the creeks was not significantly different (P = 0.19). Based on the literature, and close proximity, it was hypothesized that the physical geography characteristics would not be different between Smith Creek and Town Creek; however, there were several metrics that were significantly different: (1) creek width through time (P = 0.0006), (2) floodplain width (P = 0.0004), (3) sinuosity (P = 0.0584), and (4) floodplain elevation (P = 0.0898). Average change in creek width (P = 0.110) and average water level (P = 0.223) were not significantly different between the two study areas, but these are not expected to vary in short distances, so it is not surprising that these were not significantly different. The significant differences in physical characteristics are important because they illustrate how tidal creeks are not all the same; they vary in size, shape, topography, etc., even though they are in close proximity and are within the same physiographic province (coastal plain). Lastly, it was hypothesized that physical geography characteristics were related to changes in wetlands; however, only three metrics at Smith Creek (sinuosity, change in creek width, and floodplain elevation) and two metrics at Town Creek (sinuosity and change in creek width) were related to the change from emergent wetland to water. There are very few studies that have investigated a relationship between land cover, wetland change, and metrics that describe the physical geography of a location. Other than erosion/accretion related to shoreline change and area of coastal features [60][61][62], most studies do not holistically investigate changing coastal riverine dynamics and land cover change.

However, the salinity data collected in this study did not reach the peak salinities identified in either study [16,63]. The Lower Cape Fear River program reported peak salinities during the late fall and winter and the lowest salinity in spring and summer [63]. Salinity values are primarily driven by river discharge and precipitation [16]. Daily precipitation data in Wilmington (obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information [64]) for the same period that our instruments were within the creeks showed that there was no correlation between salinity and daily precipitation ( Figure 9); however, river discharge data from the USGS gauging station (station 02105769) at Lock and Dam 1 (see location in Figure 1) [65] was correlated with salinity where low river discharge related to higher salinity ( Figure 9). Given these results, salinity in these creeks is likely driven by Cape Fear River discharge and precipitation, which is consistent with the finding from the USACOE long-term monitoring study [16].

[64] and river discharge [65]. and, therefore, RSLR cannot be the sole factor dominating wetland change in these two tidal creeks. Additionally, the tidal range in Wilmington increased 0.41 m since the installation of the NOAA tide gauge in 1936; however, only 0.202 m can be attributed to RLSR and, therefore, the remaining 0.208 m was likely the result of the frequent dredging in the Cape Fear River, which has increased channel depth 9.1 m since 1871. Dredging increases the volume of water and, therefore, leads to movement of the saltwater wedge further up the estuary. This migration of salinity mimics the effects of RSLR, which pushes tides and salinity upstream. Therefore, given that we calculated an increasing tidal range through time using daily water levels from 1936 to 2018 [14] and there are documented dredging activities, it is likely that the combination of increased tidal range through RSLR and dredging activities enabled saltier water to move further inland, including up the tidal creeks, resulting in vegetation transitioning from forest to emergent wetland. and, therefore, RSLR cannot be the sole factor dominating wetland change in these two tidal creeks.

When conducting heads-up digitizing, there are many sources of potential error including rectification, interpretation, and digitization. In this study, the rectification (0.83-4.67 m) and digitization errors (0.62-1.52 m) were similar to the rectification (0.5-3 m) and digitization errors (0.55-3 m) from other studies in coastal habitats [49][50][51][52]. When mapping intertidal habitats, images ideally should be acquired during the same tidal phase and phenological stage to accurately delineate vegetation. While image acquisition date and time was available for the WV-2 imagery, it was unavailable for the aerial photography, making it difficult to account for the tidal regime/height during the time of image acquisition. However, we can assume that the aerial photography was obtained during mid to high tide due to the absence of any mud flats within the water bodies. Second, if imagery dates were obtained during different tidal phases, the location of \"change\" through time would be consistent along the creek boundary between water and non-water (e.g., emergent wetland, forest). However, this was not the case as both Smith Creek and Town Creek experienced varying amounts of change throughout the creek between imagery dates. Therefore, we can conclude that the tidal regimes were close between image dates, and transitions between land cover types (e.g., emergent wetlands to water) represent true transitions rather that misidentified transitions due to the influence of tides. Third, the phenological stage during image acquisition poses an issue for bald cypress trees, which lose their needlelike leaves in the winter, making it difficult to decipher dead versus deciduous trees. This issue arose for the 1998 Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quads (DOQQs) taken in January, resulting in potentially misclassified vegetation. However, the 1998 imagery were compared to imagery from the early 2000s that was obtained during leaf-on conditions, which verified the land cover designations from the 1998 imagery. Lastly, the classification accuracy of the WorldView-2 imagery (98% for Smith Creek and 96% for Town Creek) was similar to other wetland classification studies [56,57], indicating that WV-2 imagery is a reliable source for mapping coastal wetlands in this study area."}, {"section_title": "Future Work", "text": "This research initiated the investigation into whether there were changes in wetlands and when they occurred, and the rate of migration upstream as an indication of increasing saltwater. The next step in this research is to (1) replicate this work on sites that do not have any influence from dredging, (2) investigate urbanization and deforestation and the relationship with sedimentation rates, (3) incorporate many more dates of recent satellite imagery in order to decipher the relationship with seasonal weather, and (4) perform additional field work to measure salinity and the influence of groundwater and surface water to link this water level and saltwater extent. These four items are currently being developed with a larger team of multidisciplinary researchers. We purposely selected sites that had nearby dredging because these activities dramatically mimic a rising sea level and, if we documented the impacts on vegetation under these conditions, then other tidal creeks that have no influence of dredging (i.e., tributaries of the New River and White Oak River) may provide insight into changing land cover that is directly related to rising sea level. This study utilized six dates of imagery at one creek and four dates at the other creek. So, now that we have identified habitat changes, migration rate of saltmarsh moving upstream, and changes in water level, this work can be expanded to many dates of imagery that could provide more detailed spatial and temporal analysis of land cover transitions, rate of upstream movement of the emergent wetland/forest boundary, and comparison with seasonal weather. Thus, imagery sources with greater spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions (i.e., WorldView-2/3, NAIP, PlanetScope, QuickBird, and IKONOS) will provide more image acquisition dates and increased measurement of when land cover transitions occurred. Further, with the greater spectral and spatial resolution, species-level vegetation change could be feasible [44,47,56]. Lastly, additional research could investigate tides and salinity through time and space in greater detail by installing devices at more locations and for a longer duration. This would allow for a greater understanding of temporal (daily, monthly, seasonal) and spatial changes as well as the drivers of salinity from both a groundwater and surface water perspective. This combination of increased spatial and temporal mapping, replication at other sites, and further understanding the influence of weather and salinity will greatly increase our understanding of the processes and resulting land cover changes under a rising sea level."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study utilized aerial photography and satellite imagery to map tidal creek habitats with high spatial accuracy. The results identified habitat change in tidal creeks, migration of emergent marsh upstream, and the relationship with physical geography metrics such as floodplain elevation, creek sinuosity, average change in creek width, average water level, river discharge, and precipitation. There have been other case studies investigating wetland transition/loss along tidal creeks of the Cape Fear River [19,20]; however, this is the first multi-decadal investigation in the Cape Fear River that sheds light into when and where change occurred. Results from this study identified substantial change in the distribution of wetlands since the mid-1900s where (1) 67.85 ha (14%) on Smith Creek and 272 ha (18%) on Town Creek transitioned from forest to emergent wetland, (2) the rate of transition was the greatest since 1980, (3) the forest/emergent wetland boundary migrated upstream 6.65 km at Smith Creek and 10 km at Town Creek, (4) the transition from forest to emergent wetland was significantly different between the two creeks, and (5) sinuosity, change in creek width, and floodplain elevation were significantly related to the change in wetlands. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insight into the location and timing of forest and wetland transitions in coastal tidal creeks, describes a methodology for identifying change, and relates this with physical geography characteristics.
