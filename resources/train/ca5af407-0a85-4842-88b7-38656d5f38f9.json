In 2007, the agricultural sector was responsible for 6% of the total GHG emissions in the United States (413 Tg carbon dioxide equivalents [CO 2 There is a paucity of recent estimates for GHG emissions from the agricultural region of New York State. However, it can be expected that the percent contribution of agriculture to total GHG emissions from the State of New York is on the same order of magnitude or slightly lower than that for the nation (\u22646%).\nCertain management practices can reduce GHG emissions from agricultural lands by sequestering carbon (C) in the soil. Methods of agricultural C sequestration include, but are not limited to, conservation tillage and rotational grazing. Conservation tillage refers to a tillage system in which at least 30% of crop residue cover is left on the fields after harvest (Blevins et al. 1977) . This protects the soil against erosion and increases the soil C content (Kern and Johnson 1993) . No-till management, a variant of conservation tillage, leaves the soil undisturbed from harvest to planting, except for nutrient injection as well as the application of pesticides (Uri 1999) . Rotational grazing management usually refers to the division of pastureland into individual grazing units where herds are alternately grazed throughout the season. This practice keeps pastures in a vegetative state, improves grass quality, and reduces the total amount of CO 2 released into the atmosphere by enhancing the soil's C storage capacity (Kimble et al. 2002) . In order to encourage farmers to adopt such practices, C credit programs have been established for farmers to sell C credits to other parties wishing to reduce their GHG emissions. Like estimates of C sequestration, agricultural C trading has mainly been conducted for the major cash crops of the Midwest. Carbon trading programs do not exist, however, in regions like New York State's Hudson Valley that are characterized by small-scale and diversified agriculture (Bricklemyer et al. 2007 ).\nThe Hudson Valley agricultural region flanks the Hudson River, which flows from north to south through eastern New York State and is comprised of 10 counties: Albany, Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rensselaer, Rockland, Ulster, and Westchester. This region was historically considered the breadbasket of New York State and supported an abundance of fruit, dairy, and vegetable farms. Recently, the region has seen a transition from producing food crops to more profitable ventures such as greenhouses, horses, and hay (J.E. Daly, personal communication). Farmers of smaller, more diverse farms like those within the Hudson Valley have limited options for participation in C trading because most estimates of C sequestration have been calculated for large-scale agriculture. COMET-VR (Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases-Carbon Management Evaluation Tool) is based on the biogeochemical model, CENTURY (Parton et al. 1987) , and is an ideal decision support tool for small-scale farmers, land managers, soil scientists, and other agricultural stakeholders to calculate rates of C sequestration associated with management practices and to assess monetary C trading potential (Paustian et al. 2009 ).\nUnderstanding the distribution and dynamics of soil C at the regional level is an important step in quantifying regional and global C balances and assessing responses of terrestrial ecosystems to land use change (Paustian et al. 1997 ). This research aimed to (1) estimate the C sequestration potential of the Hudson Valley agricultural region using the COMET-VR tool and (2) provide New York State scientists and policymakers with the information to begin creating a framework for a C credit program that is also relevant to similar small-scale, diverse farming regions."}, {"section_title": "METhOds", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Geographical Information Systems Analysis of Hudson Valley Agriculture.", "text": "To begin calculating the soil C sequestration potential of the Hudson Valley, data on farms in the region were coupled with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping technology to identify and locate centers of agricultural activity, as well as to determine the prevalent types of farming and dominant crops in the Hudson Valley region. Data on the size and type of agricultural lands (e.g., land managed for crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry farms, nurseries, and pasture) in the Hudson Valley were derived from Real Property data from the New York State Office of Real Property Services (http://www.orps. state.ny.us/). Using a buffering operation in GIS, the size of each land parcel under agricultural management was represented on a map by creating a circle around the parcel point (centroid) that was equivalent in size to the land area of each agricultural parcel. Land use (figure 1) and agricultural parcel (figure 2) maps were created for the 10 counties in the Hudson Valley.\nCalculating Total Carbon Sequestration Potential. To assess the C sequestration potential for the agricultural region of the Hudson Valley, COMET-VR was run to generate the CO 2 emission potential per area of agriculture in the Hudson Valley. COMET-VR provides an interface to the Carbon Sequestration Rural Appraisal database, which contains land use data and calculates the annual C flux in real time, using a dynamic CENTURY model simulation (http://www.cometvr.colostate. edu). Results from COMET-VR simulations can be presented as 10-year averages of soil C sequestration or CO 2 emissions. We chose to simulate CO 2 emissions, which can be proxies for soil C sequestration, to present the potential for GHG mitigation. Data on the magnitude of the land area devoted to agriculture (e.g., for vegetables, grain/hay crops, and pasture), the diversity and quantity of crops harvested, and the agricultural practices employed (e.g., conservation methods) within each Hudson Valley county were compiled from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, which provides detailed information on agriculture in New York State (via Census of Agriculture). Land use history of the agricultural parcels within the Hudson Valley from the 1800s until 2007 was also compiled. These data, along with data from GIS analysis of Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) and parcel data, provided the input variables needed to run the COMET-VR tool for three management scenarios:\n1. Farmers continue their conventional farming practices (Current methods). 2. Farmers convert all cropped land to grass/legume pasture managed under the guidelines of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which began in 1986 to support farmers converting highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land from crop production to perennial grasses or trees (Lal et al. 1999 ). 3. Farmers convert all cropped land from conventional tillage to no-till and/or rotational grazing (Improved practices). Soil C sequestration estimates for each county were then summed to calculate the total C sequestration potential for Hudson Valley (in terms of CO 2 emissions) over a 10-year projection. Figure 1 tive to conventional tillage but should not be adopted unless a farmer already has cropped fields. That is, converting from heavily grazed pasture to no-till crops leads to CO 2 emissions rather than sequestration. Of the three management scenarios, maintaining conventional farming practices was the only scenario to lose soil C rather than serve as a C sink (0.27 Mg CO 2 ha -1 yr -1 [0.12 tn CO 2 ac -1 yr -1 ] emissions for all counties). Our estimates are similar to estimates from an analysis of C sequestration rates from a global database of long-term agricultural experiments for the conversion from conventional tillage to no-till (57\u00b114 g C m -2 yr -1 or ~2. [0.42 tn C ac -1 yr -1 ]) compared to the estimates in West and Post (2002) may have arisen from the differences in the duration of the studies from which the estimates were taken, differences in soil types, and possibly because estimates from our study were simulated and those of West and Post (2002) (2008), the Chicago Climate Exchange, the C trading facilitator in the United States, assigned $1.50 Mg -1 ($1.65 tn -1 ) CO 2 -C (http://www. ccfe.com); therefore, the C market of the Hudson Valley would consist of ~$1,117,000 distributed over 10 counties. The limited potential of C sequestration is expected to decrease as the soil reaches a new C equilibrium after the new management practice has been in place for 15+ years (Johnson et al. 1995 , the knowledge that conservation tillage and rotational grazing management can make a difference for soil C sequestration compared to conventional farming practices is vital information for policy makers and farmers alike. Moreover, this study is among the first to demonstrate the potential for obtaining reliable estimates of soil C sequestration on a region characterized by small-scale and diverse farming.
