Figure 6 shows that increasing and increases in general, however, the parameter plays a much more dominant role in increasing , particularly when . Contours of equal values of the parameter as functions of and are also illustrated in Figure 6. The contours further demonstrate the strong influence of the GEV shape parameter, , on increasing the , particularly when . However, we find negative values for the shape parameter (i.e., ) for 82% of the 202 tide stations. The 50-year 1-year (i.e., the left panel of Figure 6) exhibits a much more coherent relationship with and than the 50-year MHHW (i.e., the right panel of Figure 6). This is likely because the 50-year 1-year is uniquely characterized by the GEV parameters. On the other hand, the 50-year MHHW is also influenced by the tidal characteristics, which are not fully described by the GEV parameters. Next, we apply spatiotemporally variable SLR projections (Kopp et al., 2014) at each station to find the year in the future when SLR exceeds to the two different scenarios (shown in Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the timing of flooding regime shifts based on SLR projections associated with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario. Later, in Figure 9, we explore the impacts of lower (RCP 2.6 and 4.5) emissions scenarios. As in Figure 6, we color each tide station according to the GEV scale parameter, . To obtain the year in the future when the scenarios (shown in Figure 6) are exceeded by the SLR projections of Kopp et al. (2014), we apply a linear interpolation of the time series vs. to find the abscissa (i.e., time ) associated with an ordinate equal to . Each data point includes 95% confidence levels representing the spread of the probabilistic SLR Water Level \uf044 projections from Kopp et al., (2014). Specifically, the lower bounds of the error bars in Figure 7 represent the upper end of the SLR projections (i.e., the 97.5% quantile) and, likewise, the upper bound of the error bar represent the lower end of the SLR projections (i.e., the 2.5% quantile). Hence, 95% of the SLR projections fall between the error bars shown in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 9, increasing and delays the flooding regime shifts between the 50-year event and either the 1-year event or the MHHW event.  Figure 7 provide insights into the difference in water level between critical thresholds and the timing of apparent regime shifts, respectively. However, they do not illuminate the continuous rate of the change occurring between drastic regime changes. In contrast, Figure   8 and Figure 9 explore the rate of change in flood frequency. Figure 8 illustrates the relationship between SLR and the relative increase in the probability of exceeding the present-day 50-year water-level event, . The relative probability increase is equivalent to a time-dependent 'amplification factor' or 'factor of increase', as investigated previously in Buchanan et al., (2017) or , respectively, corresponding to the 50-year event. We calculate the probability increase, , by shifting the present-day probability distribution vertically by a variable amount of SLR. Thus, the future exceedance probability is given by , which corresponds to increasing the mean value, \uf06d , of the distribution by an amount of SLR equal to . Next, the quantity is obtained by comparing the new exceedance probability, , at the present day 50-year water level threshold to the old exceedance probability, . Figure 8 shows the results for three different distributions of exceedance probability. Panel A applies the empirical exceedance probability distribution resulting from all values of the recorded hourly water level. Panels B and C, on the other hand, apply exceedance probability distributions resulting from the top three annual maxima. Panel B uses the empirical exceedance distribution of extremes, whereas panel C uses the GEV model for the exceedance distribution of extremes. Unlike Figure 8 panel A, the relative exceedance probability increase shown in Figure 8 panels B and C is bounded. Since panels B and C are constructed from the exceedance probability distribution of extremes (i.e., top 3 annual maxima, ), the probability increase cannot exceed a factor of , despite the ever-increasing hazard level. Thus, considering the exceedance probability distribution of all hourly water levels (e.g., panel A) may be more informative than the probability distribution of extremes. In the case of panel A, corresponds to the probability of exceeding the water level established by the GEV distribution at the 50-year return period. Hence, based on the empirical ('all values') distribution is much lower than the corresponding for the distributions of block maxima in panels B and C. Therefore, upper bounds on are not encountered until much higher values of SLR. The x-and y-axes of Figure 8 are on linear and (base-two) logarithmic scales, respectively. Hence, relationships that follow a straight line correspond to exponential growth with SLR on the x-axis. Each solid line on Figure 8 corresponds to the relationship between and SLR for a single tide station, which is colored according to its cluster shown in Figure 5. The red, black, and green dashed lines correspond to a doubling of exceedance probability with every 1 cm, 5 cm, and 25 cm of SLR, respectively. Hence, for vulnerable, low-latitude sites (shown in red), one centimeter of SLR can cause a doubling of the exceedance probability at the 50-year water level threshold, which is further discussed in the following section. Earlier, in the Methods section, we also discussed the apparent bounds in the relative exceedance probability increase in panels B and C.   Kopp et al., (2014). Each solid line corresponds to the SLR projection for a single tide station, and each station is colored according to its classification shown in Figure   5. The black solid lines in Figure 9 correspond to a few tide stations where SLR is projected to decrease with time in the next few decades (which are generally located at high latitudes) due to local land uplift associated with sea-level fingerprinting. In Figure 9, we again remap the abscissa in Figure 8 from SLR to time using linear interpolation and the SLR projections of Kopp et al. (2014), as we did in Figure 7 (as discussed above). Here, we apply three different SLR projections based on greenhouse gas concentration trajectory scenarios (RCP 2.6,RCP 4.5,and RCP 8.5), which correspond to a range of possible radiative forcing conditions in the year 2100. As in Figure 8, the second column of Figure 9 (e.g., panels B, F, and J) applies the empirical exceedance probability distribution resulting from all values of the recorded hourly water level. The third column of Figure 9 (e.g., panels C, G, and K) applies the empirical exceedance distribution of the extremes, and the last column of Figure 9 (e.g., panels D, H, and L) uses the GEV model for the exceedance distribution of the extremes. Once more, the x-and y-axes of the current figure are on linear and (base-two) logarithmic scales, respectively. Hence, relationships that follow a straight line correspond to exponential growth with time on the x-axis. The red, black, and green dashed lines correspond to a doubling of exceedance probability with every 1 yr, 5 yrs, and 25 yrs, respectively.

For most coastal regions, global sea-level projections by the year 2100 are comparable in size to today's extreme, but short-lived water-level events due to storms. Thus, the 21 st century will see dramatic changes to coastal flooding regimes. So far, estimates of increased coastal flood frequency focus on endpoint scenarios, such as factors of increased flooding by 2050 or 2100. Here, we investigate the continuous shift in coastal flooding regimes by quantifying growth rates in the exceedance probability of extreme water levels. We find that the flood hazard potential increases exponentially with SLR, meaning that fixed amounts of SLR of approximately 1-10 cm double the chance of exceeding extreme water-level thresholds. Integrating these growth rates with established SLR projections, we find that the chance of extreme flooding doubles approximately every 5 years. Extrapolating this rate of growth into the future, we find that the present day 50-year extreme water level will be exceeded annually before 2050 for most US coastal regions. Looking farther into the future, the present day 50-year extreme water level will be exceeded during every high tide before 2100. These findings underscore the need for immediate adaptation planning."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Sea level varies on a multitude of spatiotemporal scales due to oceanographic processes such as tides, waves, winds, currents, and climatic cycles. The energy spectrum of sea level in the ocean is sketched in Figure 1, which labels the typical frequencies and forces responsible for each process. Peaks in the energy spectrum in Figure 1 indicate the processes that contribute the most to the variance in sea level. In the following sections, we briefly describe the dominant processes responsible for most of the sea-level variability along the coastline, e.g., tides, waves, and storm surge. Ultimately, the goal of the current study is to understand the recurrent nature of extreme events, which often result for large, combined contributions of elevated water levels from multiple processes (e.g., both tides and waves). Furthermore, we seek to explore the role of persistent sea-level rise on the frequency and severity of extreme events. "}, {"section_title": "Tides", "text": "Tides typically represent the most obvious force responsible for the rise and fall of sea levels. Tides originate from the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon, and Earth's rotation (Mellor, 1996). Hence, tides oscillate at 24-hour (diurnal) and 12-hour (semi-diurnal) periods. However, the dominance of the oscillation period is geographically dependent. Tides typically cause sea levels to oscillate between a daily high tide elevation called mean higher high water (MHHW) and a daily low tide level called mean lower low water (MLLW). For most locations around the US (i.e., 65%), the elevation difference between MHHW and mean sea level (MSL) is less than 1.0 m. Because tides have historically played a critical role in harbor operations and shipping, they are regularly measured at a multitude of coastal sites around the US by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Although tides are generally quite predictable, non-tidal residuals (NTRs) are often present, which causing the observed water level to differ from the predicted water level. Recent tidal records are based on the National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE), which is a specific 18.6-year time period that includes the longest tidal variations, which averages out the seasonal meteorological, hydrologic, and oceanographic fluctuations. The NTDE of 1983-2001 has been adopted for the current data collection and research purposes by National Ocean Services (NOS) (Edwing, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Waves", "text": "Waves on the ocean are the most obvious variation of sea levels at periods less than ~20 seconds (i.e., swell and seas in Figure 1). Although a majority of the energy in ocean waves dissipates in the surf zone through wave breaking, a small amount of the remaining energy transforms to potential energy in the form of wave runup. Runup is essentially a series of disconnected water-level elevation maxima measured across the foreshore, compared to still water-level (which takes place when there are no waves). Wave runup is the combination of two different processes: setup and swash. Wave setup is the time-averaged elevation of mean water level, due to breaking waves and the resulting gradients in radiation stress (Fairchild 1958, Longuet-Higgens andStewart, 1962). Swash, is generally defined as the location of the timevarying junction between the shoreline and the sea, which changes with time (Stockdon et al., 2006). Wave setup and runup are critically important to understand coastal flooding hazards at a specific location on the open coast. Yet, large-scale assessments of coastal flood vulnerability to SLR rarely include the effects of waves (Vitousek et al., 2017a;Melet et al., 2018) due to the lack of global data and the difficulty associated with wave modeling (Barnard et al., 2014). Furthermore, most water level observations are conducted in harbors and other areas sheltered from waves. Wave energy in the ocean is categorized into swell and seas (e.g., wind wavessee Figure 1). Swell refers to long period waves (typically 10-20 sec) that are generated by distant storms and propagate faster than the accompanying short-period waves. Swell is a ubiquitous feature of the global ocean since it can propagate through extremely large distances with negligible attenuation (Young, 1999). On the other hand, seas refer to locally-generated wind waves that also originate from storm systems, yet are of much closer proximity. In general, swell waves are larger and contribute more to wave runup and coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge", "text": "Another component that plays a crucial role in extreme sea-level events is storm surge, which is the increase in sea level above the predicted astronomical tide resulting from reductions in atmospheric pressure associated with large storms, such as hurricanes. Hurricanes are described as a \"tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher\"  Data source: NOAA Tides and Currents database website (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov)."}, {"section_title": "Climatic cycles", "text": "Climatic cycles such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which occur almost every 3-7 years originating in the Pacific Ocean, cause significant sea-level anomalies (Stone et al., 1998). Recent studies (Barnard et al., 2015) demonstrates that ENSO elevates sea levels on the West Coast of the US by 10-25 cm and also significantly increases the frequency of extreme wave events. Likewise, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has a strong influence on sea level, sea-surface temperature, and hurricane frequency in the Atlantic (McCarthy et al., 2015). These climatic and sea-level cycles are well recorded in the tide gauges around the US coastline and thus are accounted for in the current study. However, the water levels associated with climate cycles are generally much smaller than contributions from tides and waves, hence climate cycles are not the primary motivation for the current work."}, {"section_title": "Sea-level rise (SLR)", "text": "Sea-level rise (SLR) is slow, yet consequential (Cazenave et al., 2018). Sea level is currently rising at approximately 3-4 mm/yr (Watson et al., 2015, Yi et al.,2015, but the rate of increase is accelerating (Nerem et al., 2018). SLR is caused by several different factors. \"Steric\" SLR refers to global changes in the sea level due to thermal expansion. For instance, as the oceans warm due to incased concentrations of heat-trapping gases, the warmer water expands causing sea level to rise. Eustatic sea-level rise (ESL) refers to variations in the mass or in the volume of the oceanic water throughout the world. For example, the melting of land-based ice masses increases the volume of water in ocean basins and therefore causes sea level to rise. Glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA) refers to local changes in the earth's surface height and geoid due to the viscoelastic response of the earth's subsurface as it redistributes the changing loads from melting ice. For instance, ironically, as large land-based ice masses, such as Greenland melt, raising sea level globally, the local regions instead experience uplift (or so-called \"rebound\") due to GIA and therefore relative sea-level fall. Conversely, when ice bulk mass increases, the local area experiences subsidence (Rovere et al., 2016). Land-based ice melting has the biggest contribution to the uncertainty in the future global sea-level rise (SLR  Figure 10). Although many SLR projections have been produced by IPCC, recent studies suggest that accepted methodologies significantly underestimate the contribution of Antarctica to SLR (DeConto et al., 2016). Furthermore, the SLR projections of the IPCC are perhaps more conservative than most other projections derived scientific literature (Garner et al., 2018). The \"business-as-usual\" emission scenario, RCP 8.5, is generally considered to be the target scenario in terms of adaptation planning. For the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, SLR projections around the US range from about 0.80 -2.88 m by 2100 (Kopp et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal flooding", "text": "Coastal flooding often results during extreme water-level events, which can be caused by a combination of the processes depicted in Figure 3. Hallegatte et al., (2013), introducing the concept of Average Annual Loss (AAL), estimated the present and future dollar losses to be around $63 billion per year by 2050. Moreover, they have predicted that the engineering solutions mitigating the impacts of coastal flooding must be upgraded appropriately to avoid extreme AAL of $1 trillion or more by 2100. It is often helpful to distinguish between coastal \"flooding\" and \"inundation\", which are both commonly used to refer to the hazards resulting from elevated water levels. \"Flooding\" specifically refers to transient, elevated water-level events, whereas, \"inundation\" is defined as \"permanent submergence\" (Flick et al., 2012). Hence, the topic of interest here is coastal flooding and the interaction of transient extreme events with a trend in the base water level due to SLR. Of course, with enough SLR, flooding prone areas may become permanently inundated. However, the area will clearly become uninhabitable long before inundation occurs. Thus, we focus our investigation on the more imminent threat of coastal flooding. "}, {"section_title": "Synopsis", "text": "The rest of this thesis is comprised of 6 sections.

Many have quantified increases in the future flood frequency by deriving 'multiplying factors' (Hunter 2012), 'amplification factors' (Buchanan et al., 2017), or 'factors of increase'  in exceedance probability or, equivalently, reductions in return period (Tebaldi et al., 2012, Wahl et al., 2017, Vousdoukas et al., 2018 of extreme waterlevel events due to endpoint scenarios of SLR occurring by 2050 or 2100 (see e.g., Figure 4). The reported factors of increase are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest SLR scenarios of 0.5 m or less. While these factors of increase are staggering, they do not effectively illuminate the continuous, time-dependent transition between present and future flooding regimes that we will inevitably experience in the coming decades. Taking a different approach, Sweet et al., (2018) and Stephens et al., (2018) investigated the decade in the future that present-day, extreme water-level events become common-place. They found that many coastal cities transition to higher flooding regimes before 2050 for even moderate SLR scenarios (based on Kopp et al., 2014). This new approach, establishing new flooding regimes based on a calendar date, effectively communicating the urgency for SLR planning and adaptation. Stephens et al., (2018) further expanded the approach by introducing the concept of a 'trigger', i.e., the combination of an intermediate sea-level threshold and an associated timeframe when decisions must be made, in order to provide sufficient lead-time to adapt before more critical flooding thresholds are exceeded. Here, we follow a similar approach to Sweet et al., (2018) and Stephens et al., (2018) by estimating the timing of shifts in coastal flooding frequency. Additionally, we examine the rate of increases in flood frequency. We argue that the rate of flooding increase is a critical yet poorly understood component to address the impacts of future SLR. Focusing on SLR scenarios and impacts by 2050 or 2100 is perhaps inappropriate, given that sizable changes in coastal flooding are expected to occur within decades (Storlazzi et al., 2015. A multitude of oceanic processes such as tides, tropical and extratropical storms, climatic cycles (e.g., El Nino/Southern Oscillation), and oceanic eddies and circulation patterns affect both mean and extreme water levels. Hence, the frequency and severity of coastal flooding vary on a multitude of time scales. Yet, the persistent trend of sea-level rise has a profound interaction with transient extreme events. In theory, sea-level rise progressively increases the frequency and severity of flooding. In practice, the monotonic increase in flooding, driven by elevating the longterm mean sea level, is often overshadowed by interannual variability in extreme events (Wahl et al., 2017). Following the well-known frequentist interpretation of extreme statistics, we circumvent temporal-dependence on extreme events by considering the exceedance probability distribution. The exceedance distribution is a monotonic function, analogous to the cumulative probability distribution, which expresses the relationship between the magnitude of a random variable (e.g., extreme water level) and its probability of exceedance (ranging from 0 to 1). As the mean of the exceedance distribution is increased, in this case due to SLR, the probability of an event exceeding a particular threshold is increased. Since the distribution's mean increases with time (e.g., due to the time-dependence of SLR), so too does the exceedance probability increase with time. Hence, we isolate the rate of the exceedance probability increase with time due to SLR from the multitude of dynamic, yet transient sea-level fluctuations. Many probability distributions exhibit an exponential decay in probability with the magnitude of the random variable. Hence, a shifting baseline (or mean) of the random variable results in an exponential increase in the probability of exceeding a given threshold. By applying the Gumbel distribution with a shifting mean due to SLR, Hunter (2012) found that the number of extreme events exceeding a particular threshold increases exponentially with SLR, given by , where is the number of expected events, is the sea-level increase, and is the scale parameter or variance of the Gumbel distribution (or equivalently for the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, discussed below). The corresponding equation governing the increase in the number of expected events is modified when accounting for the skewness (or family type) of the extreme value distribution (Buchanan et al., 2016). Here, we further explore sea level's role in increasing the frequency of flooding events by focusing on a different form of exponential growth. We investigate an exponential function of the form , where is the exceedance probability distribution of extreme water level under future sea-level conditions, is the exceedance probability distribution in present-day conditions (in this case corresponding to the exceedance probability of the 50-year water level event), is once again the sea-level increase, and is the amount of SLR needed to double the exceedance probability. is comparable to the GEV scale parameter, , but the two variables are not the same. We suggest that the functional form is slightly more intuitive than since the argument in the context clearly indicates the number of doubling events. For example, when is found to be 5 cm, then 5 cm of SLR ( cm; ) doubles the exceedance probability corresponding to a particular threshold. An additional 5 cm of SLR ( cm; ) doubles the exceedance probability again.  found global-scale estimates of the amount of SLR needed for a single frequency doubling to be around 5-10 cm, with lower-end values needed in the tropics. They estimated the amount of SLR required for a single frequency doubling by estimating the difference in water level between the 50-year and 25-year water-level elevations. Here, we examined the continuous process of doubling via the relationship between and . For this relationship, is the slope of the relationship between and . In the current study, we estimate at a number of tide gauges around the US. Next, given well-established sea-level projections (Kopp et al., 2014), we estimate the time scales associated with doubling. We find that the chance of extreme flooding is likely to double every 5 years into the foreseeable future for the most vulnerable sites around the US."}, {"section_title": "Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution", "text": "In the current research, we have mostly used the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution which is one of the most popular tools in Extreme value theory. Extreme value theory is a statistical method to describe the occurrence of rare events, typically with abnormally large magnitude (Coles, 2001). Extreme values are scarce, by definition, which means that we often seek estimates of the probability of events that are more extreme than the ones already been experienced. In the following paragraphs, we briefly discuss the most popular statistical models in extreme value theory, starting with the GEV distribution. The cumulative probability function of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution is given by , where is a random, independent variable representing the water level, is the exponential function, and , , and represent the location, scale, and shape parameters, respectively (Coles 2001). Depending on the value of the shape parameter, , the function may have a finite domain. The GEV distribution generalizes three families of extreme value distributions: Gumbel (type I), Fr\u00e9chet (type II) and Weibull (type III), corresponding to values of the shape parameter , , and , respectively. From Eq. (1), the distribution of the exceedance probability, i.e., the probability that a given water level is exceeded, is given by . (2) The factor of increase in exceedance probability of an elevated sea-level condition ( ) relative to a neutral baseline ( ) is thus given by . Although Eq. 3is exact for known parameters, it is unwieldy. We simplify Eq. 3to an approximate form that illuminates the critical role of the SLR parameter, . After approximating the exponential functions in Eq. 3using Taylor series, , and retaining only the first two terms in the expansion, the factor of increase in exceedance probability becomes . The Taylor series approximation is valid for small values of the arguments of the exponential function, or , in Eq. 3, which correspond to large event levels, . Letting the shape parameter , Eq. (4) becomes , An increase in the exceedance probability of extreme events is equivalent to a decrease in the return period, , given by , in which is the recurrence interval from the observed data. For example, a 100-year event has an exceedance probability of 0.01, that is, a 1% chance of occurring in a given year (with year, i.e., a distribution fit to the annual maxima). The return period concept is often more intuitive than the probability of rare events. We can estimate the factor of decrease in return period at the new sea-level state ( ) relative to the neutral baseline ( ) as . Eq. 7demonstrates that an increase in exceedance probability corresponds to a decrease in the return period that is governed by the inverse of Eq. 3, and approximately by the inverse of Eq. (5). Thus an exponential increase in flooding frequency or exceedance probability corresponds to an exponential decay in return period at that event level."}, {"section_title": "Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)", "text": "We show that the exponential form of increase remains valid for the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), i.e., the probability distribution of values exceeding a threshold or, likewise, the distribution of the asymptotic tail of a random variable (Balkema & De Haan 1974, Pickands 1975. The cumulative probability function of the Generalized Pareto distribution is given by , where is a random, independent variable representing the water level and , , and represent the location, scale, and shape parameters, respectively (Coles 2001). The exceedance probability distribution of the GPD is given by . Thus, the factor of increase in exceedance probability of a new sea-level condition ( ) relative to a neutral baseline ( ) is given by . Note that the unapproximated result for the GPD given in Eq. (10) is identical to the approximated result (i.e. using Taylor series approximation) of the GEV increase function , Eq. (4). Interestingly, this behavior might be expected because the GPD, Eq. (8), represents the first two terms in a Taylor series expansion of the GEV distribution (1). Furthermore, This behavior is consistent with the theory that the GPD represents the tails of another distribution and that retaining the first two terms in a Taylor series expansion renders the distribution valid for the largest event levels , which comprise the tails of the GEV distribution. Also as expected, in the limit , Eq. (10) becomes Eq.

The number of exceedances (14) may be preferable to the exceedance probability (5) or return period (7) because, like the GPD, the Taylor series approximation is not required to produce the simplified exponential expression. However, to obtain the purely exponential behavior we again require . Nevertheless, there appears to be strong theoretical grounds indicating an exponential increase in both the probability and/or number of exceedance events associated with a baseline trend in the random variable. In the theoretical results discussed above, the natural exponential function ( ) clearly plays a critical role.

When measuring seal levels, the goal is to measure the vertical distance between the average surface of the sea and a fixed datum level. In situ sea levels measurements is much more difficult than laboratory measurements because of difficulties due to waves, corrosion, biofouling, site access, site security, and long-term reliability. Nevertheless, a large network of tide stations is available to analyze. where is a distance to be measured and is the velocity of sound in air. Corrections must be made for variations in with air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Making measurements of sea level is only part of the data gathering process. Proper long-term management of the data is essential but is often given low priority. Final checking and corrections to sea level data for mean sea level studies and other scientific interpretation can be done more thoroughly later. Extra time at this stage allows for more careful correction and, if necessary, interpolation of gaps in the data. In all cases, when the data have been processed, it is highly desirable that they are preserved with proper documentation in a permanent digital databank. Data should be easily available for research purposes. International agreements exist for the exchange of data between national networks under the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) (Pugh, 2004). NOAA archives water-level observations along the US coasts via the Tides and Currents database. We obtained the data used in the current study from the CO-OPS Application Programming Interface (API), described here: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/. Using the API, we downloaded hourly sea level records from 1950 -2017 for 876 stations around the US (See Appendix A for an example of the code used to obtain sea-level observation). As is common practice in extreme value analysis, we removed any linear trend in the hourly water-level observations in order to eliminate the influence of SLR on the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (see e.g., Tebaldi et al., 2012). We restricted our study to only use stations whose records contain at least ten years of sea-level observations. This restriction ensures sufficient data quantity for parameter estimation of the extreme value distribution. For the remaining stations, we identified the top 10 maximum sea-level events with a minimum peak separation of at least three days to ensure that the block maxima are independent. Later, we applied only the top three annual maxima ( ) to obtain GEV parameter estimates, leaving the remaining 4 th -10 th largest events to fill in any data gaps, if present. The choice of selecting the annual maxima instead of the (largest event per year) approach, called the -largest order statistic model, is consistent with the GEV distribution for block maxima (Coles et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Selecting", "text": ", the recurrence interval in Eq. (6) is given by years. We chose to select the top three annual maxima in order to decrease the influence of large, isolated waterlevel events, such as those resulting from tropical storms. Additionally, we removed outliers in the top three annual maxima, identified as events whose magnitude exceeded three median absolute deviations (MADs) of the set of block maxima. Gaps in the block maxima, which were created by removing outliers or that occurred from year-long gaps in the observation time series, were filled with the largest remaining events of the sorted data from the set of the remaining 4 th -10 th largest events from all years. If the station lacked sufficient data from the (4 th -10 th largest) block maxima of recorded years to fill in prolonged gaps in the observations, then the station was eliminated from the current analysis. However, this case represented only 4% of the stations eliminated here. On the other hand, we removed 66% of the stations because the data record was less than 10 years. Of the remaining stations, the average record duration was approximately 37 years. Finally, we eliminated another 5% of stations that did not record water-level observations at hourly time scales. The data quality control procedure thus retained nearly 25% of all of the stations (i.e., 217 of stations out of the initial 876 stations). Yet, we further eliminated a small subset of the remaining stations that behaved as outliers in terms of the derived GEV parameters. We omit stations whose derived and parameters exceed  which is simply the difference between the 50-yr water level, , and the 1-yr water level, , of the GEV water-level distribution. Here, the function is obtained by inverting the GEV exceedance distribution, , to find the value of the random variable, , corresponding to an exceedance probability of . Additionally, we calculate the other scenario examined here, according to , where is 50-yr water level and Mean Higher High Water (MHHW), which is calculated as the average of the larger semidiurnal high tide events from the detrended time series of the hourly water-level observations at each station. We considered these two scenarios since they represent flooding regime changes from rare (i.e., the 50-yr event) to often (i.e., annual), and subsequently to very frequent (i.e., daily).

Figure 5 shows the network of tide stations used in the current study (panel A) and an example of a GEV fit to the top 3 annual maxima water-level events observed at the Honolulu, HI tide gauge (panel B). Figure 5 panels C, D, and E show 'pair plots' depicting the mutual relationship between the three best-fit parameters of the GEV distribution ( , , and ) for each station. Among the GEV parameters, we only find a meaningful relationship between the first two parameters, and (i.e., panel C), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.55. For the results shown in Figure 5, we apply the K-means algorithm to cluster the GEV parameters into four groups. In Figure 5A, the color of each tide gauge station depicts the cluster to which the station belongs. We explore the geographic variability and vulnerability of the tide stations shown in Figure   5 later in the Discussion section. In this study, we investigate site-specific thresholds responsible for tragic shifts in coastal flood regimes. For each site, we determine the difference in extreme water level, namely the , between the 50-year extreme water level and 1-year extreme water level. Additionally, we determine the between the 50-year extreme water level and MHHW, i.e., the water level associated with a daily high tide. The metrics provide insights into the consequences of SLR; an amount of future SLR equal to the (50-year 1-year) will cause the present day 50-year water-level event to become exceeded every year. For example, the (50-year 1-year) for Honolulu is only 11 cm of SLR ( Figure 5B). Thus, small changes in SLR can cause large changes in the return period of coastal flooding. Although many analogous water-level metrics exist to study coastal flooding, we focus on the metric for the 50-year 1-year event since it represents a regime shift from a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence (in terms of engineering \"design lifetime\") to an annual occurrence. Likewise, the metric for the 50-year MHHW event represents a regime shift from a rare occurrence to a daily occurrence.  Figure 6 depicts the for the 50-year 1-year water-level event (left), and the for the 50-year MHHW event (right) as a function of the GEV shape parameter, , for the 202 tide stations used in the current study (with labels provided for a few important tide stations). The color of each tide station shown in Figure 6 represents the GEV scale"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The parameters defining the GEV distribution for each station are location dependent, as indicated by the clusters shown in Figure 5. Similar to the geographic distribution of the GEV parameters shown in  and Rueda et al., (2017), latitude exerts a strong influence on the cluster location, and more specifically, the value of the GEV scale parameter, . In general, the tropics experience small values of (i.e., the red clusters on Figure 5A), midlatitudes experience intermediate values of (i.e., the yellow clusters on Figure 5A), and highlatitudes experience large values of (i.e., the green clusters on Figure 5A). The increase in with latitude is largely driven by latitudinal gradients in storm activity and tide on the US coastline. We color the GEV clusters red, yellow, and green to indicate low medium, and high values of , respectively. It is well known that decreasing increases the susceptibility to higher event frequencies with SLR (Hoozemans et al., 1993, Hunter 2012, Church et al., 2013, Rueda et al., 2017. Hence, the red, yellow, and green clusters indicate high, medium, and low vulnerability to increases in flood frequency associated with SLR, respectively. The gradient in (and therefore the gradient in vulnerability to SLR) with latitude is particularly evident on the US West Coast (as shown in Figure 5A). On the other hand, the clustering of the GEV parameters for stations on US East Coast is less coherent, as the East Coast is punctuated by stations experiencing high values of the GEV shape parameter, (i.e., the blue clusters on Figure 5A). As discussed previously (Izaguirre et al., 2011, Buchanan et al., 2016, Rueda et al., 2017, values of , are typically found in tropical cyclone regions, where exceedingly large yet inconsistent wave height and/or water-level events can occur. Positive values of the GEV shape parameter, , correspond to seemingly unbounded probability distributions, i.e., distributions with non-zero probabilities for events of near infinite magnitude. This unbounded nature of extremes is, of course, not physically realistic, but instead results from the occurrence of outliers among data sets of limited duration. Nevertheless, a majority (i.e., 82%) of the water level stations in the US exhibit bounded extremes, as expected. Here, we consider a stationary approach to extreme value theory, meaning that the exceedance probability distributions (or parameters thereof) remain constant with time, except for the shifting mean due to SLR. Non-stationary methods (e.g., M\u00e9ndez et al., 2006, Serafin & Ruggiero 2014, on the other hand, allow for extreme distributions (or their parameters) to vary with time, but typically require longer records of data. Vousdoukas et al., (2018) investigated nonstationary changes in extreme water level events at the 100-year return period due to climate projections of different emissions scenarios. They found relatively small changes (<10 cm changes in absolute value) in extreme water level for most of the globe, except at high-latitudes. Furthermore, Vousdoukas et al., (2018) found that the contribution of non-stationary changes in extreme water level decreases rapidly relative SLR as a function of time and higher emission scenarios. Hence, we consider the effect of non-stationary changes to the mean of the extreme water-level distributions but do not consider any non-stationary (i.e., time-dependent) changes to the distribution's variance or skewness resulting from increases/decreases in storminess due to climate change. Figure 6 shows the difference in water level between the 50-year event and the annual event (left) and the difference between the 50-year event and the daily high tide event (i.e., MHHW). Earlier, we noted that decreasing the scale parameter, , increases vulnerability to SLR impacts. This is particularly evident on the left panel of Figure 6, where stations with smaller values of (i.e., blue colors on the color axis) experience much smaller values of the . Hence, small amounts of SLR will cause a transition from a once-in-a-design-lifetime frequency of flooding to an annual flood frequency. For more than 90% of US tide stations used in the current study, the difference between the water level of the 50-year event and the annual event is less than 0.5 m. The difference in water level between the 50-year water level event and the daily high tide event (MHHW event) is generally about 2-4 times larger than the difference between the water"}, {"section_title": "\uf073 \uf073", "text": "Water Level \uf044 level of the 50-year event and the annual event. Yet, for about 73% of the tide gauges used in this study, the difference in water level between the 50-year water level event and the daily high tide event (MHHW event) is less than 1.0 m. Figure 6 shows labels for a few long-standing tide stations in populated areas. Interestingly, the location of the coastal cities depicted on Figure 6 bears a rough resemblance to their geographic location: cities on the West Coast are further to the left on Figure 6 than their East Coast counterparts, indicating that they generally experience lower values of the GEV shape parameter. Furthermore, high-latitude cities generally have larger differences in for the 50-year to 1-year and 50-year to MHHW scenarios, owing to the general increase in with latitude. Figure 7 shows the year when SLR projections exceed the scenarios in Focusing on the ensemble mean SLR scenarios, all of the labeled tide stations transition from 50year water level events to annual events before 2050. For nearly 70% of the tide gauge stations used in this study, SLR causes flood regime shifts from the present-day 50-year water level event to an annual occurrence before the year 2050. 99% of tide stations in the US transition from a 50year occurrence to an annual occurrence before 2100. Considering the even more dire scenario of a flood regime transition from a 50-year occurrence to a daily occurrence (i.e., during a MHHW event), we find that only 6% of stations transition before 2050, but the number climbs to 62% before 2075. 93% of tide stations in the US will transition from a 50-year recurrence of an extreme   Figure 8 panels A and B, which correspond to the empirical exceedance probability distribution for all values of water level and for the extreme values of water level, respectively, are slightly jagged compared to panel C for the GEV distribution. The empirical distributions arise from the observed data and thus are not necessarily smooth. In contrast, the GEV model represents a smooth fit to the observations. Although there are some notable differences between the three panels of Figure 8, particularly with respect to the upper bound on panels B and C (as discussed in Methods), overall, each panel shows roughly the same growth rates and the same variation among the growth rates for each cluster. In general, the curves in Figure 8 parallel the dashed lines corresponding to doubling rates every 1 cm, 5 cm, and 25 cm of SLR). Unsurprisingly, we find that the low-latitude stations belonging to the red cluster are highly vulnerable. The most vulnerable of these sites double in exceedance probability with every centimeter of SLR. On the other hand, stations belonging to the blue cluster, which indicates a higher value of the GEV shape parameter, , are much less vulnerable, since they require larger amounts of SLR (~10-25 cm) to double in frequency. Figure 9 demonstrates that an exponential relationship also exists between the doubling of exceedance probability and time. In Figure 9, each row corresponds to different SLR scenarios based on different emissions scenarios, i.e., RCP 8.5, 4.5, and 2.6 for panels A, B, and C, respectively. Similar to Figure 8, the three thick dashed lines on each graph show the time scale required to double the exceedance probability of a 50-year flood event. In general, most curves parallel the 5-year dashed line, which means that the exceedance probability of most stations will double every 5 years. Once more, low latitude stations (in red) double much faster than higher latitude stations. The stations that are least vulnerable are the high latitude stations shown in k rebound associated with the melting glaciers and Greenland. For these few stations, impacts due to SLR are delayed until about 2050 or later. For the rest of the stations considered here, the exceedance probability increases by a factor ~100 or more by 2050 for high-end SLR scenarios. Interestingly, for the most vulnerable sites shown in red, the lower RCP emissions scenarios provide a brief respite from impacts due to SLR. Even the modest amounts of SLR experienced under the RCP 2.6 scenarios are more than enough to double the flood frequency several times over at the most vulnerable sites. Impacts occurring at the higher-latitude stations shown in green and the tropical-storm exposed stations shown in blue, on the other hand, do seem to be delayed by few decades under the RCP 2.6 SLR scenario compared with the RCP 8.5 scenario."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The long-term trend in mean sea level has profound consequences on the nature of transient extreme events. Present-day extreme sea-level events will be rendered commonplace within the next few decades which entails catastrophic impacts, such as frequent flooding and/or inundation of low-lying coastal areas. Given established emissions trajectories (i.e., RCP 8.5, which is the most pessimistic of the scenarios considered here, and also, most likely) and accompanying sea-level projections, the chances of extreme coastal flooding will likely double every 5 years into the foreseeable future, calling for immediate engineering solutions. Furthermore, today's once-in-a-design-lifetime coastal flood level may be exceeded every day during high tide before 2100. Although the current paper focuses on increased flood frequency, we expect a corresponding acceleration of a number of related coastal hazards, such as beach and cliff erosion , Limber et al., 2018, Anderson et al., 2018. Our society has yet to fully comprehend the eventuality of regime shifts in coastal hazards and the consequences thereof, which may amount to billions of dollars of damages each year. Worse yet, we have precious limited time left to adapt."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE WORK", "text": "The research conducted here can be adopted as a start point in a multitude of future works. Firstly, the methodology introduced here, which was merely applied to the data from tide gauge stations around the US coastal zones, could be also applied to the multitude of tide stations all around the globe. There are definitely some limitations in this regard, stemming from the inadequate number of stations recording data in some geographical areas like Africa, South America, and the Indian Ocean. In addition, the raw data used in the current study is mostly recorded at stations that filter out the effects of waves, thus excluding the influence of wave runup. Including the influence of wave runup will likely change the timing of the scenarios considered in this study, but will certainly not reverse any of the conclusions presented herein. The results presented in this study are applicable to sheltered coastal waters, which represents conditions at most coastal megacities in the US. The approach that we took in the current study is a stationary one in terms of the parameters obtained from the GEV analysis on the data (as discussed in the Discussion section). Future work might consider a non-stationary approach to assess the relationship between extreme events and climate change. This may allow us to separate the influence of SLR from climatedriven changes in storminess. Lastly, the stationary GEV analysis can be implemented on other natural physical phenomena, such as temperature. In this regard, one application could be the effect of increased heat waves due to global warming. An incredible wealth of environmental data has been recorded over the past several decades as anthropogenic climate change as accelerated.
