Chen et al., 2015; Jia & Chassignet, 2011; Liang et al., 2008; Metzger & Hurlburt, 2001; Nan et al., 2015; Pe\u00f1aflor et al., 2007) . The northward flowing Kuroshio Current (KC) periodically intrudes through the strait into the SCS as the Kuroshio Intrusion (KI), significantly contributing to mean Luzon Strait Transport (LST; Caruso et al., 2006; Centurioni et al., 2004; J. Hu et al., 2000; Jia & Liu, 2004; Nan et al., 2015; Wyrtki, 1961) .

Chen et al., 2001; D. Hu et al., 2015; Nan et al., 2015; Qiu & Lukas, 1996) . SCS outflow crosses the LS toward the WPO at lower rate, causing water and nutrient exchange along the strait (Chern & Wang, 1998; Du et al., 2013; Hsin et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2004) .\nIntermittent measurements and multiyear hydrographic observations of the water exchange across the strait reveal a spatially variable structure of the LST. The mean transport across the strait has a sandwich-like vertical structure, such that the upper (i.e., <500 m) and deep (i.e., 1,500 m) layers flow into the SCS and the middle layer (i.e., 500 to 1,500 m) flows out to the WPO (Nan et al., 2015; Qu et al. 2006 Qu et al. , 2000 Shaw & Chao, 1994; Tian et al., 2006) . In the upper layers (i.e., 0 to 300 m), eastward and westward currents are also observed to alternate spatially. Inflow to the SCS is commonly observed across 19.5-21\u00b0N (G. Hsin et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2004) and the direction typically reverses north of 21\u00b0N (G. Hsin et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2008; Nan et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2004) . The net flow into the SCS varies between 3 and 6.5 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6 m 3 /s) annually (Nan et al., 2015) . The LST also\nshows strong monsoon-driven seasonal variation, where maximum intrusions (minimal outflows) of 2.75 to 13.7 Sv (0.2 to 2.75 Sv) occur during winter (summer) when the northeast (southwest) monsoon predominates (Centurioni et al., 2004; G. Chen, Hu, et al., 2011; Hsin et al., 2012; Metzger & Hurlburt, 1996; Nan et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2004 Qu et al., , 2000 Tian et al., 2006; Wyrtki, 1961; Yang et al., 2010; . Numerical models are able to reproduce similar spatial and temporal variability but further magnify quantitative inconsistencies in the observed mean transport. Model-derived LST estimates (e.g., Hsin et al., 2012; Nan et al., 2015) indicate a mean westward transport of 0.6 to 10.2 Sv, while seasonal transports vary Figure 1 .

Colored symbols indicate the location of coral \u0394\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\nwhere V p (m/day) is the gas exchange piston velocity, a function of wind speed (WS = 6.4 m/s from National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis; Kalnay et al., 1996) and equivalent to V p = WS * 0.9995-3.47 (Druffel, 1997b; Goodkin et al., 2012; Grumet et al., 2004) ; CO 2(aq) is the dissolved CO 2 fixed to a value of 0.019 mol/m 3 (Druffel, 1997b; Goodkin et al., 2012; Grumet et al., 2004) ; Z is the mixed layer depth fixed to a value of 50 m based on the Ocean General Circulation Model for Earth Simulator data set (Masumoto et al., 2004) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration World Ocean Database (Levitus, 1982; Monterey & Levitus, 1997) ; and \u03a3CO 2 is the total CO 2 dissolved in the surface waters equivalent to 2.06 mol/m 3 (Broecker & Peng, 1982; Levitus, 1982) . Thus, k \u22121 is equal to 0.20 year \u22121 .\nThe exchange rate from the subsurface, k D , is approximated from the upwelling index reported off southwest Taiwan. The mean upwelling rate is 78.2 m 3 /s 100 \u22121 m of coastline (i.e., total coastline is~1,700 km; Ndah et al., 2017) . With respect to the volume of the subsurface box (i.e., 3.13 \u00d7 10 13 m 3 ), the ventilation rate, k D , is equivalent to 1.2 year \u22121 or, in terms of the mean amount of water exchanged, about~1.3 Sv.\nTo approximate the lateral exchange rates from SO and KI boxes, we assumed that k SO and k KI are fractions of the total lateral input, k Lat , such that 25% and 75% of k SO and k KI constitutes k Lat , respectively, based on Nan et al. (2015 ; Table S3 ). Here, the direction of k Lat represents the mean flow along the strait, which is from the WPO into the SCS. The lateral terms in equation (1) were then expressed in terms of k Lat :\nAssuming steady state conditions,\nwhere the average fraction modern (Stuiver & Polach, 1977) , respectively. With respect to the volume of the LS, the amount of water exchanged, k KI and k SO are correspondingly equal to 0.11 and 0.04 Sv. Among the calculated exchange rates during the prebomb period, k D is the highest, highlighting the importance of subsurface ventilation in the \u0394 14 C content of the strait.\nWe applied this model to the postbomb period after 1970 using constant values for k \u22121 and k D , and solving for k Lat . We excluded the year 1979 because the values for surface boxes SO, LS, and KI are equivalent (Table S2) , resulting in a lateral mass value close to 0 and hence an anomalous estimate of the lateral flux. The mean amount of water exchange from 1970 to 1999 across the strait is 2.2 \u00b1 5.2 Sv (1\u03c3, n = 28), ranging from \u221213.4 to 16 Sv, where a negative value is net flow out of the SCS and a positive flow is into the SCS (Figure 6 ). These values are within the magnitude of the mean flow measurements across the strait commonly conducted in shorter time periods (e.g., Nan et al., 2015) but are likely to be overestimated due to limitations of the model. While k D is likely to vary with time, we do not have measurements to inform us of changes to the rate. As the largest flux into the strait, small variability of k D will have minimal impact on the model.

The red line across the strait at 120.8\u00b0E running from 18\u00b0N to 22\u00b0N define the transect where surface zonal currents and sea surface heights from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation data set (SODA v.2.2.4, http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/dods/public_data/SODA/soda_pop2.2.4) are derived (shown in Figures 3 and 4c , respectively).

The large range of these estimates primarily result due to the differences in the methodology and model assumptions (Hsin et al., 2012; Nan et al., 2015) .\nCompared to seasonal variability, the interannual LST variation and its controlling mechanisms are less understood due to scarcity of continuous direct observations (Nan et al., 2015; Wu, 2013) . Numerical models show that the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts influence on the interannual variability of the LST by means of shifting the position of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) bifurcation latitude (e.g., Qu et al., 2004) . The position of the bifurcation latitude determines the volume of the Kuroshio relative to the southward flowing Mindanao Current (MC) and the subsequent intrusion into the SCS. During El Ni\u00f1o years, anomalous southerly winds east of the Philippines push the bifurcation latitude northward reducing the Kuroshio transport east of Luzon (Y. Y. Kim et al., 2004; Qiu & Chen, 2010; Qiu & Lukas, 1996; Q.-Y. Wang & Hu, 2006) and increasing the KI into the SCS potentially a result of inertial effects (Gordon et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2004; . The situation then reverses for La Ni\u00f1a periods. However, recent studies show that the interannual variability of the NEC bifurcation and, consequently, the mean flow across the strait is strongly linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and not ENSO (e.g., Nan et al., 2016; Wu, 2013; Wu et al., 2016) . With the more frequent PDO shifts in the recent years, ENSO is hypothesized to exert less impact on the NEC bifurcation latitude migration and mean LST, especially after 1995 when the PDO became predominantly negative (Wu, 2013) . Similar to the ENSO-related wind forcing, anomalous winds during warm (cold) PDO phase induces northward (southward) shift of the NEC bifurcation, which enhances (reduces) the KI (Wu, 2013; Wu et al., 2016) . The weakening trend of the KI, \u22120.12 Sv/ year from 1993 to 2012, estimated from satellite data and hydrographic observations across the strait, is likewise attributed to the changes in PDO phase (Nan et al., 2016) . Due to the predominantly cold (negative) PDO regime since the early 1990s, the position of the NEC bifurcation latitude is southward, lessening the penetration of the KI into the SCS (Nan et al., 2016; Wu, 2013) . Another study highlights the role of longterm changes in pressure gradient on the reduction of KI across the strait in the recent decades (e.g., Nan et al., 2013) . Whether the intrusion is linked with the ENSO or PDO and driven by the local and large-scale wind forcing or pressure difference across the strait still remains a subject of disagreement (Nan et al., 2015) .\nPaleoreconstructions based on both marine sediments and coral proxies provide insights into the long-term change of Kuroshio transport. Changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages and stable isotope geochemistry reveal fluctuations in Kuroshio flow patterns and intensities along the east coast of Japan since the Late Quaternary to the Holocene (e.g., Jian et al., 2000; Ujiie & Ujiie, 1999) . Similarly, coral \u03b4 15 N and \u03b4 18 O from east of Japan and south of Taiwan record Kuroshio variability in the last 50 to~150 years (e.g., Li et al., 2017; Yamazaki et al., 2016) . Paleoreconstruction of the KI strength, on the other hand, is limited to the Holocene (e.g., Liu et al., 2013) , where ENSO-related mechanisms remained unclear. While direct measurements, satellite data, numerical models, and proxy reconstructions have advanced our presentday knowledge of current movements and transport variability in recent decades, there is still a need for multidecadal, high-resolution on-site LST records to better understand its interannual variation.\nThis study presents annually resolved histories of mean transport variability across the LS based on coral radiocarbon (\u0394 14 C) records. In this approach, we aim to investigate how the surface transport across the LS has changed in the past 68 years. Moreover, we aim to provide insights on the possible mechanisms that drive its variability. This information is critical to understanding the causes and impacts of long-term ocean circulation variability in this region.\nC coral is not affected by biological process; thus, they provide a conservative tracer of ocean circulation (Dunbar & Cole, 1999) . Coral \u0394 14 C records of various temporal resolution and length are available in the WPO, SCS and Indonesia regions (Figure 1 ). These records provide histories of basin-scale changes in ocean circulation since the beginning of the twentieth century. In conjunction with our coral \u0394 14 C records, we take advantage of this extensive spatial and temporal information to examine the interaction between the WPO and the SCS through the LS.\nC with lower \u0394\nC values and the observed dampening in \u0394\nC seasonality at this site. However, since the LS is a site of water mass exchange between the SCS and the WPO, the \u0394 14 C values at our sites must be additionally affected by the \u0394\nC variability between these basins.\nThe occurrence of early bomb peaks in both Houbihu and Palaui \u0394 14 C records indicates influence of the western Pacific circulation across the LS. Relative to air-sea CO 2 exchange, which typically takes a decade (Nydal, 2000) , the quick \u0394 14 C rise in Houbihu and Palaui recorded 1 year after the initial bomb detonations is likely due to a nuclear fallout signal distributed by the advection of tropical Pacific currents (i.e., NEC and KC) originating at the testing sites at Bikini and Enewetak atolls (Andrews et al., 2016; Glynn et al., 2013; . This current system delivers bomb-contaminated NEC waters through Guam, with a current speed of~0.1 to 0.2 m/s, until it bifurcates to the northward flowing KC and the southward flowing MC whose speeds are roughly 5 to 10 times faster (Andrews et al., 2016; Lien et al., 2014; Qu et al., 1998 ; Figure 1 ). The difference in the transport velocities between the NEC and its branches (i.e., KC and MC) explains the 1-year lag time between the initial detonations and the early bomb peaks in the coral records .\nIn the Pacific, the interannual variability of the location and speed of the western boundary currents are strongly influenced by ENSO (Y. Y. Kim et al., 2004; Qiu & Chen, 2010) . To further investigate this control on the \u0394 14 C variability at our sites during the post bomb period (i.e., after 1970), we compared our results with Guam \u0394 14 C since the Kuroshio waters reaching our sites originate from the NEC that flow by Guam. Figure  3a) ; and the Southern Oscillation Index (Y. Y. Kim et al., 2004) . During El Ni\u00f1o years, the northward NBL position causes less NEC water to flow northward to the KC relative to the southward flow east of Mindanao (Y. Y. Kim et al., 2004; Qiu & Chen, 2010; Qiu & Lukas, 1996) . Due to the dampened winds, the NEC and Kuroshio velocities are slower, and transports are at their minimum during El Ni\u00f1o (Y. Y. Kim et al., 2004; Qiu & Chen, 2010; Qiu & Lukas, 1996) . This leads to a positive Palaui-Guam \u0394 14 C difference 1970-1971, 1975-1976, and 1979 is opposite of what the above mechanism predicts. This period coincides with the broad \u0394 14 C plateau recorded in Guam (Andrews et al., 2016) . The cause of the small \u0394 14 C variability after the bomb peak in Guam is not well understood (Andrews et al., 2016) . However, the higher \u0394 face flow across the strait and surface circulation in the SCS are strongly dependent on the Asian monsoon system (e.g., Centurioni et al., 2004; G. Chen, Hu, et al., 2011; Hsin et al., 2012; Metzger & Hurlburt, 1996; Nan et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2004 Qu et al., , 2000 Tian et al., 2006; P.-X. Wang & Li, 2009; Wyrtki, 1961; Yang et al., 2010; . During winter, the prevailing northeast monsoon winds drive surface water flow westward across the strait. The general surface circulation within the SCS is also cyclonic during this period (Figure 1 ). During summer, the general surface circulation involves a cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation in the northern and southern SCS region, respectively (Figure 1 ).\nBetween the winter and summer monsoon systems, the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) has a greater impact on the westward flow across the strait and circulation within the SCS (Hsin et al., 2012) . To examine the monsoonal control on the circulation and \u0394 14 C variability between our sites and the SCS records, we similarly calculated the interannual \u0394 14 C difference between Houbihu \u0394 14 C and Con Dao, Hon Tre, and Currimao. Con Dao sits on a continental shelf in shallow waters and is mainly impacted by atmospheric \u0394 14 C processes (Mitsuguchi et al., 2007) . In contrast, Hon Tre and Currimao are monsoon-driven sites with seasonal upwelling and advection impacting \u0394 14 C. Southeast monsoon winds blow parallel to the Vietnam coast at Hon Tre driving summer upwelling at this site . \u0394 14 C in Currimao shows significant correspondence with the strength of the winter monsoon winds (Hirabayashi, Yokoyama, Suzuki, Miyairi, Aze, Siringan, & Maeda, 2017) , which drives upwelling and \u0394 14 C variability along the northwest coast of Luzon (Shaw et al., 1996) . Due to these site attributes, only the \u0394 14 C difference between Houbihu and Currimao shows a significant relationship with the EAWM winds (e.g., D'Arrigo et al., 2005) with a 1-year lag (r = 0.46, p = 0.02, n = 25, Figure 4b ). Because of westward intrusions across the strait and upwelling offshore of Currimao during stronger (positive) EAWM periods, the \u0394 14 C difference between Houbihu and Currimao is positive (i.e., Houbihu > Currimao). Conversely, the SCS outflow is more evident during weak EAWM periods, leading to a negative Houbihu-Currimao \u0394 14 C difference (i.e., Houbihu < Currimao). The slower currents within the strait and in the northern SCS region (i.e., maximum of 0.35 m/s; J. Hu et al., 2000; Nan et al., 2015) compared with the surrounding waters may explain the 1-year delay.\nAcross the strait, the interannual \u0394\nC difference between Houbihu and Palaui is significantly correlated with ENSO (e.g., Ni\u00f1o 3.4) with a 1-year lag (r = \u22120.46, p = 0.003, n = 41, Figure 4c ). The negative correlation indicates that large (small) \u0394 14 C differences (i.e., greater/lesser than~4\u2030) coincide with El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) years. The influence of ENSO to the \u0394 14 C difference between our sites may lie on the meridional pressure difference across the strait. SODA-derived sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, an indicator of pressure difference (See details in Figures 1 and S2 .), show a significant negative correlation with ENSO from 1970 to 2010 (r = \u22120.48, p = 0.007, n = 31, Figure 4c ). The negative relationship indicates that El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) years coincide with lower (higher) SSH anomalies. Since the mean SSH in the western Pacific is higher than that of the SCS (Figure 1) , a higher SSH across our sites must be due to the piling-up of water across the strait. During La Ni\u00f1a, the enhanced trade winds push more water toward the western Pacific, leading to higher SSHs in this region, indicating presence of the KI along the strait (Nan et al., 2013 (Nan et al., , 2015 and, thus, smaller \u0394 14 C differences between our Houbihu and Palaui sites. Conversely, due to the relaxed trade winds during El Ni\u00f1o, the western Pacific warm pool spreads toward the east, flattening the SSH in this region and increasing the \u0394 14 C difference between our sites. Other satellite altimetry studies along the strait have shown that SSH anomalies in conjunction with density stratification data are indicative of the presence or absence of the KI along the strait (e.g., DeCarlo et al., 2015) . However, whether the KI penetrates into the SCS based on the above \u0394 14 C differences remains ambiguous.\nOverall, basin-specific processes controlling the \u0394 14 C variability of the LS sites are evident from quantifying the \u0394 14 C difference between our sites and other \u0394 14 C records in the region. Palaui \u0394 14 C, relative to that of 10.1029/2018JC014735\nC values are the least constrained through time adding additional uncertainty.\nThe net lateral exchange rate, k Lat , is significantly correlated with ENSO (r = 0.42, p = 0.03, n = 29, Figure 6 ), indicating its influence in driving the transport variability across the strait. Higher (lower) k Lat generally coincides with El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) periods, highlighting ENSO's role in the meridional shifts of the NEC bifurcation latitude and subsequent transport across the LS. During El Ni\u00f1o, the northward position of the NEC bifurcation latitude leads to weaker Kuroshio and stronger intrusion across the strait (Figure 7) . The reverse is expected during La Ni\u00f1a conditions. However, in 1971 However, in -1972 However, in , 1974 However, in , 1977 However, in , 1984 However, in -1985 However, in , 1988 However, in , and 1996 1971, 1984-1985, 1988, and 1996 show higher k Lat values. The observed k Lat anomalies at beginning of the record may be impacted by the postbomb peak \u0394 14 C distribution that is not advection related as previously discussed.\nBecause the EAWM is shown to exert influence on the westward transport across the strait, we also compared these anomalous years with the EAWM index and found that the weaker (stronger) monsoon strength in 1972 (1984-1985, 1988, and 1996 ) may explain the above discrepancies. Weaker EAWM during an El Ni\u00f1o event may indicate the relative dominance of k SO to k KI in 1972. A stronger EAWM during a La Ni\u00f1a event, on the other hand, may enhance overall k Lat across the strait. However, the negative relationship between ENSO and EAWM is not consistent for each ENSO period such that not all weak (strong) EAWM coincides with El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) years (e.g., D'Arrigo et al., 2005) . The PDO may impact the ENSO-EAWM relationship (e.g., J.-W. Kim et al., 2014; L. Wang et al., 2008) and hence the lateral transport across the strait (e.g., Wu, 2013; Wu et al., 2016) . However, we do not find a significant relationship between ENSO and the EAWM at different PDO phases and between k Lat and PDO (p > 0.10). Due to the length of the record, the interdecadal modulation of the PDO may not be apparent. Nevertheless, the time-varying response of the EAWM to ENSO, regardless of the PDO phase, gives indication of the secondary control of the reversing monsoons over the lateral advection across the strait.\nC is lower compared to Palaui (Philippines). Both Houbihu and Palaui \u0394 14 C records show early bomb-produced spikes as a result of a nuclear fallout signal carried by the tropical Pacific western boundary currents. The early \u0394 14 C spikes at our sites and the WPO records indicate that circulation in the C difference between these sites shows a significant relationship with the EAWM, the main driver of the SCS general circulation and alternating flow patterns across the strait. While the ENSO-driven pressure difference between our sites offers support on the occurrence of KI across the strait, whether KI reaches the SCS remains unclear. In conjunction with other \u0394 14 C records in the region, we were able to calculate the changes in the lateral transport across the strait. The mean amount of water exchanged across the strait from after the postbomb peak is 2.2 Sv, ranging from \u221213.4 to 16 Sv, where a positive (negative) value indicates net flow into (out of) the SCS. By shifting the position of the NEC bifurcation latitude, ENSO plays a critical role on the interannual variability of water mass exchange across the LS and circulation and water mass renewal in the SCS.

Backgrounds were subtracted using measurements of 14 C-free, spar calcite. The 14 C measurements are reported as \u0394 values that are corrected for known age to 1950 (Stuiver & Polach, 1977) . Analytical precision is \u00b11.5\u2030 based on long-term analyses of a modern coral standard (CSTD) and duplicate measurements of samples. . The short and discontinuous seasonal \u0394 14 C records prevent us from statistically quantifying this relationship at this site. However, considering that the surface flow across the LS is far more complex than presented here, the observed general agreement between records provides indication that zonal flow influences Houbihu \u0394 14 C seasonality. In contrast, the timing of the Palaui seasonal \u0394 14 C maxima and minima was more variable with respect to the mean flow direction ( Figure 3 ). In addition, the Palaui \u0394 14 C record was on average~4\u2030 higher than the Houbihu record, which is greater than the propagated "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LS \u0394", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regional \u0394 14 C Variability", "text": "Compared with the WPO and SCS annual records (Figure 1 ), Houbihu prebomb \u0394 14 C values are lower than most other records in the region (i.e., \u221264.6 \u00b1 2.5\u2030, n = 8, 1\u03c3, Figure 2b ). In contrast, Palaui prebomb \u0394 14 C (\u221258.4 \u00b1 1.6\u2030, n = 12, 1\u03c3) is regionally comparable to Hon Tre, Vietnam (\u221257.1 \u00b1 3.7\u2030, n = 10, 1\u03c3, Bolton et al., 2016) , Ishigaki, Japan (\u221257.9 \u00b1 7.6\u2030, n = 18, 1\u03c3, Hirabayashi, Yokoyama, Suzuki, Miyairi, & Aze, 2017), Guam (\u221254.0 \u00b1 5.4\u2030, n = 18, 1\u03c3, Andrews et al., 2016) , and Palau (\u221254.9 \u00b1 2.4\u2030, n = 9, 1\u03c3, Glynn et al., 2013; Figure 2b C record in Ishigaki, but with a year lagged (Andrews et al., 2016; .

Houbihu \u0394 14 C shows an earlier rise and broader bomb peak than that of Palaui, but both records reached initial peak values in mid-1955, a year after the early bomb detonations. Langkai and Lombok \u0394 14 C records show the same initial rise in mid-1955 (Fallon & Guilderson, 2008; Guilderson et al., 2009) , within the same time period as our sites (\u00b11 to 2 months), which may highlight the similar transport times between the bomb-contaminated waters-the Pacific western boundary currents (i.e., NEC, KC, and MC) and the ITF and between the Pacific western boundary current and the KI. Moreover, the smaller \u0394 14 C peaks and the absence of other bomb-related peaks in the late 1950s in the ITF and our records suggest other water mass exchanges along these passageways.\nIn the 1960s, Houbihu \u0394 C differences between sites and its potential drivers will be further investigated in the following section."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Compared with Houbihu, higher \u0394 14 C values in Palaui may reflect the constant influence of water masses with a greater exposure to the atmosphere.

Figure 5 shows the schematic of the box model, which includes the atmosphere (A), surface boxes of the LS, KI which implicitly includes the influence of the KC, and SCS outflow (LS, KI, and SO) and the subsurface box of the thermocline (D). The inputs and data sources for each box are summarized in Table S1 in the supporting information. Pertinent calculations can also be found in a separate Microsoft Excel\u00ae spreadsheet (Table S2) in the supporting information.\nWith equal amounts lost in the LS box to conserve mass, the rate of change in the surface LS \u0394 14 C, dLS dt ;is affected by air-sea gas exchange A, vertical contribution from D and lateral advection with inputs from both the SO and the KI, such that\nwhere 0.983 is the isotopic fractionation factor describing the influx of CO 2 from the atmosphere to the sea surface (Broecker & Peng, 1982) . Box A is represented by the annual \u0394 C records from Hon Tre , Con Dao (Mitsuguchi et al., 2007) , and Currimao (Hirabayashi, Yokoyama, Suzuki, Miyairi, Aze, Siringan, & Maeda, 2017) , duly representing the SCS \u0394 14 C variability in the model. Unlike the other boxes, the subsurface data for D are temporally and spatially sparse with no direct measurements across the strait. Box D is assumed to have prebomb values (e.g., Ostlund & Stuiver, 1980; Lauvset et al., 2016; Olsen et al., 2016) . These surveys include transects covering the Northern Pacific gyre but only the westernmost transects (i.e., 15-35\u00b0N and 125-145\u00b0N) along the path of the Kuroshio are selected ( Figure S3 ). The data in between the available years were then linearly interpolated to construct an annual record of \u0394 14 C for D. This data assumption is supported by the advection of subsurface (i.e., 100 to 200 m) tropical waters from the Pacific into the SCS via the LS evidenced in the Hon Tre coral Pb/Ca signals (e.g., M. Chen et al., 2016) . The terms k \u22121 , k SO , k KI , and k D are the exchange rates between the boxes estimated with respect to the volume of the surface and subsurface boxes. The volume of the LS and D boxes is calculated using lengths delineating KI extension, from 123\u00b0E inward to 118\u00b0E, widths based on the locations of our coral sites, 18\u00b0N to 22\u00b0N, and depths where both vertical and lateral exchanges occur,~200 m (J.
