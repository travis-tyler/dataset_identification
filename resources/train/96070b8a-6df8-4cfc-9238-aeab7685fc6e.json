[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Dietary pattern (DP) analysis allows examination of the combined effects of nutrients and foods on the markers of CVD. Very few studies have examined these relationships during adolescence or young adulthood. Traditional CVD risk biomarkers were analysed in 12-15-yearolds (n 487; Young Hearts (YH)1) and again in the same individuals at 20-25 years of age (n 487; YH3). Based on 7 d diet histories, in the present study, DP analysis was performed using a posteriori principal component analysis for the YH3 cohort and the a priori Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated for both YH1 and YH3 cohorts. In the a posteriori DP analysis, YH3 participants adhering most closely to the 'healthy' DP were found to have lower pulse wave velocity (PWV) and homocysteine concentrations, the 'sweet tooth' DP were found to have increased LDL concentrations, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure and decreased HDL concentrations, the 'drinker/social' DP were found to have lower LDL and homocysteine concentrations, but exhibited a trend towards a higher TAG concentration, and finally the 'Western' DP were found to have elevated homocysteine and HDL concentrations. In the a priori dietary score analysis, YH3 participants adhering most closely to the Mediterranean diet were found to exhibit a trend towards a lower PWV. MDS did not track between YH1 and YH3, and nor was there a longitudinal relationship between the change in the MDS and the change in CVD risk biomarkers. In conclusion, cross-sectional analysis revealed that some associations between DP and CVD risk biomarkers were already evident in the young adult population, namely the association between the healthy DP (and the MDS) and PWV; however, no longitudinal associations were observed between these relatively short time periods."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "CVD is the main cause of death in the UK, accounting for nearly 200 000 deaths each year (1) . Conventionally, the focus of nutrition research has been on single nutrients and individual dietary components (2) ; however, recently, nutritional epidemiology has also begun investigations into the effect of overall diet quality, using various dietary pattern approaches, on diet-disease relationships (3) . It has been hypothesised that using a priori and a posteriori methods that encompass the whole diet may aid in the formulation of dietary recommendations, as overall dietary analysis may be easier to translate into public health messages (4,5 -7) .\nThere are two fundamentally different analytical approaches for measuring dietary patterns in epidemiological studies: 'a priori' and 'a posteriori'. A priori techniques evaluate dietary intake data using predefined indices or scoring systems (8) that have been constructed according to existing nutritional guidelines or are based on existing knowledge about diet-disease relationships (9) . Application of these a priori scores allows comparability across cohorts as the scoring is not driven by the specific population or dataset in hand (10) . There are now numerous a priori dietary scores, but one that is closely related to CVD is the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (11) .\nThe Mediterranean diet has long been reported to be associated with the attenuation of CVD risk factors, such as decreased total cholesterol, TAG, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI and C-reactive protein levels and increased HDL levels, in randomised intervention studies (12, 13) , prospective studies (7- year follow-up in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort) (14) and in case -control studies (15, 16) . Furthermore, adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern has been reported to be associated with lower CVD mortality in prospective studies with follow-up periods ranging from 3\u00b778 to 20 years (17 -21) , which has been confirmed in a meta-analysis of prospective studies (22) .\nA posteriori methods are dependent on multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is frequently used in nutritional epidemiology to gain a better understanding of the relationships between the foods consumed in the diet and health-related outcomes. It identifies foods that are frequently consumed together, reducing the data in hand into groups or patterns on the basis of the degree to which they are correlated with one another (23) . For each derived pattern, a score that defines the position of each individual along a gradient is obtained; hence, individuals receive a 'score' for each derived pattern (10) . PCA is, therefore, a data-driven approach; the preparation of data can be a time-consuming process, and as it relies on clear statistical guidance, it is limited to a research setting. Although PCA-derived dietary patterns are specific to the population from which they are derived, there is some commonality in the nature of the patterns observed between studies; for example, 'Western-type' and 'prudent-type' dietary patterns are often identified. In terms of CVD, prospective studies within adult populations have generally shown that a prudent/healthy dietary pattern is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (24 -26) , whereas a Western-type dietary pattern is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (5, 24, 27) . Data on the relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular risk in younger age groups are lacking. As cardiovascular risk factor status in young adulthood may be associated with coronary atherosclerosis later in life, it is important to determine whether a relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular health is apparent in younger age groups to inform public health strategies for CVD (28) .\nSome scientific research has stated that dietary intake patterns are established at an early age and remain relatively unchanged during pubertal development (29, 30) . On the other hand, it has been proposed by several investigators that significant changes in an individual's eating habits occur during the transition from childhood to adulthood (31 -35) , and such changes have been attributed to physiological changes in relation to growth and maturation as well as the increasing independence and interaction of adolescents within their social environment (36) , resulting in less desirable changes occurring between adolescence and young adulthood such as increased fast food consumption and binge drinking (37) . There is little information available regarding the tracking of dietary patterns during this time frame and whether tracking, or change in, dietary habits during this time has any impact on health status. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the crosssectional relationship between a posteriori dietary patterns and an a priori dietary score (MDS) and CVD risk biomarkers in a young adult population (Young Hearts (YH)3). Furthermore, it also aimed to examine whether there was a relationship between the change in the MDS and the change in CVD risk biomarkers between YH1 and YH3."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study sample", "text": "The YH Project was designed as an ongoing study investigating biological and behavioural risk factors for CVD in a representative sample of young people in Northern Ireland.

Between 1997 and 1999, these participants were invited back to take part in another screening phase (n 487, aged between 20 and 25 years), YH3. The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Queen's University Belfast.

The samples were immediately separated into plasma, serum and buffy coat before storage in aliquots at 2 708C until analysis. Sample analysis included quantification of plasma glucose and insulin (subsequent calculation of HOMA-IR), cholesterol fractions (total, HDL and LDL), TAG and homocysteine.

At YH1, smoking status was assessed by means of a recall questionnaire, and at YH3, the participants classified themselves as current cigarette smokers, non-smokers or former smokers. Those who smoked provided information on the number of cigarettes smoked per d. Social class was identified at YH1 using father's occupation and was divided into eight groups: group 1, 'Professional'; group 2, 'Management'; group 3, 'Skilled non-manual'; group 4, 'Skilled manual'; group 5, 'Semi-skilled'; group 6, 'Unskilled'; group 7, 'Other'; group 8, 'Student'. Physical activity (PA) was assessed in the YH3 cohort using a modification of the Baecke questionnaire, aimed at assessing habitual work activity, sports activity and non-sports leisure activities. For each of these three categories, a score based on a five-point Likert scale was calculated and summed, giving the total possible score ranging from 3 to 15 (33) . Arterial stiffness was measured in the YH3 cohort using the non-invasive optical method to determine pulse wave velocity (PWV), measured in ms, explained in detail elsewhere (40) .\nA posteriori dietary patterns -principal component analysis. The factor analysis procedure in SPSS version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc.) was used to perform the PCA. Over 1000 individual foods were identified from the diet histories and these foods were manually reduced to thirty-one food groups. Foods were categorised on the basis of food type and macronutrient content. PCA reduced the food groups into a smaller number of underlying factors or dietary patterns that could explain variations in dietary intake; the number of factors, or dietary patterns, retained was based on a combination of food group components with an eigenvalue . 1, examination of the break point in the scree plot and interpretability of the factors themselves (5) . Males and females were analysed together to maximise statistical power. Orthogonal rotation (varimax) was used to produce factors that were uncorrelated and more interpretable (43) . When presented, small coefficients were suppressed to absolute values $ 0\u00b72. PCA produced uncorrelated factors and a resulting 'factor score' for each participant for each of the four factors. Scores were categorised into fifths for each dietary pattern, with the fifth dietary pattern indicating greatest conformity with that particular dietary pattern.\nA priori Mediterranean Diet Score. The MDS was originally constructed by Trichopoulou et al. (44) and later revised to include fish (11) . The components that make up the MDS were split into beneficial (high intakes of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals and fish) and less desirable/beneficial (high intakes of meat and meat products and dairy products and ratio of MUFA:SFA) components. Alcohol consumption was also included (a value of 1 was assigned to men if their consumption was between 10 and 50 g/d and to women if their consumption was between 5 and 25 g/d). For all characteristics within the MDS, a cut-off point that corresponded to the median values specific to each sex was applied (except for alcohol as explained above), with a value of 1 being assigned to those above the median value for the beneficial components (0 assigned to those below) and a value of 1 being assigned to those below the median value for the less desirable/beneficial components (0 assigned to those above). A score for each of the 7 d was calculated and an average taken; a score of 9 indicated the strongest adherence to the Mediterranean diet, whereas a score of 0 indicated no adherence to the Mediterranean diet."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "All statistical analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 17.0; SPSS for Windows, SPSS, Inc.). For the cross-sectional analysis, fifths were used to categorise individuals for PCA-derived dietary patterns and thirds for the MDS. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations and categorical variables as absolute frequencies and percentages. When examining the general participant characteristics, continuous variables were compared using ANOVA in fifths or thirds groupings. Categorical data were examined using x 2 tests for trends. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between dietary patterns (in fifths or thirds) and CVD risk factors while adjusting for other potentially confounding variables. Data are presented for unadjusted and adjusted models controlling for common confounding factors identified from similar studies in the literature including the following: age; BMI; sex; PA; social class; smoking status; energy. As indicated by Northstone et al. (45) , energy was adjusted at as late a stage as possible to allow assessment of the true effects of energy on dietary patterns. Data for adjusted models (adjusted means and 95 % CI) are given in tables only where adjustment has influenced the corresponding P value.\nFor the longitudinal analysis, paired-samples t tests were used to summarise the sample characteristics. The MDS was split into 'most adherent' and 'least adherent' on the basis of the median and was then further categorised into four groups depending on scores at YH1 and YH3: group 1, 'least adherent MDS at YH1 and least adherent MDS at YH3'; group 2, 'least adherent MDS at YH1 and most adherent MDS at YH3'; group 3, 'most adherent MDS at YH1 and least adherent MDS at YH3'; group 4, 'most adherent MDS at YH1 and most adherent MDS at YH3'. Multivariable regression analysis was then performed to examine the relationship between these four groups and CVD risk biomarkers at YH3; different models of adjustments were applied: model 1 adjusted for age, sex, BMI, social class, PA, and smoking status and model 2 further adjusted for energy as per the method of Northstone et al. (45) . It has been reported that all measures of adiposity are highly correlated (46) ; therefore, in the present study, BMI was chosen as the sole measure of adiposity within the adjusted model because BMI has been indicated as the most commonly used measure of adiposity in national and international obesity prevalence statistics and is therefore useful for analysing historical trends and comparing international research results (47) . The change in CVD risk biomarkers (total cholesterol, HDL, SBP and DBP) between YH1 and YH3 was calculated and the four groups of change in the MDS were again assessed using multivariable regression analysis. At YH3, values for TAG and homocysteine concentrations were negatively skewed, and natural log transformation of the data did not affect the end interpretation; therefore, skewed data are presented to maintain continuity.\nFinally, the proportion of tracking for the MDS was assessed for males and females separately and together. The proportion of volunteers who remained in the same third for the a priori dietary score suggests tracking; however, 33 % of the volunteers would remain in the same third over time if one assumes that he or she could move randomly into any of the thirds at follow-up (48) . Weighted k values were then calculated to measure the agreement between an individual's relative position at YH1 and YH3 by considering disagreement close to the diagonal less heavily than disagreement further away from the diagonal (49) . It should be noted that k \u00bc 0 when the observed agreement equals that expected by chance and k \u00bc 1 when tracking is perfect (50) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Mean dietary, anthropometric and cardiovascular-related variables at YH1 and YH3 are given in Table 1 .

Long-term elevated PWV is directly related to the risk of developing CVD (52) . Little is known about the relationship between dietary intake as assessed by PCA-derived dietary patterns and arterial structure and function, as assessed by PWV, but some evidence is emerging relating dietary intake and arterial stiffness (53) . A systematic review supports the evidence that strong adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern in dietary interventions is associated with significant improvements in endothelial function (54) . The application of dietary indices such as the MDS to studies in younger populations is increasing, but has mostly been limited to examining relationships with anthropometric measures. However, in a recent study carried out in Greece (55) , adherence to the Mediterranean diet was found to be negatively correlated with arterial stiffness, independent of obesity, in 12-year-old children.\nThe role of homocysteine as an independent risk factor for CVD remains controversial; however, it has been proposed that it may be involved in both inflammatory and endothelial function pathways (56) and has been shown, in a preliminary study, to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in older people (57) . The inverse relationship between homocysteine and vitamin B intake and status is well established (58) , but its relationship with dietary patterns in general is less explored (4, 59) . In the present study, homocysteine was the biomarker that was found to be most often associated with the a posteriori dietary patterns (being associated with three out of the four PCA patterns), and these associations were generally in the expected directions. Similar relationships have been reported in studies in adult populations in the literature for broadly 'healthy' and 'Western/refined' dietary patterns (4,56,60 -62) . The present study, however, is one of the first studies to report that such relationships between dietary patterns and homocysteine are already evident in younger adults.\nIn relation to other prominent associations between CVD risk biomarkers and dietary patterns, lipids were also found to display some notable associations in the present study. The 'sweet tooth' dietary pattern was found to be associated with an adverse lipid profile (increased LDL concentrations and decreased HDL concentrations), and this has also been reported by Newby et al. (63) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and Eilat-Adar et al. (27) in Alaskan Eskimos (mean age 41\u00b77 years). This has not been reported previously in younger populations. This may be because the foods that loaded most highly within the 'sweet tooth' dietary pattern (namely puddings and chocolate) are high in fat, particularly saturated fat, as well as sugar, and therefore have the potential to alter plasma lipid concentrations. Again, similar to the findings reported herein, another study has reported that a Western dietary pattern is positively associated with HDL (4) . It has been proposed that the high total fat content associated with a Western dietary pattern may be responsible for increased HDL concentrations. Recent research has indicated that adverse lipid concentrations in young adulthood are associated with coronary atherosclerosis 20 years later and, therefore, Pletcher et al. (28) highlighted that more emphasis should be placed on the reduction of LDL concentrations and the elevation of HDL concentrations in younger age populations."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of dietary pattern approaches", "text": "There is limited scientific evidence directly comparing a priori and a posteriori approaches in terms of their association with health parameters or ability to predict chronic disease development. To our knowledge, nine studies (10,64 -71) to date, all conducted in adult populations, have examined both a priori and a posteriori dietary patterns. Among the cross-sectional and case -control studies (67, 69, 70) , one crosssectional study reported that the a priori method was superior at assessing sex hormone concentrations (67) compared with PCA-derived dietary patterns and both case -control studies reported similar results for both methods in relation to colorectal cancer risk (69) and classification of acute coronary syndrome and stroke outcomes (70) . Of the six prospective studies comparing a priori dietary scores with a posteriori dietary patterns, three indicated that both methods had a similar ability to predict disease development or mortality (10, 66, 68) , one study indicated that the a posteriori method was superior at assessing all-cause and CV mortality (64) , one study found that the a priori MDS was associated with stroke risk, but no associations were evident for a posteriori dietary patterns (71) , and one study found that neither a priori MDS nor a posteriori dietary patterns were associated with the risk of hypertension (65) . In the present study, more relationships with CVD risk biomarkers were evident for the PCA-derived dietary patterns than for the MDS. However, the examination of the relationship between the MDS and cardiovascular risk factors was limited by the range of MDS achieved in this Northern European cohort (only reaching a maximum of 6 points out of 9 points on the MDS scale). Thus, a posteriori methods may be advantageous in some situations. A priori and a posteriori approaches are, by their definitions, designed to answer different questions: a posteriori analysis investigates what is accounting for the variation in intakes and how well these variances are related to risk, whereas a priori index-based dietary analysis investigates whether or not variation from a predefined diet is related to risk (10) . Thus, the value of using both approaches in tandem in epidemiological research warrants further consideration as application of both may yield a more complete picture of the complex relationship between dietary exposure and disease status."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal relationship between the Mediterranean Diet Score and CVD", "text": "It has been proposed that diet and lifestyle in childhood and adolescence may have a lifelong impact on the risk of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, certain cancers and CVD (72) . Longitudinal studies investigating the stability of whole dietary intake and subsequent effect, if any, on CVD risk biomarkers are well placed to enhance understanding of this issue and, so, to aid public health planning and priority setting in relation to diet and health. There is controversy within the current literature about the extent to which dietary intake tracks from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood. There are a number of studies that have reported that tracking of dietary intake exists. However, it must be noted that methods of tracking, including the follow-up time and analysis, have been inconsistent within the studies. The majority of the positive literature has focused on the assessment of dietary intake tracking between adolescence and adulthood over an average of 20\u00b76 years (30,73 -76) and between childhood and adolescence, with an average follow-up period of 6\u00b75 years (29, 36, 77, 78) .\nResearch has also been conducted between adolescence and young adulthood, similar to the age groups in the present study. A study conducted by Patterson et al. (77) reported evidence of slight dietary intake tracking for food groups and micro-and macronutrients over a 6-year period. The data used were obtained from the European Youth Hearts Study (EYHS I and EYHS II), which was similar to the present study in terms of participants' age and follow-up period. However, it was clear that many of the participants of the EYHS I and EYHS II did not remain in the same third of dietary intake, and therefore their behaviours in both childhood and adolescence were potentially modifiable (77) ; this is in agreement with the observation made in the present study that the YH participants did not remain within the same third of dietary intake from YH1 to YH3 for the MDS. The longitudinal analysis focused on the MDS at YH1 and YH3 and the longitudinal relationship between diet and CVD risk biomarkers. The MDS decreased significantly between the two time points (for males and females and the cohort as a whole); that is, the participants did not maintain their ranking.\nLongitudinal assessment of dietary intake between the two time points did not, in general, indicate an association between the change in a priori dietary score and the change in CVD risk biomarkers at YH3 or the change in risk biomarkers between adolescence and young adulthood. Not all such longitudinal studies have, however, provided evidence of tracking. Studies reporting considerable changes in eating behaviour between childhood and adolescence have attributed these to physiological changes as well as increasing independence and peer influence (36) . There are a number of studies that support the findings from the present study that dietary intake is not stable. Previous research on the YH cohorts has indicated changes in micro-and macronutrient intakes between adolescence and young adulthood (33 -35) . Bertheke Post et al. (73) also indicated that dietary intake was not stable during adolescence as defined by groups of foods and nutrients even though their longterm investigations from childhood to adulthood and their reports on micro-and macronutrient intakes indicated lowto-moderate tracking.\nIn summary, the present study does not, in general, indicate tracking of the MDS or a longitudinal relationship between the MDS and CVD risk factors. Although it would have been encouraging in some respects to have found tracking of dietary intake between adolescence and young adulthood, it is perhaps not surprising that this was not the case. Many significant life changes that could affect dietary intake take place in the decade between adolescence and young adulthood. Most notably, alongside the major physical changes that occur, increased independence and autonomy will have a significant impact on food choice (79) . The idea that dietary patterns may track from childhood/adolescence to adulthood, omitting the transitional period when dietary patterns may be particularly erratic, has not been fully investigated. It is possible that although adolescence and young adulthood are periods of substantial change, individuals may eventually revert back, later in adulthood, to dietary patterns learnt at a younger age. This idea has been insinuated by Bertheke Post et al. (73) , who reported that although there was moderate stability over time (between 13 and 33 years), dietary intake was changeable and open to influence during the late adolescence/ young adulthood phase. It was somewhat unexpected that changes in diet, i.e. those whose diet effectively worsened between the two time points, were not correlated with changes in cardiovascular risk biomarkers over time. There are some potential explanations for this: the typical CVD risk biomarkers assessed may not have developed into clinically significant values by such a young age in life and the stability of total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol from adolescence to adulthood may be low (80, 81) . Also a period of 10 years, commencing at the early life stages, may well be too short to examine changes in cardiovascular risk biomarkers given the slow evolution of atherosclerosis."}, {"section_title": "Strengths/limitations", "text": "As with all studies, there are a number of limitations that must be recognised. The PCA has limitations associated with its execution, which have been discussed by others (82 -85) . What is encouraging is that the dietary patterns that have been identified in the present study (drinker/social, healthy, Western and sweet tooth) have also been identified by others and appear to be reasonably reproducible among different populations (86) . Another factor to consider is that knowledge regarding the validity of dietary assessment techniques in producing PCA-derived dietary patterns is limited. Dietary pattern analysis has mainly relied on FFQ as the original data source, and Hu et al. (83) have reported that FFQ are valid tools for dietary intake assessment in terms of the reproducibility of dietary patterns. In the present study, diet history information was used for the dietary pattern analysis, as done previously by Slattery et al. (87) . Although the diet history method is robust and well respected in nutritional epidemiology, it has been infrequently used in dietary pattern analysis. This method is also subjective and, therefore, may be particularly vulnerable to exaggeration of perceived 'healthy' foods and underestimation of perceived 'unhealthy' foods. The inclusion of over-and under-reports may have had an impact on the results presented, for example, precluding the detection of significant associations if some foods were systematically under-reported and therefore not represented within the dietary patterns. However, it must be noted that the reproducibility of the diet history method has been investigated and confirmed by van Staveren et al. (88) . Longitudinal studies of dietary intake are also subject to changes in food availability, food consumption patterns and food promotion (89) ; such changes are impossible to predict or calculate. The assessment of dietary intake using the MDS may also introduce error into these investigations. Median cut-offs were applied in the assessment of dietary intake using the MDS and therefore an element of a posteriori assessment was introduced. The study population was from Northern Europe, which may explain why the full spread of the MDS was not obtained for the young adult participants at YH3; however, the full spread was achieved for the adolescent participants at YH1 possibly due to parental influence. The YH1 cohort was a 2 % representative sample of the whole of Northern Ireland (age specific), and although the follow-up at YH3 was only about a 50 % response rate, the characteristics of those who responded at YH3 did not differ markedly from those who did not respond. The strengths of the present study include the wealth of information collected at both time points, which enabled the adjustment for a large number of confounding variables, giving even more strength to the results. However, it must be noted that non-fasting blood samples were obtained at YH1 and fasting blood samples were obtained at YH3. However, previous research has indicated that there are no clinically significant differences between fasting and non-fasting lipid measurements (90) . All other data collection methodologies were standardised between the two time points to allow for accurate comparison and conclusions to be drawn. It must also be recognised that investigations that involve two time points are by default linear, and it is therefore impossible to determine the form of potential change over time (91) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Dietary pattern analysis, using a posteriori and a priori techniques, revealed that some associations with CVD risk biomarkers observed in older populations were already evident in the young adult population. One new observation in the young adult population was an inverse association between a PCA-derived healthy dietary pattern and PWV. A longitudinal association between a priori dietary score and CVD risk biomarkers was not evident in this sample, and nor was there evidence of tracking of the MDS between adolescence and young adulthood. Given the natural evolution of atherosclerosis, longer-term follow-up may be required to fully explore and reveal any such associations. Even though the MDS did not track strongly between these two life stages in this sample, the associations between dietary patterns and CVD risk biomarkers that were evident in young adulthood indicate that it is still prudent to try to encourage good dietary habits early in life to maximise chances of maintaining as healthy a diet as possible throughout life."}]
