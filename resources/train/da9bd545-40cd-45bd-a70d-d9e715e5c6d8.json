[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "With increasing numbers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias across the globe, many countries have developed national plans to deal with the resulting challenges. In the United States, the National Alzheimer's Project Act, signed into law in 2011, required the creation of such a plan with annual updates thereafter. Pursuant to this, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease in 2012, including an ambitious research goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To guide investments, activities, and the measurement of progress toward achieving this 2025 goal, in its first annual plan update (2013) HHS also incorporated into the plan a set of short, medium and long-term milestones. HHS further committed to updating these milestones on an ongoing basis to account for progress and setbacks, and emerging opportunities and obstacles. To assist HHS as it updates these milestones, the Alzheimer's Association convened a National Plan Milestone Workgroup consisting of scientific experts representing all areas of Alzheimer's and dementia research. The workgroup evaluated each milestone and made recommendations to ensure that they collectively constitute an adequate work plan for reaching the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025. This report presents these Workgroup recommendations."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Although significant advances have been made over the past 30 years in understanding the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders, a worldwide public health crisis continues to grow due to the aging of the world's population and the lack of effective interventions. In the United States, more than five million people currently live with Alzheimer's, including one in nine people greater than the age of 65 years [1] . The number of Americans with AD is expected to increase dramatically as the baby boom generation ages.\nThe cost of this crisis, both personal and societal, is enormous. In 2014, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to pay $150 billion for the health care and long-term care of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias [1] . During the same period, out-of-pocket expenses are expected to reach $36 billion. The total health and long-term care costs across all payers for seniors with Alzheimer's and other dementias ($46,669 annually) are more than three times greater than for other seniors. In addition, more than 15 million Americans provide 17.7 billion hours of unpaid care giving for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, work that is valued at $220 billion [1] . Of course, Alzheimer's is ultimately a fatal disease. In 2014, an estimated 700,000 Americans will die with Alzheimer's [2] . The magnitude of this growing crisis demands a commensurate response.\nMany countries, and international organizations, have developed national plans and analytical reports to address the problem [3] [4] [5] . In the United States, the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) was signed into law in 2011, calling for the development of a comprehensive plan to fight AD. This plan, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (henceforth called \"the National Plan\"), was developed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with input from experts in aging and dementia and presented in May 2012 at the Alzheimer's Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention [6] . The National Plan outlined a set of initiatives to provide improved tools for clinicians, assist caregivers, and individuals with dementia, raise public awareness about the disease, and critically, to advance research. It also set an aggressive research goal to \"Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025.\" To achieve this goal, the following strategies were set:\nIdentify research priorities and milestones; Expand research aimed at preventing and treating AD; Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of AD; Coordinate research with international public and private entities; Facilitate the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. Table 1 Current milestones and their associated success criteria and timelines, as published by HHS and last updated in summer 2013 (available at: http://aspe.hhs.gov/ daltcp/napa/milestones/milestones-p.pdf), along with the new milestones and changes to existing milestones recommended by the expert workgroup"}, {"section_title": "Milestone", "text": "Success criteria/timeline Suggested changes/notes A: Convene an advisory meeting of experts from the pharmaceutical industry, government, academia, the FDA, and the nonprofit sector to advance rational drug repositioning and combination therapy based on translational bioinformatics and network pharmacology approaches and to explore opportunities for new public-private partnerships to facilitate drug rescue/repurposing and combination therapy.\n(1) Development of recommendations for rational repositioning and combination therapy development, (2) Development, negotiation, and implementation of appropriate agreements among the stakeholders involved in repositioning and combination therapy of drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Supplementing the work of the Council, the Alzheimer's Association established an expert workgroup to provide an independent and comprehensive analytical report on progress in the research arena and craft a scientific agenda to inform the Council's recommendations. In August, 2012, the workgroup published a goal-directed, 10-year scientific agenda intended to aid in the implementation of the National Plan [7] .\nNotably, neither NAPA nor the National Plan mandate the appropriation of funds to achieve the stated goals. To address the funding required to ensure the success of the research plan, the Alzheimer's Accountability Act of 2014 was introduced in Congress on April 1, 2014, and would require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to submit an annual budget to the President and to Congress stipulating the funds that are needed to achieve the research goal of the National Plan.\nIn June 2014, the Alzheimer's Association convened an expert workgroup (the Alzheimer's Association National Plan Milestone Workgroup) to re-evaluate the milestones set forth in the National Plan, determine whether the field is on track to achieve these milestones, recommend changes in the parameters of the milestones, identify unaddressed gaps, and recommend additional milestones to fill these gaps. The workgroup consisted of world-renowned experts in AD research and policy. This report from the expert workgroup should inform HHS and Congress in making decisions about the activities and resources that are needed now to achieve the National Plan research goal of preventing and effectively treating AD by 2025, which is a scant decade away.\nThe premise of this report is that despite significant challenges associated with AD research, the scientific community remains more optimistic than ever about the potential success of a focused National Plan, if the appropriate milestones are established and if the appropriate resources are dedicated to carry out the strategies set forth therein. Many prominent investigators believe the prospect of delaying the onset of disabling symptoms within a decade is an attainable goal, provided we can surmount several scientific, administrative, and most importantly, financial impediments. Although the scientific community and the National Plan agree that major changes are needed in areas such as novel conceptual models of the disease, and new strategies for addressing scientific, administrative, regulatory, and infrastructural obstacles, the fact remains that overcoming these challenges will require a substantial financial investment. Inadequate funding remains the single most important impediment to progress in achieving the research goal of the National Plan. Table 1 summarizes the key milestones proposed by the Advisory Council, their success criteria, and the projected time frame for achieving each milestone. It also includes the revisions recommended by the expert workgroup, both to existing milestones and suggested new milestones. The existing milestones have been assigned identifiers (A, B, C, etc.) for the ease of reference in this document."}, {"section_title": "Targets, interventions, and biomarkers", "text": "Milestones A through Z address issues related to drug development for both currently known and new targets, repurposing and combination therapy, nonpharmacologic interventions, and biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Development of targets and interventions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Drug development: Repurposing and combinations", "text": "Milestones A through D focus on two aspects of therapy development: repurposing existing drugs for new indications, and combining two or more agents to achieve additive or synergistic effects. Both of these approaches have been used successfully to treat other disease indications but have not been applied extensively to neurological disorders.\nThe potential advantages of repurposing (also called repositioning) drugs for the treatment of AD include the availability of existing preclinical data on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of compounds. For drugs that are on the market, issues related to formulation and manufacturing may also have been solved, and extensive clinical data may be available [8] . Through a systematic review of published literature and a Delphi-type consensus process with industry experts, Corbett et al. [8] identified and prioritized several classes of drugs that might be considered in repurposing studies for Alzheimer's, and the gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.\nA major roadblock to repurposing is that there may be little or no incentive for pharmaceutical companies to devote resources to drugs for which patent life has expired. The NIH has stepped into this breach through the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and through the work of the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), the newest institute of the NIH. NCATS has begun to inventory, in a systematic manner, data on compounds that have been approved by international regulatory agencies or registered for clinical trials [9] .\nWith regard to combination therapy, several recent global initiatives have suggested including drug combinations as arms in future adaptive trial designs, and at least one combination trial-combining a beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor with an anti-amyloid antibody-has been reported [10] . In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has signaled its interest in considering combination therapy through the issuance of a guidance on codevelopment [11, 12] . However, combination therapy faces numerous roadblocks, including the lack of a clear scientific rationale for combining certain therapies, the need for appropriate biomarkers to assess treatment effects, new trial designs, and the need for increased collaboration among industry partners. It should be noted that substantial basic science resources will need to be committed in order to understand the complex dynamics of targeting multiple molecular pathways, and how biomarkers may respond to combination therapies.\nThus, the steps outlined in Milestone A have not yet been successfully completed, and the expert workgroup recommends that more effort is needed to address industry concerns about intellectual property. The expert workgroup further calls for the expansion of Milestone B, noting that the field may not yet be ready for translational efforts given the insufficient understanding of the basic science underlying combination therapy. In addition, increased representation from industry is needed for the successful implementation of both Milestones A and B. Given that Milestones C and D are contingent on the work addressed in A and B, the expert workgroup notes that it is too soon to address conducting Phase II and III trials of combination therapies."}, {"section_title": "Recommended modifications to existing milestones:", "text": "In Milestone A, extend the time frame and scope of the advisory committee, and expand representation of industry scientists. Expand Milestone B to include research on the basic science underlying combination therapy.\nRevise wording of Milestone M to include not only cognitive and behavioral symptoms, but also functional and psychological symptoms of AD; and to develop best practices across the continuum of the disease, in different settings, and in the presence of comorbid conditions. Revise wording of Milestone N to include a range of treatment targets (medical, psychosocial, behavioral, environmental, and caregiver training) for the behavioral, psychological, cognitive, and functional symptoms of AD.\nRevise Milestone O to include clinical research and biomarker studies in the integrated interdisciplinary research programs; and in the goals of the research, add developing a theoretical rationale for mechanisms by which interventions impact brain health and the course of disease. Revise Milestones P and Q to include biomarker studies in clinical trials. Revise Milestone R to read: Review results of past and existing grants to develop technologies with therapeutic/preventive potential (e.g., technologies used for cognitive training, promoting or supporting physical activity interventions, or to be used as part of a reminiscence, art, or music therapy program). Assess areas where technologies have been adopted, where there are promising results that should be followed up, and where there are remaining needs.\nRevise Milestone W to reflect that the biomarkers should not only be minimally invasive but also portable and inexpensive (e.g., blood-based or electrophysiological) to enable large studies in diverse populations. In Milestone X, expand the success criteria to call for identifying at least 5 (rather than 3) peripheral bloodbased biomarkers that correlate with central (imaging or CSF) biomarkers because 3 may be insufficient to detect not only cerebral amyloidosis, but also neurodegeneration, inflammation, and other pathologies. Split or expand Milestone Y and associated success criteria to differentiate neuropsychological assessment measures used for trial screening/enrichment vs. those used to assess treatment response.\nCombine Milestones AI and AJ to achieve standardization of clinical trial outcome measures to facilitate comparisons across trials and thereby increase the efficiency and success of trials by (1) establishing a forum for open sharing of data, procedures, and analysis of outcome measures; (2) initiating validation studies across different stages of disease (preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, dementia) that incorporate a variety of outcome measures, with agreement to share data and data analyses; and (3) developing the infrastructure to incorporate selected outcome measures into therapeutic trials."}, {"section_title": "Drug development: Currently known targets", "text": "Milestones E and F concern the development of drugs against currently known targets. Milestone E calls for initiation of three to six Phase II drug trials against currently known targets, at least two of which should be in asymptomatic subjects. Although a number of Phase II trials have already been completed, most of them have targeted amyloid, and much more needs to be done to test nonamyloid therapeutic targets, including tau, inflammation, nicotinic agonist receptors, and others. Moreover, given the high attrition rate in Phase II trials to date [13] , to achieve the success criteria (i.e., completion of three to six Phase II trials, \"providing conclusive evidence of therapeutic mechanism/target engagement\") perhaps 12 or more trials will need to be initiated. The milestone also calls for trials of agents against three to six therapeutic targets, so these trials will need to involve targets beyond amyloid. Finally, because of the difficulty of conducting Phase II trials in asymptomatic subjects, it is more likely that studies to confirm proof of mechanism and/or evidence of target engagement would be embedded into Phase III trials that could be counted as registration trials by the FDA. Such trials might use an adaptive design whereby a biomarker of drug effect is included for adjusting dose and/or declaring futility. , and the TOMMORROW study). The TOM-MORROW study is testing pioglitazone, whereas the three others target amyloid. All include extensive biomarker and cognitive testing and the collection of biospecimens. The expert workgroup noted that these trials have been made possible only through partnerships bringing together resources from both public and private arenas.\nDrugs against several targets beyond amyloid have been explored as symptomatic therapies, including muscarinic and other cholinergic agonists and serotonin receptor ligands. Although the focus of many ongoing Alzheimer's trials is on disease modification, symptomatic approaches may provide substantial benefits to people with AD, including maintaining function, staying active, and remaining at home longer as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical trials of symptomatic therapies can be completed in less time and with fewer subjects, thus potentially expediting the development and approval of new therapies.\nRecommended modifications to existing milestones:\nRevise Milestone E to reflect the large number of Phase II drug trials that will need to be initiated to achieve completion of three to six trials against different therapeutic targets that show evidence of therapeutic mechanism/target engagement.\nIn Milestone E, delete the requirement that at least two trials will be for targets involved in asymptomatic disease. Revise Milestone F to reflect the large number of Phase III trials that will need to be initiated to achieve three successful trials. Revise Milestone F to indicate that at least one trial should be of a symptomatic therapy."}, {"section_title": "Drug development: Novel targets", "text": "Milestones G through L focus on developing novel targets into effective treatments. G and H together aim to identify genetic markers and pathways that may represent therapeutic targets by establishing and analyzing data in an open access research database containing multidomain information (clinical, biomarker, epidemiological, genetic), and developing a broad, large-scale sequencing project to identify risk and protective gene variants in late onset AD (LOAD). Progress has been made in both of these efforts. For example, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project used data from four consortia in the United States and Europe to conduct a meta-analysis of the genotypes of over 74,000 individuals, which led to the identification of 11 Alzheimer's susceptibility loci [14] . In addition, the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) was created in 2013 as a federated, cloud-enabled infrastructure to bring multiple data sets together and provide researchers with access to both data and analytical and computational tools [15] . However, there remain challenges to accessing and using this information. Moreover, the expert workgroup suggested expanding the databases beyond genetic studies and the goal beyond the identification of gene variants. Also needed is a uniform protocol for collecting, storing, and providing open access to biospecimens for use in genetics, proteomics, and other biomarker studies. In addition, the success criteria should be expanded from \"at least one novel target. identified\" to at least a dozen novel targets or pathways.\nThe expert workgroup supported the overall goals of Milestones I through L, but commented that history shows that only about 13% of new molecular entities (NMEs) make it from the preclinical stage to Phase III trials [16] . This suggests that to achieve the success criteria of Milestone L (\"comprehensive success/failure analysis of data from at least three Phase III trials\"), approximately 23 NMEs would need to be identified, characterized, and validated in Milestone I, which currently calls for only six novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, because novel targets need to be identified across many pathways and mechanisms-e.g., reducing amyloid, reducing inflammation-a much larger number of NMEs, 60, should be identified in Milestone I. Thus, the expert workgroup recommends that the numbers and projected costs in I, J, K, and L be adjusted to more accurately reflect the reality of drug development.\nThe expert workgroup also noted the need to dramatically increase the efficiency of Phase II and III trials to change the risk profile for drug development and spur investment. Although some of these efficiencies are addressed in other milestones-for example, implementing a National Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Milestone AH), and convening advisory meetings and working groups to address some of the barriers to drug development (Milestones AD and AE)-more activity and resources are needed in this area. Additional milestones are also recommended for developing precompetitive consortia to de-risk the early stages of drug development (see section 5.3).\nRecommended modifications to existing milestones:\nIn Milestone G, expand the analysis of data beyond identifying genomic regions (to include, for example, epigenetic data), and expand the success criteria to 12 rather than one novel target identified. In Milestone I, expand the number of novel therapeutic targets to be identified, characterized, and validated to 60 NMEs covering six new classes of targets (e.g., inflammation, tau).\nSimilarly expand the number of therapeutic agents developed in Milestone J to 30; and the number of these agents advanced to Phase II trials in K to more realistic numbers (at least 12) needed to achieve Milestone L. In Milestone L, ensure that at least one of the agents tested in a Phase III study is for a symptomatic indication."}, {"section_title": "Recommended new milestones:", "text": "Develop a uniform protocol for collecting, storing, and providing open access to biospecimens for use in genetics, proteomics, and other biomarker studies.\nEnlist an unbiased, independent, nonprofit entity to conduct an annual review of clinical trial efficiencies.

This model and supporting data provide not only clues about the mechanisms underlying the disease, including amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, but potential therapeutic targets as well. Yet, they also point to the need for the discovery of new biomarkers of other pathophysiologic processes involved across the trajectory of the disease, and less intrusive and expensive biomarkers.\nMilestones addressing these concerns focus on developing, testing, validating, and standardizing novel imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood-based biomarkers to assess disease burden and demonstrate target engagement; and incorporating these biomarkers into Phase II (proof of concept) and Phase III (pivotal) drug trials for study subject enrichment and/or proof of target engagement. The milestones also call for studies linking peripheral and central biomarkers, the development and testing of minimally invasive biomarkers for use in clinical studies, and the development and validation of sensitive neuropsychological assessment measures that can track early clinical manifestations of AD. Some success has been achieved under the existing milestones. Amyloid beta (Ab) ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging are well developed-three (florbetapir, florbetaben, and flutemetamol) have been approved by the FDA and at least one other is in latestage development [19] . The approved ligands are currently included in clinical trials, although none are yet common in clinical use. Tau ligands are also being developed for PET imaging [20] . Other imaging, biochemical, and genetic biomarkers are also widely used in research and clinical studies [21] , and many novel biomarkers are in development. Standardization has also been addressed, not only in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), but through the Alzheimer's Associations' Global Biomarkers Standardization Consortium for Cerebrospinal Fluid [22] , the Hippocampal Harmonization Project [23] , and the Centiloid Project to standardize amyloid imaging measures [24, 25] .\nThe expert workgroup supports the milestones that call for development of (1) a validated tau ligand, (2) CSF biomarkers beyond existing Ab and tau biomarkers, (3) bloodbased biomarkers directly associated with both amyloid and tau pathology, and (4) a biomarker of synaptic dysfunction (Milestones T, U, and V). However, given that these new biomarker milestones must be realized in parallel with new target identification and drug development (see section 2.1.3-Milestones I, J, K, and L), achieving these milestones in an efficient, step-wise manner introduces complexities related to the sharing of data, resources, and knowledge; apportioning responsibility for funding the various steps; and commercializing biomarker tests. For example, once a new target is identified, preclinical studies will be needed to establish proof of mechanism before identification of PET tracers or other biomarkers. Subsequently, these biomarkers will need to be incorporated into Phase II trials to prove mechanism and demonstrate target engagement. The cost of development before a Phase II study will thus require incentives for commercialization and/or a degree of collaboration that has to this point been difficult to bring about.\nThe expert workgroup endorses the milestones (W and X) that call for developing minimally invasive biomarkers for detection of AD pathophysiology in community-based studies and linking these to central imaging and CSF biomarkers, with two modifications and one addition (see later).\nWith regard to developing and validating neuropsychological assessment measures for use in early Alzheimer's (Milestone Y), there has been substantial initial activity in this area because the Milestones were written. The investigators from major new prospective secondary prevention trials (DIAN, API, and A4) have come together under the Collaboration for Alzheimer's Prevention (CAP) to identify common neuropsychological domains and tests to include so that results can be shared and compared across studies. These investigators are also working together to choose instrumentation, on the basis of literature published over the last 5 to 10 years, which identifies cognitive domains affected in early stages of disease. Some of these measures are also being incorporated into other studies, including ADNI. However, these studies are just beginning, and it is as yet unknown whether the neuropsychological measures chosen will prove effective. Moreover, these markers will need to be validated both as screening/enrichment measures and as outcome assessments to demonstrate a treatment response.\nAdditional work is also needed to develop novel measures that will be sensitive and informative in presymptomatic Alzheimer's. Because research suggests that subtle cognitive changes may be detectable as changes in performance on everyday tasks, the expert workgroup recommends further studies to develop and validate measures of cognition based on noninvasive everyday measures that take advantage of new technologies for home monitoring, personal monitoring via smart phones, etc.\nIdentification and development of novel biomarkers, particularly for synaptic dysfunction and for minimally invasive markers, is likely to require significant additional efforts and resources in basic science and preclinical research. This will be particularly important with regards to finding novel biomarkers that reflect the earliest changes in the disease process, and biomarkers that do not necessarily correlate with existing biomarkers during disease progression and treatment."}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure and research resources", "text": "Milestones AA through AJ are directed toward addressing a critical lack of sufficient research infrastructure and resources to meet the research goal of the National Plan.

Risk and protective factors for dementia and Alzheimer's identified in these studies include genetic, vascular, psychosocial, dietary, and other lifestyle factors [27] . Thus, these studies inform public health policies, prevention strategies, and the design of intervention trials. The utility and importance of epidemiologic studies have been confirmed with the recent success reported by an early analysis of the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) multidomain prevention trial [28] . All the factors used as part of the intervention in this trial-diet, physical exercise, cognitive training, social activities, and control of vascular risk factors-were identified through epidemiologic studies. However, more resources must be committed to epidemiological infrastructure and studies to fully harness the power of this methodology.\nMilestones AA and AB call for convening an expert panel to recommend best practices in the use of existing epidemiology of dementia databases to individualize treatments in Alzheimer's clinical trials; the expansion of existing cohorts to include subjects in mid-life; and the use of data generated from these expanded cohorts in the design of treatment and prevention trials.\nThe expert workgroup called first for a reframing of these milestones to focus more broadly on prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia across the entire lifespan. Although advances have been made in identifying modifiable risk factors that influence cognition, there remains a need to determine which targets make most sense for prevention studies and the appropriate time across the life course when prevention studies should be initiated. The workgroup thus recommends that the work of the expert panel called for in these milestones be expanded both in time and scope to address these knowledge gaps and better inform future studies. In addition the workgroup recommends building upon existing cohort studies and/or initiating new cohort studies with broader research goals. These studies should be attentive to changing demographics and ethnic and racial shifts in the population, and should have harmonized data collection methods.\nThe expert workgroup further recommends the initiation of a large, multidomain prevention trial focused on modifiable risk factors in the United States to replicate the results of the FINGER trial in a larger, more diverse population.\nRecommended modifications to existing milestones:\nIn Milestone AA, extend the time frame of the expert panel and expand the scope of the panel's work to include determination of best targets for prevention and the time in the lifespan when prevention trials make the most sense. Modify the focus more broadly on prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia rather than the more specific clinical trials for AD.

While progress has been made in achieving some of these milestones, additional steps are needed to accelerate progress.\nMilestone AC calls for developing a common Alzheimer's research ontology, unified classification system, and publicly available database of the research portfolios of international Alzheimer's funding agencies. Beginning in 2010, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Alzheimer's Association began developing CA-DRO, a Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology [29] , followed by an International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio (IADRP) [30] , which currently captures information from 15 organizations.

The process led to the launching of the AD network analysis group, which has been incorporated into the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP; see section 5.3).

A model for a Comprehensive ADC (CADC) at the University of Pennsylvania was proposed in 2010 [34] . Other ADCs also have many of the components in place to make a smooth transition to a CADC.\nThe expert workgroup recommends facilitating the call for an expedited review of translational Alzheimer's research applications by having a nonfederal, independent organization oversee the development and implementation of this policy.

A small workgroup, with representation from private foundations, academia, and the Alzheimer's Association, has been working on a viable plan for the preceding two years, but thus far has received only limited financial support commitments (from the Alzheimer's Association and the National Research Council of Canada). Once established, the NIRB-ND will be financially self-sufficient.

Recruiting and retaining study participants in Alzheimer's clinical trials has proved challenging and a major hindrance to the successful completion of trials [37] . Many factors contribute to sluggish recruitment, including lack of awareness on the part of both participants [38] and primary care physicians [39] , stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, and logistical issues that place unacceptable burden on patients and caregivers. Recruitment of participants from underrepresented populations has proven particularly difficult, despite the fact that studies report higher Alzheimer's risk among both African-Americans and Hispanics [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . However, African-Americans are less likely to report cognitive and functional problems in older family members until the impairments become severe [41] . This highlights the need for culturally sensitive educational programs that emphasize the differences between normal and pathological cognitive aging, and the value of research focusing on the benefits to both the individual and the whole community now and in the future [45, 46] .\nMilestones addressing these concerns focus on providing a central resource on best practices for recruitment and retention, increasing awareness of and access to large scale Alzheimer's-related registries and cohorts, and increasing the enrollment of participants from underrepresented populations in clinical trials.\nCreation of a central resource for best practices in recruitment and retention has been discussed by many groups including the NIA, Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), and ADNI; however, there is currently no consensus on best practices.\nRecently, the US federal government has launched a cross-agency effort to educate older adults and encourage their participation in clinical trials. The program-named ROAR for Recruiting Older Adults into Research-involves the efforts of NIA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Administration for Community Living. After seeking input from a broad range of partners, the ROAR group has developed educational and recruitment materials to be used in community settings, and in conjunction with a broad range of partners, including the aging and public health networks, and the Alzheimer's Association. These materials are currently being tested in several cities, and should be expanded to include the ADCS/ADCs and industry partners.\nThe expert workgroup supports the idea of a central resource for best recruitment and retention practices (such as may be developed within the ROAR infrastructure), while noting that consensus on best practices has not yet been achieved and also may differ as trials move from treating to preventing dementia. Thus, the workgroup also supports establishing a working group of clinical trial recruitment experts to develop concrete recommendations on best recruitment practices. With several large scale predementia trials (API, DIAN, A4, TOMMORROW) already beginning to enroll subjects, now is an ideal time to bring this working group together to discuss the success of various recruitment strategies (Milestones AK and AL).\nWith regard to increasing awareness of large-scale registries (AM and AN), tailored awareness campaigns will be needed for different population groups concerning the purpose of registries and the importance of participation. However, the expert workgroup stresses that raising awareness alone is insufficient and must be accompanied by actually increasing enrollment in registries, and enrollment and retention in trials.\nA national health promotion campaign to increase awareness in African-American and Latino communities is desperately needed, and regional campaigns to address the varying needs of diverse communities. These efforts will require both public (NIH) and private (philanthropic) funds. The infrastructure provided by ROAR represents an opportunity to build such an effort, with input from multiple stakeholders. A task force comprising leaders in underrepresented communities, clinical investigators, philanthropic and health advocacy organizations, and marketing/advertising specialists should be convened to identify strategies for developing these public awareness campaigns.\nFor Milestone AM, the success criteria should include development of tailored awareness campaigns for different populations about the purpose of registries and the importance of participation. For Milestone AN, the success criteria should include a national health promotion campaign, and regional campaigns to increase awareness and participation of the African-American and Latino communities."}, {"section_title": "Additional considerations", "text": "\nThe expert workgroup identified two research areas not covered by the existing milestones, and recommended new milestones that would address these: (1) Novel paradigms on the etiology and pathogenesis of AD, and (2) efforts to increase the efficiency of gaining regulatory approval of new drugs. These new milestones would establish and fund training awards, fellowships, and research programs on the neuropathology and molecular biology of aging; and support the regulatory qualification of several biomarkers of disease progression.\nThe expert workgroup also noted the lack of milestones that directly address how best to forge strategic alliances between the federal government and the private sector, including expanding the role of industry in this enterprise. Thus, they recommended efforts toward creating a precompetitive consortium of industry partners aimed at de-risking early stage drug development; and a summit including a broad range of stakeholders to address issues related to data sharing and patent exclusivity."}, {"section_title": "Novel paradigms on etiology-pathogenesis of AD", "text": "Given that current approaches to treatment have not yet resulted in effective new therapies, strategies are needed to re-examine existing paradigms and consider new conceptual models of AD. The Alzheimer's Association convened a Research Roundtable in 2006 [47] and again in 2012 [48] to explore mechanisms other than the dominant amyloid hypothesis that may contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. Pathways identified that may offer additional therapeutic targets include those associated with aging, such as synaptic loss, loss of telomeres, decreased neurogenesis, autophagy, insulin resistance, and changes in lipid metabolism; and cell cycle events and other cellular processes such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium homeostasis, and alterations in chaperone proteins.\nAmong the barriers to exploring these alternative hypotheses has been a lack of tools, infrastructure, and resources. Although some new tools, such as tau imaging and novel structural and functional imaging approaches, are in development, there remains a critical need for additional tools including additional ligands and new technologies such as nanoimaging. These new imaging technologies could be especially useful in studying a cohort of individuals who maintain cognitive function very late in life. In addition, extensive and careful autopsy studies will continue to be an extremely important aspect of future studies, including proposed large, longitudinal cohort studies. However, a rate-limiting step hindering progress in this area is the insufficient number of neuropathologists training in neurodegenerative disease.\nIn addition, substantial new efforts and resources are needed in the area of basic science and pre-clinical research. Clinical research depends heavily on the understanding of basic biological and disease processes that illuminated by basic science research. While much is known about Alzheimer's disease, much remains to be discovered. Basic research is needed to more fully understand cellular and molecular events associated with aging, and how these are tied to the processes that give rise to Alzheimer's disease. Areas that are ripe for study include DNA damage, mitochondrial function, and immunobiology. The potential for expanded basic research to dramatically accelerate progress in translational and clinical research is enormous, and will provide much needed illumination in areas ranging from novel therapeutic strategies and targets to novel biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Regulatory", "text": "The National Plan's research goal of effectively treating and preventing Alzheimer's by 2025 will be achieved not only as a result of basic and clinical research discoveries made in academic and industry labs, but in the ability to demonstrate through clinical trials that the treatments developed are safe and effective. The long, complicated, and expensive process of moving a new medical entity from the bench to the bedside has been cited as one reason for the lack of new treatments despite rising expenditures. In addition to novel trial designs, improvements in biomarkers and other outcome measures, and improvements in recruitment and retention of study participants, making clinical trials more efficient will require greater flexibility in the process of gaining regulatory approval for a new drug.\nRegulatory agencies are key partners in this process and have demonstrated some willingness to adapt their requirements to the evolving science. For example, in 2013 the FDA published a draft guidance for developing drugs for early stage AD [49] , which suggested a willingness to consider accelerated approval based on the demonstration of clinical efficacy in one trial (rather than the typical requirement of two pivotal trials) along with a biomarker signal of target engagement. Moreover, the agency has published guidelines for organizations to follow in seeking qualification of drug development tools including biomarkers, cognitive assessments, and modeling and simulation tools [50] . Qualification of such tools in precompetitive space through public-private partnerships could enable sponsors to avoid the costly and time consuming process of validating outcome assessments in individual trials."}, {"section_title": "Research financing and resource development:", "text": "Forging strategic alliances to expand the role of industry\nThe National Plan identifies numerous areas in which the federal government can work collaboratively with private research organizations, industry, and health care and nonprofit organizations to address AD. Yet there are no milestones that directly address how best to forge strategic alliances with the private sector on research efforts and expand the role of industry in this enterprise.\nMost of the knowledge and expertise about drug development and specific drugs in the pipeline reside in industry, yet proprietary concerns make it difficult for transmission of that knowledge to the field. There have been a few notable exceptions to this; for example, industry scientists from multiple companies came together and shared data from phase I studies of phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitors for schizophrenia, increasing understanding of the disease and helping to clarify a path forward for drug development.\nMechanisms exist within the federal government to promote collaborations with industry, such as Comparative Research and Development Agreements. In addition, the NIH recently established the AMP, a consortium of the FDA, NIH, pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit agencies, managed by the Foundation for the NIH,which aims to jointly identify and validate disease targets for Alzheimer's and other diseases [51] . With $67.6 million from the NIH and another $61.9 million from industry, AMP is funding two 5-year Alzheimer's projects-one that will incorporate selected biomarkers into four NIH-funded clinical trials and the other a network analysis project of Alzheimer's brain tissue samples to validate biological targets known to be involved in disease pathogenesis and identify new targets.\nFrom the perspective of industry, drug development for AD is a high-risk endeavor, exacerbated by the need for large and lengthy clinical trials which substantially reduce the period of marketing exclusivity. As mentioned earlier, the FDA has addressed this to some extent by publishing a draft guidance on developing drugs for early stage Alzheimer's including the use of an accelerated approval pathway [49, 52] . The accelerated approval pathway was developed in the 1980s in response to the pressing need for drugs to treat AIDS, and has since been used successfully for oncology drugs [53] but rarely for central nervous system disease.\nThe expert workgroup recommends that more must be done to de-risk early stage drug development and provide incentives to industry to devote the necessary resources to Alzheimer's drug development. In industry circles, extension of exclusivity is widely seen as the preferred solution. Another solution that could make it economically viable for companies to invest in Alzheimer's drugs is identifying and developing an outcome measure that provides a short-term signal early in the drug development process."}, {"section_title": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "Two years after the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was presented, the Alzheimer's Association brought together a multidisciplinary group of leading researchers, clinicians, and policy makers (the expert workgroup) to evaluate progress in achieving the research goal of preventing and effectively treating AD by 2025.

Incentives are also needed to encourage pharmaceutical companies to work together toward development of combined therapies. Cross-industry collaborations are needed, for example, to establish a clear scientific rationale for combining therapies, identify appropriate outcome measures, and develop innovative trial designs to test drugs in combination. Given these pressing needs, the expert workgroup recommended extending the time frame and scope, and increasing industry representation on the repositioning and combination therapy advisory committee established in Milestone A, and expanding Milestone B to include research on the basic science underlying combination therapy.\nDrug development for currently known targets (Milestones E and F) is well underway, yet the expert workgroup noted that nearly all current Phase II and III trials target amyloid, and they called for increased efforts to develop agents against nonamyloid targets and symptomatic therapies. Citing the high attrition rate in Phase II trials to date, they also recommended greatly expanding the number of trials to be initiated to achieve the success criteria indicated (three to six successful Phase II trials and three successful Phase III trials). They also recommended deleting the requirement that at least two Phase II trials will be conducted in asymptomatic individuals in favor of embedding proof of mechanism and/or target engagement studies into Phase III trials.\nThe expert workgroup supported Milestones G through L, which focus on developing novel targets, but called for expanding research efforts to go beyond the identification of gene variants and expanding the success criteria to 12 rather than one novel target identified. Moreover, given that only a fraction of NMEs make it from the preclinical stage to Phase III trials, the expert workgroup recommended greatly expanding the number of NMEs identified, characterized, and validated in Milestone I, covering six new classes of targets. Similar expansions of numbers are recommended for drug discovery and development efforts delineated in Milestones J, K, and L. In addition, they recommended that at least one of the agents tested in a Phase III study (Milestone L) should be for a symptomatic indication.\nThe expert workgroup also recommended new milestones to expedite the development of novel targets, including developing a uniform protocol for collecting, storing, and providing access to biospecimens; enlisting an unbiased and independent entity to conduct an annual review of clinical trial efficiencies; and convening a working group to consider novel trial designs such as adaptive trials.\nWith regard to developing nonpharmacologic interventions (Milestones M through R), the expert workgroup suggested revisions to the existing milestones that address (1) the importance of treating not only cognitive and behavioral, but also the psychological and functional symptoms of Alzheimer's; (2) the importance of developing best practices for the use of nonpharmacologic interventions tailored for different stages of disease, different care settings, and in the presence of comorbid conditions; (3) the desirability of studying biomarkers in the context of nonpharmacologic interventions; and (4) the need to establish a theoretical rationale for using physiological outcomes for nonpharmacologic interventions-for example, how improvements in outcomes such as mood, sleep, or physical function may be reflected in imaging or other physiologic assessments. They also recommended an additional milestone to establish research and business development programs focused on developing and testing new nonpharmacologic therapies.\nCiting progress that has been achieved in developing and standardizing biomarkers, the expert workgroup endorsed Milestones S through Z concerning the development of new and improved biomarkers, including minimally invasive biomarkers, and cognitive markers to assess disease progression. However, they noted that these milestones must be realized in parallel with new target identification and drug development, which will require increased sharing of resources, data, and knowledge.
