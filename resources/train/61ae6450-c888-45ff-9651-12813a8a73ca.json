On 30 January 2020, it was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . By 15 th of May 2020, there were 4,621,410 COVID-19 cases and 308,542 related deaths (Worldometer, 2020) worldwide involving almost every country in the world. Within five months, the virus had spread to Europe, America and eventually to Africa. The first case in Africa was reported in Nigeria on 28 th of February 2020 (Adepoju, 2020) , and at the time of writing, the pandemic has spread to almost all countries on the African continent. South Africa has had the highest number of COVID-19 cases to date with a total of 13,524 people infected and 247 deaths (as at 15 th May)(COVID-19 WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGY BRIEF PROVINCES AT A GLANCE, n.d.).\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on 5 th of March 2020.\nDecisive early action was taken by the government: a national state of disaster was declared on 15 th of March 2020, and a nationwide lockdown was enforced on 27 th of March 2020 to avoid the first wave overwhelming the health system. While initially only people who had travelled to at-risk countries and their contacts received PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the recommendation broadened to include all people with an acute respiratory illness. Furthermore, a program of community-based screening and testing was rolled out across the country (NICD, 2020). Testing increased rapidly and by the middle of May 2020, over 600,000 tests had been carried out in South Africa (approximately 10,000 per million population) (Roser M et al., 2020) ."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "As the global pandemic has expanded, WGS and genomic epidemiology (Grubaugh et al., 2019) have been consistently used to investigate COVID-19 transmission and outbreaks (Deng et al., 2020; Eden et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020; Grubaugh, 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Munnink et al., 2020) . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance of COVID (NGS-SA) was formed (Msomi et al., 2020) , which is a network of five large government laboratories and five public universities funded by the Department of Science and Innovation and the South African Medical Research Council. In this paper, our consortium focuses on a detailed analysis of the epidemic in South Africa and preliminary genomic analysis of some of the first introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). We show that although the South African epidemic started in KZN, which have the first cases and deaths, other provinces in the country, namely the Western Cape (WC), Gauteng (GP) and the Eastern Cape (EC), have overtaken KZN in the number of confirmed cases. We also show evidence of many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in KZN and early evidence suggesting nosocomial transmission.\nWe downloaded all sequences and associated metadata from the GISAID sequence database (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Shu and McCauley, 2017) as of 1 st of May 2020 (n=15,793). Due to the low variability of SARS-CoV-2, we wished to only include high quality sequences in our downstream analyses. To this end, we filtered out sequences that were <25kbp in length as well as sequences with a high proportion of ambiguous sites (>5%). Additionally, we also removed sequences that lacked any geographic and or sampling date information. The resulting 10,959 sequences were analyzed along with 20 sequences that were generated by the laboratory at the (Rambaut et al., 2020) , which suggest this to be the first lineage (hence A).\nLineage A genomes are characterized by two unique mutations (8782C>T and 28144T>C), relative to lineage B. Lineage B, on the other hand, shares no common mutations since this lineage contains the global SARS-CoV-2 genome reference (Wuhan-Hu-1). From these lineages, sub-lineages (e.g. A\u00b71, A\u00b72, A\u00b73 and so forth) are then designated, each defined by an additional set of unique mutations. For example, for sub-lineage A\u00b71, these mutations would be; 11747C>T, 1785A>G and 18060C>T. Sub-lineages can further diversify into sub sublineages (e.g. A\u00b71\u00b71). Please refer to the schema provided in Supplementary Figure 5 for more information.\nPhylogenetic analysis 10,959 GISAID reference genomes and 20 KRISP sequences were aligned in Mafft v7\u00b7313 (FF-NS-2) followed by manual inspection and editing in the Geneious Prime software suite (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). We constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree topology in IQ-TREE (GTR+G+I, no support) (Nguyen et al., 2015; Tavar\u00e9 and Miura, 1986) . Due to the large size of the alignment and the low variability, we opted to not infer support for splits in this tree topology. In any tree topology of SARS-CoV-2 the majority splits will be poorly supported with only the major splits separating the major lineages having good support. The resulting ML tree topology was transformed into a time scaled phylogeny using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) with a clock rate of 8x10 -4 and rooted along the branch of Wuhan-WH04 (GISAID: hCoV19/Wuhan/WH04/2020) and Wuhan-Hu1 (Genbank: MN908947). The resulting phylogeny was viewed and annotated in FigTree and ggtree.\nBased on this large phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, we randomly down sampled the GISAID reference sequences that passed initial sequence quality checks to ~10% of the original size.\nAll African sequences in the GISAID subset, the 20 genotypes that were generated in this study, as well as a select few external references (e.g. Wuhan-Hu-1) were included. The resulting dataset of 1848 sequences was used in a custom build on the NextStrain analysis platform \nIn short, sequences were aligned in mafft v7.313 and visualized and manually edited in Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand) as previously described. ML-tree topologies were inferred from each alignment in IQ-TREE v1\u00b76\u00b79 (GTR+G+I, with transfer support values) (Nguyen et al., 2015; Tavar\u00e9 and Miura, 1986) . Resulting tree topologies were analyzed in TempEst software suite for temporal clock signal (Supplementary Figure S4) . Coalescent molecular clock analyses were performed in BEAST v1\u00b78. In short, analyses were run under a strict molecular clock assumption at a constant evolutionary rate of 8x10 -4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year and an exponential growth coalescent tree prior. The Markov Chains were run in duplicate for a total length of 100 million steps sampling every 10,000 iterations in the chains. Runs were assets in Tracer for good convergence (ESS>200) and\nTreeAnnotator after discarding 10% of runs as burn-in.\nData Availability SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated in this study have been deposited in the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/), under the following accession IDs: EPI_ISL_421572, EPI_ISL_421573, EPI_ISL_421574, EPI_ISL_421575 EPI_ISL_421576 EPI_ISL_436684 EPI_ISL_436685 EPI_ISL_436686 EPI_ISL_436687. In addition, raw short and long reads have been submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) and can be accessed under BioProject Accession: PRJNA636748 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA636748).\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on 5 th of March 2020 in KZN, a South African citizen returning home from a skiing holiday in Italy. A steady increase in the number of confirmed cases in South Africa (all imported cases) followed over the next week, with the first suspected case of local transmission reported on 13 th of March 2020 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. The early cases were predominantly located in the three provinces with the main urban populations and international travel hubs, namely GP (main cities Pretoria and Johannesburg), the WC (Cape Town) and KZN (Durban). In these three provinces, the doubling time for confirmed cases was approximately three days prior to the lockdown ( Figure   1 ). However, since the lockdown on 27 th of March 2020, the epidemic seems to be growing at different rates in South Africa.\nThe South African epidemic has been very heterogeneous. For example, the first cases and deaths happened in KZN and GP. This was more pronounced in KZN, as a large nosocomial outbreak in a private hospital in Durban caused KZN to lead the country in number of deaths until the WC overtook it on 21 April 2020. In addition, GP, home of the largest metropolitan area of Johannesburg, had an unusual epidemic, as the majority of initial cases were in middle age and rich individuals who traveled overseas for holidays. This translated in a very small number of deaths over time and infections were concentrated in the rich suburb of Sandton in Johannesburg. However, the epidemic expanded the fastest in the Western Cape (WC) province, especially in Cape Town, which is the capital and most populated city of the WC. At the time of writing this report, this province has over 60% of all of the cases and deaths in South Africa (Figure 2 ). There is mounting evidence that the Western Cape is seeding the growing epidemic in the Eastern Cape as the funerals from some of the deaths in the Western Cape are taking place in the Eastern Cape.\nThis dynamic and heterogeneous epidemic complicates the estimation of effective reproductive number (R) over time and space. For example, deaths, which is normally one of the gold standard data for estimation of R0 for South Africa in May 2020 were stable at 1\u00b712 (1.0-1.2) (Supplementary figure 1) . KZN, the first province affected by COVID-19, initially had the highest death rate but in the last period analyzed, had only 3 deaths. We have therefore attempted to estimate R from two data sources: aggregated reported cases and deaths at the country level (See Methods). Similarly, to that observed in other regions of the world, our estimates of R for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported, independently of the data source used. By the last period analyzed between 6-18 th of May, using the Wallinga et al approach (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) , we find that R was still 1.39 (1.04 -2.15, 95% CI), suggesting potential of sustained transmission for the near future.\nSequencing of viral isolates from early COVID-19 cases in KZN, which is the province of South Africa with the first infections and early deaths, provided useful insights into the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. From the first twenty-one genomes analyzed, we found thirteen independent introductions in KZN. These introductions were related to lineages B, B\u00b71 and B\u00b72, which have spread widely in Europe and North America. We also found a cluster of cases in health care workers in Durban, highlighting the potential importance of nosocomial transmission in this pandemic and potentially two other transmission pairs. The production of genomes from the WC will be crucial to understand the drivers of transmission during the lockdown period, and particularly whether health care facilities, prisons, workplaces and other institutions are acting as amplifiers of transmission. This is one of the main activities that our consortium, NGS-SA, is currently working on.\nGenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa has proved challenging on many fronts. First, sequencing of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not a straightforward task. For example, a survey of thousands of sequences deposited in public databases has revealed a number of putative sequencing issues that appear to be the result of contamination, recurrent sequencing errors or hypermutability (Virological, 2020). These might arise from laboratory-specific techniques of sample preparation, sequencing technology or consensus calling. Furthermore, the low diversity of this virus and the small number of mutations that define lineages have prompted caution in the interpretation of early phylogenetic analysis worldwide (Lu et al., 2020) . Often apparent local transmission clusters can in fact be the result of multiple introductions from under-sampled regions from non-uniform sequencing efforts (Grubaugh et al., 2019; Kraemer et al., 2019) . To mitigate this we confirmed phylogenetic results by manual inspection of mutations relative to the reference of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table S4 ).\nSecond, the pandemic is still evolving and grouping of SARS-CoV-2 into lineages and subclades is likely to be dynamic at this stage and it is influenced by proportionally larger number of sequences produced in the northern hemisphere (Rambaut et al., 2020) . Third, the travel histories of apparent community transmission need to be thoroughly investigated in order to elucidate the true dynamics of transmission in a particular area. In our case, a subsequent investigation into the samples comprising the monophyletic cluster revealed the association with a big hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Durban, KZN (Lessells et al. manuscript in preparation 2020) . This paper has some important limitations. The first is related to estimation of R from a limited number of deaths in a high heterogeneous epidemic both in time and space -for which we were able to estimate R only at the aggregated country level. The second is a lack of well set up genomics laboratories that can sequence the virus in Africa. This is also amplified by the difficulty of acquiring reagents that are in high demand, coupled with the disruption of air freight. It is therefore a high priority for our consortium, NGS-SA, to evaluate and share protocols among national laboratories in South Africa that could generate sequences of highquality and capacitate our laboratories with the protocols and bioinformatics pipelines to properly investigate virus introduction and to validate the call of variants with a detailed and reliable bioinformatics system. NGS-SA is also working with the Africa Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen genomics surveillance in the African continent.\nIn this paper, we provide an early analysis of COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, showing very heterogeneuos epidemics in the different provinces. We also estimated SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in KZN using the first twenty one genomes from some of the first cases in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f country. We find that KZN had many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV2, but also had early evidence of nosocomial transmission. The pandemic at the local level is still developing and the objective of NGS-SA is to clarify the dynamics of the epidemic in South Africa and devise the most effective measures as the outbreak evolves.

The SID distribution used is the one estimated by Nishiura and colleagues (Nishiura et al., 2020) , with m=4.7 and s=2.9. We term this approach the Flaxman et al. approach (Flaxman et al., 2020) . (ii) We used the relationship R=(1+r/sigma)(1+r/delta), with 1/sigma the infectious period and 1/delta the incubation period, as described by Wallinga and Lipsitch (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) , which is based on an SEIR modelling framework and expects both periods to be exponentially distributed. We used exponential distributions with mean 5.1 days for incubation (Kucharski et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020) and 4 days for the infection (Kucharski et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020) .\nWe term this approach the Wallinga et al. approach . To obtain the epidemic growth rate r, we used maximum likelihood estimation in R (function optim), by fitting the exponential growth J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f model A0e rt to the reported time series of cases and deaths (independently), where t is time, A0 is the number of reports at t=0, and r the growth rate.

Recent data indicates that over 62% of the new infections and deaths are happening in this province, although only 17% of the South African population lives in this region. The fast spread of COVID-19 in the WC is not fully explained by the higher testing rates as this province has performed between 20-22% of the tests in South Africa, but the positivity rate has been around 9%, were as in the other provinces the positivity rate is around 1-2%. Our estimates of transmission potential for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported, similarly to that observed in other regions of the world.
