The ECLS-B tracks a nationally representative sample of children from infancy to first grade. The full sample consists of more than 10,000 children born in 2001, and the primary methods of data collection are interviews and direct child assessments that occur during home visits at nine, 24, and 48 months after birth. The sample for these analyses includes 6,816 biological resident fathers who completed a 10-minute self-administered survey in the nine-month wave of the study.\nThe advantage to using the ECLS-B is that it enables researchers to report fathers' self-reported intentions and behaviors rather than relying on mothers' reports of their pregnancy intentions. Additionally, the sample makes it possible to analyze data about a large, diverse group of fathers' so that findings can be more easily generalized to all resident fathers. Note, though, that the ECLS-B overrepresents married fathers and fathers with strong attachments to children. All differences presented in this brief are statistically significant (p<.05) unless otherwise noted.

Figure 4 sheds light on the extent of this involvement.\nI More than nine in 10 fathers felt the baby move (97 percent), saw an ultrasound of the baby (95 percent), listened to the baby's heartbeat (93 percent), discussed the pregnancy with the mother (93 percent), or bought things for the baby (91 percent).\nI Less than one-half of all fathers attended a childbirth class with the baby's mother (42 percent).\nI More than nine in 10 fathers (93 percent) were in the delivery room when their child was born, and 99 percent of fathers visited their child and/or the mother of their child in the hospital after the birth (analyses not shown).\nAmong resident fathers, teen fathers and fathers aged 35 and older were slightly less likely to be involved in prenatal activities than were fathers in other age groups.

This section summarizes our key findings.\nI Most resident fathers want the pregnancy of the focal child; but a quarter report that they did not want the pregnancy at all. Pregnancy intentions, however, differ by age and race/ethnicity. Specifically, teen fathers are least likely to report that the pregnancy occurred at or about the right time, and non-Hispanic black fathers and fathers of other ethnicities are more likely to report not wanting the pregnancy than Hispanic or non-Hispanic white fathers.\nI Overall, resident fathers are highly involved with partners' pregnancies. However, teen fathers and Hispanic fathers are somewhat less likely to demonstrate specific prenatal behaviors.\nI Pregnancy intentions are related to resident fathers' postbirth involvement with their children. Specifically, men who report not having wanted the pregnancy are less likely to exhibit warm behaviors than are fathers who report that the birth occurred at or about the right time. In comparison, men who report they would have preferred that the birth happen earlier are more likely to engage in nurturing activities.\nI Prenatal behaviors are important predictors of postbirth involvement. Men who participate in more prenatal behaviors are more likely to be positively engaged with their children."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE", "text": "Findings from the current study have a number of implications for policy and practice that would serve to enhance fathers' participation in prenatal activities and increase their involvement with their children after birth.\nI Policies and programs should encourage couples to plan fertility according to both partners' desires. Because of the association between fathers' pregnancy intentions and their postbirth warmth and nurturing behaviors, fathers' opinions about the timing of pregnancies can matter for children.\nI Pregnancy programs and health care providers should involve fathers from the start. Our analyses suggest that encouraging and enabling resident fathers to participate actively in the pregnancy as early as possible may increase later father involvement in childrearing. Thus, involving fathers early in the pregnancy may be important for promoting greater engagement in the child's life after birth.\nI Programs should cater to the needs and interests of men, as well as of women. Examples of such programs for fathers might include activities that help fathers understand the phases of pregnancy, that emphasize the importance of participating in doctor visits and childbirth classes, and that develop fathers' emotional attachment to the unborn child.\nI The importance of positive father involvement for child well-being should be stressed at all levels. Parenting classes targeted at fathers as early as the teen years and available both before and after the birth may serve as effective vehicles for teaching men about how to interact with their babies and how important it is for fathers to be involved in their children's lives-not just during infancy but in the ensuing years as well.\nI Pregnancy programs should be sensitive to cultural differences in the ways fathers perceive the pregnancy and support the mother. There appear to be differences in pregnancy intentions and prenatal behaviors across racial and ethnic groups, as noted. Therefore, programs should consider these differences when planning curricula and training staff."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "How a man responds to the news that he will be a father can have implications for a child's long-term well-being. When a man welcomes this news and actively supports his partner during the pregnancy and at and after the child's birth, that child starts down the road of life with some precious assets in hand. Surely that is a compelling reason for learning more about fathers' pregnancy intentions and prenatal behaviors and their significance for father's involvement with their young children."}]
