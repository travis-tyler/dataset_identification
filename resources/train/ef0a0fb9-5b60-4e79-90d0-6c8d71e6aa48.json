This perspective describes the differences between these later studies and the original experiments. We highlight the necessity for using standardized and informative assessment tools and processes when determining the age of development of AD or AD symptoms, and also stress that this clinical phenotype is best measured reliably in prospective studies during which subjects are monitored over time.

Indeed, it is difficult to find cognitively normal individuals with the APOE \u03b54/4 genotype who are older than 90 years of age. Arguably, APOE \u03b52/2 is also highly informative because the occurrence of AD in people with this genotype is rare or nonexistent. However, only w1% of whites have an APOE \u03b52/2 genotype. Therefore, the two potentially informative APOE genotypes are rare. The development of an extensive body of clinical information and molecular studies added weight to the genetic findings and led to acceptance by the AD research field that carriage of APOE \u03b54, in APOE \u03b54/4 and APOE \u03b53/4 genotypes, is deleterious. Individuals with APOE \u03b53/3, the most common genotype, and also APOE \u03b52/3, are assumed to be unaffected by whatever APOE \u03b54 does to increase disease risk and decrease the AOO of AD. These assumptions subsequently led to broad comparisons of APOE \u03b54-positive and APOE \u03b54-negative groups in many clinical and pharmacological studies.\nThe genomic region surrounding the APOE gene is characterized by strong linkage disequilibrium-different alleles at polymorphic loci in the region tend to be co-inherited faithfully from generation to generation. A number of other genes are encoded within the APOE region, including TOMM40, which codes for the protein that forms the channel subunit of the multisubunit complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane through which nuclear-encoded proteins enter mitochondria. The association between the 523 polymorphism and age of AD onset was first reported by Roses and colleagues [1] . Fig. 1 illustrates the type of genetic data, based on DNA sequencing of the polymorphic poly-T, that describes the 523 locus. The sequencing identified three categorical length alleles for 523, and a two-haplotype system for APOE \u03b53-523. Attached to APOE \u03b53, and also to APOE \u03b52, which is thought to have arisen later in human history, is either a short (S; 19 T residues) form or a very long (VL; .29 T residues) form of 523. In contrast, 98% of the time, APOE \u03b54 is linked to, and thus inherited with, the long (L; 19-29 T residues in length) 523 poly-T allele.\nThe publication by Roses and colleagues [1] demonstrated the power of phylogenetic mapping for postgenomewide association study analysis of regions of high linkage disequilibrium, showing that haplotypes composed of the 523 S allele and APOE \u03b53 have a different inferred evolutionary history than haplotypes containing APOE \u03b53 linked to 523 VL. That is, APOE \u03b53-523 S and APOE \u03b53-523 VL haplotypes segregate to different clades on the phylogenetic tree constructed from DNA sequences of the APOE-523 region for AD patients and control subjects. Similarly, 523 L, which is almost always linked to APOE \u03b54, occurs in distinct clades, and the tree structure suggests that APOE \u03b54-523 L haplotype has an evolutionary history that is more similar to APOE \u03b53-523 VL than to APOE \u03b53-523 S haplotypes. The branch of the tree that contains the APOE \u03b53-523 VL and APOE \u03b54-523 L haplotypes is enriched for AD patients, whereas the branch containing APOE \u03b53-523 S is relatively enriched for the control subjects from the study group analyzed. The coincidence of distinct APOE \u03b53 haplotypes with APOE \u03b54 haplotypes on the tree suggested that these APOE \u03b53 haplotypes might also be associated with higher disease risk. In fact, the relationship is stronger with age of disease onset than with lifetime risk. Thus, by using phylogenetic mapping, resolution of the contribution of different alleles/haplotypes within this highly correlated region was discerned. There is a very large risk signal that is undeniably associated with the APOE \u03b54-523 L haplotype, but age-dependent risk can also now be assigned to haplotypes containing APOE \u03b53. Fig. 2 illustrates stratification of the age of cognitive impairment by 523 genotype in which case status is determined clinically during an ongoing prospective study conducted by the Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center using carefully applied, standardized, and validated neuropsychological tests [4, 5] . The six Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated in Fig. 2 map a single APOE \u03b54/4 AOO distribution, two distinct distributions for APOE \u03b53/4, and three distributions for haplotypes containing APOE \u03b53/3 or APOE Fig. 1 . Histograms of 523 poly-T lengths and allele frequencies linked to specific APOE alleles. The data were obtained from Sanger sequencing of 23-Kb DNA that contained both the 523 poly-T variant and the APOE epsilon single nucleotide polymorphisms, so linkage between the 523 and APOE alleles was unambiguous. The data were obtained from a white cohort of 83 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 67 age-matched control subjects, and included subjects with APOE \u03b53/3, \u03b53/4, and \u03b54/4 genotypes (no \u03b52 alleles; details of the cohort are given in Li and colleagues [2] ). The overlap region for the long (L) and very long (VL) categories is shown in the gray area.

Age at which cognitive impairment occurred was stratified by TOMM40 genotype, and KaplanMeier curves were constructed. L, long; VL, very long; S, short. \u03b52/3. Note that the three distinct AOO distributions corresponding to APOE \u03b53/3, now distinguished by the 523 genotypes-S/S, S/VL, and VL/VL-provide risk estimates for w40% of whites. No curves are provided for APOE \u03b52/4 or APOE \u03b52/2 separately (which together account for only 3% of the white population) because of insufficient numbers of disease onset events for APOE \u03b52 carriers. Thus, the 523 genetic locus, discovered by phylogenetic mapping, is more informative for AOO distributions than the two categories provided by APOE \u03b53/4 and APOE \u03b53/3 (523 L/L and APOE \u03b54/4 genotypes are almost perfect surrogates). By using 523 genotypes to stratify age-dependent disease risk, risk predictions can be made for .97% of the population sample.\nSome recent experiments have not replicated the association of TOMM40 523 with AOO of AD, most notably reports from Jun and associates [6] and Cruchaga and coworkers [7] . An editorial that accompanied the article by Jun and associates [6] asserted, based on the conditional analysis presented by Jun and associates [6] , that there was no independent genetic association between TOMM40 523, nor any other single nucleotide polymorphism in the TOMM40-APOE genomic region other than the two single nucleotide polymorphisms that define the APOE genotype, with AD risk [8] . Guerreiro and Hardy [8] (page 1243) state that \"The golden rule to consider a gene as a true risk factor for a determined disease has been the ability to replicate the original association.\" This is a true statement; however, there are several aspects to consider when asking why the metaanalysis by Jun and associates [6] and the study by Cruchaga and coworkers [7] , which Roses has previously commented on in Alzforum [9] , do not replicate the association between 523 and AOO of AD as reported by Roses and colleagues [1] . Box 1 lists the requirements for replication of the findings by Roses and colleagues [1] .\nA number of methodological aspects may account for the differences observed between the survival (age of AD onset) analyses conducted by Jun and associates [6] compared with the data shown in Fig. 2 . The article by Jun and associates [6] presents the results of a meta-analysis of 15 data sets comprised of 11,840 AD patients and 10,931 cognitively normal elderly control subjects assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium for genomewide association study research. Of all the larger data sets, only 1256 patients and 1605 control subjects were genotyped for the TOMM40 poly-T marker. Of the complex assemblage of studies that yielded cases for the analyses by Jun and associates [6] , only some were prospective, where incident cases were captured during the course of the study. Other studies were cross-sectional, or had a cross-sectional component, and would have contributed patients with retrospectively reported AOO of AD in which recall and survivor biases are likely to undermine the accuracy of the AOO data. Only one of the three studies that were genotyped for TOMM40 by Jun and associates [6] and used in their survival analyses was strictly prospective. The Adult Changes in Thought Study (ACT) began with cognitively normal subjects and incident cases of AD were captured during the course of the study. The other two studies-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Aging Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) studies-are composed of both prevalent and incident cases. It is not clear whether the ADNI or ADC data that were used by Jun and associates [6] and Cruchaga and coworkers [7] were only the incident cases. If prevalent cases were included in the AOO analyses, AOO would be reported retrospectively, and recall and survivor biases and variously defined clinical presentations would confound the interpretation of the results. Moreover, even prospective studies may introduce methodological challenges resulting from the use of different instruments or clinical staging when cross-study comparisons are made. Within-study reconciliation may also be problematic when a large number of sites are involved, as with ADNI, because there is increased risk for variability in application of the assessment instruments and thus in ascertaining AOO. Unfortunately, neither the uniformity, or lack thereof, of definitions of AD diagnosis nor an assessment of accuracy or withinand cross-study consistency for ascertaining AOO are detailed in the article. For example, among the three series used in the survival analyses [6] , either the subject samples analyzed from each study are very different, or case diagnosis is very different because (i) the average AOO for the ACT sample is 12 years older than for ADNI or ADC; (ii) the AOO distribution for APOE \u03b54-plus subjects in the ACT study is pushed to later ages than the APOE \u03b54-minus distribution, and both occur at later ages than seen for the ADC and ADNI cases; and (iii) APOE \u03b54-plus and \u03b54-minus AOO distributions are very similar within ADNI and ADC samples. The critical measure for a delay of disease onset clinical trial is the age at which symptoms appear. Introducing error by allowing variability in the definition of the end point or the measurement of that end point will ensure the failure of the study.\nA second potential source of measurement bias in this research is a result of the technical difficulty of measuring Box 1: Outline of steps necessary to corroborate the association of TOMM40 523 polymorphism and age of onset of Alzheimer's disease onset Accurate, standardized definition of clinical age of onset from prospectively monitored clinical cohorts An analytically validated assay for accurate TOMM40-523 poly-T sizing Differentiation of the poly-T overlap region so that L, VL, and S alleles can be assigned accurately to each individual Age of onset distributions for each 523 genotype (ie, not grouping three distinct 523 genotypes into a single APOE \u03b53/3 risk group using a proportion of a population) Accurate means of accounting for the presence of one or more APOE \u03b54 or APOE \u03b52 alleles in an individual genotype Determination of whether an individual's S or VL alleles are linked to an APOE \u03b52 or APOE \u03b53 allele to provide an accurate prognostic haplotype accurately the length of the 523 poly-T tract and assigning it correctly to an allele category: S, L, or VL. To reproduce the original association study it would have been necessary for Jun and associates [6] to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-plus-sequencing poly-T assay performed by Polymorphic DNA Technologies, Inc (Alameda, CA, USA), in the original experiments by Roses and colleagues [1] , because different assays will have unique measurement biases. Approximately 9500 assays of 523 length have now been performed by Polymorphic DNA Technologies for research purposes, with continuous quality assurance monitoring. Substantial data now exist for the reproducibility and robustness of Polymorphic's assay. The assay performed by Polymorphic DNA Technologies is available for fee-for-service use at very low cost. Although some major research institutions are employing this vendor to genotype the 523 locus and APOE, others have developed assays de novo. These other tests are unlikely to have the analytical validation of the Polymorphic DNA Technologies assay. The Polymorphic DNA Technologies assay uses Sanger sequencing, whereas Jun and associates [6] and Cruchaga and coworkers [7] used gel filtration sizing of PCR products of the locus. After extensive analyses, Polymorphic DNA Technologies found that the sequencing-based assay had a standard deviation of 61-2 T as a consequence of PCR slippage. For the longer 523 alleles, L and VL, for which the length distributions overlap, the PCR slippage may introduce error in the call of the categorical allele designation (L or VL). Fig. 1 illustrates that the boundaries of the peaks for allele lengths for L and VL are immediately adjacent so different methodologies for determining poly-T length will potentially result in calling different categorical 523 alleles. Fig. 1 further illustrates that as an internal check of the 523 allele calls at these boundaries, one can use a subject's APOE genotype to distinguish between L and VL, since L is (almost without exception) linked to APOE \u03b54 and VL is (almost without exception) not linked to APOE \u03b54 in whites. For example, if all poly-T lengths .30 T (ie, the gray overlap in Fig. 1 ) were labeled VL regardless of APOE genotype, these could be miscalls because some may be L alleles. Using APOE genotypes informs accurate calls for 523 allele lengths in this overlap region.\nIt is necessary to test whether allele calls are consistent among studies to know that findings in different studies are comparable. Unfortunately, although Jun and associates [6] had the means to do so, they did not report whether the results of their 523 poly-T assay were concordant with allele calls made using the sequencing-based assay performed by Polymorphic DNATechnologies. This would have been possible with the ADNI cohort because Zinfandel Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Durham, NC), sponsored the 523 and APOE genotype tests for a subset of the ADNI cohort, and the data were transferred to ADNI researchers. Earlier, Roses and colleagues were interested in providing 523 genotypes to the ADNI database and in co-authoring with ADNI collaborators an analysis of AOO stratified by 523 genotype.\nThe genotype data were provided to ADNI collaborators before the AOO data were accessed and reviewed with them. When Roses and colleagues examined how the AOOs were determined for the ADNI series, it became clear that there was insufficient standardization across sites for determining AOO, nor was there any way to verify the AOO of each case. The best estimate of year of onset of AD symptoms was recorded; however, this was not defined uniformly as the date of initial symptoms, diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by stated criteria, or diagnosis of AD by a clinician using standard diagnostic criteria of AD or MCI. Because of the uncertainty of the AOO data, Roses and colleagues determined that a clinically useful article or a true replication of the original association study could not be produced, and they chose not to participate in publication of an AOO analysis of this data set.\nThe accuracy of the Kaplan-Meier curves of AOO stratified by 523 genotype reported by Jun and associates [6] and also by Cruchaga and coworkers [7] can reasonably be questioned considering the ambiguity introduced by the nonstandardized determination of AOO, in which at least some of the determinations are retrospective, and the potential for miscalling of the 523 alleles in the area of overlap. Consistent 523 genotype calls and accurately recorded and standardized determination of age of AD onset (within a year or two in prospective clinical follow-up) should be the minimum requirement for a replication study (Box 1).\nThe APOE and TOMM40 523 genotype combination is informative of age-dependent risk of AD for the white population. The importance of the relationship between APOE and TOMM40 523 is not the independent statistical association with AOO for AD. Rather, the use of the 523 poly-T genotype increases the proportion of the at-risk population for which genetics may provide an estimate of age-dependent risk, and also improves resolution of age-dependent risk for individual subjects, to support clinical research and development of much-needed therapies. Although the APOE \u03b54/4 genotype alone is informative of age-dependent risk of disease for 2% of the white population, APOE and 523 genotype information, when combined, is informative of agedependent AD risk for .97% of whites.\nConducting clinical trial practically to test a therapy for delay AD onset requires a means to identify those at increased risk of developing disease within the expected duration of a trial. Without a risk enrichment strategy, prevention trials will likely be much larger in size and/or take longer to accrue sufficient numbers of end point conversions to demonstrate statistical differences between treated and untreated groups. The APOE and TOMM40 523 genotype combination appears to provide the means to do this. The genotype combination as a predictor of age-dependent risk of cognitive decline will be validated in a prospective study, using standardized clinical assessments for identifying onset of MCI resulting from AD [10] , uniformly conducted by trained clinicians at defined time intervals, and using a technically validated assay for calling genotypes. If, as a result of this study, it is demonstrated that the age of AD onset can be delayed by a therapeutic, then the statistical significance of TOMM40 relative to that of APOE becomes a relatively trivial discussion."}]
