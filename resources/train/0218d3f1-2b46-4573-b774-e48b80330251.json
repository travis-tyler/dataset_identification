[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because AD pathologies begin two decades before the onset of dementia, prevention of A\u2424 amyloidosis has been proposed as a mean to block the pathological cascade. Here, we generate a transgenic plant-based vaccine, a soybean storage protein containing A\u24244-10, named A\u2424+, for oral A\u2424 immunization. One mg of A\u2424+ or control protein (A\u2424-) was administered to TgCRND8 mice once a week from 9 weeks up to 58 weeks. A\u2424+ immunization raised both anti-A\u2424 antibodies and cellular immune responses. Spatial learning decline was prevented in the A\u2424+ immunized group in an extended reference memory version of Morris water maze test from 21 to 57 weeks. In Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and formic acid (FA) serial extractions, all sets of A\u2424 species from A\u2424 monomer, low to high molecular weight A\u2424 oligomers, and A\u2424 smears had different solubility in TgCRND8 brains. A\u2424 oligomers decreased in TBS fractions, corresponding to an increase in high molecular weight A\u2424 oligomers in SDS extracts and A\u2424 smears in FA fraction of the A\u2424+ treated group.

Processing of amyloid-\u2424 protein precursor was not different between A\u2424+ and A\u2424-groups. No evidence of amyloid-related inflammatory angiopathy was observed. Thus, A\u2424+ oral immunization could be a promising, cheap, and long-term safe disease-modifying therapy to prevent the pathological process in AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1, 2] , many diseasemodifying therapies (DMTs) are now being developed. However, none have succeeded in phase III clinical trials. Although the first clinical trial with an amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) vaccine, AN1792, was stopped because of meningoencephalitis [3] , subsequent studies revealed that AN1792 induced anti-A\u2424 antibodies, removed A\u2424 accumulations, and slowed the progression rate of cognitive dysfunction [4, 5] . Since then, many trials have attempted to improve the safety of A\u2424 immunotherapies by avoiding T-cell autoimmune responses [6] [7] [8] . In a phase Ib randomized trial, aducanumab, an antibody against aggregated forms of A\u2424, reduced A\u2424 burden accompanied by a slowing of cognitive impairment in prodromal and mild AD patients [9] . A phase II study of A\u2424 vaccine CAD106 against A\u2424 1-6 evoked a strong serological response and demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability [10] . A phase IIa trial of A\u2424 vaccine UB-311 against A\u24241-14 has been started based on favorable phase I trial results [11] . Case studies, the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) have shown that AD pathology begins more than 20 years before the onset of dementia [12] [13] [14] . For this reason, DMT trials aimed at preventing the onset of AD, such as the DIAN-Trials Unit [15] and Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) [16] , are now ongoing.\nMucosal vaccination is the ideal immunization for good accessibility, needle-free delivery, and protective immune responses in both mucosal and systemic immune compartments [17] . This method induces regulatory T cells, leading to a decrease in the systemic T-cell response and increased secretion of immune-inhibitory cytokines. Plants are advantageous platforms for recombinant vaccines because of their low cost, industrial scale production, and the absence of contamination from toxins and pathogens that are produced in bacterial and yeast systems [18] . Although plant-based A\u2424 vaccines using potatoes, tomatoes, green pepper leaves, rice, and tobacco have been reported [19] [20] [21] , their effect on amyloid deposition and learning was examined only in the study with transgenic rice [21] . Booster injections of A\u2424 peptide were necessary in their procedure, and most transgenic plants did not produce sufficient amounts of A\u2424. We have developed an approach based upon an innovative transgenic soybean that produces 870 mg/g of transgenic soybean seed storage protein containing A\u24244-10 (A\u2424+), which is sufficient sequence of Th2 epitope [22] for safe oral immunization without T-cell responses and additional A\u2424 peptide booster injections [23] . Here, we validate the efficacy of A\u2424+ oral vaccines using an AD mouse model, TgCRND8 [24, 25] ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Preparation of transgenic soybean protein A\u03b2+", "text": "Three tandem repeats of the Th2 epitope portion of A\u24244-10 (FRHDSGY) [22] were inserted into three portions of the flexible disordered regions II-IV of soybean glycinin A1aB1b, a carrier subunit protein of 11S globulins [26] (Fig. 1A) .

However, accumulation of HMW A\u2424Os was slightly increased in the A\u2424+ treated group at 23, 43, and 59 weeks (Fig. 5D-F) . In FA fractions, monomers and dimers of A\u2424 increased with age equally in both groups (Fig. 5G-I ). Smear patterns of A\u2424 were markedly observed in the A\u2424+ group at 59 weeks of age (Fig. 5I) . Using quantification of the bands, TBS soluble A\u2424 monomer decreased significantly in A\u2424+ treated groups by two-way ANOVA (p < 0.001, Fig. 5J ). Using post-hoc analysis, significance was detected at 59 weeks (p < 0.001, Fig. 5J ). SDS soluble HMW oligomers and A\u2424 smear in the FA fraction increased significantly in A\u2424+ treated groups by two-way ANOVA (Fig. 5N , p < 0.01 for SDS soluble HMW oligomers, and Fig. 5O , p < 0.0001 for 59N indicates nontransgenic littermates at 59 weeks. A) In TBS fractions, A\u2424 monomers were detected by 82E1 from 13 weeks and the amount increased with age (D). Other molecular weight oligomers except HMW oligomers (G) were difficult to detect because of the existence of mouse IgGs. B) In SDS fractions, A\u2424 monomers and A\u2424Os, including di-, tri-, tetra-, and A\u2424*56, and HMW A\u2424Os, were visualized from 13 weeks. Respective species increased with age (E, H). C) In FA fractions, A\u2424 monomers from 13 weeks, A\u2424 dimers from 43 weeks, and diffuse smear patterns from 43 weeks were found (F, I). J-L) 4G8, anti-A\u2424 40 , and anti-A\u2424 42 weakly detected LMW A\u2424Os, but could not detect HMW A\u2424Os. M) HMW A\u2424Os were detected by antibodies against the N-terminus (82E1, Ab9204, A\u2424-N, and PEP3), and were weakly detected by antibodies against the mid portion of A\u2424 (6E10 and 4G8), but were not detected by anti-A\u2424 42 and BC-05. Anti-C-terminus to A\u2424 40 (anti-A\u2424 40 and BA-27) did not detect A\u2424 . N) Immunostaining of TgCRND8 brains using A\u2424-N (1:1000), anti-A\u2424 40 (1:1000), and anti-A\u2424 42 (1:400) showed age-dependent A\u2424 deposition. A\u2424 burden labeled by anti-A\u2424 40 and anti-A\u2424 42 were weaker than those by A\u2424-N. Bar represents 100 m. One mouse at 13 weeks, 2 mice at 23 weeks, 43 weeks, and 59 weeks were used for analysis. figure (J-O) . In TBS fractions, soluble A\u2424 monomers in A\u2424+ treated mice were decreased compared with those in A\u2424-treated mice at 23, 43, and 59 weeks (A-C, J). To detect A\u2424 monomers clearly at 23 weeks, the membrane was exposed for longer than the other blots (A). Small amounts of HMW A\u2424Os were detected only at 59 weeks, but they did not differ between the A\u2424+ and A\u2424-groups (A-C, M). In SDS fractions, A\u2424 monomers and LMW A\u2424Os were detected equally at 23, 43, and 59 weeks (D-F, K). Accumulation of HMW A\u2424Os was inversely increased in the A\u2424+ treated group at 23, 43, and 59 weeks (D-F, N) . In FA fractions, monomers and dimers of A\u2424 increased with age equally in both groups (G-I, L). However, smear patterns of A\u2424 were markedly visualized in the A\u2424+ group at 59 weeks (G-I, O). Mice at 23 weeks (n = 9 for A\u2424+, n = 11 for A\u2424-), 43 weeks (n = 7 for A\u2424+, n = 6 for A\u2424-), and 59 weeks (n = 6 for A\u2424+, n = 7 for A\u2424-) were used. A\u2424 smear). By post-hoc analysis significance was detected at 59 weeks (p < 0.001 for SDS soluble HMW oligomers, Fig. 5N , and p < 0.0001 for A\u2424 smear, Fig. 5O ). HMW oligomers in the TBS fraction and A\u2424 monomer in the SDS and FA fractions did not differ between the A\u2424+ and A\u2424-groups (Fig. 5M,K,L) . Since TBS soluble A\u2424Os detected by 82E1/82E1 ELISA seem to be recovered as A\u2424 monomers in western blots using SDS sample buffer, these results correspond to A\u2424Os ELISA result that A\u2424+ immunization suppressed soluble A\u2424Os. Furthermore, it was suggested that A\u2424+ immunization accelerated the conversion of LMW A\u2424Os to HMW A\u2424Os in SDS fractions, and finally increased smear A\u2424 accumulation in most insoluble FA fractions."}, {"section_title": "Suppressed A\u03b2-immunoreactive load and adverse reaction", "text": "Age-related A\u2424-immunoreactive load measured using the total area of A\u2424-N immunostaining was significantly suppressed in the A\u2424+ treated group compared with that of the A\u2424-group (Fig. 6A,  C ; p < 0.0001).

At 21 weeks, escape latencies and path-lengths became worse in the A\u2424-group, whereas the A\u2424+ group remained in the same levels. The performances of the A\u2424+ group were significantly better during 21-59 weeks than those in the A\u2424-group. Our extended MWM test study showed the preventative efficacy of A\u2424+ oral immunization on A\u2424-related learning impairment. As previously indicated [35] , probe tests were inadequate for extended MWM test which consisted of extensive long-time and repeated behavioral evaluation. The same repeated trials in every 4 weeks in A\u2424 immunization trial of TgCRND8 mice also failed to show significant difference in probe trials [24] . Extensive overtraining by trials for a long duration may achieve the saturated level of memory, and may make it difficult to detect subtle changes in probe trials even among hippocampal damaged animals [36, 37] . Recent cohort observation studies have confirmed that A\u2424 amyloidosis caused impairment of episodic memory in the preclinical stage, and executive and global functions in the symptomatic stage before onset of dementia [38] [39] [40] . Rigorous and detailed cognitive assessments to repeatedly evaluate subtle cognitive impairments over a long duration are necessary for preclinical prevention trials such C) The area labeled by A\u2424-N was significantly suppressed in the A\u2424+ treated group compared with that in the A\u2424-treated group (p < 0.0001). D, E) The area occupied by diffuse plaques was more than 3-fold of that by core plaques. Both plaques were suppressed by A\u2424+ treatment (D, p < 0.0001; E, p < 0.0001). Large part of the A\u2424 decrease by immunization consisted of diffuse plaques. A\u2424 burdens detected by anti-A\u2424 40 (F) and anti-A\u2424 42 (G) were significantly decreased in the A\u2424+ treated group (F, p < 0.001; G, p < 0.0001).\nH) The area of Iba1 staining in A\u2424+ treated mice was smaller than that in A\u2424-treated mice (p < 0.0001).

(J, K) The amount of sA\u2424PP\u2423 and sA\u2424PP\u2424 in the TBS fractions detected by ELISA did not differ between A\u2424+ (Red) and A\u2424-(Blue) treated groups from 23 to 59 weeks.

They were decreased in A\u2424+ treated mice compared to A\u2424-treated mice, although there was no significance difference between A\u2424+ and A\u2424-mice (A\u2424+ n-=-7 for 23 weeks, n = 4 for 43 weeks and n = 6 for 59 weeks; A\u2424-n = 9 for 23 weeks, n = 2 for 43 weeks, and n = 4 for 59 weeks).\nas DIAN, API, or A4 studies [15, 16, 41] . Based on these findings, our extended reference memory version of the MWM test is a competent way to develop preventive DMTs in basic level of model animal experiments.\nA previous A\u2424 42 immunization study reported a reduction in behavior impairment and plaques in TgCRND8 mice; however, A\u2424 amounts measured by ELISA did not decrease [24] . Administration of anti-A\u2424 antibody m266 to PDAPP mice and BAM-10 to Tg2576 mice rapidly reversed the memory deficits without altering brain A\u2424 burden [42, 43] . The same findings were observed in our experiments, which revealed reduced cognitive impairment and A\u2424 burden, but no differences in the total amounts of A\u2424 40 and A\u2424 42 measured by ELISA between A\u2424+ and A\u2424-groups except for increased A\u2424 40 in the FA fraction. Decreased TBS-soluble A\u2424Os were the significantly suppressed A\u2424 species. This observation supported the notion that these soluble A\u2424Os species contribute to neuronal/synaptic injury and cognitive impairment.\nBecause the ELISA-based A\u2424 assay could not recover the whole amount of A\u2424 species, we next intensely surveyed A\u2424 species using western blotting of the same 3-step extracts to avoid overlooking other cardinal A\u2424 molecules. Analyses of untreated TgCRND8 mice revealed the age-related accumulation of all A\u2424 species: A\u2424 monomers in the TBS fraction; a large part of all sets of A\u2424Os with LMW to HMW in the SDS fraction [28] ; and age-related A\u2424 monomers, dimers, and smears in the FA fraction. These different LMW to HMW A\u2424Os species were not measured by A\u2424Os ELISA, and the Cterminus of HMW A\u2424Os species were blocked [44] . Histological examination also confirmed increased plaque immunoreactivity by N-terminal antibodies compared to those by anti-A\u2424 40 and A\u2424 42 . Thus, diverse A\u2424 species with conformational changes, modifications, and different lengths and solubilities were accumulated in the brains. For this reason, we carefully analyzed A\u2424 accumulation using not only ELISA, but also conventional western blots to decide which is the cardinal A\u2424 molecule that is toxic for the nervous system and causes cognitive dysfunction.\nIn a comparison study between A\u2424+ and A\u2424-treated groups, visualized TBS soluble A\u2424 monomers were decreased by A\u2424+ treatment during weeks 23-59. Because A\u2424Os in the TBS fraction were easily degraded into monomers using SDS sample buffer in western blotting experiments, these findings may partially correspond with the decreased amount of A\u2424Os detected by ELISA in the A\u2424+ treated group. Consistent with ELISA findings, almost all insoluble aggregated A\u2424 species in the SDS and FA fractions did not show obvious differences between the A\u2424+ and A\u2424-treated groups. Conversely, HMW A\u2424Os in the SDS fraction and smear A\u2424 in the FA fraction were increased in the A\u2424+ treated group compared with the A\u2424-treated group. These findings suggested that toxic soluble A\u2424Os in A\u2424+ treated brains may be sequestered into highly insoluble and aggregated A\u2424Os and A\u2424 fibrils. The same findings have been suggested previously, because the amyloid fibril is a protective structure in AD pathology [45] [46] [47] . CSF A\u2424 40 and A\u2424 42 levels were decreased in A\u2424+ treated mice compared with A\u2424-treated mice, although there was no significant difference between A\u2424+ and A\u2424-mice because of the small sample size. Previous immunization studies showed increased A\u2424 in CSF by increased clearance of A\u2424 [48] . Decreased amounts of CSF A\u2424 are thought to be due to the deposition of A\u2424 in the brain, because CSF A\u2424 decreases correlate with A\u2424 plaques [29, 49] . Decreased amounts of A\u2424 in A\u2424+ treated mice suggested that the effect of immunization is not by enhanced clearance of A\u2424 but sequestration of A\u2424 in an insoluble fraction in the brain.\nHistological evaluation showed that reduction of diffuse plaques was more prominent than the reduction of core plaques by A\u2424+ immunization. Diffuse plaques were composed of scant A\u2424 amyloid fibrils. No difference of A\u2424 levels by ELISA may imply a lower decrease in core plaques. Together with biochemical analyses, A\u2424+ immunization may facilitate the sequestration of toxic soluble A\u2424Os into insoluble and HMW A\u2424Os within the compact aggregated A\u2424 amyloid core. Liu et al. separated A\u2424Os into neurotoxic type 1 A\u2424Os and non-neurotoxic type 2 A\u2424Os. Type 2 A\u2424Os, which occupy the majority of A\u2424Os sequestrated around dense core plaques (\u223c95% in 21-month-old Tg2576 mice), accounted for less than 15% of the cortex [46] . Hong et al. showed that diffusible, highly bioactive oligomers represent a critical minority of soluble A\u2424 in AD brain [50] . It is still unclear what types of A\u2424Os exert the main neurotoxicity [33, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . We have previously shown that accumulation of A\u2424 dimers in lipid rafts is the earliest event corresponding to behavioral deficits in Tg2576 mice [55] . A\u2424 dimers are also shown to be cardinal molecules for synaptic dysfunction in A\u2424 amyloid cascades in AD pathogenesis [56, 57] . Injection of LMW oligomers into the brain induced rapid and persistent impairment of memory, associated with decreased hippocampal synaptophysin [58] . A\u2424Os neurotoxicity and their induction of tauopathy are canceled by A\u2424Os-specific monoclonal antibodies [59] . The recent success of a phase Ib randomized trial of aducanumab also showed that antibodies against aggregated forms of A\u2424 are clinically useful [9] . Together with these findings, our study suggested that soluble A\u2424Os are the cardinal A\u2424 species responsible for neurotoxicity and are valid targets for DMTs.\nInverse increases in HMW A\u2424 oligomers and A\u2424 smear have not been reported in previous A\u2424 immunization studies. There are some studies on decreased A\u2424 neurotoxicity through the accelerated conversion of A\u2424 oligomers into A\u2424 fibrils. Using chaperone protein HspB1, A\u2424 oligomers were converted into large nontoxic aggregates, and their toxicity was sequestrated [60] . Peptides that enhance the formation of amorphous aggregates of A\u2424 attenuated the paralysis of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans [61] . Meanwhile, activated microglia are shown to take up A\u2424, cluster A\u2424 inside, and release aggregated A\u2424, which contributed to plaque growth [62] . Based on these reports, we speculated the presence of sequestration mechanisms that convert toxic A\u2424 oligomers into HMW A\u2424 aggregates for reduction of A\u2424 toxicity.\nBoth ELISA and TAPIR showed the presence of specific IgG antibodies against A\u2424 4-10 structural epitopes within A1aB1b in A\u2424+ immunized mice. In western blotting, antibodies were shown to detect several A\u2424 oligomers. Splenocytic proliferation and cytokine release against A\u2424+ stimulation also implied the presence of adaptive cellular immune responses. We found no histological meningoencephalitis or bleeding in mouse brains. Our mucosal A\u2424+ immunization significantly decreased microgliosis, indicating that it suppressed glialmediated inflammatory responses. These findings suggested that our A\u2424+ oral immunization could safely raise moderate and continuous innate and humoral immune responses.\nOur A\u2424+ immunization did not alter basic A\u2424PP processing or the signaling process of the A\u2424PP intracellular C-terminal domain [63] . Accumulation of pTau was only detected in dystrophic neurites associated with core plaques. Pathological conversion and spreading of aggregated tau was facilitated in the dystrophic neurites around core plaques [64] . Because numbers of core plaques were not so different, the amount of pTau was not significantly different.\nPreclinical initiation and long-term maintenance of DMT against A\u2424 amyloidosis have been proposed to halt the progression of cognitive impairment and the onset of dementia. This strategy, which will likely necessitate weekly or monthly injections of antibodies, carries two risks. First, it may enhance risks of side effects. Second, the cost of long-term treatment with antibodies is likely to be prohibitively high when applied on national scales to large numbers of people. The use of oral plant vaccines offers advantages of extremely low cost and better safety compared with synthetic compounds or antibodies. For these reasons, our plant-based soybean A\u2424+ oral vaccine strategy is cheap, safe and as effective as others.\nIn conclusion, our results revealed that A\u2424+ oral immunization suppressed soluble A\u2424Os production and prevented cognitive impairment without obvious adverse reactions. Oral immunization by A\u2424+ could be a promising DMT for prevention of the pathological processes of AD."}]
