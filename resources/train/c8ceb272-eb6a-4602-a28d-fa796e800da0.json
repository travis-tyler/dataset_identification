This proportion of functional impairment in the aMCI group is consistent with previous findings identifying IADL deficits in patients with MCI. 15, 17, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29 The severity of these impairments, however, was mild; that is, individuals with aMCI show difficulty in IADL functioning, but this difficulty does not require the assistance of others. Only 1.8% to 21.3% of ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/ VOL 68 (NO. 6), JUNE 2011 informants reported that individuals with aMCI require assistance or were dependent per the IADLs assessed. This finding contrasts with those of patients with mild AD, of whom 12.4% to 66.3% of informants reported that those patients required assistance or were dependent per most of the IADLs assessed. Thus, physicians should be sensitive to mild informant-reported deficits at the aMCI stage, which is often a precursor to the diagnosis of dementia.\nTo aid physicians in the ability to detect impairment early in the dementia process, we identified 6 IADLs that distinguished controls from individuals with aMCI. Two of these items in particular, remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, and medications and assembling tax records, business affairs, or other papers, may improve the ability of physicians to briefly identify aMCI functional impairment. These 2 items were highly specific in their ability to differentiate controls from the 2 combined cognitively impaired groups. Only 34.0% of individuals with aMCI (and 3.6% of individuals with AD) have intact informant-reported functioning on both items. These findings highlight the types of daily activities that are disrupted during different stages of cognitive impairment and specifically identified 2 daily tasks that physicians can use to differentiate controls from cognitively impaired individuals.\nThe results of this study support recent proposals to modify the Petersen criteria for MCI to reflect these deficits in complex instrumental functions. 40, 41 Although basic activities of daily living usually remain intact in aMCI, mild IADL deficits often appear to occur in aMCI. The aMCI group in this study was rigorously defined according to the Peterson criteria for aMCI, 19 yet it still represents a heterogeneous stage of cognitive impairment. Other classification systems have been used to define cognitive impairment, and each of these systems is likely to differ in the extent and severity of IADL deficits and each identifies slightly different clinical courses and outcomes. 42 These findings represent a reminder that the MCI classification system denotes a continuum of impairment, and impairments based on the extent and severity of daily functioning can play an important role in defining where on this continuum a cognitively impaired individual can be classified.

[15] [16] [17] This study found that functional impairment (total severity, total number, and average severity per deficit) was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes and decreased processing speed in the combined aMCI and AD group. Functional severity and total number of functional deficits were also associated with worse memory performance per the AVLT 30-minute delay and decreased entorhinal cortex volumes.\nWithin the aMCI group, the associations among memory deficits (as measured by the AVLT 30-minute delay and decreased hippocampal volume), processing speed decrements (per Trail Making Test, part A score), and greater functional impairment again were identified. Distinct heterogeneity was observed within the aMCI group illustrated in the post hoc and logistic models. Although the trends across groups for the severity and number of functional deficits analyses showed that with increasing deficits in daily activities, impairment in memory and processing speed and medial temporal atrophy worsened, the strongest difference was observed between the functionally intact and moderate to severe or high deficit groups.

Means are adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and intracranial volume in the hippocampal volume analysis. A, Severity of functional deficits. B, Number of functional deficits. A significant difference was found in post hoc comparisons between no deficits and moderate to severe or high deficits. Severity groups were defined as follows: no deficits, 0; mild severity, 1-4; moderate to severe, 5 or more. Number of deficit groups were defined as follows: no deficits, 0; few deficits, 1-3; and high deficits, 4 or more (P \u03fd .0167; Bonferroni corrected). functional deficits groups with aMCI had greater hippocampal atrophy and impairment in memory and speed of processing compared with the functionally intact individuals with aMCI. These results illustrate 2 possible mechanistic pathways that contribute to functional impairment in cognitively impaired individuals. One potential pathway, memory dysfunction, is represented by neuropsychological measures (ie, the AVLT 30-minute delay) and neurobiological markers (ie, increased medial temporal atrophy). This finding is consistent with past findings showing increased atrophy in the 2 areas of the brain consistently associated with AD, the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. 29, 44, 45 Speed of processing marks the second potential pathway associated with functional impairment. Processing speed declines with age. 46, 47 Although researchers have focused on the association between executive dysfunction and daily functional deficits, 48 the present study concurs with recent findings by Wadley and colleagues, 15 who showed that individuals with aMCI differed from healthy controls in speed of processing on a financial performance measure. These findings intimate that gradual decreases in processing speed that occur with normal aging may accelerate in individuals with incipient dementia. We speculate that processing speed decrements may mark the initial onset of milder deficits in daily functioning, but executive dysfunction may lead to more severe impairments in daily functioning as the disease progresses. Longitudinal data need to be examined to test this hypothesis.\nThe status of APOE \u03b54, a genetic marker shown to increase risk of developing Alzheimer disease, 49 was associated with an increased number of informantreported functional deficits in the aMCI group. Those individuals with aMCI who had a positive expression for the APOE \u03b54 allele had a greater number of functional deficits, although not more severe deficits, than those without the APOE \u03b54 allele. Individuals with an APOE \u03b54 allele may be predisposed to earlier onset of impairments in daily functioning, consistent with the increased risk of incipient dementia conferred by the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele. 49 However, these disruptions in daily activities do not require overt assistance by or overall dependence on spouses, family members, or friends.\nThe study has some design limitations. It used carefully selected individuals who agreed to participate in a research study with intensive serial procedures during an extended period. Part of the selection criteria included the exclusion of significant depressive symptoms or coexisting medical disorders, such as vascular impairment. Although the present study illustrated that functional deficits partly overlap with cognitive deficits (specifically, memory impairment and processing speed deficits) 15, 16 and in part may be considered a consequence of these impairments, the moderate amount of explained variance between functional and cognitive deficits in this study and another 50 suggests that other factors contribute to the development of these deficits. Possible contributing factors to increased functional deficits include physical 10 and psychological 14 comorbidities, but these comorbidities were excluded in this sample. The exclusion of moderate to severe depression, in particular, hinders generalizability of these findings because depression is common in patients with cognitive impairment, and the bidirectional relationship between depression and functional impairment is well established. 51 The use of different assessment methods (self-report for controls and informant report for the aMCI and mild-AD groups) makes cross-comparisons between the cognitively impaired and cognitively intact groups difficult. Previous research has shown that selfreports can underreport symptoms in part due to worsening cognitive impairment and awareness, 17, 21, 26 but informant reports in AD may overreport symptoms perhaps due to caregiver burden. 52 Performance-based measures 53 may reflect more accurately the ability of the patient to perform specific behaviors, although this remains to be established; performance-based measures were not evaluated in this study.\nIn conclusion, this study shows that mild deficits in daily activities are common in the aMCI stage of cognitive impairment and that this impairment should be considered in the MCI criteria. Functionally impaired individuals with aMCI had greater medial temporal atrophy and deficits in memory and processing speed compared with functionally intact individuals with aMCI. Future research should investigate the onset and course of functional impairment longitudinally to discern whether deficits in memory and processing speed or greater medial temporal atrophy are associated with the onset and progression of functional deficits during the disease process."}]
