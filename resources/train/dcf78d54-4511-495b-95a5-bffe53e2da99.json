"}, {"section_title": "Background and Problem", "text": "Tobacco dependence has become a global epidemic due to the marketing, distribution, and addictiveness of tobacco products. Indeed, a globally linked set of corporations have worked to make tobacco use normative, glamorized it, made products ubiquitous, and conducted calibrated campaigns to undermine public health interventions. 1,2 To maintain a broad and profitable market, the tobacco industry has engaged in racketeering and knowingly misled the public. 3 As a World Health Organization report notes, \"Tobacco use is unlike other threats to global health. Infectious diseases do not employ multinational public relations firms. There are no front groups to promote the spread of cholera. Mosquitoes have no lobbyists.\" 4(p.244) This multinational corporate enterprise is not without cost to society and to individuals. Tobacco use is a major cause of disability and premature death. Tobacco causes over 480,300 premature deaths and 5.4 million years of productive life lost annually in the United States. 5 Tobacco dependence is causally related to cancer incidence and myriad health morbidities. 6 The burdens of tobacco use dependence are not shared equally across the U.S. population. Among other disparities for socioeconomic status, 7 mental health status, 8 and race/ethnicity, 9 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people are at much higher risk of tobacco use than their straight counterparts. 10 Indeed, smoking prevalence among LGB people is over 50% higher than among straight people. 11 Data for transgender populations are scarce, * although disparities exist. 12 Disparities in lung health and cardiovascular disease for LGB people are also likely related to tobacco use. 13,14 The reasons for this disparity are only partially known, and research has focused primarily on the role of discrimination, stress, and stigma, 15 specifically using the minority stress model. 16 Briefly, tobacco use is hypothesized to be more common among populations for which discrimination and stigma result in added stress. Tobacco use can serve as a coping strategy for such stress, and stress can hinder quit attempts. Other ecological approaches may also help explain higher prevalence of tobacco dependence among LGB populations than among heterosexual populations. 15 Although research has been limited, suggested determinants include the role of LGB bars and the media environment. Researchers have suggested that the role of LGB bars as safe community spaces may promote tobacco use. 17,18 In the media environment, tobacco use is highly visible in the LGB print press and in LGBTthemed movies while coverage of cessation is rare. [19][20][21] Similarly, in LGB news blogs discussion of the tobacco epidemic is rare and little focus is given to cessation. 22 The tobacco industry has targeted its marketing directly at LGB communities. 23,24 Although much of the tobacco industry's targeting marketing is overt and present in the LGB press, the industry has also engaged in more subtle forms of marketing. 23 These include emphasis on LGB workplace non-discrimination policies and participation in the Human Rights Campaign's Workplace Equality Index 25 as well as sponsorship of HIV/AIDS and arts organizations. 26 In one of the industry's most clearly articulated plans to market to gay men, cleverly titled Project Sub-Culture Urban Market (SCUM), RJ Reynolds planned to make its products and their marketing ubiquitous in a neighborhood widely considered to be a gay enclave, San Francisco's Castro. 27 Project SCUM called for better \"in store presence,\" \"store front presence,\" and \"consistent POS (point-of-sale)/PDI placements\" with an objective to \"[p]enetrate fragmented/nontraditional outlets to increase Camel's Distribution [sic] and presence.\" 27 It is notable that the tobacco industry, in its clearest example of marketing to LGB populations, focused on making tobacco products and marketing ubiquitous at the POS in neighborhoods where LGB people are concentrated. This spatial component of marketing to LGB people has been largely ignored in studies of the etiology of LGB health disparities in tobacco. 15 Yet there is emerging demographic evidence that internal migration of LGB people within the United States results in the concentration of same-sex couples \u2020 in more diverse and lower-income neighborhoods, in regional cities, and in places where there are already more same-sex couples. 28,29 These patterns are more complex than the common view of migration of LGB people to major cities. 30 If these patterns put LGB people in spaces where there is disproportionate exposure to tobacco industry marketing, this could help explain the presence of large disparities in tobacco use for LGB populations compared to heterosexual populations."}, {"section_title": "Why the Retail Environment Matters to Tobacco Use Initiation, Dependence, and Cessation and Disparities Therein", "text": "Tobacco marketing at the point of sale (POS) is part of a broader marketing effort that is causally related to smoking initiation. 31,32 The tobacco industry spends the majority (85%) of its reported marketing dollars at the POS in the United States. 33,34 Eminent tobacco control researchers have argued that strategies can be judged by the industry's [re-]action; 35 that is, if POS marketing were not effective, corporate leaders would not invest so heavily in it 33,34 or \u2020 I use the terminology \"same-sex couples\" to describe patterns available from the U.S. Census, which does not report on individual sexual orientation. When discussing the literature or conceptual issues, I use LGB. protest restrictions so fervently. Two systematic reviews have synthesized the evidence of the impact of POS marketing on tobacco-related health behaviors, suggesting both sufficient evidence for policy intervention and the need for more prospective studies. 36,37 Both a National Cancer Institute monograph and the Surgeon General report indicate the importance of POS marketing. 31,38 More specifically, tobacco marketing at the POS likely contributes to the normalization of tobacco products, 39 is associated with smoking initiation among youth, 40,41 is associated with brand preference among youth, 42 can prompt impulse purchases by smokers, 43,44 and serves as a primary communications channel for industry marketing efforts to patrons of retail stores, including children. 45 Such communications are designed promote positive views of tobacco use and are often targeted to youth and people attempting to quit. [46][47][48] Being near to a store is associated with decreased likelihood of quitting 49,50 and with current smoking. 41,51,52 Disparities in Tobacco Retailer Density The first report of a disparity in tobacco retailer density found greater density of tobacco retailers in lower socio-economic status (SES) and higher African American census tracts by quartile in a single New York county. 53 Further research identified similar disparities in census tracts within an Iowa county. 54 In the same Iowa county researchers found the opposite result when using geographically weighted regression (GWR), \u2021 which is typically used in an exploratory fashion, finding unexpected negative associations between density and percent African American. 55 Among all 99 Iowa counties, however, at the county level of analysis, tobacco retailers were disproportionately present in areas with, \u2021 Geographically weighted regression (GWR) allows the parameter estimates from the regression model to vary over space, e.g., predictors of child poverty in one part of the country may be different than in another. unexpectedly, higher incomes and, as expected, with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minorities. 56,57 These differences in Iowa suggest the challenge of interpreting results from larger area units such as counties, which do not approximate neighborhoods, using a single county and using regression approaches that may be best suited to exploratory work. Five studies examine tobacco retailer density in New Jersey using increasingly sophisticated analytic techniques. Fakunle and colleagues (2010) analyzed census tracts in two New Jersey counties and found differences in retailer density by quartile of median household income and racial/ethnic demographics in the expected direction. 58 A statewide cluster analysis (i.e., a K-means cluster analysis) of tract characteristics found high retailer density in conjunction with higher percentages of African American and Hispanic residents and lower median income. 59 Geographically weighted regression techniques yielded similar findings only after transformation to achieve normality of residuals. 60 Last, spatial regression \u00a7 approaches used at the census-tract level with statewide data found greater percentage Hispanic, lower median income, and greater percentage African American were predictors of greater tobacco retailer density. 61 In New York, the density of retailers around New York City schools was not found to be related to race, ethnicity, or income in multivariable regression. 62 A statewide analysis in New York using spatial regression at the census-tract level, however, found greater tobacco retailer density for lower SES and higher proportion African American areas. 63 Fewer studies examine these findings in other areas of the United States. In randomly \u00a7 That is, a regression model in which spatial autocorrelation or the \"geographic influence of being near\" is explicitly included in the model, thereby accounting for the problem of non-independence of contiguous area units. Such models can vary in their treatment of the dependent variable's assumption of form using a spatial regression approach to ordinary least squares regression, Poisson regression, etc. Multi-level modeling addresses the same statistical problem of non-independence (i.e., area units nested within a larger area unit) but is not overtly spatial in its treatment of the influence of being near. See: Modeling spatial effects (pp. 399-400) in Cromley & McLafferty, 2012. selected census tracts in Omaha, Nebraska, the percent of African American and percent of Hispanic residents were positively associated with tobacco retailer density while median income was negatively associated. 64 Nationally, Rodriguez and colleagues found tobacco retailer density to be significantly and positively related to Hispanic ethnicity, poverty, and other indicators of SES using multivariable linear regression. 65 Globally, disparities in tobacco retailer density by deprivation indices and other measures of SES have been found in Southeast Queensland, Australia; 66 Western Australia; 67 Ontario, Canada; 68 Cologne, Germany; 69 and New Zealand. 70 However, one study from New South Wales, Australia, found no relationship between SES and retailer density 71 until smoking prevalence was entered as a control. 72 The patterns found across New York, Iowa, New Jersey, the United States as a whole, and even globally, when analyzed at appropriate area units (i.e., definition of neighborhood), show a consistent pattern of greater tobacco retailer density being associated with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minorities and lower income. These indicate greater access to tobacco products and the marketing at tobacco retailers provide cues to purchase tobacco products. 43,[73][74][75] The origin of these differences likely comes from two sources. First, the tobacco industry targets its marketing by neighborhood characteristics. 76 Second, there are differences in store types where lower income and more diverse neighborhoods have smaller retailers and fewer chain retailers, 77,78 likely due in part to historic underinvestment (e.g., redlining) of African American communities."}, {"section_title": "Disparities in POS Tobacco Marketing", "text": "The evidence of greater amounts of marketing per store and different types of marketing in neighborhoods with more racial/ethnic diversity and lower-income neighborhoods is more complex than the evidence of disparities in tobacco retailer density. Lee, Henriksen, Rose, Moreland-Russell, and Ribisl (under review) conducted a systematic review of tobacco marketing disparities that identified 43 papers across the four P's of marketing: 79 Price, Promotion, Product, and Placement. Although methodological quality and measures varied widely, several key findings suggest that disparities in marketing are present with more marketing in African American neighborhoods and there is greater volume of menthol marketing in African American neighborhoods. Additionally, several studies suggest differences in price: Menthol is found to be cheaper in neighborhoods with more African American residents. 80 Most studies identified were conducted in and around a single city. Among the papers with the strongest methodologies come findings from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; 81,82 Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; 83 and, Omaha, Nebraska. 84 In the Minneapolist/St. Paul metropolitan statistical area (MSA), Toomey and colleagues examined premium, menthol, and discount cigarettes marketed by the same company and showed differences in pricing based on store and neighborhood characteristics. They found wide variation in price and higher prices in neighborhoods with fewer white residents, except for the menthol brand. 82 That is, cigarette prices other than menthol prices are positively associated with higher percentage non-white neighborhood demographics after controlling for the manufacturer and store type. Menthol, however, was relatively more affordable in neighborhoods with more non-white residents. In St. Paul, Minnesota, Widome and colleagues found more ads in more African American neighborhoods and more menthol ads in African American and poorer neighborhoods. 81 In Omaha, Nebraska, Siahpush and colleagues found every $10,000 increase in median income was associated with a 14% decrease in the number of marketing materials; however, they found little evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in marketing. 84 In Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, John and colleagues found more tobacco marketing at stores in neighborhoods with lower income and more minority ** population. 83 These patterns from single cities show overall trends toward more marketing in neighborhoods with lower income and with more African American residents. Several state-or province-wide studies confirm and extend these findings. Cohen and colleagues examined stores in 20 Ontario cities, finding more tobacco promotion in lower income areas after controlling for store type in a multi-level model. 85 In California high school neighborhoods, Henriksen and colleagues found that as the percentage of African American students increased, the odds of a Newport promotion increased, the proportion of menthol advertising increased, and the cost of Newport cigarettes decreased; the same relationship was not found for the leading non-menthol brand, Marlboro. 80 In Victoria, Australia, school neighborhoods, McCarthy and colleagues 86 found that price discounts below the recommended retail price were disproportionally present in lower-income areas. Overall, these findings echo a previous systematic review of billboard and magazine marketing in black neighborhoods, \u2020 \u2020 which found higher amounts of marketing per person than in white neighborhoods. 87 In sum, the presence of tobacco retailers and tobacco marketing at the POS is not randomly distributed throughout the population. Although these studies present tantalizing evidence of neighborhood differences in tobacco marketing, which are already supported by differences in industry targeting of demographic groups, 76 no ** A number of studies use the term \"minority\" generally referring to non-white, Hispanic identification in the U.S. Census, although some studies do not define their use of the term minority. I use the term minority to be consistent with the study being described when a more descriptive term is not available. I recognize that the term \"minority\" is somewhat problematic in the United States, because this term does not and increasingly will not reflect that a majority of the population in many places is non-white and Hispanic. \u2020 \u2020 Primack and colleagues (date) conducted a meta-analysis of \"black\" versus \"white\" media markets, including neighborhoods, but did not define the cut off of \"black\" versus \"white.\" literature has examined neighborhood tobacco retailer marketing in relation to same-sex couples.

Moreover, how might this contribute to population health disparities? I contextualize this research within a social ecological framework 88 to detail how environmental factors such as tobacco industry marketing can influence health behaviors. To expand this to the creation and reproduction of health disparities, I use a framework of neighborhood health disparities developed by Bernard and colleagues. 89 Yet these two frameworks only provide us with an understanding of how tobacco marketing matters and why its presence can influence health disparities. Additional consideration is required to conceptualize and guide understanding of the formation of same-sex dense neighborhoods, the migration of same-sex couples to those neighborhoods, and the characteristics of the spatial patterning thereof that might influence the relationship with the presence, types, and characteristics of tobacco retailers. A recent systematic review shows that the literature measuring retail tobacco marketing is largely atheoretical with only a few mentions of broader theories and frameworks such as structural violence, diffusion of innovations, and community empowerment. 90 One exception is Canadian research on neighborhood health disparities that has used domains of the Bernard framework 89 to empirically examine neighborhood smoking disparities. 91 Described in detail in the next section, this framework 89 helps organize this project and provides the underpinnings of understanding the phenomena under study. Although research on gay and lesbian space and place, or the \"geography of sexualities,\" was historically neglected, 92 work in the 1980s and beyond in cultural geography, economics, and demography has provided a rich set of research on the formation and maintenance of gay and lesbian neighborhoods as well as on internal migration patterns.

This framework allows for the role of historical processes that influenced the types of retailers present in a given neighborhood and for the substantial role of the tobacco industry in influencing the pricing and marketing of its products in retailers. 2 This framework specifically posits that health disparities are the result of the availability of and access to health-related resources. Both availability and access are subject to proximity, prices, rights, and informal reciprocity. Taken together, these are conceptualized into five domains of influence on availability and access of health-promoting resources: (1) physical, (2) local sociability, (3) institutional, (4) community organization, and (5) economic. Unlike the social ecological framework where domains of influence are essentially scaled up from micro-to macro-level influences, the domains of influence in the Bernard framework operate together within a single level: the neighborhood. Figure 1 shows an overarching framework, specific to the creation and reproduction of neighborhood disparities in tobacco retailer density and marketing volume that draws from Bernard et al., 89 Bronfenbrenner, 88 and Sallis et al. 94 Figure 1. Conceptual framework for creation and reproduction of neighborhood disparities related to tobacco retailer density and marketing based on Bernard et al. 89 The Bernard framework's five domains of influence have been empirically examined in relation to neighborhood disparities in youth smoking. 91  Local sociability suggests the importance of resiliency against tobacco addiction and the sharing of resources among community members. While I focus on the physical and economic domains of the Bernard framework in this dissertation, the others provide additional context for understanding potential intervention points in tobacco retailer density and marketing disparities. Although this framework is not specific to LGB people, it provides a basis for understanding the relationship between neighborhoods and health disparities. Together, the domains of influence are useful in conceptualizing how neighborhood tobacco retailers and POS marketing can influence health and how there is potential for policy intervention at the neighborhood level. Any discussion of these domains of influence would be remiss without a discussion of the role of the tobacco industry's influence. The tobacco industry's influence manifests at the neighborhood level in multiple ways. First, the Bernard framework is situated within a broader social ecological framework where the tobacco industry has swayed macro-level state and federal policies, changed social norms to promote the acceptance of tobacco use, and saturated media environments with tobacco imagery. 95 Thus, the four social domains of institutions, economics, local sociability, and community organizations have been influenced by lobbying, legal victories, 2 corporate social responsibility campaigns, 96,97 and \"philanthropy\" to community organizations. 98 The tobacco industry has been convicted 3 of racketeering that subverted scientific findings and misled both the public and elected officials. Second, the tobacco industry plays a direct role in geodemographic marketing segmentation, thus carefully altering the physical presence of marketing materials and price promotions based on neighborhood characteristics to maximize sales.  In summary, the tobacco industry and various macro-level forces influence neighborhoods and their retailers. At the same time, there is also social influence on same-sex couples' neighborhood selection, toward which I now turn attention."}, {"section_title": "\"Get Thee to a City\": Internal Migration, Gay and Lesbian Enclaves, and Residential Patterning", "text": "Movement to a city is something of a common theme in the historical and popular imagination about the \"natural\" trajectory of LGB lives.  119 and some work has explicitly examined gay life in the suburbs 120 and rural areas.

Researchers also note that migration can be temporary and can play an important part of one's sexual identity development, even if one returns to their community of origin. 108,111 Indeed, gentrification, access to other housing opportunities due to social acceptance, and legal recognitions are likely responsible for an ongoing changes to the spatial patterning of LGB populations.

Black and colleagues provided the first empirical investigation of the spatial pattern of same-sex male couples using the 1990 Census and indices of amenities and quality of life in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of \u2265 700,000 population. 110 This analysis conducted at the MSA level showed higher concentrations of gay men in areas with more cultural amenities and better climate and that the cultural amenities were more correlated with samesex couples than social values about the morality of homosexuality. 110  Census data. At the zip code level they found: (1) Same-sex couples are more likely to live in urban areas than heterosexual couples; this is even more so for male same-sex couples than female same-sex couples; (2) same-sex couples are more likely to live in areas with greater non-white, foreign-born, and non-English speaking populations than heterosexual couples; (3) same-sex couples are more likely to live in neighborhoods with lower median household income than married heterosexual couples; (4) same-sex male and female couples are more likely to live in neighborhoods with older housing than married couples, however, female same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual partners have similar housing age; (5) samesex couples are more likely to live in areas with higher crime rates than heterosexual couples; and (6) same-sex male couples are more likely to live in areas with fewer owner-occupied homes than same-sex female or opposite sex couples. 29 Hayslett "}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATION OF SAME-SEX COUPLES AND TOBACCO RETAILER DENSITY? \u2021 \u2021", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) population is routinely found to have a large, persistent disparity in tobacco use. 10 In the 2012-2013 U.S. Adult Tobacco Survey, the prevalence of any tobacco use among LGB adults was 36% compared to 24% for heterosexual adults. 134 Explanations for LGB tobacco use disparities typically focus on discrimination, structural stigma, and resulting stress. 15 Media influence is another prominent explanation: LGB populations report high exposure 24,135 and receptivity 136 to targeted tobacco industry marketing. 23 Tobacco use is also normative in LGB print 20  Theories of neighborhood health disparities applied to tobacco retailer density suggest that tobacco retailers represent a physical presence that can hinder health by promoting ready access to tobacco products. Additionally these physical locations provide a channel for tobacco industry marketing and decrease search costs for tobacco products. 89,91 Tobacco retailers provide ubiquitous cues to smoke. 37,43,44,138 Proximity to tobacco retailers is associated with decreased success in tobacco use cessation, 49,139 although this may be true only in lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods. 73 Tobacco retailer density has been associated with smoking behaviors 51,140,141 and with youth initiation; 52 however, some findings are mixed. 49,141,142 There are both regional and local patterns of same-sex couple migration and neighborhood selection in the United States. 29 (We use the term same-sex couple to discuss migration and other aspects of research using census data, because individual sexual orientation is not ascertained in the U.S. Census. In discussing broader literature regarding sexual orientation identity, we use LGB.) Indeed, similar levels of neighborhood segregation exist for same-sex couple households as for household income, although fewer than exist for race. 133 Same-sex couples, like other couples, tend to migrate toward regions with better jobs, more temperate weather, lower crime, and more cultural amenities. 28,110 Yet the political environment also matters for same-sex couples, with greater concentrations of same-sex couples in less conservative places 128,131 and in regions with higher concentrations of other same-sex couples. 28 Within these regions, however, neighborhood selection can be influenced by several factors: Qualitative research finds strong evidence of the importance of other same-sex couples in neighborhood selection. 125,126 These patterns of neighborhood selection differ somewhat by sex, with greater concentrations of same-sex male couples into fewer, more dense neighborhoods than for female same-sex couples. 132 Same-sex couples, and male couples in particular, were more likely than opposite-sex couples to live in urban area zip codes, and in more racially/ethnically diverse zip codes with lower median household income. 29 Existing evidence suggests racial minority and lower income neighborhoods have a disproportionately higher density of tobacco retailers. The first report of a disparity in tobacco retailer density found greater density of tobacco retailers in lower socioeconomic status (SES) and higher proportion African American census tracts by quartile in a single New York county. 53 Similar findings have been identified in Iowa; 54 New Jersey with added disparities for tracts with more Hispanic residents; [58][59][60][61] New York state; 63 for poverty and Hispanic residents in Chicago, Illinois; 143 and for Hispanic residents and lower income in Omaha, Nebraska. 64 In one national study, tobacco retailer density was related to Hispanic ethnicity, poverty, and other indicators of lower SES. 65 In this national study, we sought to identify if same-sex couples live in areas with higher tobacco retailer density and to assess if the association is independent from other neighborhood characteristics. A national review of food stores found that commercial lists like those used in this study are a viable data source for large-scale studies 146 and the use of these commercial databases has been validated using ground truthing in a state without tobacco retail licensing. 147 Previous research has also validated the use of commercial lists to measure tobacco retailer density, finding that commercial lists did not show disproportionate under-or over-reporting of state-licensed tobacco retailers by area demographics in Washington. 65"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Data Sources: Tobacco Retailers", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources: Same-Sex Couples", "text": "Data on same-sex couples came from the 2010 U.S. Census, which included a question on relationship to the owner or renter of the household (\"How is this person related to Person 1?\").

Measure definitions are reported in Table 1 by their role as dependent variable, independent variables, and explanatory variables. Percentages were divided by ten (e.g., 12% = 1.2) for scaling purposes. respectively, r s(n=17,675) = 0.09 (p<0.001) and 0.14 (p<0.001).

We then excluded eight tracts for which no economic data were available. All model results are reported using n=17,667 tracts. Given gendered differences in spatial patterns of same-sex couple migration, we stratified all analyses by sex of same-sex couple. When statistically modeling phenomena with a spatial component, key tenets of linear regression are violated by non-independence of observations based on shared characteristics due to their proximity. 158 We identified spatial clustering of the dependent variable (Moran's I = 0.10, p = 0.001). Indeed, ordinary least squares regression residuals showed significant spatial clustering (Female: Moran's I = 0.08, p = 0.001; Male: Moran's I = 0.07, p = 0.001). Therefore, we used spatial regression models to account for spatial dependence in our data. We examined models with multiple contiguity weights matrices, selecting a second-order queen weights matrix. Two common approaches to spatial dependence include spatial lag and spatial error models. Spatial lag models address the influence of the dependent variable in one location on nearby locations. Spatial error models address the influence of omitted independent variables over space. Past tobacco retailer density analyses have used a spatial lag approach. 61,63 Lagrange Multiplier Tests indicated the spatial error model was more appropriate for our data. We set all critical values at \u03b1=0.05 and used two-tailed tests.

We then added tract-level characteristics for income and racial/ethnic composition. Last, we added variables for the presence of interstates and rurality, as indicated by USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (see Table 1). We compared models using changes in R 2 and likelihood ratio tests. Last, we conducted sensitivity analyses for edge effects (i.e., a boundary problem in spatial analysis), where the lack of data on neighboring units at the borders of the area under study can influence results. 160 Because there were no human subjects, the UNC Office of Human Research Ethics exempted this research from further review (#13-2602). Results from spatial regression show that higher rates of both female and male samesex couples were associated with a higher density of tobacco retailers (Table 2). However, the magnitude of this association was small: For each additional same-sex household per 1,000 households, the number of tobacco retailers per 1,000 people increased by 1/100. For both sexes, the first model explained only 6% of variance. Figure 2 illustrates the bivariate relationship in natural breaks of same-sex couple rates.  .

We note that document research about LGB targeting by the tobacco industry has not reported specific targeting of mentholated products. 23,24,135 Menthol is also disproportionately used by black and African American smokers; 197 researchers have consistently suggested that this is due to heavy targeting by the tobacco industry 76,197 and linked declines in menthol in Australia to declining marketing. 198 Because we did not find differences in retail marketing of menthol products, other avenues to explain this disparity should be explored. Physiological differences in sensory experience of menthol, which have been suggested by some researchers, 199 seem unlikely to explain differences for LGB people. However, menthol use is associated with being health conscious and a desire to quit, 200 and we believe future research should examine the role of these as potential reasons for LGB menthol disparities, given gendered and cultural differences in menthol preferences. 200 Last, our research focuses on the neighborhood level of the social-ecological framework and the potential role of POS tobacco marketing therein on LGB tobacco disparities. Further research is needed on other sources of influence on these disparities, such as policies increasing the per-unit cost of tobacco products, other forms of tobacco marketing (e.g., print media, corporate sponsorship), media effects, and differential effects of tobacco use cessation interventions."}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings", "text": "Same-sex couples tend to live in neighborhoods where tobacco retailer density is greater, and for male same-sex couples this association persists even after adjustments for neighborhood income, race/ethnicity, and other correlates of higher retailer density. An increase of 100 same-sex couple households in the rate of same-sex households was associated with an additional tobacco retailer for every 1,000 residents in census tracts. Although the association between the density of same-sex households and tobacco retailers was relatively small, such findings matter to our understanding of population-level influences on health. 162 This study is the first to suggest a role for neighborhoods in understanding the etiology of LGB tobacco-related health disparities. That the relationship between same-sex couples and tobacco retailer density can be explained by area demographics for female same-sex couples but not for male same-sex couples suggests differences by sex in the mechanisms by which same-sex couple households come to be associated with tobacco retailer density. Two processes may be involved in this. First, retailer density can be explained by theories of organizational ecology, 163 which consider available resources to promote the founding, evolution, and closing of retail locations. Neighborhood resources for retailers may be influenced by historical underinvestment in more urban, more African American neighborhoods. 164 With fewer large and chain stores, more smaller corner stores may be present. 77,78 Second, neighborhood selection choices of same-sex couples may be related to selection into neighborhoods that, for other reasons, have more tobacco retailer density. Mechanisms could include differences in childrearing (less for male couples) 165 and interest in school quality; in perceived safety of neighborhoods, which may differ by gender, 166 although some studies find no differences for lesbian women and gay men; 167 and in income (lower for women). 168 There is evidence that LGB people are subject to wage and hiring discrimination, the latter of which may differ by state. 129,130,169 Same-sex couples are not as wealthy as the popular imagination holds. 170 Lesbian couples are also affected by gender-based inequity in pay compared to heterosexual couples and gay male couples. 168 Early research on gay neighborhoods described a process of territorialization, rooted in masculine behavior and need to create gay [male] space. 114 Others describe a process by which gay male neighborhoods were created out of red light districts. 109,115 In qualitative research, these patterns of neighborhood formation do not parallel the formation of lesbian neighborhoods. 106,[124][125][126] Alternatively, declining residential segregation for same-sex couples 133 and rural and suburban neighborhood selection 108,120,123 as well as the feasibility of returning to communities of origin with growing social acceptance 111 could be different by gender and result differences in our models. Regardless of the different mechanisms, our findings show both the rate of male and female same-sex couples are associated with greater tobacco retailer density. In sensitivity analyses to assess edge effects, our results differ, particularly for female same-sex couple models. However, because the counties included in our study are more urban than the typical county, edge tracts appear to be qualitatively different than core tracts. Thus we cannot rule out the possibility of edge effects. For many included counties, a central city occupies the center of the tract and many edge tracts are larger and suburban in nature.

Although the census undercounts some racial/ethnic minorities, 171 census data represent a high-quality data source. Second, there is no national licensing of tobacco retailers. Although we used a unique, high-quality list of tobacco retailers that has been validated in similar studies, 65,147 there is an unknown amount of error in identifying current tobacco retailers.

Much of the literature on tobacco dependence disparities for LGB populations is based on a minority stress model. 15 Our work suggests a small role for an environmental factor that may also contribute to disparities, differences in neighborhood tobacco retailer density. The positive relationship between tobacco retailer density and same-sex couples at the tract level suggests that this may play a part in population-level disparities in tobacco use for LGB adults. The extent and quantification of that role requires further research. Given the lack of tobacco control interventions that reduce disparities, 174 identifying pro-equity interventions is an important area of future research. Policy interventions [175][176][177] to limit the density of tobacco retailers should be assessed for their impact on LGB tobacco use disparities.\nIn a 2013 systematic review, Blosnich and colleagues noted that the minority stress model is the most frequently used conceptual approach to explaining the origin of LGB tobacco disparities. 15 We attempted to extend this line of research to include spatial patterning of same-sex couples; however, our findings suggest that tobacco industry marketing at the store level is not disproportionately greater in neighborhoods with more same-sex couples. This is not to say existing market is not meaningful; even without disproportionate exposure, tobacco industry marketing may have a greater impact on LGB people than heterosexual people possibly due to LGB community appreciation for being recognized. 136,203,204 Further research is needed to assess density in relation to marketing because greater density could cause total ads per neighborhood to be higher even with no store-level differences. Chapter 2 shows evidence of greater tobacco retailer density in census tracts with higher rates of same-sex couples. Although we hope others will replicate this study, it suggests that the store-level physical marketing environment may play a limited or role or no role in the origin of LGB tobacco disparities, use of mentholated products, use of flavored little cigars, and use of e-cigarettes."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RETAILERS' POINT-OF-SALE TOBACCO MARKETING AND RATE OF SAME-SEX COUPLES IN CENSUS TRACTS Introduction", "text": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people are at much higher risk of tobacco use than their straight counterparts. 10 In addition to more than 50% higher smoking prevalence than for straight people, 134 LGB people are more likely to smoke menthol brands, flavored little cigars, filtered little cigars, and use e-cigarettes than heterosexual people. 134,[178][179][180] Data for transgender populations are scarce, 12 although similar disparities likely exist. 181 The reasons for these disparities are only partially known, and research has focused primarily on the role of discrimination, stigma, and stress. 15 Researchers have also suggested that the role of LGB bars as safe community spaces may promote tobacco use, 17,18 that the media environment may contribute as tobacco use is normative in the LGB print press and in LGBT-themed movies, [19][20][21] and that tobacco industry marketing targeted directly at LGB communities contributes to disparities. 23,24,136 In one of the tobacco industry's plans to market to gay men titled Project Sub-Culture Urban Market (SCUM), RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. planned to make its products and their marketing ubiquitous in a neighborhood considered to be a gay enclave, San Francisco's Castro. 23,27 Project SCUM called for better \"in store presence,\" better \"store front presence,\" and \"consistent POS[point-of-sale]/PDI placements,\" with an objective to \"[p]enetrate fragmented/nontraditional outlets to increase Camel's Distribution and presence.\" 27 Thus, in one of the clearest examples of tobacco industry targeted marketing to LGB people, Reynolds sought to make its marketing ubiquitous in tobacco retailers in a gay neighborhood. In studies of the etiology of LGB health disparities in tobacco, 15 neighborhood-level marketing to LGB people has been largely ignored although some research has examined political and social environments at the county level and school level in relation to LGB youth smoking. 182 Yet there is emerging demographic evidence that internal migration of LGB people within the United States results in the concentration of same-sex couples \u00a7 \u00a7 in certain types of neighborhoods, in regional cities, and in places where there are already more same-sex couples. 28,29,133 These patterns are more complex than the common view of migration of LGB people to major cities, 30 potentially reveal decision-making regarding migration that is informed by sexual orientation identity, 111,121 and indicate that LGB people have, as a population, unique spatial patterning. 28,29,132,133 If LGB people live in places where there is disproportionate exposure to tobacco industry marketing, exposure to this marketing could partially explain the presence of large disparities in tobacco use for LGB populations compared to heterosexual populations because such marketing can stymie quit attempts. Indeed, demographic research suggests that same-sex couples often live in lower income and more diverse neighborhoods, 29 especially male same-sex couples. 132 Tobacco industry marketing is frequently found at greater volume at retailers in poorer and less white neighborhoods. 76,83,87,183,184 Neighborhoods with more black residents have more menthol marketing, 80,81,185 lower menthol prices, 80 and more little cigar marketing. 186 E-cigarettes are more available in higher-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with more white residents. 187 Thus, same-sex couples are, as a population, more likely to live in a more \u00a7 \u00a7 We use the terminology \"same-sex couples\" to describe patterns available from the U.S. Census, which does not report on individual sexual orientation. When discussing the literature or conceptual issues, we use LGB. racially/ethnically diverse neighborhood with lower income; these neighborhoods are likely to have disproportionate tobacco market due to industry targeting of African American neighborhoods and lower-income neighborhoods. 87 Tobacco marketing at the POS is part of a broader marketing effort that is causally related to smoking behaviors. 31,32 Both a National Cancer Institute monograph and the Surgeon General report highlight the importance of POS marketing to tobacco prevention and control. 31,38 The tobacco industry spends the majority (85%) of its reported marketing dollars at the POS in the United States. 33,34 Two systematic reviews have synthesized the evidence of the impact of POS marketing on tobacco-related health behaviors, suggesting sufficient evidence for policy intervention. 37,188 Because tobacco use starts during adolescence, 31 POS tobacco marketing is relevant to our understanding of LGB tobacco use disparities through its role in stymieing quit attempts. Greater volume of tobacco marketing at retailers in neighborhoods with more same-sex couples could delay quit attempts or make them more likely to fail. 37,43,74,75,139,188,189 We aimed to examine the association between census tracts' rate of same-sex couple households and tobacco retailers' marketing. Because this is the first study to explore the rate of same-sex couples in neighborhoods in relation to retailers' POS marketing, our hypotheses are driven by two competing approaches. First, same-sex couples tend to live in more diverse neighborhoods, 29 which are the same neighborhoods that are more likely to be targeted by the tobacco industry. 81,83,87 These neighborhoods have smaller, non-chain stores with more marketing. 77,78,190 Second, same-sex couples have been associated with neighborhood gentrification 115,116 and rising home prices, 118 which are associated with less POS tobacco marketing. 81,85 We proposed eight hypotheses based on the first approach, given the weight of demographic evidence 29 but recognizing that this study is the first to investigate this relationship. Given the LGB tobacco disparities that exist (higher smoking prevalence, higher menthol use, and higher use of flavored little cigars) we hypothesized store marketing characteristics that would contribute to those disparities in hypotheses 1-7. We then hypothesized the likelihood of stores' sale of e-cigarettes based on evidence that same-sex couples live in more diverse neighborhoods. 187 The rate of same-sex couple households in census tracts is: Positively associated with the presence of (H 1 ) promotional offers and (H 2 ) Newport-specific (i.e., menthol) promotional offers.

We assessed reliability of marketing audits by assigning eight auditors to repeat audits at 166 stores; we calculated inter-rater reliability using Krippendorff's alpha. 191 Audits were often over a week apart; some variability is expected due to changes in the store environment. When stratified by time, audits with a short retest interval had higher reliability than those with longer intervals (data not shown).

For advertised price, we used linear models; for counts of marketing, we used generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution; and for dichotomous outcomes we used a binary distribution. For linear models we used full maximum likelihood estimation and for non-linear models we used 9-point adaptive quadrature estimation. We use different strategies for advertised cigarette prices than for other forms of marketing. Because prices are subject to state and county tax variation, we report a threelevel model with random intercepts at the tract and county levels for price variables. However, for other forms of marketing, to facilitate convergence and report consistent models, we report a two-level model with random intercepts at the tract level. Tracts have higher intra-class correlations than counties for these variables. Three-level models (see Appendices) showed no substantive differences from two-level models but exhibited convergence problems. *** Based on the previous demography literature, we selected a priori a modeling strategy, building sex-stratified models for each dependent variable.

First, the census may underestimate same-sex households and only captures information on same-sex couples. Individual LGB people are more likely to live in more urban areas than same-sex couples. 201 Individual sexual orientation data, which is not available in the census, would have strengthened our study, which is not generalizable to LGB individuals. Second, reliability on some audit measures was low to moderate; we believe this is due to an up to six-week gap between audits. This may reflect expected changes in product promotions (and reliability was negatively related to the length of time between audits); audit questions such as ours generally show good reliability. 202 But lower reliability makes it harder to detect a true effect. Given our largely null findings, this is a cause for concern. Third, because of the national scope of this study, it was not financially viable to visit retailers who were not known to be tobacco retailers. Our phone verification protocol may have biased our study against the inclusion of smaller, independent retailers who may be in higher minority and lower income neighborhoods. 77,78  Fourth, this study, because of its sampling strategy, was conducted in largely urban counties. Geographers have noted that assessing differences within higher density LGB areas reduces our ability to see differences across the country. 127 That is, by focusing in urban areas, where there are overall higher concentrations to same-sex couples, 29 we may have attenuated our ability to detect differences. Fifth, we had two limitations from our measures of product marketing. Mentholated products were limited to advertised price of a leading mentholated cigarette brand and the presence of price promotions for that same brand.

Tobacco marketing in the United States is predominantly communicated through retailers at the point of sale (POS), with major cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers spending approximately 85% of their marketing expenditures in this venue. 33,34 In this dissertation, I sought to expand our knowledge of social-ecological influences on LGB smoking by examining the neighborhood environment. I drew on a neighborhood health disparities framework developed by Bernard and colleagues and based in structuration and reciprocity theories 89 to inform the research questions and hypotheses. I then examined these using data on and from retailers in a nationally representative sample of 97 U.S. counties. In the next section, I first discuss the general pattern of results, how results align with the rationale for my hypotheses, how results relate to the theoretical framework, and results' meaning for our understanding of the origins of these disparities. I then give an overview of limitations, areas for future research, and finally implications for public health policy. As for the general pattern of results, we examined the density of tobacco retailers (Chapter 2) and the characteristics of tobacco retailers' marketing (Chapter 3) in relation to census tracts' rate of same-sex couple households. We found a positive association between tobacco retailer density and both male and female same-sex couple rates per 1,000 coupled households. Although the models found small effect sizes for the density relationship, I note that small effect sizes can make large differences to population health. 162 When I examined if tobacco retailers' marketing characteristics were associated with same-sex couple rates, I found few associations and the associations I found were small and in the opposite direction of our hypotheses. For several types of tobacco marketing, we identified no significant storelevel differences by census tract same-sex couple rate. However, if store-level marketing shows no or limited differences but there is greater density of tobacco retailers, then the total number of tobacco marketing materials in a given neighborhood may be higher for neighborhoods with more same-sex couples. That is, even with the absence of store-level differences there still may be neighborhood-level differences in the volume of tobacco marketing. Although the data used here were not designed to directly address this issue, it is an important issue for future research. The hypotheses were driven by demographic data showing same-sex couple rates are correlated with more diverse and lower neighborhood income. 29 These are characteristics of neighborhoods associated with disproportionate tobacco industry marketing. 81,83,85 Indeed, the neighborhoods in these studies show similar patterns of racial/ethnic diversity and lower income being associated with same-sex couple rates. The hypotheses were largely supported regarding density but were not supported regarding store-level marketing. Regarding density, I hypothesized that the relationship could be explained in part by other neighborhood demographic characteristics. Although this held for female same-sex couples, the relationship maintained significance for male same-sex couples. Regarding marketing characteristics of tobacco retailers, none of our hypotheses were supported except for one suggesting no difference in Marlboro prices. The non-significance of our findings suggests that the underlying rationale of our hypotheses should be reconsidered. I hypothesized greater marketing and lower mentholated prices based on overlapping demographic patterns of same-sex couples, racial/ethnic diversity, and some indicators of fewer neighborhood economic resources. Given other research that suggests decreasing neighborhood segregation of same-sex couples, 133 gentrification of traditionally gay/lesbian neighborhoods, 115,116,173 and the ability of LGB people to return to communities of origin, 111 it may be that the processes of neighborhood selection and change are, at the population level, resulting in same-sex couples living in more diverse areas. Yet at the same time, those areas may be changing in ways that attenuate tobacco industry geodemographic targeting. Here I briefly discuss how the study results relate to our conceptual framework. Our findings suggest the importance of considering theories of neighborhood health disparities (with domains of physical, economic, institutional, community organization, and local sociability influence) 89 within a broader social ecological framework to our understanding of LGBT tobacco use disparities. Chapters 2 and 3 solely addressed the physical and economic domains, finding disproportionate density of tobacco retailers in neighborhoods with more same-sex couples (i.e., in the physical domain) and limited differences (possibly even health promoting) of higher Newport prices in neighborhoods with more same-sex couples (i.e., the economic domain). The other domains are relevant to future work on tobacco retailer marketing. For example, institutional factors could include Food and Drug Administration enforcement of tobacco retailer regulations, 206 community organizations may intervene on tobacco retailers' behavior 207,208 and push for policy change, 209 and local sociability can describe the role of retailers in the social fabric of the community as well as the role of the community in moderating potential impacts of tobacco retailer marketing. There are other channels by which LGB people are marketed to by the tobacco industry (and, indeed, such marketing may been more influential given the historic invisibility of LGB consumers 136,203,204 ). Although the tobacco industry is best known for the Project Sub-Culture Urban Marketing (SCUM) marketing plan for gay neighborhoods, a major change in marketing strategy took place with the ACT-UP \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 boycott of Philip Morris. ACT-UP attempted to apply pressure to then-Senator Jesse Helms, who blocked public health HIV prevention efforts, with a boycott of Philip Morris. 26 In part to combat this boycott and to prevent future such boycotts, tobacco companies engaged in efforts to support LGB communities through donations to AIDS services organizations, arts, and other organizations supported by LGB communities as well as inclusive corporate human resources policies. 23,24,26 Reynolds American, for example, competes in the Corporate Equality Index and has received a perfect score in promoting equality for its LGB workers. 25 These efforts combine with targeted print advertising 19 and the normative nature of tobacco products in the LGB print press 20 and LGBT movies, which show an average of one incident of tobacco use for every 15 minutes of run time. 137 Although tobacco marketing targets LGB communities, it is important to contextualize this research with other forms of tobacco industry influence. The conceptual model I use, which focuses on the production of neighborhood health disparities, does not explicitly include the tobacco industry. Yet each of the domains of influence in the model has been influenced by the tobacco industry's long and successful efforts to normalize tobacco use and undermine public policies that would challenge that use. These efforts have included being convicted of racketeering 3 and clear (often successful) attempts to obfuscate and undermine science and policy. 95 More specifically, the domains of influence I examine in the Bernard framework of neighborhood disparities are influenced by the historic lack 210 of regulation of tobacco as a consumer product and by political efforts to undermine efforts to increase prices of tobacco products. Both of these, for example, impact neighborhoods where access and availability of tobacco products, marketing and low prices are relevant to the production of neighborhood health disparities. Thus this research and its conceptual model are situated in an environment where the powerful influence of the tobacco industry goes well beyond our measures of store density, counts of marketing at retailers, and presence of products. This research, like similar research, cannot disentangle the many forms of influence of the tobacco industry's marketing and policy efforts. Marketing segmentation and targeting is a normative business practice 211 and niche or \"long-tail\" approaches are increasingly recommended in public health campaigns. 212 The tobacco industry has used market segmentation based on identity, lifestyle, and image and calibrated products and marketing campaigns to draw upon these. 213 Marketing approaches have also included explicit efforts to improve corporate image and create \"evidence\" of corporate social responsibility by supporting organizations and causes that appeal to different target markets. 23 For LGBT communities, these have included efforts to show workplace equality, sponsorship of HIV/AIDS, and arts organizations. 24,26 Other strategies have included LGBT bar-based outreach by the tobacco industry, sponsorship of LGBT organizations, and presence at LGBT events (e.g., pride parades). 23,98 In 2003, Smith and Malone described the tobacco industry's targeting marketing of LGBT communities as \"underdeveloped\" and described Philip Morris's first gay-oriented media campaign, which garnered media attention and caused corporate worries of effeminizing the Marlboro man. 135,214 Most research has described print media campaigns and corporate sponsorship strategies. Research on tobacco industry targeted marketing has clearly documented an important spatial component to tobacco industry marketing: targeting by neighborhood demographics. 76 A less discussed form of spatial targeting, geodemographic targeting, uses demographic information in addition to data sources on lifestyle and spatial information to create consumer profiles by area. 215 Tobacco industry documents show the use of an Integrated Micro-Marketing Tool by Philip Morris, which uses a variety of consumer data sources on brand selection, magazine subscriptions, census data, and sales data. 99 From these each \"retail trade area\" can be targeted with specific mix of products and marketing strategies. 99 Other Philip Morris documents show use of a commercial geodemographic marketing tool, Claritas's PRIZM segmentation tool, which creates consumer profiles at the ZIP-code level. 216 PRIZM's segmentation profiles are derived from proprietary techniques, and none of the available profiles mention same-sex couples or LGBT people. 217 The only spatial evidence of tobacco industry targeting of LGBT communities comes from Project SCUM, which sought to make RJ Reynolds's products ubiquitous in gay neighborhoods in San Francisco, California. RJ Reynolds spokespeople have told journalists that the SCUM plan was never implemented. 25 Thus, there is limited evidence of how the tobacco industry operationalizes area units other than as a ZIP code in PRIZM or their own \"retail trade area.\" Nonetheless, no systematic examination of tobacco industry documents has examined geodemographic targeting by the tobacco industry's use of area units and specific neighborhood-level strategies used to target LGBT people. There are a number of important strengths and limitations to this research. First, we draw upon data from the U.S. Census, which is a uniquely high quality data source with no sampling error. However, the Census had a questionnaire design error that over-counted same-sex couples in door-to-door data collection. 149 Although we corrected for this using a recommended method, 151 some error likely exists in our measure of same-sex couples. Additionally, there is likely some underestimation of same-sex couples who did not wish to disclose sexual orientation to a government worker. Non-disclosure of same-sex couple status may be patterned by geography, income, and race. Because the Census captures only same-sex couples, not LGB individuals, this research is not generalizable to individual LGB people, who may have different patterns of neighborhood selection and health behaviors. 201 Second, we use a high quality list of tobacco retailers from 97 U.S. counties; however, as there is no licensing of tobacco retailers in the U.S., there is likely some error in our count of retailers for density calculations. 147 Nonetheless, our list, created from two databases, represents one of the largest and most comprehensive lists of tobacco retailers to date. Third, our sampling of tobacco retailers for in-person marketing audit began with phone verification of retailers. This likely biased our sample toward larger and more chain retailers. Nevertheless, with over 2,200 in-person audits, these data represent one of the larger tobacco retailer audit studies. In a 2012 systematic review of studies auditing tobacco retailer marketing, the median sample size was 208 stores. 202 Fourth, with an up-to-six-week gap for inter-rater reliability calculations, a number of our marketing variables showed lower reliability. While reliability was higher for shorter gaps and while the types of questions used on the audit generally show good reliability, 202 this is a cause for concern. Fifth, the sampling design for this study provided a nationally representative sample drawn from the lower-48 states. Given that the counties selected often had no neighbors, spatial analysis may be influenced by edge effects (i.e., missing data from outside the study boundaries). 160 Due to differences between the core and edges of counties from patterns of segregation and sprawl in the U.S., our sensitivity analyses could not confirm or rule out the presence of edge effects. Future research from a contiguous study area should examine this issue further. Sixth, our in-person audit measures of marketing characteristics were designed for a larger nationally representative study. Thus, they did not have the level of detail to fully address some of our hypotheses. For example, our measure of targeted menthol marketing did not include the count of menthol ads. Previous research has used the proportion of marketing for menthol marketing. Seventh, our study area, because of its sampling strategy focusing on higher selection of counties proportional to their size, sampled larger, more urban counties. As same-sex couples may migrate toward more urban areas, this may have limited our ability to capture the full range of differences in same-sex couple household rates. These strengths and limitations suggest that future research may be able to provide additional depth and information regarding the research questions addressed in this dissertation, which provides the first information on tobacco retailer density and marketing characteristics in relation to the spatial patterns of same-sex couples. Our findings suggest areas for future research. First, the neighborhood environment contains more than just tobacco retailers. Future research should examine a broader set of indicators of health-promoting neighborhood resources as well as those that may hinder health. This might include work incorporating bars and alcohol retailer density. 17,218,219 Methodologically, using activity space of LGBT people instead of area-unit aggregation of rates would greatly strengthen our understanding of exposure to these retailers. Similarly, future work should assess these relationships with LGBT individuals instead of same-sex couples, as spatial patterns are likely different. 201 Lastly, the contribution of neighborhood differences in tobacco retailer density and marketing should be quantified. Finally, these findings have relevance for public health policy. An emerging literature suggests potential in the U.S. for regulating tobacco marketing at the POS through land use policies, 175 permitting, 176 restrictions of store window marketing, 208 limits on the time/place/manner of tobacco sales, 220,221 and minimum price policies. 209 Many evidencebased tobacco control interventions likely increase disparities even as they improve population health, 174 an effect that has been termed \"the inequality paradox.\" 222 While efforts to increase the per-unit cost of tobacco products (e.g., excise taxes), appear to improve population health while exerting a pro-equity effect by reducing health disparities, little evidence exists about the role of POS and density policies. Only one study provides limited evidence regarding higher tobacco costs and the smoking behaviors of LGB people: a French cohort study of HIV-positive gay men found greater declines in smoking for gay men \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 than other men in the cohort following price increases. 223 This finding suggests there may be promise in price-based policies that increase the per-unit cost of tobacco products through floor prices, taxes, or other available strategies, particularly if implemented in neighborhoods and communities with higher rates of same-sex couples. Given the large disparities that exist, pro-equity interventions are needed in general and, more specifically, for LGB populations. \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 Interpretation of this study is difficult as sexual orientation was assessed by transmission route of HIV, which is an imperfect measure and makes comparison groups of drug use and heterosexual transmission. Future work should examine the role of POS tobacco marketing interventions on LGBT tobacco disparities. Equity being an important consideration, future work should also examine the role of other evidence-based tobacco prevention and cessation interventions 224 for moderation by sexual orientation. 225 These include the role of media campaigns, interventions to increase the per-unit cost of tobacco products, and the quitline, all of which are evidence-based interventions at the population level. 224 The current, albeit limited, evidence suggests no difference in outcomes by sexual orientation for intensive, non-tailored clinical tobacco dependence treatment interventions (i.e., pharmacotherapy and counseling) 226,227 and emerging evidence suggests little to no differences in receipt of advice to quit from healthcare professionals, 228 although quitline utilization may be lower among LGBT smokers. 229 Thus, while this work suggests a potential role for neighborhood-level environmental factors in LGBT tobacco use disparities, continued attention is needed on other levels of the social-ecological framework. There is a role for the neighborhood environment and the social ecological framework in our understanding of the origins of LGBT tobacco use disparities. The majority of work conducted on this topic has used a minority stress model 16   Note: Significance at the p < 0.05 level is indicated by bolded text. County population is in 100,000s.
