Of these components, BMI screening received the most criticism, including concerns that weight-based teasing would increase as a result. 4, 5 Research evaluating the prevalence of weight-based teasing indicates that it is common among children and adolescents, particularly among girls 6, 7 and overweight children. [6] [7] [8] [9] Among adolescents spanning a range of body weights, 25.5% of girls reported weight-based teasing more than a few times per year, while 22.2% of boys reported such teasing. 6 Similarly, weight-based teasing was 3 times more likely among obese children aged 10 to 14 years than among nonobese children in that age range. 9 Weight-based teasing is of particular concern because it has been associated with negative psychosocial behaviors, including disordered eating 6, 9, 10 and anxiety, 7 as well as depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. 10 A recent prospective study 8 of middle school and high school students found that teasing about weight was a significant predictor of disordered eating behaviors 5 years later such as fasting, taking diet pills, self-inducing vomiting, and using laxatives or diuretics. Therefore, the question of whether weight-based teasing is precipitated by school-based obesity policies merits investigation.\nLittle, if any, research is available to inform the public and the scientific community about the potential risks of legislative approaches to address childhood obesity that are being implemented or considered by many states. The primary objective of this study was to examine whether rates of weight-based teasing increased after the implementation of Act 1220 of 2003."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY DESIGN", "text": "Baseline cross-sectional telephone surveys among parents of Arkansas public schoolchildren were conducted in the summer of 2004, before initiation of school-based obesity policies.

Each survey included identical items focused on weight-based teasing, allowing comparison across the 3 years."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS", "text": "Survey sampling methods have been described in detail elsewhere. 11 Briefly, a stratified multistage sampling procedure was used to ensure that the sample included parents whose children attended public schools across all geographic regions (north, northwest, southwest, central, and east), school types (elementary, middle, and high school), and school sizes (small, medium, and large). Alternative and special schools and schools with enrollments of fewer than 100 students were excluded. School size was based on tertiles of enrollment, using data from the Common Core of Data of the National Center for Education Statistics. Schools were sampled, and households with listed telephone numbers within a 15-mile radius of a selected school were sampled and contacted. Households with a child attending prekindergarten to 10th grade in a selected school were interviewed. If the household contained more than 1 eligible child, a single child was selected randomly, and that child was the focus of the interview."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Parents verbally consented to complete the telephone interview. If the selected child was an adolescent (\u054614 years) and the parent consented, the adolescent was interviewed after assent. The project was reviewed and approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board.\nSurveys included questions about teasing, weight and height, demographic factors, opinions about school-based obesity policies, and attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions about dietary intake and physical activity. Survey questions assessed the parent interviewed, the family overall, and the index child. The present analyses use reports of teasing, weight and height data, and demographic characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Parent Survey", "text": "Parents provided the index child's sex and age and the parents' race/ethnicity. Weight-based teasing was determined by asking: \"Do others tease, joke, or make fun of your child because of his/ her weight?\" (yes or no). Non-weight-based teasing was assessed by asking: \"Do others tease, joke, or make fun of your child because of other reasons?\" (yes or no). The child's BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared using parent-reported height and weight and was transformed into sex-and age-specific percentiles based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Adolescent Survey", "text": "Adolescents were asked about their teasing experiences with the following 2 questions: \"Do others tease, joke, or make fun of you because of your weight?\" (yes or no) to assess weightbased teasing and \"Do others tease, joke, or make fun of you because of other reasons?\" (yes or no) for non-weight-related teasing. Adolescents also identified their racial/ethnic group."}, {"section_title": "DATA ANALYSIS", "text": "Data were weighted to be representative of families with children attending public schools in Arkansas, accounting for geographic region, school level, and school size. Child weight status was categorized as not overweight (\u03fd85th BMI percentile), overweight (85th to \u03fd95th BMI percentile), or obese (\u054695th BMI percentile). 2 Race/ethnicity was classified as white or as nonwhite. Analyses of change in the weight-based teasing prevalence over time were conducted unadjusted for adolescent-and parent-reported data, followed by analyses adjusted for sex, school size, weight status, race/ethnicity, and non-weight-based teasing. For parent-reported data, changes in teasing were first assessed across sex, age groups, and weight status and then were adjusted for sex, school size, race/ethnicity, and non-weightbased teasing. Additional analyses examined which children were most vulnerable to weight-based teasing. Wherever appropriate, 2 tests were used to measure unadjusted associations. Logistic regression models were used to adjust for covariates when examining change in weight-based teasing. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe the magnitude of association between weight-based teasing and covariates. Analyses were considered significant at \u2423=.05. All analyses were conducted using commercially available statistical software (SAS, version 9; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina)."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY SAMPLE", "text": "A total of 1551 parents were interviewed at baseline (76.1% cooperation rate).

The unadjusted prevalence of parent-reported weight-based teasing also did not significantly change for subgroups of the sample (ie, age, sex, weight status, and race/ethnicity) over time ( Table 2) .

Overweight youths were almost twice as likely to be teased about their weight compared with nonoverweight counterparts.\nRegardless of weight status, if youths were teased for non-weight-based reasons, they were more likely to be teased about their weight.

However, these sex differences depended on weight status, with nonoverweight girls more likely to experience weight-based teasing than nonoverweight boys (Table 3) . Overweight boys were half as likely to experience weightbased teasing compared with overweight girls. Overweight boys were no more likely to experience weightbased teasing than nonoverweight boys (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.89-2.18), while overweight girls were more than twice as likely to experience weight-based teasing than nonoverweight girls (2.55; 1.63-3.99).\nObese boys and obese girls were equally likely to experience weight-based teasing, with both groups being approximately 4 times more likely to be weight-based teased than their nonoverweight counterparts (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.51-5.72 for girls; and 5.50; 3.90-7.78 for boys). For boys, increased vulnerability to weight-based teasing does not occur until they are obese, but obese boys are just as likely to experience weight-based teasing as obese girls.\nSex differences in weight-based teasing were present in children and in adolescents. Weight-based teasing was 60% less likely among adolescent boys than among adolescent girls (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.62).

Agerelated differences in weight-based teasing occurred only between obese youths, such that obese children were less likely to be weight-based teased than obese adolescents (Table 3 ).

While obese children were greater than 4 times more likely to be teased than their nonover- weight peers (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 3.16-5.76), obese adolescents were almost 9 times as likely as their nonoverweight peers to experience weight-based teasing (8.82; 95% 4.55-17.08). Therefore, although adolescents were significantly more likely to experience weight-based teasing overall, this relationship seems to be driven by high rates of weight-based teasing among obese adolescents.\nThere were no age-related differences in weight-based teasing among youths who were teased for other reasons. Children and adolescents who experienced teasing for other reasons were about 3 times as likely to experience weightbased teasing as their peers who did not experience nonweight-related teasing (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 2.46-4.56 for children; and 3.09; 1.86-5.14 for adolescents)."}, {"section_title": "ADOLESCENT REPORT OF WEIGHT-BASED TEASING", "text": "No significant differences in relevant demographic characteristics were noted among adolescents in the baseline and follow-up samples.

Obese children and adolescents were substantially more likely to be weight-based teased, and overweight youths were at elevated risk compared with nonoverweight peers. Weightbased teasing was greater among white children than nonwhite children, with a marginal trend for increased teasing because of weight among white girls and no racial/ethnic differences among boys. Sex differences were apparent across the weight ranges except for obese children. Obese girls and obese boys were equally likely to experience weight-based teasing. Furthermore, weight-based teasing was significantly more frequent among obese adolescents than among obese children. Finally, across the full spectrum of weight status, children and adolescents teased for other reasons were more likely to be teased about weight, indicating a broader constellation of teasing.\nParents and adolescents were consistent in not reporting an increase in weight-based teasing in the 2 years following the implementation of Act 1220. Although adolescents were somewhat less likely to report weight-based teasing than their parents, similar trends emerged related to predictors of weight-based teasing. Specifically, obese adolescents were more likely to report weight-based teasing, and overweight adolescents were not more likely to report weight-based teasing than their nonoverweight peers. Adolescents who reported being teased for other reasons were also more likely to report weight-based teasing. Based on the adolescent data, there were no significant sex or race/ ethnic group differences in weight-based teasing.\nWe know of no previous studies that evaluated weightbased teasing after the implementation of school-based obesity prevention policies. After the passage of Act 1220, some professional and lay critics argued that the increased focus on obesity would encourage weight-based teasing and other harmful behaviors among youths. 12 However, our findings indicate that policy implementation activities did not result in greater weight-based teasing in schoolchildren overall or among obese and overweight children, who might be at greatest risk.\nResults from the present study are largely consistent with previous literature that has reported weight-based teasing to be more prevalent among overweight children and obese children. [7] [8] [9] 13 and more common among girls than among boys. 7, 13 Consistent with findings of no sex differences in the experience of weight-based teasing among obese children compared with nonoverweight children, 9 we observed no differences in weightbased teasing among obese boys and obese girls, indicating that sex differences are apparent only at lower body weights. Weight-based teasing has previously been shown to be comparable across racial/ethnic groups in studies of adolescents 6, 13 and in samples limited to overweight and obese children. 7 In our sample with broad age and weight ranges, weight-based teasing was more common among white youths. Future research may further examine these and other predictors of weight-based teasing to facilitate identification of youths at greatest risk for teasing and for possible negative psychosocial consequences. However, our findings indicate that weightbased teasing is part of the experience of youths regardless of an increased focus on obesity prevention."}, {"section_title": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS", "text": "This article about the influence of Arkansas Act 1220 of 2003 on weight-based teasing has several strengths. It is the first report (to our knowledge) to assess the influence of comprehensive school-based obesity reduction policies on weight-based teasing. Furthermore, the evaluation of Act 1220 recruited a diverse sample that allowed for broad statewide representation. This article expands the available data on adolescent weight-based teasing by surveying parents and adolescents. We are unaware of other studies that have measured weight-based teasing using multiple informants. Consideration of whether reports from parents or from adolescents are best for assessing weight-based teasing may be an important area for future investigation. Previous research has largely not examined child age or non-weight-based teasing. Given our findings that weightbased teasing is more prevalent among adolescents compared with children, future research may focus on adolescents and examine the trajectory of weight-based teasing throughout childhood. The clustering of weight-based teasing with teasing for other reasons may help inform methods of detecting teasing and interventions for targeting teasing. Although policies to address weight-based teasing have not been implemented at a statewide level in Arkansas, a recent pilot study 14 in Minnesota found that an intervention to decrease weight-based teasing was low cost and successful. The persistent rates of weight-based teasing indicate that school-based programs addressing the issue could be beneficial.\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. Because the surveys were designed to evaluate many aspects of a broad initiative, weightbased teasing was assessed with a single item. Therefore, future studies monitoring weight-based teasing in the context of school-based obesity policies may benefit from including a more comprehensive assessment that addresses teasing frequency and duration, specific perpetrators, and emotional effect. Research indicates that weight-based teasing can come from parents, siblings, and other family members, as well as from peers, 6, 10, 15 and reported rates of teasing may differ based on the respondent. For example, parents who tease their children about weight may be less likely to report weight-based teasing. Therefore, it may be important to consider the source of the teasing and the respondent in future research. A larger sample size would allow examination of differences in weight-based teasing experiences across racial/ethnic groups, and a longitudinal sample would allow examination of relationships between policy changes and weight-based teasing for individual children. It may also be important to note that a child's weight status in the present study was based on parental report. However, such reports have been previously found to be reasonably accurate, 16 and our results mirror findings reported by other weight-based teasing researchers who measured weight and height directly. 6 "}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Although further research is needed to determine whether school-based policies will reduce the childhood obesity prevalence, our findings may reassure parents, academicians, policy makers, school personnel, and health care providers that such approaches do not seem to adversely affect weight-based teasing. In fact, recent research about policies that include BMI screening in schools with parental feedback has shown initial promise for increasing parents' awareness of their child's weight status. 17, 18 Therefore, a comprehensive policy that includes BMI screening offers a promising approach to increase awareness of and to potentially reduce the prevalence of obesity among our nation's youths.
