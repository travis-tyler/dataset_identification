[{"section_title": "ORGANIZATION AND FEATURES OF THIS SPECIES ACCOUNT", "text": "Information on the habitat requirements and effects of habitat management on grassland birds were summarized from information in more than 4,000 published and unpublished papers. A range map is provided to indicate the primary breeding distribution of the species in North America, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data. The shading on the map represents the average number of individuals detected per route per year. Although birds frequently are observed outside the breeding range indicated, the maps are intended to show areas where managers might concentrate their attention. It may be ineffectual to manage habitat at a site for a species that rarely occurs in an area. The species account begins with a brief capsule statement, which provides the fundamental components or keys to management for the species. A section on range outlines the current breeding distribution of the species in North America, including details on areas that could not be mapped using BBS data. The suitable habitat section describes the breeding habitat and occasionally microhabitat characteristics of the species, especially those habitats that occur in the Great Plains. Details on habitat and microhabitat requirements often provide clues to how a species will respond to a particular management practice. If habitat needs vary appreciably in different parts of the breeding range, those needs are indicated. A table near the end of the account complements the section on suitable habitat, and lists the specific habitat characteristics for the species by individual studies. The table usually provides more details than those provided within the text. A special section on prey habitat is included for those predatory species that have more specific prey requirements. For species exhibiting area sensitivity, details on minimum area requirements are provided. It may be futile to manage a small block of suitable habitat for a species that has minimum area requirements that are larger than the area being managed. The impact of management on the species depends, in part, upon a species nesting phenology, including the length of the nesting cycle and duration of the breeding season, and the tendency to renest after nest failure. Breeding-season phenology provides representative dates of spring arrival and fall departure (and occasionally peak breeding period) for the species in the Great Plains. The duration and timing of breeding will vary from region to region and from year to year. Species' response to management summarizes the current knowledge and major findings in the literature on the effects of different management practices, including burning, mowing, and grazing, on the species. The section on management recommendations complements the previous section and summarizes specific recommendations for habitat management provided in the literature. If management recommendations differ in different portions of the species' breeding range, recommendations are treated separately by region. The literature cited contains references to published and unpublished literature on the management effects and habitat requirements of the species. This section is not meant to be a complete bibliography; a searchable, annotated bibliography of published and unpublished papers dealing with habitat needs of grassland birds and their responses to habitat management is posted at the Web site mentioned below. Wilk 1958 , Bent 1962 , McCallum et al. 1977 , Renaud 1980 , Cochran and Anderson 1987 , Shackford 1994 ).\nProximity to water may be an important factor in habitat selection (McCallum et al. 1977 , Cochran and Anderson 1987 , Shackford 1987 . In southeastern Colorado, 41% of 63 Longbilled Curlew observations occurred within 91 m of standing water, and 68% of observations were within 403 m (McCallum et al. 1977) . In southeastern Colorado and northwestern Texas, 39% of 354 curlew observations occurred within 400 m of stock ponds or irrigation facilities (King 1978) . In Utah, nests often were placed near the edges of alkali flats of the Great Salt Lake (Paton and Dalton 1994) . Shackford (1987) suggested that a drop in the water table in the panhandle of Oklahoma caused Long-billed Curlews to favor areas near irrigated fields over upland, shortgrass sites. However, in southeastern Alberta, Long-billed Curlews were less common on wet transects (a wet transect was defined as having wetlands intersecting the transect along >5% of its length) than on dry transects (Gratto-Trevor 1999) . Because curlews are known to return to the same area to nest each year regardless of whether water is still available, curlews may be found nesting far from water if water sources have disappeared (McCallum et al. 1977) .\nLong-billed Curlews in Colorado used shortgrass, mixed-grass, and weedy areas more than expected based on the availability of those habitats (King 1978) . They used agricultural areas (cropland, stubble fields, and bare ground) less than expected based on availability and did not use areas dominated by sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia). In northcentral Oregon, areas of shrubs or areas of downy brome (Bromus tectorum) intermixed with patches of Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) were preferred or used in proportion to availability by Long-billed Curlews (Pampush 1980, Pampush and Anthony 1993) . Areas of dense forbs, antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), and bunchgrasses were used in proportion to their availability or were avoided. If bunchgrass habitats were used by adults with broods, they always were contiguous with downy brome areas that were being used as nesting sites.\nLong-billed Curlews in Nebraska used areas in which 75% of the total vertical vegetation density (number of plant contacts with a thin rod inserted vertically into the canopy) was found at heights <10 cm, compared to 63% in non-use areas (Bicak 1977) . Preference for areas in which vegetation density is concentrated near ground level may be important in terms of the feeding behavior of Long-billed Curlews or their ability to see potential predators. In the Oklahoma Panhandle, curlews were usually observed in areas with clay loam soils on 0-1% slopes (Shackford 1987) .\nCurlews forage in grasslands, cultivated fields, stubble fields, wet meadows, prairie dog (Cynomys) colonies, and occasionally along wetland margins (Silloway 1900 , Salt and Wilk 1958 , Johnsgard 1980 , Shackford 1987 . During the incubation period in southwestern Idaho, Long-billed Curlew's prey-capture rate was higher in areas with short grass even though prey density was higher in areas with tall grass (vegetation measurements, prey densities, and capture rates were not given) (Bicak et al. 1982 , Bicak 1983 . Pre-laying female curlews in western Idaho foraged in shortgrass pasture within their territories during years when vegetation was short (3.6-9.7 cm tall) (Redmond 1986 ). However, during a year when vegetation was dense and tall (12-15.7 cm tall, with areas as high as 40 cm tall) due to abundant precipitation, curlews flew as far as 10 km from their territories to forage. In southcentral Washington, Long-billed Curlews preferred to forage in areas with higher topographic diversity (ridges and small dunes) and higher plant species diversity than in flatter areas with more homogeneous vegetation (Allen 1980) . Although breeding density also was higher in topographically diverse areas, most nests were placed on relatively flat ground (neither the proportion of nests nor the slope of the ground was given).\nIn the Platte River Valley of Nebraska, Long-billed Curlews nested at higher densities in wet meadows than in upland prairie (Faanes and Lingle 1995) . Within the sandhill grasslands of Nebraska, proximity of mixed-grass uplands to wet meadows was the most important criterion in nest-site selection (Bicak 1977) . Wet meadows were used for feeding, loafing, and fledging young and were aggressively defended (Bicak 1977) . Curlews in Nebraska also nested on upland slopes of native vegetation near moist meadows that were used for foraging (Johnsgard 1980) . In North Dakota, Long-billed Curlews nested on grazed mixed-grass and on shortgrass prairie (Stewart 1975) . Curlews preferred gently rolling terrain with gravelly soils. Long-billed Curlews in central Montana nested on dry portions of the mixed-grass prairie, which were elevated above their surroundings and located near wet meadows (Silloway 1900) . Grassy floodplains adjoining a creek provided nesting habitat in southeastern Colorado (Davis 1949) .\nIn northern Utah, Long-billed Curlew nests were found in irrigated and non-irrigated grass pastures and on alkali flats (Sugden 1933 , Forsythe 1972 , Paton and Dalton 1994 . Nests in that area were built in bunchgrasses, clumps of sedges (Carex spp.), stands of inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), or saltwort (Salicornia rubra) (Forsythe 1972) .\nOf 21 nests in southeastern Washington, 71% were in areas dominated by a mixture of downy brome and Sandberg's bluegrass and 29% were in areas dominated by downy brome alone (Allen 1980) . All areas with downy brome and Sandberg's bluegrass were used for nesting, whereas there were areas which were not used for nesting that contained only downy brome. Preference for areas dominated by the two plant species was attributed to a lower percent coverage of live (7%) and dead (65%) downy brome in those areas than in areas dominated by downy brome alone (live: 14%; dead: 92%). Plant communities dominated by downy brome but containing substantial amounts of tumbling mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum), as well as other grass communities (e.g., wheatgrass [Agropyron spp.] communities), were not used for nesting. In northcentral Oregon, mean nest density was highest in downy brome and Sandberg's bluegrass, followed by bunchgrasses, dense forbs and shrubs, and antelope bitterbrush (Pampush 1980, Pampush and Anthony 1993) .\nIn northcentral Oregon, several vegetation variables differed between nesting areas and non-nesting areas (Pampush 1980, Pampush and Anthony 1993) . Compared to non-nesting areas, nesting areas had shorter vegetation (24 vs. 29 cm at non-nesting areas), grass with less variation in height, total vegetation with less variation in height, grass with higher vertical density (0.8 vs. 0.2 contacts/5 cm height increment) in the 25-50 cm height increment, and shrubs with lower total vertical density (0.02 vs. 0.05 contacts/5 cm height increment). Nest density within study areas was negatively correlated with vegetation height and vertical density; nest density was positively correlated with percent cover of bare ground and with the evenness of forb height. Depredation of eggs and chicks was high in habitats other than downy brome, possibly indicating that predators were more dense or nests were more vulnerable in those habitats. In Wyoming, hayfields and pastures with nests had lower percent grass cover (mean of 20 vs. 32%), had greater forb cover (mean of 16 vs. 4%), and were drier (45 vs. 3% of random locations characterized as 'dry') than hayfields and pastures that had no nests (Cochran and Anderson 1987) .\nAlthough Long-billed Curlews select nest sites in areas with short vegetation, vegetation within 3-6 m of the nest may be taller than vegetation in the surrounding habitat patch (Cochran and Anderson 1987, Paton and Dalton 1994) . In Utah, habitat patches containing nests had shorter vegetation (mean of 5.6 cm) than random habitat patches (mean of 9.0 cm), and more bare ground 6-15 m from the nest (mean of 34-36%) than random patches (mean of 38-39%) (Paton and Dalton 1994) . At nest sites, however, vegetation <3 m from the nest was taller (mean of 6.5 cm) than vegetation 6-15 m (mean of 4.9-5.5 cm) from the nest and there was less bare ground <3 m from the nest (mean of 18%) than >6 m from the nest (mean of 28-39%). In Wyoming, nest sites were characterized by less bare ground and higher percent cover of grasses (values were not given) than random sites within hayfields and pastures that contained nests (Cochran and Anderson 1987) .\nNests often are located near cowpies or other conspicuous objects, possibly for concealment (Silloway 1900 , Bent 1962 , King 1978 , Johnsgard 1979 , Allen 1980 , Cochran and Anderson 1987 . Additionally, nests often occur on hummocks, possibly to improve visibility of predators and to prevent flooding in otherwise level fields (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . Of 59 nests in southcentral Washington, 37% were 30-100 cm from an object (e.g., big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata] branches, rocks, dirt mounds, horse manure, metal cans, bunchgrasses), 31% were <30 cm from an object, 27% were immediately adjacent to an object, and only 5% were >100 cm from an object (Allen 1980) . Big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, trees, dried tumbleweeds (Salsola), dirt mounds, rocks, tree stumps, and fences were used as perches.\nHabitat characteristics of the landscape surrounding nest sites also influence Long-billed Curlew populations (Maher 1973 , King 1978 , Allen 1980 , Pampush 1980 , Pampush and Anthony 1993 . After eggs hatch, adults and broods continue to forage in shortgrass and mixedgrass habitats, but they increase their use of areas with more vegetative cover (e.g., cropland, stubble fields, and weedy areas) (Maher 1973 (Maher , 1974 King 1978; Allen 1980; Pampush 1980; Pampush and Anthony 1993) , particularly if vegetation is sparse at the nest site (Maher 1974) . Use of areas with tall, dense vegetation in the Texas Panhandle and northcentral Oregon may have provided chicks with an important source of shade or concealment cover (King 1978 , Pampush 1980 , Pampush and Anthony 1993 . In central South Dakota, Long-billed Curlews with chicks were reported in grass that was 18 cm tall (Spomer 1981) . In Oklahoma, Longbilled Curlews with young were observed in cultivated fields, shortgrass prairie, and tame grassland (Shackford 1994) . A table near the end of the account lists the specific habitat characteristics for Long-billed Curlews by study."}, {"section_title": "Area requirements:", "text": "In southwestern Idaho, curlew densities were positively correlated with size of the management unit and with amount of area within the management unit that contained vegetation <10 cm tall (Bicak et al. 1982) . Territory size averaged about 14 ha in the most densely populated areas, and an unoccupied buffer zone of 300-500 m existed around the edge of suitable habitat (Redmond et al. 1981) . In southeastern Washington, areas with diverse topography and habitat (shrubby areas near the nest sites) supported smaller (6-8 ha) curlew territories than did open, flat, less diverse habitat, which supported larger (20 ha) territories (Allen 1980 ). An increase in the breeding population between years did not result in the reduction of territory size, but rather resulted in an increased use of marginal habitat. Allen suggested that the existing territories may have already reached a minimum size.\nAfter eggs hatch, adults and their broods often leave the nesting site. In southern Saskatchewan, one pair of adults with a brood was recorded >6.5 km from the nest site 6 d after hatching (Maher 1974, Sadler and Maher 1976 )."}, {"section_title": "Brown-headed Cowbird brood parasitism:", "text": "No known records of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) exist.\nBreeding-season phenology and site fidelity:\nLong-billed Curlews arrive on the breeding grounds from about mid-March through May and depart for the wintering grounds from August to October (Silloway 1900 , Sugden 1933 , Salt and Wilk 1958 , Bent 1962 , Maher 1974 , Stewart 1975 , Allen 1980 , Pampush 1980 , Renaud 1980 , Redmond et al. 1981 , Bicak et al. 1982 , Paton and Dalton 1994 . In some areas, fall departure may begin as early as June or July (Maher 1973 , King 1978 , Allen 1980 , especially by unsuccessful breeders (Allen 1980, Paton and Dalton 1994) . Peak breeding season in North Dakota is early May through early June (Stewart 1975) . A single renesting attempt following depredation of a first clutch was observed in southcentral Washington (Allen 1980) . The second nest also was depredated following completion of the clutch. Historically occupied sites are reused by curlews every year, and some individual birds may reuse the same territories from year to year (McCallum et al. 1977; Allen 1980; Redmond and Jenni 1982,1986) .\nSpecies' response to management:\nBurning can improve habitat for Long-billed Curlews by removing shrubs and increasing habitat openness (Pampush and Anthony 1993) . During the breeding season following a fall range fire, there was a 30% increase in the estimated curlew breeding density in western Idaho (Redmond and Jenni 1986) .\nHaying can be used to provide the short vegetation preferred by nesting curlews, but should be timed so that short vegetation is available early in the season and active nests are not damaged (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . In northcentral Oregon, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields were used for foraging as long as vegetation remained < 30 cm tall (Pampush 1980, Pampush and Anthony 1993) . In Alberta, however, Long-billed Curlews did not use haylands (Prescott 1997) . In Wyoming hay meadows, cowpies from fall-and winter-pastured cattle were scattered with branches, logs, or harrows (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . This practice, termed \"dragging,\" was detrimental because curlews often built nests near cowpies. The practice generally has declined since the 1960's but still can be common locally.\nGrazing can be beneficial if it provides suitably short vegetation, particularly during the pre-laying period (Bicak et al. 1982, Cochran and Anderson 1987) . Timing and intensity of grazing treatments should be adjusted according to local climate and habitat characteristics (Bicak et al. 1982 , Bock et al. 1993 . Curlew response to grazing over large areas of mixedgrass and shortgrass prairie was variable, but response to grazing in shrubsteppe habitats was negative (Bock et al. 1993) . In Nebraska, curlews were present on grazed areas and were absent from ungrazed areas (Cole and Sharpe 1976) . Long-billed Curlews in southern Alberta used only continuously grazed mixed-grass pasture and were absent from mixed-grass pasture grazed in early summer, spring-grazed tame pasture, and deferred-grazed (grazed after 15 July) mixedgrass pasture (Prescott et al. 1993) . In southwestern Idaho, areas grazed by sheep alone or sheep and cattle had higher densities of curlews than did areas grazed by cattle alone (Bicak et al. 1982) . Pastures that included sheep in the grazing regime had more area of short grass (32% of area sampled <10 cm tall) than areas grazed by cattle alone (19% of area sampled <10 cm tall). Curlew density was negatively correlated with height and vertical density of vegetation. Height of vegetation was negatively correlated with grazing intensity and with animal stocking rates. Sheep were less likely than cattle to follow established routes through the grassland, and thus sheep trampled and reduced the amount of dead vegetation to a greater extent than did cattle. However, Sugden (1933) cautioned that sheep are more likely to trample nests than cattle. In northwestern South Dakota, Long-billed Curlews were seen either in pastures with cattle or in unoccupied pasture; no curlews were observed in pastures with sheep (Timken 1969) . In Idaho, neither cattle nor sheep could graze dense stands of perennial wheatgrasses, such as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), to a height that was usable by curlews (Bicak et al. 1982 ). Long-billed Curlews preferred recently grazed areas and did not use areas that had not been grazed for >1 yr. Rotational and deferred grazing may provide suitable habitat, but year-long grazing was not recommended. In Wyoming, nests in areas that were grazed during the incubation period had lower hatching success rates than nests in ungrazed areas (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . Of 119 nests in western Idaho, 4.2% were lost to trampling by livestock (Redmond and Jenni 1986) .\nLong-billed Curlews prefer grazed prairie, but will forage and occasionally even nest in cropland, including fallow fields, forage crops, and grain crops (McCallum et al. 1977 , Pampush 1980 , Renaud 1980 , Cochran and Anderson 1987 , Pampush and Anthony 1993 . However, Renaud (1980) reported that curlews avoided large cultivated areas in Saskatchewan. In the Platte River Valley of Nebraska, conversion of upland prairie to cropland had a negative impact on curlews through the destruction of nesting habitat (Faanes and Lingle 1995) . Long-billed Curlews in the Oklahoma Panhandle frequently used areas with a mix of shortgrass pasture and cropland, which often was planted to wheat (Shackford 1987) . In Alberta, Long-billed Curlews were more common in areas of mixed-grass prairie than in cultivated areas (Owens and Myres 1973) . In central South Dakota, Long-billed Curlew adults were observed in a bare, disced field (Spomer 1981 ). The only two nests found in cropland during a 3-yr Oklahoma study were destroyed by agricultural operations (Shackford 1994) . Researchers suggested that Long-billed Curlews may experience better nesting success in wheat fields than in fields that are being prepared for plowing. Cochran and Anderson (1987) suggested that, although hayfields in Wyoming that had been cultivated may provide suitable vegetation and bare ground, they lacked elevated mounds and hummocks preferred for nesting. Nests in hayfields and pastures that were fertilized had lower success rates than nests in unfertilized fields, presumably due to disturbance by mechanical field operations.\nIn Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Long-billed Curlews were present on grasslands enrolled in the Permanent Cover Program (PCP) (McMaster and Davis 1998) . PCP was a Canadian program that paid farmers to seed highly erodible land to perennial grassland cover; it differed from CRP in the United States in that haying and grazing were allowed annually in PCP.\nPesticides can be detrimental to Long-billed Curlews (Blus et al. 1985) . Three Longbilled Curlews suffering convulsions or displaying erratic behavior were collected in northeastern Oregon. One male curlew appeared to have died of dieldrin poisoning and another of chlordane poisoning. The third, a female, may have sustained lethal injuries as a result of impairment from poisoning. Seven eggs collected in the same region all contained low concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites, and some (numbers not given) contained low concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and chlordane metabolites. The authors suggested that concentrations of contaminants in the eggs were too low to influence the reproductive success of Long-billed Curlews substantially."}, {"section_title": "Management Recommendations:", "text": "Prevent conversion of upland prairie to cropland (Faanes and Lingle 1995) .\nProtect breeding habitat of curlews from detrimental human activities, such as vehicular use, researcher disturbance, and shooting (Sugden 1933, Redmond and Jenni 1986) . In Saskatchewan, abandonment of breeding sites by Long-billed Curlews was attributed to researcher disturbance (Maher 1973 (Maher , 1974 .\nHabitat areas need to be >3 times as large as a Long-billed Curlew territory, which averages about 14 ha, in order for curlews to use them, because of an unoccupied buffer strip 300-500 m wide around the edge of suitable habitat (Redmond et al. 1981) .\nTall, dense residual vegetation should be removed before the pre-laying period (March to April) so that adults do not have to leave their territories to forage (Redmond 1986 ; R. L. Redmond, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, pers. comm.). Removal of residual vegetation is especially important after years of above-normal precipitation. Haying and grazing can be used to provide the short vegetation and reduced vertical plant density preferred by nesting curlews, but should be timed so that short vegetation is available early in the season (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . In southwestern Idaho, curlews avoided areas that had not been grazed within the past year (Bicak et al. 1982) .\nBurn areas where fire will improve habitat by reducing shrub coverage and increasing habitat openness (Redmond and Jenni 1986, Pampush and Anthony 1993) . During the breeding season following a fall range fire in western Idaho, the estimated curlew breeding density increased 30% (Redmond and Jenni 1986) .\nAdjust timing and intensity of grazing treatment according to environmental factors (Bicak et al. 1982 , Cochran and Anderson 1987 , Bock et al. 1993 .\nAvoid grazing during the incubation period; in Wyoming, nests in areas that were grazed during incubation had lower hatching success rates than nests in other areas (Cochran and Anderson 1987) .\nIn westcentral Wyoming, do not drag hayfields to break up cowpies; Long-billed Curlews prefer to nest near cowpies (Cochran and Anderson 1987) . However, in Idaho, curlews did not show a preference for nesting near cowpies, and R. L. Redmond (pers. comm.) , suggested that dragging 13 Preferred to forage in dune and ridge areas where topographic and vegetational diversity were high; most nests were on relatively flat ground; of 59 nests, 5% were >100 cm from an object, 37% were 30-100 cm from an object, 31% were <30 cm from an object, and 27% abutted an object (e. *In an effort to standardize terminology among studies, various descriptors were used to denote the management or type of habitat. \"Idle\" used as a modifier (e.g., idle tallgrass) denotes undisturbed or unmanaged (e.g., not burned, mowed, or grazed) areas. \"Idle\" by itself denotes unmanaged areas in which the plant species were not mentioned. Examples of \"idle\" habitats include weedy or fallow areas (e.g., oldfields), fencerows, grassed waterways, terraces, ditches, and road rights-of-way. \"Tame\" denotes introduced plant species (e.g., smooth brome [Bromus inermis]) that are not native to North American prairies. \"Hayland\" refers to any habitat that was mowed, regardless of whether the resulting cut vegetation was removed. \"Burned\" includes habitats that were burned intentionally or accidentally or those burned by natural forces (e.g., lightning). In situations where there are two or more descriptors (e.g., idle tame hayland), the first descriptor modifies the following descriptors. For example, idle tame hayland is habitat that is usually mowed annually but happened to be undisturbed during the year of the study."}]
