[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Research increasingly suggests that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in older adults, in the absence of objective cognitive dysfunction or depression, may be a harbinger of non-normative cognitive decline and eventual progression to dementia. Little is known, however, about the key features of self-report measures currently used to assess SCD. The Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative (SCD-I) Working Group is an international consortium established to develop a conceptual framework and research criteria for SCD (Jessen et al., 2014, Alzheimers Dement 10, 844-852). In the current study we systematically compared cognitive self-report items used by 19 SCD-I Working Group studies, representing 8 countries and 5 languages. We identified 34 selfreport measures comprising 640 cognitive self-report items. There was little overlap among measures-approximately 75% of measures were used by only one study. Wide variation existed in response options and item content. Items pertaining to the memory domain predominated, accounting for about 60% of items surveyed, followed by executive function and attention, with 16% and 11% of the items, respectively. Items relating to memory for the names of people and the placement of common objects were represented on the greatest percentage of measures (56% each). Working group members reported that instrument selection decisions were often based on practical considerations beyond the study of SCD specifically, such as availability and brevity of measures. Results document the heterogeneity of approaches across studies to the emerging construct of SCD. We offer preliminary recommendations for instrument selection and future research directions including identifying items and measure formats associated with important clinical outcomes. Rabin et al.

In terms of the origin of instruments, while some studies use complete published questionnaires [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] 65] , others use groups of items from existing measures [69] [70] [71] or develop new items for a specific study [12, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Finally, while selecting appropriate measures stands among the most critical decisions made in clinical research contexts, the SCD literature in many cases does not thoroughly discuss selection decisions.\nAn international consortium known as the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative (SCD-I) Working Group recently was established to develop common terminology and basic criteria for SCD to enable joint research efforts across studies and settings [23] . The current study describes the characteristics of self-report measures employed by studies represented by SCD-I investigators. Specifically, we focus on key structural and content validity issues and investigate content overlap among the questionnaire items as well as questionnaire selection decisions.

They first developed a list of cognitive domain categories under which to subsume all items. The list was revised following feedback from additional working group members and included the following categories: (1) memory (short-term/long-term/episodic/semantic/prospective memory and learning new information); (2) attention/working memory/processing speed (also includes basic attention, sustained attention, focused attention, concentration, divided attention, and alertness); (3) language (expressive and receptive language, word finding, reading, and spelling); (4) executive function (organizing, planning, switching, initiating, multi-tasking, reasoning, judgment, problem solving, decision-making, handling emergencies, impulsivity and selfregulation, clarity of mind, motor programming, handling money, and self-awareness of problems); (5) basic calculation and arithmetic tasks; (6) orientation to person, time, place, or situation; (7) general cognitive ability (memory and other thinking abilities grouped together in a single item); and (8) visuospatial skills (visuoperception, route finding, and directional orientation). The raters assigned each item to a single category using the widelyrecognized neuropsychological framework suggested by Lezak and colleagues [78] .

For items that assess ability versus disability/impairment, items could portray the intensity or severity of problems, their frequency, or impact on everyday life. The raters therefore coded for referents of severity (degree of seriousness), frequency (rate of occurrence), and impact (effect on real-world outcomes). For items that assess change, items could portray temporal change (relative to a general or specific timeframe) or atemporal change (relative to peers, a previous state, or rate of change). The raters therefore coded for both temporal and atemporal referents."}, {"section_title": "Categorization by item specificity and complexity", "text": "To address issues of item specificity and complexity, the raters coded memory items according to generality versus specificity and whether they were double-barreled (i.e., involved multiple sub-questions within the one item). A general memory item was defined as a cognitive self-report item that inquires about memory functioning without specifying a particular memory activity, problem, or task. The raters did not extend the coding of general versus specific items to cognitive domains other than memory because of the complexity of establishing coding criteria for non-memory domains. A double-barreled cognitive item was defined as an item that asks respondents to rate or respond to two or more different issues while allowing for only one response."}, {"section_title": "Most commonly occurring items", "text": "After close review of all items across the 34 questionnaires, the raters identified items with overlapping content (e.g., memory for recent events, memory for names, losing one's train of thought) despite nonidentical item wording (as there were no items with verbatim wording for both item stems and response options). Subsequently, the raters generated a list of the 10 most common item themes."}, {"section_title": "Selection decisions", "text": "To understand the decision-making behind each research group's choice of measures or development of new measures, the raters distributed a brief survey to working group members.

For working groups that reported developing their own cognitive selfreport measure (n = 9), reasons cited related to one of three general themes: (1) categorization of participants into SCD versus non-SCD groups; (2) addressing concerns specific to SCD individuals not captured by other measures; and (3) enabling the researchers to tap cognitive domains of interest. For working groups that reported using more than one self-report measure within a specific study (n = 7), reasons cited related to one of four general themes: (1) use of one measure to classify SCD and additional measure(s) to quantify specific aspects of cognitive functioning; (2) for complete coverage of domains of interest; (3) to permit more variability in the distribution of responses; and (4) to replicate what is used by other studies with similar participant demographics."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview of findings", "text": "The current study is the first to provide a systematic descriptive summary of the cognitive self-report measures used in 19 international cognitive aging studies affiliated with the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative(SCD-I)Working Group. Participating studies were diverse with respect to research environment, number of participants, number of self-report measures utilized, and language in which measures were administered. Results indicated that participating studies adopted a wide range of methods to assess SCD-specifically, 34 different self-report measures-the vast majority of which used only within a single study. Measures most commonly used across studies were the MAC-Q [57] and ECog [68] , each used at four sites, though two different timeframes were used for the MAC-Q. Almost all self-report measures were self-administered in paper-and-pencil format. The cognitive domain most often targeted was memory, followed by executive function. Items related to memory for the names of people, remembering placement of common objects, and general memory problems occurred on the greatest percentage of measures. The vast majority of memory items tapped specific, rather than general, aspects of memory functioning.\nResults highlight wide variation across studies ostensibly interested in the same construct and suggest that many factors may affect instrument choice beyond simple measurement of SCD. Most respondents indicated that measure selection decisions were based on accessibility and convenience of administration, as well as the frequency of use in the cognitive aging literature. Given that several sites reported very large sample sizes (i.e., >3,000 individuals), these decisions are understandable. Being mindful of participant and researcher burdens, this suggests that extensive batteries that fully characterize SCD may not be tractable for many sites to administer.\nOur examination of currently used instruments demonstrated wide variation in the format, range, timeframe, and response options both within and across different measures. Items also varied as to whether they tapped ability/disability versus change or decline, with time referents for intraindividual change items ranging from the past 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20+ years to various other periods of life. Given that the subjective, first-person experience of SCD has been relatively understudied, such a broad swath of response options might increase the odds of successfully extracting the unique ways that various subgroups of individuals with SCD conceptualize their concerns.\nThere are limitations to quantifying an inherently subjective phenomenon such as a complaint. First, asking about complaints in such a large number of ways, largely a theoretical with regards to SCD, raises concern that group differences may emerge from type I error (i.e., statistical bias) incidence rather than actual distinction. In addition, large variability in reference periods has been shown to result in differing question interpretation and subsequent reporting by respondents [79, 80] . With shorter reference periods (e.g., over the past 6 months), respondents tend to report specific minor issues like forgetting names, whereas longer reference periods (e.g., over the past 5 years) tend to tap global, non-specific problems such as general age-related cognitive decline. In general, attentiveness to reference periods seems advisable [81] . Moreover, Likert (and related) formats used by many measures assume an experience of SCD continuous with that of healthy older adults, distinguished only by degree of frequency or severity of complaint, which has not been established as factually evident. Indeed the perception of severity may well vary by demographic factors, such as education [82, 83] at the very least, so endorsement of the same items may mean different things to people of different experiential backgrounds. It is also noteworthy that a significant proportion of items (15%) were double-barreled, where participants could respond to either or both semantic referents, with no systematic way to address resultant ambiguity. This is particularly problematic when directly comparing selfand informant-responses to the same subjective report items, where double-barreled items make it impossible to determine which element(s) of an item stem a given respondent has addressed [84, 85] .\nA previous review of the SCD literature indicated that SCD has primarily been examined in longitudinal clinical research that follows individuals who decline to MCI and dementia over the course of the studies [86] . Retrospective examination of these cases determined that individuals often complained about declines in cognition many years before decline was detected on standardized clinical assessment-as long as 15 years before manifest cognitive impairment [86, 87] . Given that episodic memory is the cognitive domain most often impaired in MCI patients who subsequently progress to AD [30, 88] , one would expect cognitive self-report measures to focus heavily on memory. This was borne out by our data, where well over half of all items and the most frequently occurring items pertained to memory. However, these memory items are not necessarily the best items to include in SCD assessments. In fact, several population-based studies suggest that a large percentage of older adults will endorse some complaint about memory [24, 82] , and it is questionable whether the most commonly occurring memory items have the requisite sensitivity and specificity to reliably identify individuals progressing toward MCI and dementia. A report from the Nurses' Health Study indicated that trouble following a group conversation or finding one's way around familiar streets were more highly associated with the risk of cognitive impairment than memory complaints such as forgetting things from one moment to the next [89] . Finding one's way in a familiar place might be classified as orientation or as spatial memory, a specific type of memory, and following a conversation might not be considered memory at all, but rather attention or executive function. Reisberg and colleagues specifically recommended use of the term cognitive rather than memory impairment precisely because the unique phenomenology of SCD is not fully understood and may not be limited to memory [86] . Thus, memory as typically conceived might not be the primary complaint of individuals with SCD due to preclinical AD, and items from other domains may prove to have better discriminant validity at this early stage of non-normative cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Considerations", "text": "The current study was intended to serve as a selective overview of the cognitive self-report measures used in studies performed by SCD-I Working Group members, whose primary focus is on preclinical AD. Thus, we were unable to include every extant self-report measure, and this may have biased results to some extent. However, we feel confident that we have captured many of the instruments used to assess cognitive complaints in large aging cohort studies around the globe. In light of our findings, we provide several considerations for the measurement of SCD going forward:\nFirst, the heterogeneity of measures used suggests the exercise of great caution in comparing findings across studies. This does not mean that every site investigating SCD should or could use exactly the same self-assessment battery. Research environment, for example, is an important consideration in selecting measures, as complaints likely mean something different in a population/volunteer sample as compared to a clinical sample. One might assume that individuals recruited from a clinic have specific concern or worry about their cognitive function, which is different from the report of complaints per se. While the literature tends to conflate complaints and concern, recent studies suggest that specific concern or worry about cognitive function has predictive value over and above complaints [21, 47] .\nSecond, researchers might consider approaches from measurement science to inform proper selection of instruments to characterize SCD. Such approaches could be used to investigate the psychometric properties of existing measures, refine or shorten scales (by eliminating less informative items), or optimize measures for specific subgroups of the population of interest (e.g., a brief screen for SCD in a volunteer sample of highly educated older adults). Another application is computer adaptive testing, whereby participants are administered a set of self-report items tailored to their unique cognitive complaint profile estimated from previous item responses, resulting in use of the least number of items to estimate a person's underlying subjective cognitive ability [90] . To our knowledge, computer algorithms to identify specific items to administer are not currently used. At a basic level it is necessary to investigate psychometric properties such as internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and content validity, as many of the instruments we reviewed were recently developed or not formally validated.\nThird, more sophisticated and nuanced analytic approaches should be applied to the datasets on older adults available worldwide. At a minimum, this might include specificity and sensitivity analyses to derive items, for example, which discriminate SCD due to preclinical AD from healthy controls. Identifying items not only with sensitivity but also specificity for SCD is particularly salient in light of discussions about over-diagnosis and the potential to trigger a health crisis in the worried well if researchers over-screen for cognitive complaints [91] .\nFourth, future research on SCD should include items related to mood, personality, and health. While the current study focused exclusively on cognitive self-report items, there is likely to be unique variance in perceived cognitive function explained by factors such as mood, personality, and health [69, [92] [93] [94] [95] . Therefore, research on the predictive validity of self-report items should include non-cognitive measures to explain as much variance in the experience of SCD as possible. Additionally, we chose not to examine informant-report or clinician rating scales such as the Brief Cognitive Rating Scale, which incorporates various sources of information including self report of memory, objective observation of cognitive deficit on clinical interview, and assessment of functional ability [41] . These methods warrant investigation alongside self-report measures. Informant report, for example, may prove vital, not only in its own right, but also with respect to how it converges or diverges with self-report at different points along the spectrum of pathologic cognitive decline [96] ."}, {"section_title": "Fifth, the meaning of complaints tends to vary as a function of demographic characteristics such as level of education and age.", "text": "Two previous studies [82, 83] , for example, found that cognitive complaints in highly educated participants were associated with increased risk of decline to AD. In fact, self-report measures may provide the optimal approach for measuring and monitoring high-functioning individuals in the earliest stages of neurodegenerative cognitive decline, since these individuals may perform at ceiling level on neuropsychological tests [93] . Age of participants also may impact the meaning of complaints, with research suggesting that memory concerns in the young-old associate with anxiety, depression, or personality variables, while memory complaints expressed by older individuals may reflect actual impairment or decline [82] . Cross-site collaboration may be fruitful to the extent that sites share a common setting and common participant demographics. However, any sensitivity and specificity analyses may need to be conducted within the context of local norms for response frequency. [86] , the first-person experience of SCD remains largely unknown. While one might assume that SCD varies from MCI and AD only by degree, it may manifest as a phenomenologically distinct entity. This is likely to be true at least to the extent that individuals with SCD are assumed to have preserved awareness of their difficulties when compared to individuals further along the spectrum of pathologic cognitive decline. Likewise, the first-person experience of SCD due to mood or health complaints may differ from the preclinical AD form of SCD. Aside from the psychometric strategies already discussed, another approach to characterizing SCD could involve gathering qualitative data from persons classified as SCD to reveal their first-person experience, including the frequency and types of complaints most salient to them. This approach would be sensitive to possible cultural differences in the expression of SCD and allow researchers to develop measures specific to their sample demographic characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Finally, as noted by Reisberg and colleagues", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and recommendations", "text": "SCD is rapidly becoming a topic of major interest in cognitive aging and dementia. The current study is the first of its kind, involving an in-depth review of self-report measures currently employed by 19 international sites focused on the study of SCD. Overall, our findings serve as a call for international collaboration to promote harmonization and pooling of cognitive self-report data and greater consistency in the measurement of SCD. The majority of instruments we reviewed were developed within the past 10 years, in some cases within the context of a specific research study, and have limited psychometric evidence. However, validation is an ongoing process, and psychometric data are hopefully forthcoming. With these caveats in mind, we offer the following recommendations:\nA. Select measures with appropriate demographic characterization:\n\u2022 Ensure that your target population corresponds to the population for which the questionnaire was developed, understanding that response patterns may vary as a function of demography (e.g., general population versus clinicbased, young-old versus old-old participants). A good selection criterion is involvement of the target population in the questionnaire development process."}, {"section_title": "B. Select measures with adequate content coverage for the target population:", "text": "\u2022 Ensure that item stems are simple and easy to understand. Questionnaires should not contain double-barreled items, which are known to confuse respondents and undermine the accuracy of responses [84, 97] .\n\u2022 Combining multiple constructs within a single measure (e.g., items related to cognition in addition to aspects of mood, personality, or health status) may pose problems for calculating and interpreting scores and is generally not recommended.\n\u2022 Inquire about cognitive issues that older adults encounter frequently in their daily lives. For example, while older adults routinely face the task of recalling a loved one's name, some have never attempted to handle financial affairs and may rely on ideas about related skills they do possess, such as basic mathematics [117] . An optimal approach may involve tailoring questions to individuals based on knowledge about their particular experiences or medical history [117] .\n\u2022 Sample cognitive domains beyond episodic memory because items that tap into other aspects of memory, or other domains, might be more pathognomonic of non-normative decline at the early AD stages.\n\u2022 Utilize measures that contain a greater number of specific rather than general cognitive items. Specific items prompt older adults to search for explicit instances in which they experience memory problems in their daily lives, which leads to more accurate reporting. Broadly worded items, by contrast, may cause older adults to fall back upon global beliefs about their abilities and the cognitive aging process more generally [84, 117] .\n\u2022 Ensure that response options correspond to the measurement purpose. When the primary purpose is to distinguish between groups, a dichotomous scale might be sufficient. For the measurement of change over time, a Likert scale might represent a better choice. Notably, to the extent that SCD implies a perceived decline, measures should include some items targeting cognitive change. Another consideration is whether response options should target the frequency of problems (how often) versus quality of performance (how well).\nTo address frequency, it is essential to utilize manageable timeframes (e.g., number of times the individual misplaced car keys over the past week as opposed to the past year). To assess quality of performance, one should keep in mind that individuals will provide responses based on aggregated experience rather than specific problematic instances [117] .\n\u2022 Ensure that the reference period is specific, appropriate, and narrow. Inquiring about experiences over the past month, week, or even several days is preferable to longer timeframes because these windows enable older adults to focus on concrete recent events rather than rely on beliefs about \"typical\" performance or the cognitive aging process as a whole [117, 118] . Commonly used longer timeframes (e.g., >1 year, 5 years) may seem face valid but could pose difficulties for older adults trying to recall specific recent events. Vague reference periods should never be used."}, {"section_title": "C. Consider issues of psychometric adequacy:", "text": "\u2022 Select questionnaires that have been published, and for which there is at least some evidence for adequate reliability, construct validity, test-retest reliability, and differences between subgroups of interest.\n\u2022 Validate measures in the population of interest. For example, some instruments might have self and informant versions but have only been validated for one or the other population. One cannot assume that validity will generalize across populations, particularly as individuals and their informants contribute unique sources of variance to estimates of current cognitive function.\n\u2022 Consider whether items appropriately measure the cognitive domains of interest. This is especially important in cross-cultural collaborative research, where cognitive complaints might not mean the same thing in Western versus non-Western settings. Western conceptualizations of executive function, for example, often include time pressure/cognitive efficiency, which may not generalize. For questionnaires adapted for use in a different culture, language, or country, two types of validation must occur: linguistic validation (established equivalence of language) and cultural validation (item revision based on cultural appropriateness of wording and potential misinterpretation due to differences in ways of thinking about cognition) [98] ."}, {"section_title": "D. Develop new measures:", "text": "\u2022 There is a need to derive a small number of well-constructed, easy-toadminister items with adequate reliability across diverse samples of older adults. Ideally, these items should discriminate subgroups of SCD, for example those with SCD due to preclinical AD from healthy older adults (concurrent validity), as well as indicate who of the SCD group is likely to decline to MCI and AD (predictive validity). A multi-method approach to assessment incorporating objective cognitive and biomarker measures might help establish the validity of self-report items. Summary of response types and options.
