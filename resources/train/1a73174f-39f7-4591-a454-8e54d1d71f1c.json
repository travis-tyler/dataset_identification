[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "By 2050, the U.S. population is projected to grow by another 110 million, to 392 million (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). Meanwhile, there is decreasing fertility, increasing life expectancy, and a flow of immigrants producing significant demographic shifts in the U.S. population. Median age increased steadily from 34.0 in 1994 to 35.5 in 2000, and is projected to peak at 39.1 in 2035, then decrease slightly to 39.0 by 2050. This trend is driven by the Baby Boom cohort born between 1946 and 1964. The older population, persons 65 years or older, is projected to increase from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 20.7 percent in 2050. Moreover, the most rapidly growing age group is aged 85 and older. Based on the 2000 U.S. population, this age group will increase fivefold by the year 2050; from 4.2 million to 20.9 million (see Figure 1). While the sex distribution of the U.S. population is expected to change moderately, the racial/ethnic composition will experience larger changes in the same period. The proportion of persons who are members of racial minority groups (i.e. African American, Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander) is expected to increase from 19 to 27.9 percent, the proportion of Hispanics will increase from 12.6 to 24.4 percent, and the proportion of Whites will decrease from 69.4 to 50.1 percent (see Figure   2). The growing number of older adults in the U.S. population implies that there will be some shifts in consumer demand on the food system. Mature consumers are more likely to be health-conscious than younger generations. They might also have more health problems that require different types of diets.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), typical health conditions associated with the ageing process are arthritis, stroke, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Many of these problems might be either caused by or at least partly alleviated by diets. Recent studies on the link between nutrition and health problems in older age support this observation (Ahmed, 1992;Chernoff, 2001; Roberts and Barnard, 2005). Moreover, income for this age group is lower compared to working-age groups. The median income of older persons (65 or older) in 2004 was $21,102 for males and $12,080 for females. Comparatively, the median income for males aged 15 years old is $30,513 and for females it is $17,629 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005) 1 . Since income is an important determinant of food expenditure (Blisard et al, 2002), the reduction of income could directly affect older adults' demand for food by decreasing the absolute dollar amount and lower the percentage of income spent on food, partly due to other fixed expenses such as housing, utility payments, and healthcare. With the rapidly increasing population of American elderly, policy makers need to be informed about the dietary and consumption patterns of this growing segment of the U.S. population. The purpose of this report is to review what is known about changes in food consumption and nutrition intake due to shifts in consumer demographics, particularly in terms of age and the aging process in the U.S. population. The analysis includes general trends in food demand and supply in the last three decades. In particular, this literature review seeks to answer these questions: 1) Are there differences in food/nutrient consumption patterns among different cohorts at a given time? Among different cohorts over time? Within a cohort over time? The question often asked is whether people adopt a set of eating habits in their youth and keep them as they age. This is a cohort effect. Alternatively, people may display similar eating patterns at each age, i.e. their 20's to 30's or 30's to 50's or their older years. If so, are they stable over time? For example, do older people eat less beef and has this been true traditionally? 2) What are the factors that affect different food choices among cohorts or other demographic criteria at a given time, and over time? 3) What are the issues that need to be addressed to conduct this type of study, i.e. data collection, nutrient database, methods of decomposing total effect? This literature review is selective rather than exhaustive, but it is a systematic exploration of academic, government, and industry information sources related to the topic. Sources include computerized academic literature sources (e.g. JSTOR, Medline), government publications and databases (e.g. government survey data, census data), and market research data."}, {"section_title": "Differences in Food/Nutrient Consumption Patterns within a Cohort over Time", "text": "Traditionally, consumption analyses have relied on life-cycle patterns. One often finds that income rises from the early twenties into late fifties and then declines as people retire and live on reduced incomes. Likewise, food/nutrient consumption patterns can be explained based on income and age effect. However, there are others such as generational and time effects that are often ignored. Theoretically, these effects are complementary and should be analyzed together. However, it is rare to have rich enough data to support this type of analysis. So far, there are only a few studies that investigate all issues concurrently. Blisard (2001) utilized a framework of food consumption by Deaton (1997) to separate food expenditure 2 by age, cohort, and time effects. The findings showed that age effects match the life-cycle profile, cohort effects can be viewed as a secular trend that is associated with generational effects, and time is an aggregate effect that might move cohorts off their trend and age profiles. Blissard 2001 therefore it represents the whole sample. By decomposing the total effect into three components, Blisard finds that there are significant cohort effects for income and food expenditures. Each succeeding cohort realizes higher real per capita income, and since income elasticities for foods are generally positive, food expenditure would continue to increase over time. Furthermore, all other cohorts, except the youngest cohort (age 26-30), have relatively higher spending on food away from home, but this declines for the oldest cohort (61 or older). However, food at-home spending (in absolute dollars) increases steadily from the youngest to the oldest cohort. By looking at individual food groups, the findings indicated that there are significant cohort effects. Real weekly per capita spending by older cohort is higher for meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, fruits, beverages, fat and oils, and lower for cereal, bakery goods, and miscellaneous prepared foods. Expenditures for vegetables, sugar and sweets are not significantly different among all cohorts. There are some other interesting points that bear mentioning. First, there is a trend of decreasing dairy consumption with age, and with younger cohorts' decreasing expenditure on dairy, the calcium intake is falling and overall consumption of dairy products will decline in the future. Second, lower expenditures on meat, poultry, fish, and eggs by younger cohorts imply that they might ingest less fat and cholesterol than older cohorts do. Likewise, higher expenditures on cereal and bakery goods by younger consumers mean they consume higher carbohydrates, fiber, and minerals than older cohorts do. However, from this simple framework, one should keep in mind that the underlying assumption of no interaction effects between age, cohort, and time might not always hold true. There are a few earlier studies that used the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset to investigate the cohort effect concurrently with the age and time effects. Common results revealed that as people get older, total calories per day (kcal/day) and calories density (kcal/kg) intake decline. However, while percentage of calories from fat and cholesterol decrease, the percentage of calories from carbohydrates and polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids ratio increases (Elahi et al, 1983;Hallfrisch et al, 1990). In other words, aging had a negative effect on intake of calories and total fat and a positive impact on carbohydrate intake. On the other hand, cohort effects were not observed for these nutrients. The most noticeable trend was secular changes (time effects) in type and amount of fat consumed. Older people ate less fat and cholesterol, These results, however, were based on a small sample (180 individuals) of predominantly White, highly educated males and it is therefore difficult to generalize these findings to the whole population or the whole market. Using a longitudinal dataset, the Bogalusa Heart Study with a cohort of 246 young adults, a study by Demory-Luce et al (2004) shows that the transition from childhood (age 10 or younger) to young adults (from age 19 to 28) entails decreasing mean consumption of fruits/fruit juice, mixed meat, desserts, candy, and milk while increasing consumption of sweetened beverages, poultry, beef, seafood, cheese, and salty snacks. In addition, there are indicators that children's diet quality decreases when they become young adults. Particularly, there is a 10 percent decrease in the total grams of nutrient-dense foods from childhood to young adulthood even though there is an increase in total grams of food consumption in a 24-hour period. In other words, teenagers and young adults eat more empty calories. Similar findings were found by Lytle et al (2000), Kant (2003), and Kant and Graubard (2003)."}, {"section_title": "Differences in Food/Nutrient Consumption Patterns among Different Age Groups over Time", "text": "Many studies have utilized this framework of analysis, mainly due to the availability of cross-section datasets such as NHANES and BRFSS which are repeated over time. Although studies have applied different methods of analysis, as well as defined different age-groupings, time frames, and food groups, there is a consensus of findings that is summarized as follows."}, {"section_title": "3.1) Total Energy Intake and Percent of Total Energy Consumed by Key Food Groups", "text": "Total energy intake increased for all age groups except the mature ages (60 or above) from early 1970's to late 1990's, with an average increase of 12 to 18 percent. Overall, there is an average increase of 200 calories for all Americans age 2 and higher. Of these, about 46 additional calories came from meals and 148 calories from snacks. Specifically, total energy consumed from salty snacks and sweetened beverages (i.e. both fruit drinks and soft drinks) increased from 40 to 141 calories, while consumption of milk decreased from 127 to 82 calories. This trend in total energy consumed and the percentage of energy from snacks instead of meals exists in all age groups. The youngest group, however, between 2 and 18 years of age, has the highest increase while the oldest group, 60 and older, displays the lowest increase (Nielsen et al, 2002;Nielsen and Popkin, 2004;Briefel and Johnson, 2004).  For the oldest age group (65 years or older), there is a shift to healthier food choices such as lower-fat beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Also, consumption of low-fat milk and whole grain bread increased between late 1970's and late 1980's. There are no gender differences, contradicting the idea that women are changing their diets more rapidly than men (Fanelli and Stevehagen, 1985;Popkin et al, 1992). Overall, most studies show a decline in energy intake and it is likely that average intake from food energy are below the USDA recommendations for this older age group (Block et al, 1988;Gerrior 1999)."}, {"section_title": "3.2) Percentage of Calories Consumed by Location", "text": "Most studies find that there is a shift of energy intake from food-at-home to foodaway-from-home with restaurants and fast food places having the highest increase in high energy food sales. Less than 65 percent of energy is obtained from food-at-home in the mid 1990's compared to 77 percent in the late 1970's (see figure 4). In contrast, there is an increase of about 11 percentage points, from 9.4 to 21.3, of total energy consumed from restaurant/fast food sources for the average American, age 2 and older, during the same period. The group between 20 and 39 displays the largest shift; about 43 percent of total energy is from away-from-home sources in the mid 1990's for young to middle aged adults while the mature group (60 or older) consume about 21 percent away-from-home in the same period (Nielsen et al, 2002). 1 9 7 7 -7 8 1 9 8 7 -8 8 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 Year of survey"}, {"section_title": "Percentage", "text": "Away from home"}, {"section_title": "At home", "text": "Source: Compiled by ERS, USDA, from NFCS 1977-78, 1987-88, CSFII 1989-90, 1994 Another way to put this issue in perspective is looking at the history of food expenditure in terms of budget share.  1 8 6 9 1 8 9 9 1 9 1 1 1 9 2 3 1 9 3 5 1 9 4 7 1 9 5 9 1 9 7 1 1 9 8 3 1 9 9 5 "}, {"section_title": "3.3) Eating Patterns 5", "text": "Using the 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) data, several studies documented eating patterns of American elderly, age 55 and older. Core foods (e.g. those routinely consumed by this population group) were whole milk, white bread, coffee, sugar, bananas, orange juice, tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce, and eggs (Fanelli and Stevenhagen, 1985). When examining a subgroup of people age 65 and higher in this dataset, Murphy et al (1992) reported a higher percentage of the oldest age group, 85 and higher, had poorer quality diets where diet quality was defined as one that provides at least two thirds of the RDA for nine nutrients. By defining the eating pattern more broadly, whether people's intake meets the federal recommendations for each of five food groups in the food pyramid (grains, vegetables, fruit, dairy products, and meat), Krebs-Smith et al (1997) found that among 32 food-consumption patterns, six patterns representing almost 50 percent of the diets in the population fail to meet the fruit recommendation, four of which also fail to meet the grain and dairy recommendations. Only one percent of the population meets the recommendation for all five food-groups. For U.S. children and adolescents, the mean numbers of servings per day were found to be below minimum recommendations for all food groups except the dairy group for ages 2 to 11. Only one percent of youth meet all recommendations while 16 percent of them did not meet any recommendations. However, a diet that meets all recommendations resulted in nutrient intakes above the recommended dietary allowances and was high in fat (Munoz et al, 1997). Trends in fruit and vegetable consumption were evaluated by Casagrande et al (2007). The authors used two rounds of NHANES, 1988-94 and 1999-2002, to assess adult (18 years or older) intake and compare that with the five-a-day recommended level by USDA. Older consumers (aged 40 or older in 1988-1994 and those over 50 in [1999][2000][2001][2002] tended to meet the pyramid guidelines more often than younger people. However, about 89 percent of Americans failed to meet USDA guidelines. About half of the participants consumed no fruit, a quarter consumed no vegetables, and 14 percent consumed neither daily. Furthermore, there is no improvement between the two survey rounds, even after adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity. These findings highlight the phenomenon of under-consumption of nutrient-dense foods and over-consumption of energy-dense foods (of modest nutrient), or both, in all age groups and over time. More importantly, there is evidence of a substitution between the two food groups, mostly energy-dense for nutrient dense (Harnack et al, 1999;Kant, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "3.4) Macro Nutrients (Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrate) Intake Trend", "text": "Overall, the percentage of total energy consumed from fat declined, but it increased for carbohydrates and is unchanged for protein over the last three decades for U.S. consumers. Using four NHANES rounds, from 1971-74 to 1999-2000, Briefel and Johnson (2004) showed there is a decrease in total fat consumption for Americans, from 36 to 33 percent of total calories consumed, between the early 1970's and late 1990's.   (Cavadini et al, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "3.5) Selected Micro Nutrients Intake Trend", "text": "Using NFCS and two rounds of CSFII data to compare average intake as a percent of recommended diets by gender for older Americans over age 65 over a course of 20 years, Gerrior (1999) shows that although total energy consumed remains low, some micro-nutrient intake is actually higher than recommended. Since this trend is consistent over a course of 20 years, from the late 1970's to late 1990's, it implies that Americans seem to maintain their micro-nutrient intake levels as they get older. Specifically, the level of vitamin A, C, folate, iron, and sodium have been consistently higher, while dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin E, and calcium are below the daily recommended allowance (RDA) for both genders in their later years. These results are in line with more current studies which use NHANES data. Wakimoto and Block (2001) report the same decreasing patterns for calcium, iron, and zinc and constant or slightly increasing intake patterns for folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C with age from CSFII (1994-96), and NHANES II and III data. Intake of most B vitamins and vitamin E decline with age in men, but stay fairly constant in women. There are a large percentage of older men and women who consume much less than the RDA for most vitamins and nutrients. For example, only 5 percent of older women and 10 percent of older men consume the RDA for calcium (1200 mg). For the adolescent group (age 11-18), data from NFCS between 1965 and 1994-96 show increases in intake of fiber, folate, iron, and vitamin C, but decreases in intake of calcium and vitamin A over the course of 30 years. Intake of iron, folate, and calcium for females were lower than optimal for proper growth and development during adolescence years (Cavadini et al, 2000).  (Millen et al, 2004).  Source: NHIS data and Millen et al (2004) NHANES III data indicates there are demographic differences between supplement users. Female, non-Hispanic White, higher level of income, and persons with a high level of education are more likely to take supplements than others (Balluz et al, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "3.6) Supplement Use", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Factors that Affect Different Food Choice among Cohorts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4.1) Socio-Economic Factors and Time Constraint", "text": "There are several socio-economic factors that affect one's food choice: income, time constraints, education, and nutrition knowledge. Generally, higher levels of income and greater time constraints among working-age cohorts induce people to choose convenient foods and eat out more often compared to the retired cohort. Annual surveys by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) from the year 2000 to 2007 show that the percentage of older shoppers (Boomers and Matures 6 ) having home-cooked meals three or more times per week is much higher than that of younger (generation X and Y 7 ) cohorts (e.g. 84-90% compared to 59-70% in January 2007). Conversely, older cohorts eat out less frequently, particularly in the fast-food restaurants category. Older cohorts might not be able to afford the convenience of eating out, and/or might have health problems that prevent them from eating away from home (Henchy, 2001). Also, they are less likely to be in the labor force and eating lunches away from home. Furthermore, Henchy (2001)  Generally, HEI scores increased with age (for adults), education, and income (Variyam et al, 1998;Basiotis et al, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "4.2) Biological and Physiological Factors", "text": "Beside the close link between aging and changes in people's income, social status, and lifestyle, there exists strong biological and physiological aspect of aging that affects food consumption. Studies on older adults have noted that the intake of calories and most nutrients fall with increasing age (Elahi et al, 1983;Flynn et al, 1992;Wakimoto and Block, 2001). This reduction in energy intake is explained by reduced muscle mass and declined physical activity (Westerterp and Meijer, 2001), altered sensations of taste (Drewnowski, 2000), and thirst, hunger, and satiety (Morley, 2001). Furthermore, the age-associated decline in function might be caused by cumulative exposure to risk factors and effects of chronic diseases beyond the aging process (Ory and Cox, 1994;Stewart and King, 1991;Drewnowski and Warren-Mears, 2001;Drewnowski and Evans, 2001). On the other hand, food preferences are acknowledged to shift from sweet foods during adolescence towards a more diversified diet, particularly to more vegetables and fruits (Drewnowski, 1989;Birch and Sullivan, 1991). A study by Krebs-Smith et al (1995) found that age is a significant explanatory factor in vegetable intake. Similarly, using factor loading to identify consumer's characteristics with three dietary patterns, Park et al (2005) found that age is negatively associated with a \"Fat and Meat\" pattern while positively correlated with \"Vegetable\" and \"Fruit and Milk\" patterns. These ageassociated changes emphasize the differences in food consumption and dietary patterns both between cohorts over time and as people age.

These factors impact the younger and/or working-age cohorts more than older cohorts due to time constraints and the need for quick and convenient solutions for meal preparation. Indeed, Trends (2007) shows that ready-to-eat, takeout solutions is most popular among time-starved groups, i.e., full-time working women, single males, single mothers, and shoppers with older children (aged 7 to 12)."}, {"section_title": "Food Supply", "text": "Data from USDA indicates that the variety and types of food in the U.S. food system paralleled changes in consumer preferences such as demand for more healthful foods, increased ethnic diversity, and more elderly consumers in the U.S. population. Together with more effective nutrition policy and dietary guidance from the federal government, the U.S. food supply has evolved dramatically in the last three decades. From the food supply side, USDA's data on both total and loss-adjusted food supply available for consumption indicate an increase of 12 percent in average calories available (about 300 calories,) between 1985 and 2000. Of this 300 calories increase, (refined) grains accounted for 46 percent; added fat, 24 percent; added sugar, 23 percent; fruits and vegetables, 8 percent; and the meat and dairy groups together, declined by 1 percent (Putnam et al, 2002).  1909 1915 1921 1927 1933 1939 1945 1951 1957 1963 1969 1975 1981 1987 1993 1999 Year Total calories Using the same data source but in a slightly different time frame , Harnack et al (2000) document the annual per capita availability for U.S. consumers as a decrease for red meat (11.9 %) and eggs (21.1%) but an increase for poultry (84.5%), fish and shellfish (23.1%), all types of fats and oils (21.8%), cheese (111.6%), fruits and vegetables, flour and cereal products, and corn sweetener (238.4%). At the same time, availability and sales of reduced-energy and reduced-fat products also grew rapidly.

Food supply data or food balance sheets provide gross estimates of the amount and type of food available for human consumption in a country. Food supply data from around the world is documented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a United Nation organization headquartered in Rome. It provides essential information on a country's food system in three sections: domestic supply, domestic utilization, and per capita consumption values for all agricultural commodities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides the U.S. Food Supply Series, which contains the measure of per capita availability of several hundred food commodities and per capita per day nutrient availability estimates (Putnam et al, 2002). At the household level, food expenditure with prices at retail locations for specific food items purchased is collected by ACNielsen and Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). At the individual level, there are several federal datasets that provide information on food consumption, expenditures, dietary patterns, and knowledge. There are two types of data collected, cross-sectional and longitudinal (panel). Cross sectional data is useful for studying generational differences at a given time. Repeated cross sectional and longitudinal are useful in studying multiple effects by looking at either the same age group over time or following the same cohort over time.  1971-75, 1976-80, 1988-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, and 2005-06.

This trend makes analysis of patterns of food demand and consumption increasingly important for those who study nutrition and health, those who design food/feeding programs, and for those who design and sell food to consumers. This report summarizes the main findings of what is known about cohort and aging effects of food patterns and changes over time. There exist significant cohort (generational) effects related to income and food expenditures. With positive income elasticities on most foods, and with each succeeding cohort realizing higher real per capita income, food expenditures continue to increase over time. However, for the older cohorts (aged 61 and higher), food away-from-home expenditure is lower compared to other cohorts, food-at-home expenditure is the highest. Older cohorts tend to spend more on red meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, fruits, beverages, fats and oils, while younger cohorts spend more on cereal and bakery products as well as prepared foods. The trend of decreasing diet quality in the transition from childhood to young adults is observed in several studies. While total energy intake has increased for all age groups in the last three decades, the increase is highest in the youngest age group and smallest in the oldest group. Moreover, there is a shift in the oldest group to healthier food choices such as fruits and vegetables. They are more likely to take supplements, and more likely to meet the USDA recommended dietary guidelines than younger people. There are several socioeconomic factors and time constraints that differentiate food patterns among age groups. Higher income and greater time constraints among working-age cohorts induces people to choose convenience foods; they are more likely to eat out compared to the retired-age cohorts. There are also biological and physiological factors such as reduced muscle mass, declined physical activities, and altered sensation of taste and satiety, that affect food and nutrient intake of older age groups. Besides changes in nutritional recommendations, an increase in the food supply supported food consumption patterns of all consumers in the last few decades. Taken together, the studies reviewed indicate that the aging effect is greater than the cohort effect. Perhaps this reflects the type of data available, since in very few cases are the same people and their eating habits followed over a lifetime. However simulation of cohorts by looking at data for various age groups at different points in time does not strongly indicate that food habits follow one through a lifetime. We are more likely to change food consumption as we age due to a number of factors including food availability, new experiences and information, and physiological and health changes as bodies mature. With an advancing age population, continued study of food habits and nutritional needs of mature people will be a fertile topic for diet and health research and new markets."}]
