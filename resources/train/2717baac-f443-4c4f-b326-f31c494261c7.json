[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To examine whether b-amyloid (Ab) and APOE e4 status independently contribute or interact to influence longitudinal cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). Methods: Data from 490 CNs were aggregated across 3 observational cohort studies (Harvard Aging Brain Study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing; median age 5 75.0 years, 255 female), and the contributions of APOE e4 and Ab on longitudinal change over a median of 1.49 years were examined. Cognitive decline was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall scores).\nResults: High Ab participants were more likely to be APOE e41 than low Ab participants. CNs who were both high Ab and APOE e41 showed greater decline in Logical Memory immediate recall (p , 0.087), Logical Memory delayed recall (p , 0.024), and MMSE (p , 0.034) compared to all other groups (low Ab/APOE e42, low Ab/APOE e41, and high Ab/APOE e42). No other pairwise contrast was significant for any cognitive measure.\nConclusions: Clinically normal individuals who are APOE e41 and have high Ab showed the highest cognitive decline. These results suggest that Ab and APOE e4 are not redundant contributors of decline in aging but rather interact to promote decline during the short follow-up period examined in this study. Longer follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the influence of Alzheimer disease risk factors on cognitive decline in aging.

Ab accumulation in CNs is associated with subtle reductions in cross-sectional cognition 2 and heightened risk of subsequent clinical impairment. 3-5 A major risk factor for AD is the presence of the APOE e4 allele, which is associated with a decade or more decrease in AD symptom onset. 6 Although APOE e4 influences AD risk through increased Ab accumulation, 7,8 it is also possible that APOE e4 additionally has an independent contribution, or interacts with Ab, to influence decline. However, the few recent studies that have simultaneously investigated Ab and APOE e4 in CNs with respect to cognitive or functional outcomes have not converged to reveal a consistent pattern. [9] [10] [11] [12] As secondary prevention trials are being planned in asymptomatic at-risk populations, it is critical to understand the relative contributions of both Ab and APOE e4 status on shortterm cognitive decline, as these factors may influence eligibility criteria and need for From the Departments of Neurology ("}, {"section_title": "", "text": "stratification or covariate adjustment in investigating treatment effects. Large cohorts of CNs with longitudinal data are required to evaluate potential interactions in these risk factors. We explore the influence of Ab and APOE e4 on decline in a large cohort of CNs by combining data from 3 independent AD studies that included PET amyloid imaging: Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageinga (AIBL).\nMETHODS Inclusion criteria. Cohort-specific inclusion criteria can be found in previous publications. [13] [14] [15] Enrollment for CNs used in these analyses began in 2010 for HABS, 2010 for ADNI (when florbetapir imaging was included; some ADNI CNs were also previously enrolled in an earlier phase of the study), and 2006 for AIBL. All participants included in this analysis were categorized as clinically normal, had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) $26 at the baseline testing session used in these analyses. Participants were included regardless of subjective complaint status, as long as their CDR global score was 0. Participants were included if they completed a PET amyloid imaging scan within 1 year of a testing session (referred to here as baseline), had at least 1 followup cognitive session after amyloid imaging, and had APOE genotyping. APOE 2/4 CNs were excluded (,2%), given that the effect of this genotype on AD risk is unclear. Testing sessions greater than 1 year prior to amyloid imaging data were discarded (thus, baseline sessions in this analysis are not necessarily the cohort-defined baseline). Overall, 490 CNs were included in these analyses (table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and consents.", "text": "Institutional review boards approved study procedures across participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nCognitive outcomes. Change in the MMSE and Logical Memory I and IIa (i.e., immediate and delayed recall) were examined (the only cognitive scores available across all cohorts). HABS CNs completed these tests approximately every year, whereas AIBL CNs underwent testing every 1.5 years. ADNI CNs completed these tests approximately every year, with an additional MMSE assessment 6 months after the ADNI-defined baseline visit. All available testing sessions following the analysis-defined baseline session were used (HABS: n 5 86 completed 2 visits, n 5 67 3 visits, and n 5 8 4 visits. ADNI: n 5 152 2 visits, n 5 31 3 visits, and n 5 15 4 visits. AIBL: n 5 41 2 visits and n 5 90 3 visits). Baseline scores for MMSE and Logical Memory were taken from the same analysis-defined baseline session for each CN.\nStructural MRI. Details regarding MRI acquisition for ADNI and AIBL have been described elsewhere. 16, 17 For HABS, MRI scanning was completed at the Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center on a Siemens TIM Trio 3T System with a 12-channel head coil. Structural T1-weighted volumetric magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo scans were collected (repetition time/echo time/inversion time 5 6,400/2.8/900 msec, flip angle 5 8\u00b0, 1 3 1 3 1.2 mm resolution). Structural scans were used to define regions of interest (ROIs) to derive global Ab indices. To define ROIs in each participant's native space, structural scans from HABS and AIBL were processed in our laboratory using FreeSurfer v5.1. 18, 19 Since extracted amyloid PET data from ADNI are available online using FreeSurfer-derived ROIs, our laboratory did not reprocess ADNI MRI data.\nAb imaging. Ab status was derived using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) for HABS/AIBL and florbetapir for ADNI. Details regarding Ab imaging acquisition and processing are available elsewhere. 15, 17, 20 To increase consistency across cohorts, all data were analyzed as standard uptake value ratios, using a whole cerebellum reference region.\nADNI. Global florbetapir index values were downloaded (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/data-samples/access-data/). These values were derived using a previously published pipeline, using summed images with additional postprocessing to account for differences that may exist in data collected at different ADNI sites. 20, 21 In brief, summed images corresponding to 50-70 minutes postinjection were coregistered to each participant's MRI using SPM5, enabling alignment of FreeSurfer ROIs to the summed PET image. 22, 23 PET values were extracted across 4 large bilateral regions: frontal (orbitofrontal cortex/ inferior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus/superior frontal gyrus/frontal pole), cingulate (anterior cingulate/posterior cingulate/isthmus cingulate), parietal (precuneus/inferior parietal cortex/superior parietal cortex/ supramarginal gyrus), and lateral temporal (middle temporal/superior temporal gyri). These values were averaged and normalized by the whole cerebellum to yield a global Ab index for each participant.\nHABS. PiB-PET data were collected 0-60 minutes postinjection. These images were realigned and frames corresponding to 40-60 minutes postinjection were summed. The first 8 minutes of data were summed and used to guide coregistration between PET and MRI using FreeSurfer's bbregister, a surface-based coregistration algorithm. ROI extraction, averaging, and normalization were identical to the process implemented in ADNI.\nAIBL. PiB summed images corresponding to 50-70 minutes postinjection were downloaded (https://ida.loni.ucla.edu/login. jsp?project5AIBL) and coregistered to each participant's structural MRI scan using FreeSurfer's bbregister. ROI extraction, averaging, and normalization were identical to the process implemented in ADNI.\nGaussian mixture modeling. We employed a Gaussian mixture model approach to classify CNs as high or low Ab (e-analysis on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at Neurology.org). In brief, CNs with greater than 50% probability of belonging to their cohort's high Ab distribution were labeled high Ab, whereas CNs with greater than 50% probability of belonging to their cohort's low Ab distribution were classified as low Ab.\nStatistical models. Analyses were performed using R v3.0.\nGroup differences were assessed with Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and x 2 tests for dichotomous variables.\nTo investigate contributions of Ab and APOE e4 to longitudinal change in MMSE and Logical Memory scores, we implemented 2 linear mixed regression models for each cognitive outcome (e-methods): inclusion of interactions of Ab with time and APOE e4 status with time in the same model and inclusion of interactions of Ab with time and APOE e4 status with time along with their joint interaction with time. All models included main effects of baseline age, education, sex, and cohort and their interactions with time, as well as a random intercept for each participant. To explore interactions between Ab and APOE e4 status, decline across all pairwise group contrasts was performed (low Ab/APOE e42, low Ab/APOE e41, high Ab/APOE e42, and high Ab/APOE e41). All p values were 2-sided, and no multiple comparisons correction was performed.\nRESULTS Cohort characteristics. We examined 490 CNs with a median neuropsychological session follow-up period of 1.49 years (interquartile range 1.07-2.24 years; table 1). Compared to ADNI and HABS, AIBL CNs were younger and had lower education. ADNI CNs were older than HABS. There were more APOE e4 carriers in AIBL compared to the other cohorts (AIBL enriches by APOE e4 status 17 ). Baseline MMSE was higher in ADNI compared to AIBL and HABS. Logical Memory scores were lower in AIBL than ADNI and HABS. HABS had the shortest follow-up duration, whereas AIBL had the longest follow-up duration.\nAb distributions. Gaussian mixture models were fit to each cohort's distribution of Ab index values, and in each cohort a 2-distribution model was optimal (figure e-1). Classification using this method revealed a similar proportion of high and low Ab CNs across cohorts; however, classification certainty was lowest in ADNI (florbetapir) compared to ADNI/AIBL (PiB) (e-analysis and figure e-2).\nBased on this Ab classification, CNs were divided into groups based on joint Ab and APOE e4 status (table 2). As expected, high Ab CNs were more likely to be APOE e41 (p , 0.0001). Low Ab/APOE e41 CNs were younger than all other groups (p values , 0.002) and high Ab/APOE e42 CNs were older than all other groups (p values , 0.02). Low Ab/APOE e42 participants were also younger than high Ab/APOE e42 (p 5 0.0002). High Ab/APOE e41 CNs had lower education than low Ab/APOE e42 (p 5 0.028) and high Ab/APOE e42 CNs (p 5 0.036). There were no group differences in sex.\nLongitudinal change models. Terms reflecting associations with longitudinal cognitive change are summarized in table 3. In models containing interactions between APOE e4 and time as well as Ab and time as simultaneous predictors, neither term was significant. However, when the 3-way interaction between APOE, Ab, and time was included, this term was significant for both Logical Memory immediate and delayed recall. To understand these interactions, we directly contrasted groups based on Ab and APOE e4 status (low Ab/APOE e42, low Ab/APOE e41, high Ab/APOE e42, and high Ab/APOE e41 groups; figure 1 and table 4 ). High Ab/APOE e41 CNs showed significantly greater decline than all other groups for Logical Memory delayed recall, whereas all pairwise contrasts with the high Ab/APOE e41 group were significant or marginally significant for Logical Memory immediate recall. Although the interaction term between Ab and APOE e4 status was not significant (p 5 0.11) for MMSE, all pairwise contrasts with high Ab/APOE e41 were significant. No other pairwise difference was significant.\nDISCUSSION In a large dataset of clinically normal individuals, we found that both Ab and APOE e4 are contributors to cognitive decline over a short follow-up period. Specifically, there were significant interactions between Ab and APOE e4 status in predicting change on both immediate and delayed Logical Memory scores and a marginally significant interaction for change in MMSE. Across all 3 measures, this interaction revealed greater decline in high Ab/APOE e41 participants, whereas minimal decline was present in the other groups. Although our ability to identify independent contributions of Ab and APOE e4 may be limited by the high association between these risk factors, the presence of an interaction between Ab and APOE e4 status in predicting longitudinal decline suggests that these variables do not merely reflect redundant sources of information. There are several possible mechanisms that may promote cognitive decline specifically in high Ab/APOE e41 CNs. First, it is possible that APOE e4 may have Ab-independent effects on neuronal integrity, and that these effects may make individuals more vulnerable to toxic effects of Ab. For instance, these Ab-independent effects of APOE e4 may impact synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, tau phosphorylation, mitochondrial activity, neuroinflammation, or neurodevelopment. 24 The presence of Ab-independent effects of APOE e4 is further supported by functional imaging differences in young human APOE e41 (before the age at which Ab accumulation occurs) [25] [26] [27] as well as in older APOE e41 participants lacking evidence of fibrillar Ab accumulation. 28, 29 In isolation, effects of APOE e4 may not be consequential to cognition, but become consequential when co-occurring with elevated Ab. Second, it is possible that Ab and APOE e4 in conjunction impart greater levels of neuronal toxicity. Given that the apoE4 protein is less effective than apoE3/2 in responding to neuronal injury, 30 neural injury related to Ab may be enhanced within APOE e4 carriers. Third, it is possible that high Ab/APOE e41 CNs have had underlying Ab for longer than high Ab/APOE e42 CNs and are therefore further along the AD trajectory than their APOE e42 counterparts. Studies that examine incident Ab positivity will be essential to understand the contribution of Ab positivity duration on longitudinal cognitive decline. Finally, high Ab/APOE e41 CNs may have higher quantities of underlying pathology than high Ab/APOE e42 CNs, in terms of neurofibrillary tangles, 31 cerebrovascular disease, 32 vascular Ab, 33 or cerebral Ab. 34 Future studies that incorporate multiple markers of pathology in addition to Ab and APOE e4 status will be crucial to understanding mechanisms underlying cognitive decline within at-risk CNs. Our finding of greater decline in high Ab/APOE e41 CNs is seemingly at odds with 2 recent studies examining longitudinal change within CNs. Specifically, one study showed independent effects of Ab and APOE e4 in memory decline 11 while another showed that Ab, but not APOE e4, was independently associated with functional decline. 12 However, given the smaller sample sizes in these studies compared to the current analysis (Lim et al. 11 : n 5 141; Roe et al. 12 : n 5 201), it is possible that these analyses were underpowered to detect an interaction between Ab and APOE e4. Although an interaction between Ab and APOE e4 status was not identified in either aforementioned longitudinal study, studies examining cross-sectional relationships between Ab, APOE e4, and cognition within CNs have suggested the presence of an interaction. 9, 10 Although recent longitudinal datasets may be limited by smaller sample sizes than cross-sectional studies, a longitudinal design may be advantageous since it accounts for individual differences that are not due to pathologic processes. By combining data across multiple observational studies, we were able to aggregate a longitudinal dataset large enough to enable investigation of the interaction between Ab and APOE e4 status within CNs.\nAlthough combining data across HABS, ADNI, and AIBL provided a large number of CNs with known APOE e4 and Ab status, it is important to consider study design differences that may complicate the interpretation of our results. For instance, AIBL specifically recruited CNs with subjective cognitive complaints, and previous work suggests that associations between AD markers may be strongest in this group. 35 Investigating the contribution of subjective cognitive complaints was beyond the scope of the current article but is currently under investigation by our group. Another potential confound is different frequencies of neuropsychological testing across the examined cohorts. In particular, practice effects may vary depending on this frequency and we did not have enough observations per participant to model nonlinear slopes that may account for these practice effects (most participants only have 2 measurements). Additional factors that may be influential to our results are exclusion criteria and recruitment based on factors such as APOE e4 and socioeconomic status. To address differences in amyloid imaging acquisitions across cohorts, we employed a data-driven Gaussian mixture modeling approach to the Ab values from each cohort separately. There is currently no universally accepted method for defining Ab cutoff values, and little consistency exists across laboratories (with methods ranging from hierarchical clustering between CNs and patients, 17 iterative outlier removal within CNs, 36 defined in CNs , age 40, 37,38 postmortem verification 39 ). Ab cutoff values are especially problematic in elderly CNs, given that the proportion of slightly elevated participants (who are the most difficult to classify) will be higher in CN populations compared to AD. Nevertheless, our resulting classification has similarities to cutoffs derived using different approaches. For instance, the cutoff we derived for ADNI of 1.126 is similar to the cutoff of 1.11 defined in young participants (age , 56) and verified with postmortem examination of older CNs and patients. 20, 37, 39 It is also noteworthy that the classification certainty within ADNI (florbetapir) was lower than the classification certainty within HABS and AIBL (PiB). This may be due to the more limited range of florbetapir values, making CNs with slightly elevated values more difficult to classify. For the current analysis, we classified CNs using a 50% probability cutoff, which does not take into account the increased uncertainty present with florbetapir and may result in misclassification in CNs with slightly elevated florbetapir values. However, given the current paucity of studies investigating the relevance of slightly elevated Ab values in CNs, additional studies will be necessary to determine the ability of different amyloid imaging tracers to differentiate biologically relevant signal from noise in CNs with slightly elevated values.\nOur analyses have several additional limitations. The median follow-up period was short (1.49 years) and may be insufficient to adequately capture independent effects of Ab and APOE e4. Given the limited overlap in measures of cognition across studies, we were only able to examine change in MMSE and Logical Memory. More sensitive measures across different cognitive domains may be more insightful in detecting subtle early decline within CNs. Biases in participant recruitment also exist, given that the majority of CNs used in these analyses are highly educated, which may limit the generalizability of these findings to more representative samples. Ongoing follow-up of these and other large cohorts will provide further insights into the contributions of both Ab and APOE e4 to decline in CNs.\nContributions of AD risk factors to decline in aging are increasingly relevant given proposals for secondary prevention trials targeting CNs. The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (A4) trial will assess the efficacy of an antiamyloid therapy in high Ab CNs using cognitive endpoints and biomarker data. Our findings suggest that it may be important to account for APOE e4 even among high Ab participants and to potentially stratify enrollment on the basis of APOE e4 across treatment arms. Furthermore, the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative has been awarded funding to execute an antiamyloid trial targeting APOE e4 homozygotes. 40 Our findings also suggest that it may be important to account for Ab status among APOE e4 carriers. Finally, the heterogeneity observed in this study highlights the need for large samples of CNs to determine the impact of AD risk factors on longitudinal decline and to observe a treatment effect.
