First, it profiles older students and compares them to younger students, describing their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; their enrollment patterns; how they combine working and studying; and the types, sources, and amounts of financial aid they received. Next, it examines in detail certain subgroups of older students, including students who worked full time, enrolled full time, enrolled less than half time, received employer aid, enrolled without a high school diploma, and were single parents. Finally, the report examines persistence and attainment among older students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90. The report uses data primarily from the 1989-90 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90). This survey was designed to answer fundamental questions about financial aid and detail undergraduates' education expenses, sources, and types of financial aid. The report also uses data from the 1990-92 Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/92), which followed a sample of students identified in NPSAS:90 as first-time beginning postsecondary students in the 1989-90 academic year. The estimates in this report were produced using the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Data Analysis System (DAS), a software application that allows users to specify and generate tables from NPSAS and BPS data files. Each estimate produced in a table is accompanied by the standard error and weighted sample size on which the estimate was based. The DAS is available to anyone interested in further exploring the NPSAS or BPS (see appendix B for a more detailed discussion and directions for obtaining a copy). We hope that readers of this report will find it informative and useful. We welcome recommendations for improving the format, content, or analysis to make subsequent reports even more informative and accessible.  Older students were once considered \"nontraditional,\" but this is no longer an accurate characterization now that students 25 years or older make up almost one-half of the enrollment in American institutions of higher education. Over the past two decades, enrollment of older students has grown in both absolute numbers and as a proportion of total enrollment. In fall 1970, 2.4 million of the 8.6 million students enrolled in higher education (or 28 percent) were 25 years or older. By fall 1991, total enrollment had grown to 14.4 million, and 6.5 million students (or 45 percent) were 25 years or older (table 1). This increase has been due primarily to growth in the enrollment of older women. In 1970, women 25 years or older made up 10 percent of the total student population, and in 1991, 26 percent (figure 1).1"}, {"section_title": "Paul D. Planchon Associate Commissioner", "text": "According to a survey of households conducted by the Bureau of the Census, approximately 9 percent of American high school graduates aged 25 or older were enrolled in some sort of postsecondary education during the 1990-91 school year. Although postsecondary education was defined broadly and could include short courses of only a few week? Juration as well as degree and certificate programs, the survey indicates the extent to which formal learning now extends into adulthood.2 Who are these older students? Some may have had postsecondary education aspirations for a long time, but delayed enrolling immediately after high school for personal or financial reasons. Others may have completed some postsecondary education when they were younger (perhaps even earning a degree or certificate) but reenrolled later to help advance their careers, prepare for new ones, or fulfill personal goals. Still others may have dropped out of high school in their youth and then decided later that they wanted to continue their education. Postsecondary institutions must know more about the characteristics and needs of older students in order to plan, market, and deliver programs and services to them effectively. It is often argued that older students have unique needs and face significant barriers to participation in postsecondary education. For example, students who have been out of the classroom for many years sometimes need special support services upon re-entry in order to succeed academically. Campus administrative procedures and schedules often do not take into account the needs of working students. Older students may need assistance in obtaining affordable child care. In addition, some researchers and policymakers worry that the financial aid system does not serve older students well. The process for determining financial need was designed in the 1950s primarily for the financially dependent 17-or 18-year-old who was entering college as a full-time freshman. As a result, student aid programs sometimes fail to respond to the financial circumstances of older students.3 lin the rest of this report, \"older students\" are defined as those 24 years or older, because this is the age at which they are considered financially independent of their parents for financial aid purposes. 2Rebecca Sutter lin and Robert A.

The second section focuses on selected subpopulations of older undergraduates who tend to face particular barriers to participation in postsecondary education, have specific needs for support services, and have different needs for financial aid than do younger, financially dependent students. The following groups (which are not mutually exclusive) are examined: students employed full time, students enrolled full time, students enrolled less than half time, employer-aided students, students with a GED or no high school diploma, and single parents. The final section examines older students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90 (called \"beginning postsecondary students\" in this report), addressing not only the topics identified above but also their persistence and attainment through the spring of 1992. This last section also presents a multivariate analysis to help clarify whether or not 4Undergraduates made up about 88 percent of the students enrolled in postsecondary education in 1989-90. The remaining 12 percent were graduate students, most of whom (88 percent) were 24 years or older (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Student Financing of Graduate and First-Professional Education (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1993), 10. different persistence rates for younger and older students are related to age independently of other student characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "This report is based primarily on data from the 1990 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in 1989-90.

The federal government considers students to be financially independent at age 24, and no longer takes parental resources into account in evaluating need for student financial aid. Although some students in this group may still be receiving some parental support, for the most part these students rely on their own resources and, if marred, perhaps their spouse's financial resources as well. In addition to being financially independent, these older undergraduates may have worked, served in the military, be raising a family, or had other experiences that differ from those of students who began postsecondary education within a year or two of high school graduation. Note that throughout the report, the terms \"older undergraduates\" and \"older students\" are used interchangeably. Parts of the analysis were limited to first-time beginning postsecondary students. In contrast to the general population of \"older undergraduates,\" who may have started their postsecondary education when they were younger than 24 years of age, \"older first-time beginners\" in the BPS sample did not start until they were at least 24 years old. Therefore, on average, the BPS sample will be older than the general population of older students at any particular point in their academic career"}, {"section_title": "Types of Postsecondary Education Included", "text": "The NPSAS:90 sample included public; private, not-for-profit; and private, for-profit postsecondary institutions that offered programs at least 3 months long.

However, there were no sampling restrictions placed on students attending the institutions selected for NPSAS.

In public and private, not-for-profit less-than-2-year institutions, 6 to 7 percent of the students were 50 years or older. Although older students may no longer accurately be called \"nontraditional\" because of their large numbers, they tend to look quite different from younger undergraduates in terms of 5This percentage of older students differs from the 45 percent cited in the previous section because the populations of both students and institutions are different. The 45 percent in the previous section includes graduate students as well as undergraduates, students 25 years or older rather than 24 years or older, and only institutions of higher education, a more limited group than all postsecondary institutions. their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, their enrollment patterns, how they combine studying and working, and their use of financial aid to pay for their education. These differences potentially affect older students' access to postsecondary education and their ability to succeed once enrolled. To provide a brief overview: the older undergraduate population was predominantly white; low to moderate income (almost three-quarters had annual family incomes of less than $30,000); most likely to attend public less-than-4-year institutions (59 percent) and to attend part time (69 percent). Almost half were working 40 hours a week or more while they were enrolled. Like their younger counterparts, older students were more likely to be studying business and management than anything else. However, they were more likely than younger students to major in occupationally-related fields such as computer and information technology, health, and vocational/technical subjects. About one-quarter of all older students were not seeking any kind of degree, certificate, or other formal award. Thirty-nine percent of older undergraduates received some type of finan6ial aid. About 10 percent of students in their 30s or older received financial support from their employers."}, {"section_title": "Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics", "text": "The gender and racial-ethnic composition of the undergraduate population changed with age. In all undergraduate age groups shown in table 3, more than half of undergraduates were female, but students in their 30s and 40s were especially likely to be female (62 percent and 66 percent, respectively). The undergraduate population was about three-quarters white, non-Hispanic regardless of age, but older students were slightly more likely than younger students to be black, non-Hispanic and slightly less likely to be Asian. Students over 40 years of age were especially likely to be white, non-Hispanic. In the aggregate, older and younger undergraduates had different family situations (table 4). As age increased, students were more likely to be married and to have children (or other dependents), bringing increased demands on their time and, depending on whether their spouse worked or not, either additional financial resources or increased demands on their own resources. The older student population included a substantial number of single parents (21 percent of females and 8 percent of males). One-quarter of all female undergraduates in their 30s were single parents (table 5).  "}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "The vast majority of undergraduates of all ages had a high school diploma, but a GED or even the lack of any high school credential did not appear to preclude postsecondary education, especially for older students. Nine percent of older students had a GED (about three times the proportion of younger students), and 3 percent had no high school diploma or certificate at all (table 6). Older students tended to have less educated parents than their younger counterparts. They were much less likely than younger students to have a parent with a bachelor's degree (25 percent compared with 43 percent). About two-thirds of all students in their 40s or older came from families where the parents had a high school education or less, compared with only one-third of students who were less than 24 years old (figure 2). Although many older students' parents belong to a generation that was less likely to complete high school or attend college, it is noteworthy that even those aged 24-29 were less likely to have parents with a bachelor's degree and more likely to have parents with only a high school education or less. It is difficult to compare the financial situations of older and younger students because most younger students have access to parental resources, whereas students 24 years or older are usually financially independent of their parents (and are considered so for financial aid purposes). Older undergraduates as a group tended to have low to moderate family incomes (meaning their own and their spouse's incomes), with about three-quarters having incomes under $30,000 (table 7). However, older undergraduates, especially those in their 30s or older, were better off financially than younger students who were financially independent (that is, they were more likely to have incomes of $30,000 or more). Among older undergraduates, those in the 24to 29-year age group were the most likely to have incomes of less than $10,000. "}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Patterns", "text": "Choice of Institution and Degree Program Older students relied heavily on public postsecondary education, especially less-than -4year institutions. Fifty-nine percent enrolled in public less-than-4-year institutions, and another 22 percent in public 4-year institutions (table 8 and figure 3). They were spread across all types of degree programs: 33 percent were enrolled in an associate's degree program, 24 percent in a bachelor's degree program, and 17 percent in a program leading to a certificate or other formal award (table 9 and figure 4). The remaining 26 percent enrolled for courses in a program without a formal award. Older students were less likely than younger students to choose a 4-year institution or to enroll in a bachelor's degree program.  One-half or more of older students reported that the following were very important considerations in selecting a postsecondary institution: the institution offered the course of study they wanted (79 percent); they could live at home (69 percent); they were able to go to school and work (63 percent); the institution was located close to home (54 percent); and the institution had a good reputation (50 percent) (table 10). Except for the institution's reputation, younger students were less likely to consider these factors as very important. Being able to live at home became increasingly important with age, which one would expect given the greater likelihood of the student being married and having dependents. Among students less than 24 years old, only 37 percent said living at home was \"very important.\" Among students 24-29 years old, it was very important to 57 percent; among students in their 30s, 74 percent; and among students in their 40s or older, 79 percent. Although being able to obtain financial aid might be an important consideration for some older students in deciding whether or not to enroll in postsecondary education (the NPSAS:90 data do not address this), compared with other considerations, it was not that important to older students in choosing a specific institution (24 percent said it was very important). However, 41 percent of older students attended less than half time and would, therefore, have had less need for financial aid."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Intensity", "text": "Older undergraduates were predominantly part-time students. Only about one-third (31 percent) attended full time (compared with 73 percent of younger students), and the percentage who attended full time decreased with age (table 11).

Overall, almost one-half (46 percent) of the older undergraduates were working full time (defined here as 40 or more hours per week6), but another one-quarter were not working at all (table 13). Students in their 40s or older were the most likely not to be working while enrolled. 6Full-time work is often defined as 35 hours or more per week. However, 40 hours was used here to help distinguish between students who were primarily workers and students who were primarily students but worked a substantial number of hours while enrolled. Comparing older and younger students, older students were more likely to work full time or not work at all while enrolled, while younger students were more likely to be working part time. The pattern was the same for both full-and part-time students. Looking at work and attendance status together, 38 percent of older undergraduates enrolled part time and worked full time (figure 5).

Thirty-four percent received grants (averaging about $1,700), and 15 percent took out loans through student aid programs (averaging about $3,200). Included in the percentage receiving grants were 9 percent who received assistance from their employers (averaging about $800). Students in their 40s or older were the least likely (30 percent) to receive aid (figure 6). The amounts and types of aid received did vary, as one would expect, according to the type of institution attended and the student's attendance status (tables 15 and 16).      Grants to older students were more common in the more costly institutions (private, notfor-profit 4-year institutions and private, for-profit institutions). Relatively few older students who attended less-than-4-year institutions found it necessary to take out loans (5 percent). Borrowing. through student loan programs was most common in private, for-profit institutions (58 percent). Among older undergraduates, employer aid was most often received by students attending private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, where about one in five students 30 years or older received employer support. The average amount these older students received was about $1,600. Overall, older students were somewhat less likely than younger students to receive financial aid (39 percent compared with 44 percent). However, because age is not a criterion for distributing financial aid, this difference reflects variations in other characteristics related to aid awards. For example, older students were much more likely than younger students to attend the relatively inexpensive public less-than-4-year institutions (59 percent compared with 33 percent) (table 8). In the case of loans, differences in willingness to borrow may also contribute to the different percentages of older and younger students with loans (21 percent and 15 percent, respectively). A notable difference exists between younger and older undergraduates in the percentage receiving employer aid. Overall, it was much more often available to older students (9 percent) than younger students (1 percent). This could indicate a greater willingness on the part of employers to support education for full-time workers (older students were more likely than younger ones to be working full time, 46 percent compared with 23 percent) (table 13). Employee benefits, of which tuition aid is often one, are often reserved for full-time employees. Employers might also be more willing to support more experienced workers, those who have longer tenure with their company, or both. Among older students who worked full time, about one-quarter of those whose employers gave them $1,000 or more had incomes of $50,000 or more.? Students who had never applied for financial aid were asked for the most important reason why they had not done so. Forty-one percent of all older students reported that they did not apply for financial aid because they were able to pay for their own education (about the same percentage as younger students) (table 17). Another 26 percent said that their income was too high, but they were not as likely as younger students to give this as the most important reason. Avoiding debt was not a stated concern for a very large proportion of students of any age, but was more of an issue for older students: 10 percent of older students said that a desire to avoid debt was the most important reason for not applying for aid, compared with 5 percent of younger students. "}, {"section_title": "Subgroups of Older Students", "text": "Although older students as a group appear to differ in many ways from younger students, they are not a homogeneous group. Students with different backgrounds and enrollment and work patterns have varied reasons for being enrolled, choosing what and where they study, and ways of financing their education (tables 18-24). To help clarify some of these differences, this section looks at selected populations of older students separately: students employed full time, students enrolled full time, students enrolled less than half time, employer-aided students, students without high school diplomas, women, and single parents. Note, however, that the groups described here are not mutually exclusive."}, {"section_title": "Employed Full Time", "text": "Many older students hold down full-time jobs at the same time that they are enrolled in postsecondary education programs. In 1989-90, almost one-half (46 percent) of all older undergraduates worked 40 or more hours per week (table 23). Most of these full-time workers enrolled part time (about 85 percent) (table 20), and about two-thirds selected public less-than -4year institutions (table 18). For older students who work full time, availability of the course of study they want and convenient scheduling of classes are of prime importance. About three-quarters of the older undergraduates who worked said the fact that the institution offered the course of study they wanted and that they could work while attending were very important considerations in choosing an institution (table 21). Most likely because they already had jobs, full-time workers were less likely than those who did not work at all to report that factors related to obtaining a job (the institution's reputation, its reputation for placing graduates, and being able to finish in a shorter time) or obtaining financial aid were very important considerations. Because they were working while attending mostly low-cost institutions and were usually part-time students, full-time workers as a group were not very dependent on (and may not have been eligible for) financial aid. About one-quarter received some type of aid, but 16 percent received employer aid (table 24). Relatively few took out loans (7 percent compared with 15-28 percent of older students who were not working full time). Relatively few older students who worked full time received direct financial assistance from their employers. However, they were more likely than part-time workers to get this kind of help (16 percent compared with 8 percent of those who worked 30-39 hours per week and 2 percent of those who worked fewer hours or not at all."}, {"section_title": "Enrolled Full Time", "text": "Older undergraduates who enrolled full time were a minority of all older students, but a sizable group nevertheless (31 percent) (table 20). About one-quarter of older full-time students worked full time as well (table 23). Older students who enrolled in postsecondary education full time were less concentrated in public less-than-4-year institutions than were other older students. They were much more likely than those who enrolled less than half time to select a 4-year institution or a private, for-profit institution (table 18). In selecting an institution, older full-time students had different priorities than older parttime students. They were more likely than those who attended less than half time to consider the availability of the desired course of study, the institution's overall reputation and reputation for placing graduates, finishing in a shorter time, tuition, and financial aid as very important factors in their choices (table 21). On the other hand, they were less likely to be concerned with being able to work while attending, living at home, and the proximity of the institution to their residence. Financial aid availability was a very important consideration in choice of institution to 44 percent of full-time older students (compared with 20 percent of at-least-half-time students and 12 percent of less-than-half-time students (table 21).

They were much more likely than students who attended with greater intensity to be enrolled in a course of study not leading to a degree or certificate (37 percent compared with 13 percent of full-time students and 20 percent for half-time-or-more students) (table 19). Those who were in a degree program were most likely to be in an associate's degree program. For about three-quarters of the older students who were enrolled less than half time, the availability of the desired course of study, being able to work while attending, and being able to live at home were very important considerations when selecting their institution (table 21). Twenty-two percent of students enrolled less than half time received some type of financial aid, primarily employer aid. Thirteen percent received an average of $553 from their employer (table 24). Only 2 percent took out loans through a student loan program."}, {"section_title": "Employer Aided", "text": "Businesses are considered important beneficiaries of their employees' education. Recognizing this, some employers pay some or all of their employees' postsecondary education costs. Employer aid may be distributed to individuals entirely at the employer's discretion, made available to some or all types of employees as a formal employee benefit, or made available to unionized employees as part of a collective bargaining agreement. In some cases, employers place restrictions on what recipients can study or what institutions they can attend. For example, employers may require that the course of study be related to the employee's job or lead to a degree, or they may place a cap on the amount of tuition they will pay. In 1989-90, about 9 percent of all older undergraduates received financial assistance from their employer (table 24). Larger amounts of employer aid were associated with full-time attendance and with enrollment at more expensive institutions, but the nature of the relationship is unclear. Did employers provide more aid because the employees wanted to attend more costly institutions, or did students select more costly institutions because their employers offered generous education benefits? About three-quarters of those with relatively small amounts of employer aid (less than $500) were enrolled less than half time (table 20). Those with $1,000 or more in employer aid were more likely than those with less aid to be enrolled full time. Almost one-half (47 percent) of older students with relatively large amounts of employer aid ($1,000 or more) were enrolled in bachelor's degree programs (table 19). They were more likely than those with less than $500 or no aid to choose this course of study. From 78 percent to 85 percent of older students with employer aid (depending on the amount of aid) reported that being able to work while enrolled was a very important consideration in their choice of institution (compared with 61 percent of those without employer aid) (table 21). Employer-aided students were less likely than other students to rate tuition and fees as a very important consideration (17 percent to 23 percent, compared with 38 percent). This is not surprising, because their employers were paying at least part of their tuition hnd fees. Employers appeared to help primarily their employees who continued to work full time while attending: 75 percent to 84 percent of older students with employer aid (depending on the amount of aid) were working full time, compared with 43 percent of those without employer aid (table 23). They were also particularly likely to help those who were studying business: 41 percent of those with $1,000 or more in aid, compared with 23 percent of older students without employer aid, identified business as their major field of study (table 22). This reflects the fact that employers may require that employer-supported education be job-related."}, {"section_title": "Without High School Diplomas", "text": "While most older undergraduates received a high school diploma before entering postsecondary education, 9 percent entered with a GED/ certificate, and 3 percent with no high school diploma at all (table 6). While this shows that the lack of a high school diploma does not preclude postsecondary education, the postsecondary experiences of older students without diplomas were quite different from those with high school diplomas. Older students without diplomas were more likely to select a private, for-profit institution: 16 percent of those with a GED/certificate and 36 percent of those with no high school credential, compared with 7 percent of those with high school diplomas (table 18). Older students without high school diplomas were more likely than those with diplomas to be enrolled full time, reflecting in part their greater concentration in private, for-profit institutions (tables 18 and 20). And; consistent with attending full time, older students without high school diplomas were less likely than those with them to be working while enrolled (table 23). Roughly half of the older students with a GED/certificate and about 80 percent of those with no high school diploma or certificate were enrolled in postsecondary certificate programs or programs with no award (table 19). Although they were only half as likely as older students with high school diplomas to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, some 13 percent of older students with a GED/certificate were enrolled at the baccalaureate level. About two-thirds of the older students with no high school diploma were in business management (22 percent), vocational/technical studies (21 percent), or \"other\" technical/professional (25 percent) fields (table 22). The reported importance of various considerations in the choice of institution reflects the concerns of full-time students attending institutions with high costs (table 21). For example, older students with a GED/certificate or no high school credential were more likely than those with a diploma to say that the following were very important considerations: the reputation of the institution for placing graduates, being able to finish in a shorter time, and obtaining the financial aid they needed.

Obviously, most of those starting a bachelor's degree would not have had time to finish, while those enrolled in short-term certificate programs would have had ample time to complete them. For the students who were not seeking any kind of formal award, there is no way to tell whether or not they persisted to achieve their goals. Persistence patterns for students with certificate and degree objectives were different for older and younger beginning postsecondary students. Of the older beginning postsecondary students seeking a certificate in 1989-90,36 percent completed within 9 months, and another 19 percent completed in more than 9 months. A few (4 percent) were still enrolled in the spring of 1992, and the rest (41 percent) had left out without earning the certificate (table 25). The most striking difference between older and younger beginners was the higher percentage of older students completing a certificate within 9 months: 36 percent for older students compared with 25 percent for younger students. Older first-time beginners starting an associate's degree in 1989-90 were less likely than younger first-time beginners to earn the degree by spring of 1992 (4 percent compared with 15 percent) (table 26). This is to be expected, as older students were more likely to be enrolled part time (table 11). However, older students were less likely to have been continuously enrolled through this period (10 percent compared with 22 percent). And, they were much more likely to have left without reenrolling (66 percent versus 40 percent) (figure 7). This was true whether they started as full-or part-time students. While spring 1992 was too early to compare completion rates for students seeking bachelor's degrees, older students beginning in 1989-90 tended to be farther away from this goal than were younger students. They were only half as likely to be continuously enrolled (29 percent compared with 58 percent) and were about twice as likely to leave without reenrolling (46 percent compared with 23 percent) (table 27).

Twenty-two percent had attended career-related lectures. Relatively few had joined school clubs (9 percent), participated in intramural activities (11 percent), or sought assistance from student assistance centers or programs (13 percent). Younger first-time beginning postsecondary students were more likely to participate in all of these activities. This might be because the activities are designed with younger students' interests and schedules in mind, that work and family demands placed on older students do not leave them time to participate, or both. Older first-time beginners also tended to have less contact with faculty than younger firsttime beginners. They were less likely to have talked about academic matters with faculty (51 percent compared with 68 percent), met with an advisor concerning academic plans (44 percent compared with 61 percent), or had contact with faculty outside of class (31 percent compared with 46 percent) (table 30). 9The best known work has been done by Vincent.

Older beginning postsecondary students seeking associate's and bachelor's degrees were found to be more likely to leave before completing a degree or reenrolling by spring of 1992 than were younger beginning postsecondary students with the same stated degree goals. However, this study's approach of controlling for group differences by crosstabulation has limitations with survey data, because sample size limits the number of cells into which the data can be usefully subdivided and there are complex interrelationships among variables that cannot be disentangled in tabular analyses. To overcome these limitations, linear models are frequently used to examine several sets of variables simultaneously. This section proposes one such model (linear regression) to estimate these effects (adjusted means).10 The regression model takes into account the effect of all variables simultaneously and, hence, controls for overlapping effects that can influence tabular findings.. By estimating the joint effect of all variables taken together, regression models can be used to test individual parameters while \"holding constant\" the influence of other variables. Of particular interest here is whether the pattern of greater likelihood of leaving without completing or reenrolling found among older beginning postsecondary students is related to factors unique to older students or to other characteristics (such as attendance intensity, for example) that are more common among the older undergraduate population. Regression analysis allows us to control for these other characteristics and to determine the effects of variables other than age on the likelihood of leaving without completing or reenrolling. In order to investigate the contribution of various factors that appeared in the tabular analysis to be associated with persistence, separate regressions were estimated using the proportions of beginning postsecondary students seeking associate's and bachelor's degrees who left without attaining a degree or reenrolling by spring of 1992 as the dependent variables. The models were reduced by removing variables without explanatory power.\" The regression coefficients were then used to adjust the means (in this case, proportions). The results of these analyses follow. Table 31 shows the adjusted proportions of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who stated that they were seeking an associate's degree who left postsecondary education without earning their degree or reenrolling by spring of 1992, taking into account other student and institutional characteristics. The unadjusted means are included for comparison."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Postsecondary Students Seeking an Associate's Degree", "text": "Overall, older beginning postsecondary students seeking an associate's degree were much more likely than their younger counterparts to leave without completing or reenrolling (table 26), and table 31 shows that this pattern persists even when other factors are taken into account. Among the factors for which we were able to control, the only characteristic other than age that appears to affect the likelihood of leaving without completing or reenrolling out is single parenthood status. Single parents were more likely than non-single parents to leave.

An alternative to a linear regression model would be a logistic regression model. 11See the notes at the bottom of tables 31 and 32 to see which variables were removed from the initial models. That single parents were more likely to leave without completing or reenrolling within the two-and-one-half-year period of the follow-up is not surprising, because the time constraints and limited financial resources of single parents are well known. Why other older associate degreeseekers would be more likely to leave, independent of other student or institutional characteristics; is less obvious. One possibility may be simply that they enroll on a more irregular basis than their younger counterparts, taking time off and reenrolling as family and work demands rise and fall. In other words, some of these students may still reenroll and complete an associate's degree at a later date. If this is so, the 1994 follow-up of the BPS students might be expected to show more older students who began in 1989-90 returning and completing the degrees they were seeking. Another possibility may be that older beginning postsecondary students may state \"associate's degree\" as their goal, but they may actually have more limited objectiveswanting to learn specific skills to advance in their job, for exampleand leave after achieving those objectives. Yet another possibility may be that students who delay their undergraduate education until they are older and who aim for an associate's degree are among the least prepared academically or psychologically and less committed than others to achieving a degree and, therefore, are more likely to leave without completing or reenrolling. If either or both of these last two possibilities are partial explanations, the 1994 follow-up study will not show any sizable number of these students returning to complete an associate's degree within the elapsed time period. In reality, all three possibilities, and others, may contribute to the overall enrollment patterns of older students. Future follow-ups of the 1989-90 BPS students will help clarify these patterns."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Postsecondary Students Seeking a Bachelor's Degree", "text": "Older beginning postsecondary students seeking a bachelor's degree were also much more likely than their younger counterparts to leave without completing or reenrolling within the twoand-one-half-year study period (table 27). However, in contrast to the findings for those seeking an associate's degree, when controlling for other student and institutional characteristics, the effect of age disappears for those seeking a bachelor's degree (table 32). In other words, the reason that older beginning postsecondary students seeking a bachelor's degree leave at a greater rate than their younger counterparts does not appear to be directly related to age, in and of itself, but rather to other characteristics that are found in greater proportions among older students. Beginning bachelor's degree-seekers of all ages were more likely to leave if they were married or formerly married, or if they started towards their bachelor's degree goal in a private, not-for-profit less-than-4-year institution or private, for-profit institution rather than a public 4year institution. They were less likely to leave if they were female; Asian rather than white, non-Hispanic; attended full time, full year rather than less than full time, full year; had a parent with a bachelor's degree as opposed to a high school diploma or less; and were in the highest income quartile rather than the two middle quartiles.

In less-than-2-year institutions and in public 2-year institutions, more than one-half of the undergraduates were 24 years or older in 1989-90. While older students are no longer \"nontraditional\" in terms of their numbers, as a group they differ from their younger counterparts in important ways that institutions need to take into account as they design their programs and services. Older and younger students differ in their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, their enrollment patterns, their reasons for choosing a particular institution in which to enroll, how they combine studying and working, and their use of financial aid. In 1989-90, older students were more likely than younger students to be married and have children or other dependents. About one-quarter of all undergraduate women in their 30s were single parents. Older undergraduates, especially those in their 30s or older, were better off financially than students under 24 years old who were financially independent of their parents. Compared with younger students, older undergraduates were much more likely to attend part time, and less likely to enroll in a formal degree or certificate program. Almost one-half of all older undergraduates worked full time while enrolled. Being able to live at home while enrolled became increasingly important with age. Both older and younger students were more likely to be studying business than anything else. However, older students were more likely than younger students to select occupationally-related fields such as computer and information technology, health, and vocational/technical subjects. Older students were somewhat less likely than younger students to receive financial aid, but employer aid was much more available to older students, especially to those who worked full time. While older undergraduates as a group differ from younger students in many ways, older students themselves do not form a homogeneous group. They are motivated by a variety of goals, including finding a job, training for a new career, enhancing skills needed for their current job or a promotion, and personal enrichment. They also have different family and work commitments. Consequently, how older students combine work and enrollment, how they choose what and where they study, and how they finance their education reflect these differences. Among students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90, older students seeking a certificate were more likely than their younger counterparts to complete their program within '9 months. On the other hand, older first-time beginners seeking associate's and bachelor's degrees were more likely than younger first-time beginners with those goals to leave before completing and without reenrolling by spring of 1992. At the associate's degree level, this pattern persists even when other factors are taken into account. At the bachelor's degree level, in contrast, the effect of age disappears after controlling for, other factors.

Comparisons based on the estimates of the proportions include the estimates of the probability of a Type I error, or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. The 1989-90 NPSAS survey, while representative and statistically accurate, was not a simple random sample. Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions were initially selected within geographical strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, notfor-profit; or private, for-profit) and offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, 4-year non doctoralgranting, and 4-year doctoral-granting). Sampling rates for students enrolled at different institutions and levels (undergraduate or other) varied, resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. Student's t values may be computed for comparisons using these tables' estimates with the following formula: t = P1 -P2 / SQRT ( se 12 + se22 ) where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and set and see are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates were not independent (for example, when comparing the percentages across a percent distribution in this report, across a row in a table, a covariance term was added to the denominator of the t-test formula). There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, the test may make comparisons based on large t statistics appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison is making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p s .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p s .05 and that when k comparisons were made within a family of possible tests, the significance level of the comparisons would sum to p s . 05.2 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males v. females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated with a Student's t test. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k = 10 and the significance level of each test must be p s .05/10, or .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: k = j* (j -1)/2, where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of raceethnicity, there are five racialethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black, Hispanic, and white), so k = 5*(5-1)/2=10. 2The standard tat p s.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p s.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p s.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56: 52-64."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments of means", "text": "Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages for those who persist in postsecondary education by age, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to age and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors such as attendance status, single-parent status, raceethnicity, parents' education, and so on. However, if a table were produced showing age within attendance status, within single parent status, for example, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. For those cases where the sample size becomes too small to support controlling for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. Adjusted values for subgroup populations were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as attendance status, raceethnicity, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup variable(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for some specified subgroup holding all other variables constant. For example, consider the case in which two variables, age and singleparent status, are used to describe leaving without completing or re-enrolling in an associate's degree program (for students seeking an associate's degree). The variables age and single-parent status are recoded into a dummy variable representing age and a dummy variable representing single-parent status: The following equation is then estimated from the correlation matrix output from the DAS: A Y = a + piA +I32S To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluation at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, given a case where Y=leaving without completing or re-enrolling in an associate's degree program (for students seeking an associate's degree) was being described by A and S (coded as shown above), and the means for A and S are: Estimating the above equation from the correlation matrix and the regression results in: A Y = 0.40+(022)A+(0.19)S To estimate the adjusted value for older students, one substitutes the appropriate values for the intercept and each dummy variable. In this case, the adjusted mean for older students is 0.627 and represents the expected dropout rate for older students pursuing an associate's degree who look like the average student across the other variables (in this example, single-parent status). It is relatively straightforward to produce a multivariate model using NPSAS:90 or BPS:90/92 data, since one of the output options of the DAS is a correlation matrix, computed using pair-wise missing values.3 This matrix can be used by most commercial regression packages as the input data to produce weighted least-square estimates of the parameters. That was the general approach used for this report, with two additional adjustments described below to reduce the effect of redundant parameters and to incorporate the design effect for statistical testing. Since many of the independent variables are interrelated (as previously discussed in the report), the presence of some variables in the model is redundant. That is, the variance explained by them will have been accounted for by other variables in the model. Accordingly, variables without explanatory power were removed from the model, resulting in a reduced regression model that was used to produce the parameter estimates shown in the above formula. Most commercial regression packages compute parameter standard errors on the assumption, of simple random sampling. For the NPSAS:90 and BPS:90/92 data, this assumption is incorrect. A better approximation of their standard errors is to multiply each standard error by the DEFT of the dependent variable ,4 where DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and is available with the correlation matrix. 3 Although the DAS simplifies the process of making regression models, it also limits the range of models. Analysts who wish to use different error assumptions than pairwise or to estimate probit/logit models can apply for a restricted data license from NCES. 4The adjustment procedure and its limitations are described in the Analysis of Complex Surveys, eds. C.J. Skinner, D. Holt, and T,M.F. Smith (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1989). "}]
