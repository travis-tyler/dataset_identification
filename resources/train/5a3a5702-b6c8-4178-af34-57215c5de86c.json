[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To examine prospective changes in food habits and nutrient intakes in a representative New Zealand sample of community dwelling adults aged 70 y and over. Design: Longitudinal study with food intake data collected in 1988a89 and again in 1995a96. In an attempt to distinguish age, time and cohort effects, data were analysed longitudinally, cross-sectionally and timesequentially. Subjects: The sample for study consisted of all non-institutionalised people aged 70 years and over registered with the Mosgiel Health Centre in 1988. In 1988a89, 678 adults completed a dietary survey (85% of those eligible) and 248 adults participated again in 1995a96 (66% of those eligible). Results: Energy intakes declined longitudinally in men only; however, this decline appeared not to be an aging effect as energy intake was not found to decrease with age cross-sectionally. Percentage of energy from protein increased by 0.7% in women (95% con\u00aedence interval 0.2 \u00b1 1.2) in both the longitudinal and time-sequential analysis, suggesting a time effect. The percentage of energy from saturated fat decreased 0.7% (95% con\u00aedence interval 7 1.4 to 7 0.1) and percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fat increased 0.4% (95% con\u00aedence interval 0.0 \u00b1 0.7) in women, and appears to be a time effect. However, the increase in saturated fat and decrease in polyunsaturated fat with advancing age seen cross-sectionally suggests a cohort effect also occurring. In 1995a96, more people were using margarine as a spread and vegetable oils to cook meat. Milk and milk product consumption increased (not signi\u00aecantly), and meat intake decreased signi\u00aecantly by 5 and 4 servings per month in men and women, respectively. There was an increase in the proportion of people who ate breakfast cereal at least once a week, and more women ate brown or wholemeal bread in 1995a96. Conclusion: Over the 6 y follow-up period studied, there was no indication of an age effect on nutrient intakes in adults aged 70 y and older; however, the changes occurring over time demonstrate that older adults, particularly women, are making changes towards healthier food choices.

Optimum dietary intake in older adults is important in ensuring that as many older adults as possible can continue to live independently in the community (Horwath, 1989) .\nInformation regarding changes in dietary intake in noninstitutionalised adults over the age of 70 years is limited. Perhaps the best known study of changes in nutrient intake with age is the Baltimore Longitudinal Study (Elahi et al, 1983) ; however, this study identi\u00aees changes occurring from middle to old age. Few prospective studies are available that examine changes in an already old population, (Garry et al, 1989 (Garry et al, , 1992 Sjogren et al, 1994; Amorim Cruz et al, 1996; Moreiras-Varela et al, 1996) and adequately distinguish changes due to aging, time or cohort effects. Conclusions regarding the time effect for changes in nutrient intake in the multicentre SENECA project Moreiras-Varela et al, 1996; van't Hof & Burema, 1996) , are based on an analysis performed on four nutrient intake variables, and the timesequential analysis used in a study in Gothenb\u00f9rg, Sweden, was performed over a different time frame from that of the longitudinal analysis (Sjogren et al, 1994) . Furthermore, despite observed changes in energy intake, the statistical signi\u00aecance of macronutrient density changes was not tested in most studies, therefore no conclusions were drawn regarding changes in diet quality with age (Steinkamp et al, 1965; Garry et al, 1989; Moreiras-Varela et al, 1996) .\nDifferences between age groups in cross-sectional analysis are confounded by cohort effects while changes with age seen longitudinally are confounded by time effects. An aging effect is present if the dependent variable is a function of age regardless of the subject's birth year or period of observation. A time effect is present if the variable changes over time and the change is observed in all age groups. A cohort effect is present if the value of the dependent variable differs between birth cohorts regardless of age and period of observation (Elahi et al, 1983) . In an attempt to distinguish the three effects, the cross-sequential and time-sequential designs were introduced for use in conjunction with simple longitudinal and cross-sectional studies (Schaie, 1965) . In cross-sequential analysis, independent samples of individuals born in the same period are compared at different times. Time of measurement and cohort effects are separated but both are confounded with age effects. Time-sequential analysis compares two independent groups of individuals of the same age at different times, resulting in the separation of age group and time of measurement, but both are confounded with cohort effects. Therefore, if cohort effects are assumed negligible, it is reasonable to assume that the time-sequential analysis is appropriate (Costa & McRae, 1982) .\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging attempted to differentiate between aging, time and cohort effects using three designs concurrently (cross-sectional, longitudinal and time-sequential). The study design was based on the assumption that each of the independent variables (time, age, cohort) is held constant by a different perspective. That is, there is a time effect if changes are seen in the longitudinal and time sequential analysis; an age effect is seen if changes are seen longitudinally and cross-sectionally; and a cohort effect is seen if changes are seen in both the cross-sectional and time sequential analysis. Therefore, if only a single or pure effect exists, age, time or cohort effects can be identi\u00aeed. However, multiple effects are impossible to untangle, and analysis is usually based on an assumption of no interaction between time, age and cohort effects (Elahi et al, 1983) . While this approach does not provide a de\u00aenitive solution to the problem of distinguishing age, time and cohort effects, the mechanics of the analysis are relatively simple and the method is useful for identifying pure age, time or cohort effects.\nThe aim of this study was to determine changes in food habits and nutrient intakes over a 6-year period in a representative group of non-institutionalised older New Zealand adults, and by a combination of longitudinal, cross-sectional and time-sequential analysis, to attempt to distinguish age, time and cohort effects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and study design", "text": "Mosgiel is a rural township of 13 500 people situated just south of Dunedin, New Zealand. The baseline sample for the Mosgiel Community Study of Nutrition and Health consisted of all those over the age of 70 y (as of 1 August 1988) registered with the Mosgiel Health Centre. Ethical approval was granted by the Otago Ethics Committee. Comparison with the electoral roll showed that 95% of people living in the Mosgiel area were registered with the centre. Assessment began in 1988 with a home visit from a local nurse, followed by medical and psychosocial investigations. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was left with participants to complete at home; however, where necessary, assistance was provided by a nutritionist (C.C.H.). All FFQs were reviewed for completeness and clarity of responses to ensure data quality.\nIn 1988a89, 727 adults (85% of those eligible) completed the dietary questionnaire. Energy and nutrient intakes were able to be computed for 712 participants, of whom 678 were living independently in the community (Horwath et al, 1992) . The non-institutionalised study population (252 men and 426 women) is a predominantly middle-class retired community without extremes of poverty or wealth. All subjects were European; however, only 2.3% of the older New Zealand population is Maori and most tend to live in the north. Further details of subject selection and characteristics of the baseline population, including nutrient intakes, have been presented elsewhere (Horwath et al, 1992; Campbell et al, 1993a Campbell et al, , b, 1995 .\nParticipants were followed up 6 years later in 1995a96 and, again as part of a more detailed multidisciplinary health study, were required to \u00aell out the same FFQ. The FFQs were distributed at the end of the medical examination and collected approximately a week later by a nutritionist (L.K.F.), who reviewed the FFQ with the participant and clari\u00aeed any missing or ambiguous answers.\nFood frequency questionnaire A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was designed speci\u00aecally for the study. Because subjects were required to give about 3 \u00b1 4 h of their time to medical and other investigations, it was necessary for the dietary assessment method to be short, simple and self-administered. The FFQ included a list of 120 food and drink items and qualitative questions regarding food preparation, cooking practices (especially concerning fat intake) and supplement use. For most foods, participants were asked only to estimate their usual frequency of consumption over the previous year, using \u00aeve possible frequency of use responses: never or rarely, about daily, three or four times a week, once or twice a week, about monthly. For these foods, standard age-and sex-speci\u00aec serving sizes compiled from previous New Zealand and Australian diet surveys, which included older adults, were assumed. The surveys available from which to compile standard portion sizes included insuf\u00aecient numbers of people over 75 y to permit development of speci\u00aec portion sizes for age subcategories (e.g. 70 \u00b1 75 y; 75 y and older). Portion sizes were requested for foods that could easily be described in discrete units (e.g. bread, eggs, drinks, teaspoons of sugar). Nutrient values were computed using the same database (New Zealand Food Composition Tables 1988) that was used to analyse the baseline data. This database (Milligan et al, 1988) includes about 1200 food items and consists mainly of New Zealand and British data. The FFQ results were analysed using a program developed in the Department of Human Nutrition.\nComparison of nutrient intakes estimated from the FFQ and \u00aeve 2 d estimated diet records showed that the questionnaire can provide useful information on both group mean and individual intakes for many nutrients. For most nutrients, mean intakes differed by less than 5% between the two methods, and at least 70% of the subjects when classi\u00aeed by 10 d food records fell into the same quintile or into the within-one-quintile category when classi\u00aeed by the FFQ. A more detailed description of the FFQ validation has been reported elsewhere (Horwath, 1993) . In older adults, FFQ estimates of both food group and nutrient intakes were also found to be reproducible over an 18-month period (most correlation coef\u00aecients in the range 0.70 \u00b1 0.85) (Horwath, 1987) .\nPatterns of food consumption were investigated through the use of food scores, and are reported as servings per month. Food scores were calculated as follows: fruit and vegetable scores were computed by calculating the number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed per month, with seasonally adjusted values used to account for the number of months per year each fruit or vegetable is in season (that is, in plentiful supply); milk product score was calculated as servings per month of cheese, cottage cheese, ice cream, yogurt, cream and custard; sweets and desserts Dietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al score included buns and scones, plain or sweet biscuits, puddings, lollies or chocolates and honey and jams; cereal product score included breakfast cereals, rice pudding, rice, pasta, crackers and crispbreads; bread scores were calculated as the number of slices of different types of bread eaten per month. Also calculated were the total number of teaspoons of sugar added to cereal or drinks per day, and milk consumption (ml) per month, including glasses of milk and milk added to cereal and drinks."}, {"section_title": "Anthropometric measurements", "text": "Anthropometric measurements were taken by a geriatrician (W.J.B., A.J.C.) at both times. Measures included height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, arm muscle area and waist to hip ratio. Weight was measured in light clothing, without shoes, to the nearest half kilogram, and mid-arm circumference and triceps skinfold were measured using \u0101 exible steel tape and Harpendens skinfold calipers, respectively. The corrected arm muscle area was calculated from these measurements (Campbell & Borrie, 1988) . The waist circumference was measured 1 cm below the umbilicus and the hip measurement was the largest measure over the buttocks. Heights were not recorded at follow-up because increased substantial spinal curvature reduced the usefulness of this measure."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 4 Macintosh software package. Results are presented separately for both men and women because of the signi\u00aecant gender differences in nutrient intakes seen in 1988a89 (Horwath et al, 1992) . Changes in nutrient and food group consumption over time are presented as mean changes with 95% con\u00aedence intervals (Gardner & Altman, 1986 ). Student's t-tests were used to compare the means between two groups of independent samples where nutrients were normally distributed, and the Mann \u00b1 Whitney test was used for those nutrients not normally distributed. The chi-square test was used to test differences in the number of people consuming speci\u00aec foods.\nThe longitudinal analysis was undertaken with those subjects for whom FFQ data were available at both time points; the cross-sectional analysis was undertaken with the entire baseline population; and the time-sequential analysis was undertaken with the cohorts aged 76 \u00b1 80 y at baseline or follow-up. In the baseline population, regression analysis was used to determine whether food group or nutrient intakes varied signi\u00aecantly with age. Table 1 shows the response categories at follow-up for the 678 non-institutionalised older adults for whom complete dietary data were available at baseline in 1988a89. Forty \u00aeve per cent (n 302) had died or moved into a nursing home by the time of follow-up and thus were no longer eligible to participate. Of the remaining 376, 66% (248) provided dietary and health information at follow up, 19% (73) declined to participate owing to ill health or other reasons, 8% (29) had moved out of the area and 7% (26) were lost to follow-up. Four women provided inadequate dietary information at the 6 y follow-up and were excluded from further analysis. The mean age at baseline was 77 and 78 for men and women, respectively, and 81 y for both men and women at follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "To determine the representativeness of those who participated in the follow-up study, baseline intakes for the responding group were compared with baseline intakes of those who were eligible but did not participate (data not shown).

Non-responding men had signi\u00aecantly lower intakes of dietary \u00aebre and vitamin C (P`0.05) and, although not statistically signi\u00aecant, the macronutrient pro\u00aele for both men and women was slightly better in the responding group (lower in saturated fat and total fat, higher in carbohydrate). Again, although differences in alcohol intake were not statistically signi\u00aecant, it was noted that more responders consumed alcohol, but at lower levels than non-responders."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal analysis", "text": "There was a signi\u00aecant mean weight loss of 3.4 kg in men and 3.1 kg in women, and triceps skinfold thickness also declined (Table 2 ).

"}, {"section_title": "Dietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al", "text": "Mean differences in nutrient intakes between baseline (1988a89) and follow-up (1995a96) were calculated (Table  3 ). Men's energy intake was signi\u00aecantly lower by approximately 400 kJ at the 6 y follow-up, but there was no change in their energy intake per kilogram body weight. No signi\u00aecant difference in energy intake was seen in women. While there was no change in fat intake as a percentage of daily energy intake for men or women, there was a signi\u00aecant 0.7% decrease in saturated fat intake for women. A corresponding increase in polyunsaturated fat for women was marginally signi\u00aecant. Protein intake increased for women by an average of 0.7%, and total dietary \u00aebre intake also increased by approximately 2 g over the 6 years. While changes in macronutrient intake did not reach statistical signi\u00aecance in men, trends were similar but of smaller magnitude to those in women. For example, although total fat intake was unchanged, polyunsaturated fat, \u00aebre and protein intakes all increased and saturated fat intake decreased. For men, percentage energy from alcohol was signi\u00aecantly lower at follow-up; fewer men consumed alcohol, and of those who drank any alcohol, the amount consumed was also lower. Table 4 shows changes in absolute micronutrient intakes for both men and women; however, because energy intakes declined signi\u00aecantly for men, changes in micronutrient densities are given for men only in Table 5 . Average folate intakes increased signi\u00aecantly for both women (mg), and men (mgaMJ). Mean daily calcium intake increased for both men and women by an average of 64 mg and 67 mg, respectively and, although these changes in absolute intake were non-signi\u00aecant, calcium density (mgaMJ) increased signi\u00aecantly for men. Niacin intake in men no longer declined after accounting for the decrease in energy intake.\nA comparison of the intake of various food groups over the 6 y period indicates a signi\u00aecant decrease in the number of meat servings per month for both men and women (Table 6 ). Cereal product intakes increased by 6 servings per month for both men and women; however, this change was marginally signi\u00aecant.\nTime-sequential analysis A cohort comparison was performed to determine the degree to which changes in nutrient intake over the 6 year period may be due to a time effect. Mean nutrient intakes of those aged 76 \u00b1 80 y at baseline were compared with those aged 76 \u00b1 80 y at follow-up in 1995a96 (Table  7) . Women exhibited similar patterns to those seen in the longitudinal analysis: that is, an increase in the percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fat and a decrease in percentage of energy from saturated fat. Protein intake increased for both men and women, but signi\u00aecantly so only for women. Dietary \u00aebre intake was greater in 1995a96 for both men and women; however, it reached statistical signi\u00aecance for men only. Folate and vitamin E intakes were greater in 1995a96 for both men and women, and potassium, and vitamin B6 intakes were higher for women in 1995a96.\nIn order to determine the representativeness of those aged 76 \u00b1 80 y surveyed in 1995a96, their baseline nutrient intakes were compared to the baseline intakes of those of the same age who were eligible but did not participate in the follow-up (data not shown). The only statistically Dietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al signi\u00aecant difference was a lower energy intake in those men who did not respond (P`0.05).\nCross-sectional analysis (data not shown) Weight decreased (P`0.0005) and energy intake per kg body weight increased (P`0.05 for men; P`0.01 for women) with advancing age. There was no decrease in energy intake with age for either men or women. For women only, percentage of energy from saturated fat increased (P`0.01), and percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fat and alcohol and absolute intakes of vitamin D decreased with age (P`0.05). For men, percentage energy from carbohydrate increased with age, and percentage energy from alcohol decreased with age (P`0.01).\nPresence of age, time or cohort effects An overview of longitudinal, time-sequential and crosssectional analyses is presented in Table 8 . The only age effects were a decrease in weight for both men and women, and a decrease in percentage of energy from alcohol in men. However, the increases in protein and folate and decrease in cholesterol intakes in both the longitudinal and time-sequential analysis in women suggests a time effect. The only time effect seen in men was an increase in Dietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al folate intake. Further investigation of saturated and polyunsaturated fat intakes in women suggested the occurrence of multiple effects: percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fat increased in the time-sequential analysis, marginally increased in the longitudinal analysis (95% con\u00aedence interval 0.0 \u00b1 0.7) and decreased with age cross-sectionally. Because of missing weight values; n 86 and 50 for men at time 1 and 2, respectively, and n 157 and 86 for women at time 1 and 2, respectively.\nSimilarly, but in the opposite direction, women's saturated fat decreased over time but increased with age in the crosssectional analysis (P`0.01)."}, {"section_title": "Food habits", "text": "Changes in types of fat used (Table 9) were consistent with nutrient changes seen in the longitudinal and time-sequential analysis. Although there were no changes in the proportion of people who ate fried or roasted meat (data not shown), there was a shift from the use of saturated fats (butter, lard or dripping) to unsaturated fats (margarine or vegetable oils) over the 6 y period. Other changes to healthier food choices seen in both men and women included a shift from the use of whole milk to lower-fat milks, and an increase in the proportion who ate breakfast cereals at least once a week. For women, there was an increase in the proportion of brown or wholemeal bread eaten. Regular and occasional use of vitamin and mineral supplements also increased over the 6 y period, with supplement use remaining considerably higher in women than men."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study involved a baseline dietary assessment, using a validated FFQ, of 85% of the entire community of older adults of one South Island town in New Zealand. Six years later, 66% of those eligible participated in a repeat dietary assessment. Challenging common images of older adults as being`resistant to change' or`stuck in their ways', this longitudinal study reveals that those over 70 y, particularly women, are making changes towards healthier food habits, resulting in nutrient density changes consistent with national goals. Although demographically similar to other South Island older populations, the population studied differs in ethnic composition from populations in the North Island where the majority of the country's Maori and Paci\u00aec Island people reside. Nevertheless, even in the north, the proportion of these ethnic groups that is over 70 y (3 \u00b1 4%) is far smaller than in the European population.\nOne limitation common to all dietary intake studies is the validity of the dietary assessment tool; however, in a prospective study there is also the question of the ability of the method to monitor changes in intake over time. Although the validity and reproducibility of the FFQ used in this study have been demonstrated, its ability to quantify changes in intake over long times has not been established. The FFQ approach has been found to be only slightly less responsive than multiple diet records in determining changes in fat intakes in an intervention study (Kristal et al, 1994) , indicating that the FFQ is able to measure change and, if anything, tends to underestimate change in dietary intake. Another limitation of this study is the absence of a time-sequential component, that is, recruitment of a new group of adults aged 70 y and older in 1995a96, for the examination of time effects. However, the existing study design investigated the time effect using two independent groups of people aged 76 \u00b1 80 y in 1988a89 and 1995a96. Another source of bias is the lower response rate at followup (66% compared with 85% at baseline), which may mean that less healthy participants have been lost to the study. The \u00aending of a slightly better baseline macronutrient pro\u00aele in those who responded in 1995a96 compared with those who did not suggests that those people who took part in the follow-up study may have been a slightly Energy-adjusted changes for micronutrients for men reported here.\nDietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al more health-conscious group. Also, we are unable to determine whether the non-responding group included people whose health declined rapidly over the 6 y period. The absence of a decline in energy intake with age is contrary to previous research (Sjogren et al, 1994; Moreiras-Varela et al, 1996) ; however, the increase in total energy from protein (approximately 2.5 g per day) seen in women over time is in agreement with previous \u00aendings. The consistency of absolute protein intakes despite declining energy intakes in the SENECA Study (Moreiras-Varela et al, 1996) indicates an increase in percentage of energy from protein; however, as no attempt was made to determine time effects for protein, the cause of this increase is unclear. Percentage of energy from protein also increased longitudinally in a Swedish study (Sjogren et al, 1994) ; again, however, we are unable to determine whether this is due to a time effect. In the present study, the increase in percentage of energy from protein in men was not statistically signi\u00aecant, and simply re\u00afects the declining energy intake since absolute protein intakes were unchanged.\nThe decrease in saturated fat and increase in polyunsaturated fat in women appears to be a time effect; however, this \u00aending is complicated by the cross-sectional increase in saturated fat and decrease in polyunsaturated fat with advancing age. There appears to be a cohort effect occurring, with younger birth cohorts adopting more favourable fat intake pro\u00aeles before the older birth cohorts. The Baltimore Study revealed a similar pattern of change in cholesterol intakes; that is, cholesterol intakes decreased in the longitudinal and time-sequential analysis but increased cross-sectionally (Elahi et al, 1983) . The decline in cholesterol intakes over time in both men and women is consistent with the decrease in saturated fat and meat intakes.\nAlcohol intake did not change prospectively in women, but there was a signi\u00aecant decrease in the percentage of energy from alcohol in men in both the longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. This indicates a decline in alcohol intake with age, consistent with previous research (Adams et al, 1990 ). There appears to be a decline in the number of men consuming any alcohol, as well as a decrease in the amount of alcohol consumed.\nIn this study, there was no age-related increase in total dietary \u00aebre intake in either men or women; however, intakes increased in both the longitudinal and time-sequential analysis, suggesting a time effect. In contrast, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, an age-related increase in dietary \u00aebre intake was found (Hallfrisch et al, 1988 (Hallfrisch et al, , 1990 . This difference may be linked to the age composition of the samples: our participants were over 70 y at baseline, compared with a baseline age of 24 \u00b1 67 y in the Baltimore Study. So we may speculate that if dietary \u00aebre intakes increase with age, perhaps the increase occurs before subjects reach 70 y.\nThere were few changes to micronutrient intakes, indicating that diets are not becoming less nutrient-dense with age. This is consistent with \u00aendings from the SENECA project, where only small changes in micronutrient densi- (22) 20 (25) 16 (10) 18 (11) Cooking soda added to vegetables during cooking 0 (0) 2 (3) 2 (1) 0 (0) Salt always added to cooking water when boiling foods 65 (80) 61 (75) 135 (83) 118 (72) Salt sometimes added to cooking water when boiling foods 9 (11) 12 (15) 20 (12) 32 ( (14) 22 (14) 32 ( (17) 12 (15) 39 (24) 32 (20) Use of vitamin or mineral supplements occasionally 4 (5) 7 (9) 13 (8) 24 (15) Other Salt sometimes added to meals after they are cooked 32 (40) 28 (35) 60 (37) 60 (37) Salt always added to meals after they are cooked 23 (28) 27 (33) 32 (20) 28 (17) Usually eat the fat on meat 21 (26) 19 (24) 21 (13) 16 (10) Meals never or rarely missed 73 (90) 73 (90) 138 (85) 138 (85) Following a special diet 6 (7) 10 (12) 19 (12) 20 (12) a\nDifferences between 1988a89 and 1995a96 tested using chi-square test. b Signi\u00aecant difference between 1988a89 and 1995a96, P`0.05. Dietary changes in older population LK Fernyhough et al ties occurred . The \u00aending of increased calcium and folate densities despite no change in absolute calcium and folate intakes in men highlights the importance of adjusting for decreased energy intakes when investigating dietary quality. Similarly, the signi\u00aecant decrease in absolute niacin intake for men was no longer signi\u00aecant after adjusting for energy intakes. Increased vitamin A intakes in women are consistent with results from previous studies. There was no change in absolute intakes of vitamin A, despite declining energy intakes in the Swedish study (Sjogren et al, 1994) , and absolute vitamin A intakes increased (in 3 out of 9 towns) in women in the SENECA project, despite decreased energy intakes . Changes in folate intakes have not been examined previously, but the increase with time in the present study is likely to be due to increased consumption of whole wheat products (cereals and wholemeal breads). Changing patterns of food intake explain many of the trends seen in nutrient intake. The shift from use of butter and lard to vegetable oils, as well as an increase in the use of low-fat milks, accounts for the change in the proportion of saturated and polyunsaturated fat intakes. Men and women signi\u00aecantly decreased their meat intake, also accounting for the decrease in cholesterol intakes. The increase in protein intakes in women despite the decline in meat consumption is due to an increase in protein from other sources. Women consumed an average of 9 more slices of bread per month at follow-up, as well as increasing the proportion of brown or wholemeal bread eaten. Cereal intakes increased by an average of 6 servings per month, with a signi\u00aecant increase in the percentage of people regularly consuming breakfast cereal. There was also a trend towards increasing milk and milk product consumption, re\u00afected in increasing calcium intakes in men and women. The increase in calcium intakes without adverse effects on fat intakes is consistent with \u00aendings from a 12-week intervention study to increase calcium consumption (Karanja et al, 1994) . Some similar changes in food habits over time were seen in Sweden when three independent samples of 70 year-olds in 1971a72, 1981a82 and 1991a92 were compared (Rothenberg et al, 1996) . The percentage of people consuming breakfast cereals, rice, pasta and wholemeal breads increased, and there was a trend towards consumption of milk with lower fat content. Comparison with SENECA results is dif\u00aecult because of the large variation in dietary habits between countries. However, in an investigation of food habit changes for women in 4 of the 8 countries, it was found that milk consumption increased signi\u00aecantly in Switzerland and Spain . The increase in Spain occurred despite declining energy intakes. These changes towards more healthy food habits suggest that adults over the age of 70 years are responding to health education messages.\nThe signi\u00aecant decrease in weight seen in men and women, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally, indicates a decline in weight with age in older adults. While the longitudinal analysis revealed a corresponding decline in energy intake in men, the loss of weight in women, despite constant energy intakes, is more dif\u00aecult to explain. Perhaps older women increased their exercise levels. Or perhaps, since it is possible that portion sizes decline with age, the use at baseline and follow-up of the same age-and sex-speci\u00aec portion sizes for many FFQ items may have led to the overestimation of follow-up energy intake. Another possibility is that women overestimated energy intakes at follow-up, that is, remembered and reported eating patterns similar to those at baseline. However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, this phenomenon did not occur in men. Second, a similar pattern was seen cross-sectionally, that is, weight, but not energy intakes, declined with age in both men and women. A more plausible explanation is episodes of weight loss due to periods of infection or other ill-health in the ensuing years before follow-up (Prentice et al 1989) . One of the disadvantages of collecting data at only two points in time to assess changes over the study period is that events that occur between baseline and follow-up are ignored. An analysis of Dutch and Danish participants in the SENECA study similarly observed no association between change in weight and change in energy intake (unpublished \u00aendings, K. . Instead, weight loss of 3.5 kg or more was characterised by disability at baseline and the prevalence of more chronic diseases at follow-up. Furthermore, in a comparison of malnourished and nonmalnourished institutionalised older adults (Sandman et al, 1987) , no difference in dietary intake was found; however, over the 3 y study period, malnourished patients experienced 4 times as many infections treated with antibiotics compared with non-malnourished patients.\nWeight loss cannot be ascribed to a decrease in lean body mass as there were no changes in arm muscle area for either men or women; however, triceps skinfold thickness declined signi\u00aecantly in both men and women, indicating a decrease in peripheral fat. While the redistribution of fat from peripheral to more central body sites in older adults is widely documented, average waist to hip ratios did not change over the 6 y period in this population, although a longer time period may be necessary to detect such changes.\nNew Zealand adults aged 70 y and older have made changes to dietary intakes over the 6 y period studied. How do these alterations in diet compare to those being made in the general adult population, and to current dietary recommendations? The latest National Nutrition Survey (1996) together with the Life in New Zealand (LINZ) Survey (1989 \u00b1 90) (Wilson et al, 1993) , will provide information on changes in intake in the general population over a similar time frame to the Mosgiel study; however, results will not be available until early 1999.\nThe most similar studies with which to make comparisons regarding changes in nutrient intakes over time in the general adult population are the CSIRO 1988 and 1993 Australian Food and Nutrition Surveys of adults aged 18 years and over (Baghurst et al, 1996) . In the 1988 Australian survey, energy intakes for the general population were about 1.5 MJ higher for men and 1 MJ higher for women, compared with the Mosgiel participants, as expected in a younger population. Percentage of energy derived from fat was approximately 3 per cent higher for both men and women (35.4 and 35.1, respectively) in 1988 compared with the Mosgiel participants; however, by 1993, fat intakes had declined by approximately 2.5 percent in women to a level similar to that found in the Mosgiel participants. Fat intakes had declined by approximately 1.5 per cent in the Australian men by 1993. Carbohydrate intakes increased in Australian men and women over the 5 y from 42.8% to 44.5% and 43.8% to 46.5%, respectively, but were still signi\u00aecantly lower compared with older New Zealand adults in 1988a89 and 1995a96. Total dietary \u00aebre A similar trend to that found in the Mosgiel participants towards healthy food choices was made for some foods, that is, an increase in cereal intakes and a reduction in red meat consumption (Baghurst et al, 1996) . However, in the Australian study there was an increase in the consumption of confectionery, cakes and biscuits for women, and an increase in processed meats and a decrease in vegetable intakes in 1993 for both men and women. The Australian Survey indicates some improvements and some deteriorations in the nutrient pro\u00aele and dietary habits of the Australian adult population. In making comparisons with changes over time in the general adult population, it is essential to note that older adults constitute a retired population with more time available to prepare food, and consequently less need to rely on the use of convenience foods. Therefore, it would appear that older adults are making similar improvements in dietary habits to younger adults, without increasing the use of convenience foods such as confectionery, cakes, biscuits and processed meats.\nNutrient intakes of older New Zealanders are in accord with current New Zealand recommendations (Truswell et al, 1990) , with the exception of saturated fat. Saturated fat intakes were on average 1 per cent higher in women and 2 per cent higher in men than the upper recommended level of 12% of total energy intake, indicating room for further improvement.\nAdults, particularly women, aged 70 y and over are making changes towards healthier food choices resulting in increasing percentage energy from protein and polyunsaturated fats and decreasing saturated fat intakes. These changes are consistent with national nutrition goals, and indicate that older adults, particularly women, are not resistant to change, as has often been assumed."}]
