"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, representing between 50% and 56% of all cases [1] . Age being the major risk factor for this disease, the incidence of AD doubles every 5 years starting at the age of 65 years to reach one-third of people aged 85 years and more [1] . In addition to amyloid plaques [2] and neuronal and synaptic loss [3, 4] , AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in neurons [5] . The burden of neocortical NFTs correlates with memory impairment in sporadic AD [6] .\nBecause currently known AD single-nucleotide polymorphisms only explain 30.62% of the genetic variance in this disease [7] , further effort needs to be made to identify new variants associated with AD, especially those implicated in the tau pathophysiology. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was therefore performed by our team to identify novel genetic risk factors for late-onset sporadic AD in a population isolate from Eastern Canada [8] . The use of these populations with a small number of founders, such as the Quebec Founder Population (QFP), has been shown to reduce the genetic background noise and to allow the detection of population-specific signals. All the subjects used in the GWAS belonged to the QFP The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists. 1 isolate. This population descends in genetic isolation from a few thousand founders who emigrated from France in the 17th century. The demographic history of the QFP, which is characterized by a population bottleneck, a rapid population expansion and little admixture, makes it a valuable resource for genetic studies [9] . The QFP has been well characterized as having reduced genetic heterogeneity for Mendelian diseases [10] .\nBesides the usual variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE"}, {"section_title": "Q2", "text": ") locus that markedly exceeded genome-wide significance, the strongest hit, rs10984186, in our cohort is in cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) association with the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunitassociated protein 2 (CDK5RAP2) gene, which codes for a protein that binds to the activators of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5; p35 or p25) via a domain encoded by exon 34; p25 is believed to facilitate NFT formation and accumulation by overacting CDK5 [11] , one of several kinases regulating tau phosphorylation in the central nervous system [12] .\nCDK5 is also involved during development as a regulator of cortical lamination [13] , fasciculation of thalamocortical and callosal projections [14] , as well as neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation [15] . These processes are all mediated through binding with p35. As for CDK5RAP2, it is implicated in the proliferation of neuronal progenitors in the developing neocortex by regulating centrosome function and cohesion, as well as mitotic spindle orientation and pole number [16, 17] . Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations resulting in premature terminations of the translation of the CDK5RAP2 gene have been shown to cause microcephaly 3 [18] [19] [20] [21] , as well as the Seckel syndrome [22] , two medical conditions characterized by reduced head circumferences.

Microarray data from Hokama et al. [37] revealed a similar increase in CDK5RAP2 mRNA levels in both the frontal and temporal cortices of pathologically confirmed AD cases (data not shown). In the QFP cohort, CDK5RAP2 mRNA prevalence in the frontal cortex is quantitatively associated with the NFT density in the same region (Fig. 4) , a well-established correlate of memory impairment in symptomatic AD subjects [6] . The relationship between NFTs and CDK5RAP2 gene expression appears to be driven, at least in part, by the rs10984186 minor (A) allele. Indeed, this variant is significantly associated with disease risk in both the QFP and ADNI cohorts (Table 1) and correlates with NFT burden in the QFP brains. This risk variant is also associated with an increased hippocampal CDK5RAP2 gene expression in healthy subjects from the BRAINEAC cohort (Fig. 2) , although not in cortical and cerebellar regions (data not shown), suggesting an enhanced pathophysiological risk in this vulnerable brain area. In ADNI, where the vast majority of AD cases are mild-to-moderate, the rs10984186 risk variant does not affect MCI or AD conversion rate (data not shown) nor baseline CSF pTau levels or pTau/Ab 42 ratios (all disease states, data not shown), consistent with a biological process unfolding later in the disease process, most likely when the tangle pathology spreads throughout the brain. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers of tangles accumulation, such as retention of the 18 F-AV-1451 PET ligand, would be significantly affected by the presence of the rs10984186 risk variant in symptomatic carriers. Indeed, this marker is associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in all disease states [38] , as opposed to CSF pTau/Ab 42 ratios, which are mostly predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to MCI/AD in cognitively intact subjects [39] . The association with disease risk in the QFP was not replicated in the IGAP meta-analysis (Table 1) . While a population-specific effect could be invoked to explain the discrepancy with IGAP, the independent replication in the multiethnic ADNI cohort suggests otherwise. Alternatively, the fact that the rs10984186 A variant is present on the Illumina beadchips used in the ADNI and QFP analyses but not on most of those in IGAP raises the issue of imputation quality, which is not available in the IGAP public database.\nIn contrast to the rs10984186 risk variant, the rs4837766 AA genotype, which is located in the CDK5RAP2 gene, is associated with a decreased risk of developing MCI/AD in women enrolled in the ADNI cohort (Fig. 5C) . Stratification for the gender and for the rs4837766 variant in a large sample of CTL and MCI subjects from ADNI revealed a significant protective effect in female AA carriers on MCI/AD conversion some 8 years after initial visit (Fig. 5D) . A similar striking reduction in the conversion rate in women was recently described in a multiple-cohort analysis for the protective rs3846662 variant, which is located in the HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) gene, another variant shown to affect NFT density in multiple brain areas in women [40] . CDK5RAP2 rs4837766 A variant is significantly associated with reduced levels of CDK5RAP2 mRNA levels (Fig. 5A ) in the brain in the BRAINEAC cohort and in circulating lymphocytes in ADNI subjects ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Additional stratification by gender in ADNI indicated that the association is significant only in women ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), which is consistent with the fact that only female AA carriers are protected against AD (Fig. 5C and 5D ). In CTL subjects from the ADNI cohort, the rs4837766 A variant is associated with baseline CSF pTau/Ab 42 ratios (Fig. 5B) . As mentioned previously, pTau/Ab 42 ratios are typically used as surrogate markers of cognitive decline and conversion to MCI/AD in cognitively intact healthy subjects. Therefore, CTL subjects bearing one or two copies of the rs4837766 A allele are producing more phosphorylated tau and are more prone to convert to MCI/AD, which is consistent with the previous observations on MCI/AD conversion and risk in women.\nIn conclusion, we believe that the aforementioned results are consistent with the notion that modulation of CDK5RAP2 gene expression by the rs10984186 risk variant or the rs4837766 protective polymorphism may regulate the extent of AD pathology by respectively increasing or decreasing CDK5 activity through the calpain-dependent cleavage of p35. This cleavage leads to an increased production of p25 [41] , which has a 5-to 10-fold increased half-life compared with p35. Therefore, p25 overproduction leads to CDK5 overactivation, increases tau phosphorylation, and may facilitate the subsequent accumulation of NFTs [11] . This working model is also consistent with the fact that the rs10984186 A risk variant is associated with marked reductions of baseline hippocampal volumes in AD subjects from ADNI (Table 1) . Indeed, recent evidence with the new radiotracer for NFTs ( 18 F-THK5105) has shown that the temporal signal and the neocortical signal are inversely correlated with the hippocampal volume in living AD patients [42] . The ladder observation is thus quite consistent with the postmortem findings reported previously.\nAnother potential mechanism at play could be the role of CDK5RAP2 in the cell cycle activation of postmitotic neurons, which normally leads to cell death [43] . In fact, CDK5RAP2 is required for the attachment of the g-tubulin ring complex to the centrosomes, therefore contributing to the microtubules nucleation [44] . It also acts in the recruitment of the end binding 1 protein, a facilitator of microtubules polymerization [45, 46] . Thus, because microtubules form the mitotic spindle [47] , CDK5RAP2 is important in the cell-cycle spindle checkpoint [48] .\nAltogether, these observations show that both the rs10984186 risk and rs4837766 protective polymorphic variants of the CDK5RAP2 gene might act as potent genetic ADNI, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; bl, baseline; BRAINEAC, Brain Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Almanac; CDK5RAP2, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 2; CI, confidence interval; CTL, control; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; m, months; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; OR, odds ratio; pTau, phospho-Tau; SEM, standard error of the mean. modifiers for AD risk and/or conversion by modulating the expression of this gene, particularly for women in the case of the rs4837766 polymorphism. It is conceivable that CDK5RAP2 gene expression in turn regulates the phosphorylation of tau and, in the symptomatic phase of the disease, modulates the accumulation of NFTs. To our knowledge, these two variants represent the first genetic modulators of the tau pathophysiology to be implicated in AD. Genotyping of these polymorphisms should therefore be performed routinely in the imaging of NFTs, as well as in the clinical trials designed to target the phosphorylation of tau or the accumulation of NFTs.
