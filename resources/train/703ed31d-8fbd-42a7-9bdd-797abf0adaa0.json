[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China (Li et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to more than 150 other countries, at a speed that is much higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Wit et al., 2016). Despite the lower mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the scale of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion has already caused many more casualties than either of the previous outbreaks. Early research into SARS-CoV-2 has mostly described its epidemiological features (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020), case reports (Holshue et al., 2020), structural characterizations (Wrapp et al., 2020), basic genomics features (Lu et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), etc.\nComprehensive profiling of the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 could broaden our understanding of how this virus interacts with its host. Such analyses could also inform antiviral of immuno-therapeutic development. Antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interfering with binding to receptors, blocking uptake into cells, etc. For SARS-CoV, the human ACE-2 protein is the functional receptor, and the anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication (Li et al., 2003). In addition, previous studies have indicated a crucial role of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (Chen et al., 2010; Janice Oh et al., 2012), while Janice Oh et al also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4+ T helper cells (Janice Oh et al., 2012).\nThe investigation of the genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 over time and the association between the genetic variation and the changes in the immunogenic viral epitopes will provide novel biological insights into the evolution of the virus. In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis on 5,568 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virus (from the beginning of the outbreak to May 13th, 2020) to profile the class I and class II MHC binding potentials of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and also the potential of linear epitopes of the viral proteins to induce antibodies. These data formed the immune vulnerability map of SARS-CoV-2, which was correlated with the genomic variants found in the SARS-CoV-2 strains. The comparison was made against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, leading to several interesting observations. All analyses results were made publicly available as a resource to the research community, in the form of the SARS-CoV-2 Immune Viewer: https://qbrc.swmed.edu/projects/2019ncov_immuneviewer/."}, {"section_title": "T and B cell-mediated immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2 ::: RESULTS", "text": "To explore the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2, we used the NetMHCpan (v4.0) (Jurtz et al., 2017) and NetMHCIIpan (v3.2) (Jensen et al., 2018) software to predict the MHC class I and class II binding peptides of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Fig. 1a). As there are currently no well-accepted tools for predicting the potential of both class I and II epitopes to induce T cell responses, we used the binding affinity of epitopes to MHCs as a surrogate for epitope immunogenicity, since such binding affinity has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of epitope immunogenicity (Lu et al., 2020b). As this virus was initially reported in China, the counts of the MHC binders for the reference genome were weighted by the allele frequencies of the Chinese population. The results show that there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks of immunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood (60 nt), which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup. Table 1). Of the top 50 MHC class I and MHC class II epitopes, 18 and 6 have already been validated experimentally and documented on the Immune Epitope Database (https://www.iedb.org/), respectively (Sup. Table 1). The MHC binding peptide profiles of several other racial populations: US European Caucasian, African American, Hispanic (South or Central American), and Middle Eastern/North African, were also investigated. There are minor differences in the overall immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in different racial populations (Sup. Fig. 1 and Sup. Fig. 2); however, much larger differences can be seen when examining individual HLA alleles (Fig. 1b), suggesting a large degree of variance in susceptibility to this virus could exist among different individuals (with different sets of HLA alleles). This suggests that T cell epitope-based therapeutic interventions should focus on genomic regions of the virus that are broadly presentable by as many HLA alleles as possible. This might also underlie the vast degree of differences in clinical manifestations, from being asymptotic to severe complications, when patients are infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nNext, we examined the potential of the viral proteins to encode linear B-cell epitopes that can elicit antibody responses using BepiPred 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017). We focused on linear epitopes, rather than conformational epitopes, because bioinformatics predictions are more feasible for linear epitopes. Contiguous stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues, which are more representative of the usual length of B cell epitopes, are marked as red bars in Fig. 1c, and shown in Sup. Table 2 in bins of 60 nucleotides. We also examined the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which attaches to the ACE-2 protein for entry into the human cell (Wan et al., 2020). We used BLAST to align the RBM sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with that of SARS-CoV, and found there is relatively poor conservation between the two S proteins (Fig. 1d). This was supported by Wrapp et al (Wrapp et al., 2020), which reports no binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBM by any of the three SARS-CoV RBM-directed antibodies.\nFor comparison, we also computed the immune vulnerability maps of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1e) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1f), which are the two other coronaviruses known to have caused past outbreaks. We found that the B cell epitope profiles seem to be more consistent among the three viruses. For example, they all share large numbers of predicted B cell epitopes towards the N proteins, which is consistent with the fact that antibody response in SARS-CoV patients is directed most frequently to the N protein (Flego et al., 2005). In contrast, the T cell epitope profiles are more distinct. For example, SARS-CoV Orf1ab protein uniquely possesses many T cell epitopes."}, {"section_title": "Genetic drifts of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with immunogenicity changes of the viral proteins ::: RESULTS", "text": "We examined the variants in the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2a\u2013c). SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower level of genetic variation (Fig. 2a, n=5,568). In comparison, SARS-CoV (Fig. 2b, n=19) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2c, n=519) have both accumulated significant variation among the different strains. MERS-CoV has the highest level of genetic variations as it has spilled over many times into humans over several years. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar time spans of circulation in humans, and SARS-CoV-2 is still much more slowly mutating than SARS-CoV. In spite of this, in SARS-CoV-2, narrow domains of genomes that are mutated are already discernible, while mutations were observed in other regions as well (Fig. 2a). Additionally, more mutations are expected in the viral genome in the future, especially given the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could continue to propagate in human populations for years to come.\nGenetic variations may modify the immunogenicity landscape of the virus. The selection of effective vaccination epitopes should focus on parts of viral proteins with high potential for generating immunogenic epitopes, and with less chance of mutation. We examined whether the genetic drifts of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with the changes in the immunogenicity landscape of this virus (whether some of them are non-random antigenic drifts), and compared against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We examined individual mutations in each of 5,568 SARV-CoV-2 isolates with respect to the reference genome. For each virus isolate, we also calculated the T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes that would be lost and gained due to the mutations in each strain compared to the reference virus genome. For T cell epitopes, we take a sum of the lost/gained epitopes weighted by the Chinese HLA allele frequency, to generate an overall \u201clost\u201d (compare each strain against the reference) immunogenicity score, and an overall \u201cgained\u201d immunogenicity score. Fig. 2d (CD8+ T epitopes) and Fig. 2e (CD4+ T epitopes) show that the gained and lost immunogenicity scores are very comparable for most strains, which is just an effect of random change in the epitope profiles due to mutations. However, for epitopes of CD8+ T cells, which are the major cytotoxic T cell population, a small number of strains that showed a large difference in the lost and gained immunogenicity mainly have net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the epitopes of CD4+ T cells, which have much more complicated biological functions, have an intriguing increase in immunogenicity in a large number of strains, while also having a small number of strains demonstrating net loss in immunogenicity.\nSimilarly, we calculated the number of amino acid residues that could encode B cell epitopes (Fig. 2f). Despite that neutralizing antibody-based vaccines are usually designed against viral surface proteins, there are reports that viral interior and non-structural proteins could also elicit protective humoral immune effects (Carragher et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Therefore, we considered B cell epitopes of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that there is a dramatic overall decrease in the number of B cell epitopes in the isolates compared with the reference genome (Pval<1e-15). We limited this analysis to amino acid residues in stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues and had a similar observation (Pval<1e-15, Sup. Fig. 3a). These results suggest the existence of an association between humoral immunity and the genetic drifts of SARS-CoV-2 at this stage of human circulation.\nIn comparison, we performed a similar association analysis between genetic variation and immunogenicity for SARS-CoV (Fig. 2g\u2013i and Sup. Fig. 3b) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2j\u2013l and Sup. Fig. 3c). In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains with large immunogenicity changes almost all have a net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity, for both CD8+/CD4+ T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes.\nFurthermore, we grouped the SARS-CoV-2 strains by their collection times (Dec/2019, Jan/2020, Feb/2020, March/2020, and April/2020), and compared the changes in T cell and B cell immunogenicity. This longitudinal analysis shows that the number of CD8+ T cell epitopes showed no clear trend over time, and the latter appearing strains have gained immunogenicity for CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3ab, Jonckheere-Terpstrata test Pval=4.657e-11). The same analyses regarding T cell epitopes weighted by the Caucasian, Black, Latino, and Middle Eastern allele frequencies resulted in very similar conclusions (Sup. Fig. 4). Consistent with our observations above, Fig. 3c shows the latter appearing strains are less immunogenic than earlier strains with statistical significance achieved for B cell epitopes (Jonckheere-Terpstrata test Pval<2.2e-16). We observed the same trend when focusing on B cell epitopes that are in stretches longer than 10 epitope-encoding amino acids (Fig. 3d).\nNext, we investigated the genomic locations of the antigen variants. We examined all genomic positions of all SARS-CoV-2 strains and counted the number of gained/lost B cell and CD4+ T cell epitopes. Interestingly, for CD4+ T cell epitopes, the genomic positions with large net gains in immunogenic epitopes are concentrated in several sharp peaks (P1-P3 of Fig. 3e), and these sharp peaks correspond to genomic positions with high levels of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 (P1-P3 of Fig. 2a). Upon closer examination, there is one driving mutation within each peak that accounts for most of the mutational events, but there are also many low allele frequency mutations as well. We predicted Treg epitopes using the EpiVax JanusMatrix algorithm (Moise et al., 2013), which successfully identified HCV and flu Treg epitopes (Liu et al., 2015; Losikoff et al., 2015) and has been applied to develop flu vaccines (Wada et al., 2017). Interestingly, we found that the driving mutation in P3 has enhanced Treg epitope potential (Sup. File 1), which could induce tolerogenicity and immune escape, and might explain why this mutation has been selected for overtime.\nIn comparison, the distribution of the changed B cell epitopes shows a different pattern. Fig. 3e shows that the B cell epitope changes are much more evenly spread out across the whole genome. There is a sharp peak of loss of B cell immunity around 2,500bp on Orf1ab, but immediately 3\u2019 of this position, there is another peak of gain of B cell immunity. Curiously, these two peaks do not correspond to the hotspots of mutations (Fig. 2a). Nevertheless, this result suggests this region of Orf1ab might be important for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host humoral response system, which warrants further investigation. Overall, it seems that the changes in B cell immunogenicity is a general pattern that happens in the whole viral genome. However, we still suspect that there is a difference in the tendency of different viral proteins to lose B cell immunogenicity. We examined each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and calculated the rate of B cell immunogenicity loss normalized by the length of each protein across all viral strains (Fig. 3f). As is expected, the S protein shows the highest rate of B cell immunogenicity loss, followed by the nucleocapsid protein. Although the antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins are likely non-neutralizing, Carragher et al showed that they could still play important roles in facilitating resistance to viral infection (Carragher et al., 2008), which might explain our observation."}, {"section_title": "A actively updated database of the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2 ::: RESULTS", "text": "To facilitate immunological studies of SARS-CoV-2, we created the SARS-CoV-2 Immune Viewer (Fig. 4) to openly share the viral immunogenicity data of SARS-CoV-2, and also SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All SARS-CoV-2 strains that we have downloaded and processed are presented in a searchable table, with annotation information associated with each strain (Fig. 4a). Upon clicking each row of the table, users will be able to download a small data packet for that strain of SARS-CoV-2, which can be directly visualized on the desktop JBrowse software (Buels et al., 2016) (https://jbrowse.org/blog/). The JBrowse visualization demonstrates the genomic sequence, protein annotations, and T cell and B cell epitopes of each viral isolate (Fig. 4b). Within the Immune Viewer, the densities of the mutations and the T cell and B cell epitopes are also shown in interactive plots (Fig. 4c). This resource will be updated roughly monthly as new SARS-CoV-2 strains become available (with 1\u20132 months needed to process the new batch of viral sequences collected in each month)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In summary, this study provided the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and investigated the association between the genetic drifts of SARS-CoV-2 and immunogenicity changes of the viral proteins by analyzing more than 5,000 virus genomes. We also compared the findings from SARS-CoV-2 with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This work is complementary to the work of Grifoni et al, where a sequence homology approach together with bioinformatics analysis was taken to map SARS-CoV-2 proteins to experimentally validated immunogenic epitopes (Grifoni et al., 2020). However, that work only used the reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and did not analyze the genetic drifts and its association with immunogenicity. Our work, for the first time, clearly demonstrated the evolution of immunogenicity in SARS-CoV-2, and also compared it with the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To disseminate our research, a publicly accessible database, the SARV-CoV-2 Immune Viewer, was developed for easy exploration and downloading of results. The database is under continuous maintenance and updated roughly monthly to incorporate new strains of SARS-CoV-2 made available. We believe this is the first public immune-profiling resource of SARS-CoV-2 (including all its strains) for the research community.\nThis study shows that the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 could be more than merely random genetic drifts, by showing that some strains of SARS-CoV-2 have immunogenicity loss of B cell-based host immune surveillance and gain of CD4+ T cell immunogenicity due to mutations. A minimal loss in CD8+ cell-based immunogenicity was also observed. Partially similar to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have obvious loss of both CD8+ T cell-based and B cell-based immunogenicity. On the other hand, it is very intriguing that CD4+ T cell-based immunogenicity increased in SARS-CoV-2, whereas decreases were observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analyses provided one possible explanation that, for at least the driving mutation of P3, the increased CD4+ immunogenicity could actually be an increase in the potential of the epitope to induce Treg response, which might confer a survival advantage to the virus.\nThe loss of immunogenicity will lead to a loss of resistance to viral infection. However, it is uncertain whether the loss of immunogenicity will lead to a worsening of symptoms of the patients when infected, which is dependent on complicated biological and immunological processes in the human body. It is possible that a virus will become more infectious, but also less pathogenic at the same time, which may bring a stronger survival advantage to the virus. This effect is likely hard to investigate through simplistic testing of diversifying selection, such as the observed versus expected dN/dS substitution ratios, but solving this paradox could be particularly important for tackling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. This effect may also be related to a large number of reported asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 (Ling et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020), and the observation that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are considerably more aggressive than SARS-CoV-2 in terms of mortality rates.\nAdmittedly, bioinformatics prediction of B cell epitopes is still challenging (Galanis et al., 2019). However, the Bepipred 2.0 software that we used is among the best such software. More importantly, our conclusions regarding immunogenicity loss or gain are drawn based on the overall trend of changes in the total number of predicted B (and similarly T) cell epitopes among different strains. This analysis aggregates individual predictions with random and independent errors and is thus subject to much less inaccuracies.\nOverall, this study provides a window into the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2, and have yielded curious insights into the evolution of this virus. This resource may aid therapeutic and vaccination development against this virus to stop this pandemic earlier and to prevent future outbreaks."}, {"section_title": "Acquisition of the viral genome sequences ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences and meta data were downloaded from the NGDC (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databases. Sequences that are duplicated (8.7% of all collected strains), as defined by sharing the same genomic sequences, or that have low coverage (12.9%) were not included in the analyzed strains. The rest analyzed strains include all those submitted before April 6th and 3,454 strains collected between April 6th and May 13th, which were randomly sampled from all available strains in that time window. This down-sampling was done as the sequence alignment became impractically slow if all strains were included. The reference genome was acquired from NCBI, which is one of the first few isolates of SARS-CoV-2 collected and sequenced in late December of 2019: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.\nThe removal of the duplicates alleviates the concern in potential redundancy of the genomic data imposed by a biased sampling. Admittedly, left-over bias in sampling could still exist in the sampled strains, even after duplicate removal. However, it is difficult to further adjust for this bias phylogenetically, which could be performed through certain sub-sampling approaches with respect to the size of the infected population in each country. However, the reported numbers of infection cases in different countries are subject to inaccuracies due to methods of testing and other reasons, making this approach likely to result in additional bias.\nThe complete genome SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV sequences are also downloaded from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid694009%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+complete+genome and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid1335626%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+complete+genome.

Each isolate\u2019s genomic sequence was aligned to the reference genome sequence using EMBOSS needle with the gap opening penalty of 20 and the gap extension penalty of 0. The sequence differences were identified as genomic variants and they were annotated using Annomen.
