The studied subjects were 139 persons with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Predictors of progression to AD included brain volume, ventricular volume, hippocampal volume, APOE \u03b54 two alleles, A\u03b242, p-tau181, p-tau181/A\u03b242, memory, language, and executive function. We employ a combination of Cox regression analyses and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods to assess the prognostic utility and performance stability of candidate biomarkers. In a demographic-adjusted multivariable Cox model, seven measures-brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, APOE \u03b54 two alleles, A\u03b242, Memory composite, Executive function composite -predicted progression to AD. Time-dependent ROC revealed that this multivariable model had an area under the curve of 0. 832, 0.788, 0.794, and 0.757 at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months respectively. Supplemental Cox models with time of origin set differentially at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months showed that six measures were significant predictors at 12 months whereas only memory and executive function predicted progression to AD at 18 and 24 months. The authors concluded that baseline volumetric MRI and cognitive measures selectively predict progression from MCI to AD, with cognitive measures remaining predictive even late in the follow-up period. These findings may inform case selection for AD clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical syndrome that can presage Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (Petersen and Negash, 2008) . However, MCI patients as a group can be heterogeneous. Both clinical Shanshan Li1, Ozioma Okonkwo, Marilyn Albert, and Mei-Cheng Wang/ American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013) 1: 12-28 13 and epidemiological studies have shown that a variety of pathophysiological processes may explain the clinical syndrome among those who progress to dementia. Moreover, some individuals remain stable while others revert to normal cognitive functioning suggesting heterogeneity of outcome in this population (Gauthier et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2009 ). Accordingly, a great deal of effort has been dedicated to identifying a biomarker, or combinations of biomarkers, that increase the likelihood that an AD pathophysiological process is present and will likely lead to dementia within a few years (Devanand et al., 2008; Petersen and Negash, 2008; Mattsson et al., 2009) Investigations of the risk of progressing from MCI to AD dementia have largely focused on measures from the following categories: a) cognition (Dickerson et al., 2007) , b) genetics (Petersen et al., 1995) , c) neuroimaging (Jack Jr et al., 2005) , or d) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Mattsson et al., 2009 ). The majority of these studies have examined the predictive utility of such measures independently. While some studies have examined these measures in tandem, most have not used statistical approaches that account for censoring, and take into account the passage of time over which the prediction is being made (Devanand et al., 2008; Fleisher et al., 2008; Landau et al., 2010; Ewers et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) . Thus, relatively little is known about the comparative utility of these measures in determining the risk of incident AD dementia in persons with MCI, especially whether there is a change in their relative utility over time. There remains a need to develop a parsimonious and robust multidomain predictive model of the risk of progression to AD dementia among persons with MCI, taking progression of time into account. Such a model would potentially be useful for the design and evaluation of MCI clinical trials.\nIn this paper, we employ a combination of Cox regression analyses and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods to investigate the utility of various candidate measures, alone or in combination, for predicting progression to AD dementia in a large, well-characterized group of persons with MCI. These statistical methods were selected because they provide a method for choosing among a set of biomarkers the ones that might be most predictive, but also permit a comparison of their predictive utility with progression of disease. The specific measures chosen cover the domains of cognitive function, genetics, neuroimaging, molecular markers in CSF, and relevant demographic variables (i.e., age, education, and sex) were employed as covariates given their potential effect on disease progression in AD (Fleisher et al., 2007) "}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The analyses presented here were based on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/).

The basic analytic approach involved a linking of Cox regression models and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods to assess the prognostic utility and performance stability of candidate biomarkers.\nVariables that emerged significantly in univariate Cox models were considered as covariates of interest for multivariate Cox models. Two approaches were implemented for Cox model analysis with further variable selection, adjusting for age, education and gender. One approach used p-value criterion, where predictors with p-value greater than 0.05 were removed from the model. The other approach used LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996; Tibshirani, 1997) , a penalized likelihood based method that is designed for purpose of variable reduction. Risk scores-for use in subsequent ROC analyses-were derived by fitting a new Cox model that included selected variables from p-value criterion or LASSO.\nAlthough ROC analysis has been previously utilized in interrogating AD-related data, including data from ADNI (De Meyer et al., 2010; Landau et al., 2010) , neither the complication of censoring nor the component of time (given the longitudinal nature of these studies) has been optimally handled. Therefore, the results of these analyses might have been biased. Assuming t (year) is the time point of interest, we focused on subjects with follow-up time of at least t years. To account for censoring, we used the reduced sample technique to extract a representative data sample. That is, participants who dropped out before t years were excluded from the analysis. The classic ROC analysis was therefore carried out based on the reduced sample. Although this results in loss of data information (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) , this reduced sample technique produces a representative sample that incorporates censoring. To fully utilize information from all available data, we implemented an approach (i.e., time-dependent ROC) that permits an evaluation of the diagnostic performance of biomarkers at all time points of interest.\nTime-dependent ROC is an extension of the classic ROC. It was first introduced by Etzioni et al. (1999) to accommodate settings where disease status changes with time. Instead of a binary outcome (e.g., \"converter\" vs. \"non-converter\"), conversion status is allowed to change over time. For example, a subject who is unimpaired at an earlier time point can be a case (i.e., impaired) at a later time. Sensitivity is defined as P(Mi > c | Ti = t), and specificity is defined as\nwhere Ti is the event time, Mi is the risk score, and c is a cut-off point for classification. Thus sensitivity measures the expected fraction of subjects with marker value greater than c among the sub-population of individuals who are diagnosed with AD at time t, while specificity measures the fraction of subjects with marker values less than or equal to c among those whose failure time is greater than t (Heagerty and Zheng, 2005) . This dynamic status parallels the multiple contributions that a subject can make to the risk set that underlies the Cox partial likelihood function (Heagerty and Zheng, 2005) . Time-dependent ROC analysis and Cox regression form the ideal marriage when the proportional hazard assumption is (approximately) satisfied. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to measure the intrinsic ability of the biomarkers to discriminate between the converters and non-converters (Komori and Eguchi, 2010) .\nThough there is extensive research in identifying biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, cognitive measures are still the gold standard for clinical assessment of MCI and AD (Albert et al., 2011) . It is useful to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model with measures selected from cognitive domain only (i.e. Memory composite and Executive function composite) and compare it to the model with measures selected from all domains. For this purpose, we compared the timedependent ROC curves for the two models and calculated their corresponding AUCs. To test the improvement in prediction performance by adding the additional variables, we tested whether the difference in the AUCs of the two models was statistically significant (Pepe et al., 2013) .\nTo further evaluate the stability of the predictor set derived from our Cox model, we modified Cox regression to allow biomarker combinations to change over time and to identify temporal patterns in biomarker combination for predicting AD. The time-varying effects were evaluated by refitting the Cox model after removing from the dataset, at predetermined time points (e.g., 12, 18, 24 months), participants who had developed AD or been censored by those time points. Table 1 shows some demographic summaries of the studied participants. Table 2 lists the summary statistics for 13 covariates of the studied sample. In univariate Cox models, ten variables were associated with increased risk of progression to AD at 0.1 p-value level, as listed in Table 3 . These included brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, APOE \u03b54 2 alleles, A\u03b242, p-tau181, p-tau181/A\u03b242, Memory, Language, and Executive function. (Note that dose effect was found for the Categorical measure (0 = APOE \u03b54 negative, 1 = APOE \u03b54 one allele, 2 = APOE \u03b54 two alleles) 3 Converted to Z-scores (mean 0 and variance 1) APOE genotype: the indicator of Apoe \u03b54 2 alleles was significant while the indicator of Apoe \u03b54 1 allele was not significant.) These measures were then entered into a multivariable Cox model, with age, education, and gender included as covariates. In the multivariable Cox model, brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, APOE \u03b54 2 alleles, Memory composite, and Executive function composite emerged as significant predictors with p-value less than 0.05. The LASSO method was also performed for variable selection, and the output from LASSO contained one more variable A\u03b242 in addition to the six variables selected by p-value criterion. The LASSO approach selected the optimal model as a whole, while the p-value criterion selected each variable individually with values of other variables fixed, so the results from LASSO were preferred from perspective of model selection. Note that the variables selected by p-value criterion were a subset of the variables selected by LASSO, which suggested a level of robustness of the model selected by LASSO. The seven variables from LASSO output then entered the multivariate Cox model (see Table  4 ). The score function derived from the model was employed as the classifier in subsequent ROC analyses and its predictability was studied."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The classifier was first used in a classic ROC analysis. To account for censoring, we chose t = 24 month as the cut-off. Of the 139 participants who were MCI at baseline, 22 had dropped out of the study before 24 months. Therefore, they were excluded from the analysis, leaving us with a \"reduced sample\" of 117 participants, of whom 45 had developed AD by month 24 (\"converters\") with the other 72 remaining MCI (\"non-converters\"). To further evaluate the stability of the predictor set derived from our Cox model, we refitted the regression model, choosing as our \"time of origin\" 12, 18, 24 and 36 months respectively, after excluding those participants who had developed AD or been censored by those time points. Table 5 shows the results of these analyses. The reduced sample size at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months were 123, 102, 85 and 46 respectively. Five measures were significant predictors at 12 month; Memory and Executive function composites were significant at 18 and 24 month, whereas only Memory composite remained significant at all four time points. The sign for each predictor's regression estimate remained unchanged at all time points, suggesting that the predictors' mean effect was essentially stable over time even if attenuated.

This suggested that the proportional hazard assumption did not fully hold (i.e., the effects of the 4 measures were not constant over time) and thus a time-varying coefficient model was preferred. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we utilized a combination of demographics-adjusted Cox regression analyses and time-dependent ROC curves to examine univariate and multivariable predictors of progression from MCI to AD dementia. This permitted an examination of the relative utility of these measures over time. In our univariate models, we found that (i) all three MRI measures, brain, ventricular and hippocampal volumes predicted progression to AD, (ii) APOE \u03b54 2 alleles predicted progression to AD, (iii) among the CSF measures, A\u03b242, p-tau181 and p-tau181/A\u03b242, predicted progression to AD, and finally (iv) among the cognitive composite measures, Memory, Language, and Executive function composites, predicted progression to AD. Two model selection approaches were applied to those significant biomarkers identified by univariate Cox models, and the results only differed by one variable A\u03b242. The output from LASSO was preferred, as it was optimal from perspective of model selection. The selected predictors included brain volume, ventricular volume, hippocampal volume, APOE \u03b54 2 alleles, A\u03b242, Memory, and Executive. An ancillary demographics-adjusted multivariable Cox model was then fitted, using only the selected variables, for the purpose of obtaining risk scores that were then employed in time-dependent ROC analyses that assessed the discriminant performance of the regression model at different time points. These ROC analyses revealed that our multivariable model had high performance AUCs of 0.832, 0.788, 0.794 and 0.757 at 12, 18, 24 , and 36 months respectively. Of note, by accounting for censoring and the passage of time, our ROC analysis modified the conventional ROC approach and resulted in more informative measures for evaluating markers.\nAlthough prior studies have examined biomarker combinations as predictors of incident AD among persons with MCI (Fleisher et al., 2008; Landau et al., 2010; Ewers et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) , there have been very few references on using time-dependent ROC analyses to assess model performance across time. Derby et al. (2013) applied time-dependent ROC analyses in the investigation of progression to AD dementia using data from the Einstein Aging Study (EAS), where they studied the predictive ability of a few cognitive measures and they assumed proportional hazards model for these measures. In our work, we considered measures from CSF and neuroimaging domains in addition to the cognitive domain and we found that additional measures did improve on the predictive utility of the cognitive measures. Furthermore, we examined the stability of biomarkers over time by refitting the multivariable Cox regression model at specific time points of interest (i.e., 12, 18, and 24 months) after discarding data from MCI cases who had already received a diagnosis of AD or had been censored at those respective time points. These analyses revealed that at 12 months, five measures (i.e., brain volume, ventricular volume, APOE \u03b54 2 alleles, Memory composite, and Executive Function composite) remained significant predictors of prospective progression to AD. At 18 and 24 months, only Memory and Executive Function were significant predictors of progression to AD in this sample. Finally, at 36 months, only Memory remained significant. These findings suggest that whereas MRI and cognitive measures might generally be equally useful in prognosticating risk of incident AD among persons with MCI, cognitive measures retain their predictability for longer time during the disease progression, whereas MRI measures become less predictive with the passage of time. This supposition would be consistent with a recently proposed hypothetical model of AD pathological cascade that situates cognitive impairments in the later phases of the AD spectrum, with MRI abnormalities occurring earlier .\nBaseline measures of brain and, especially, hippocampal volumes have been shown in past studies to be useful in predicting progression from MCI to AD dementia (Jack Jr et al., 1999; Devanand et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2008) even when the statistical model included other measures. Similarly, impairments in neuropsychological measures of episodic memory and executive functions are recognized as the most common features of AD even at its earliest stages (Grady et al., 1988; Storandt and Hill, 1989) . Not surprisingly then, several studies have demonstrated that baseline performance on measures that tap memory and executive functions are effective in predicting the transition from a state of mild impairments to clinically-manifest AD dementia (Albert et al., 2001; Dickerson et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2007; Landau et al., 2010; Ewers et al., 2012) . Thus, overall, our finding that progression to AD dementia in persons with MCI varied as a function of baseline brain, ventricular and hippocampal volumes, baseline A\u03b242, APOE genotype, and scores on composite measures of Memory and Executive function is consistent with prior reports in the literature. Furthermore, our findings suggest that combinations of measures that reflect putatively earlier pathognomonic AD processes (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and memory loss) and those that perhaps reflect more extensive disease (i.e., whole brain atrophy and executive dysfunction) might be optimal for predicting which persons with MCI would go on to develop clinical AD.\nAs noted earlier, a major strength of this paper is the use of statistical methodologies-specifically time-dependent ROC curves-that allowed us to examine progression to AD in a manner that has not been accomplished by prior studies. Our approach revealed that, overall, the performance of our predictor set remained stable over time although there was some tapering of effect at later time periods. In addition, it demonstrated that cognitive tests of memory and executive function retain their predictive utility even late in the disease process whereas MRI measures become less useful with the passage of time. It would be of interest to see whether our predictor set replicates when additional biomarkers such as measures that tag inflammation, neuronal injury, glial activation, or oxidative stress are included in the model.\nAt this time, there are no federally-approved therapeutics for delaying the onset of dementia in persons with mild impairments. However, several targets are being evaluated in clinical trials (Neugroschl and Sano, 2009 ). The measures we have identified as predictive of progression from MCI to AD could be useful in case selection for these trials so that the trials are populated with persons who truly have underlying AD pathophysiology and are at greater risk of developing a dementia over a reasonable time frame. These measures could also play a role in identifying MCI cases who would benefit from treatment, when such treatments become available. The caption should appear directly below the picture.
