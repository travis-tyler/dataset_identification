In particular, I would like to thank my primary dissertation chair, Dr. Dongbin Kim, who not only encouraged me to pursue my doctoral degree at the University of Kansas, but has supported my work, mentored and inspired me to pursue my research interests, connected me with my colleagues as we began to develop our research programs, continually challenged my assumptions, and rigorously engaged me throughout this process to make me a better researcher and ensure that my study had sound footing. I would also like to thank my co-chair, Dr. Susan Twombly, who first introduced me to the joys and challenges of qualitative research and encouraged me to pursue a doctoral dissertation using qualitative methods. Her insights and suggestions have enabled me to bring the powerful voice of my interviewees into this study. Special thanks must also go to Dr. Donna Ginther, who provided me with access to the data I needed from the National Science Foundation, supported my research by providing me with laboratory space, and was always there to discuss my research and help me work through the numerous barriers that I encountered. I would also like to thank Dr. Lisa Wolf-Wendel for her support of my research, her critical feedback and encouragement along the way, and her confidence in my abilities. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Steven Maynard-Moody who has been incredibly supportive of my efforts and provided me with important insights into how to conduct qualitative research, decipher meaning, and convey the voice of those I engage with. I must also thank my friends and family. To my office colleagues, thank you for the time you have given me to pursue this degree in general and this research project in particular. Your passionate commitment to higher education has been a constant source of inspiration for me and vi compelled me to continue in my studies. To my good friend Bill Johnston, thank you for believing in me and encouraging me to pursue doctoral studies. To Bruce Hayes, my dear friend and colleague, I owe my sincerest thanks. He listened to me for countless hours as I discussed my research, kept me healthy and laughing throughout, and never waivered in his support and belief that I could accomplish this important research. To my Mom and Dad, I owe the world. They raised me to believe in myself, to pursue my dreams, and to rigorously interrogate the world around me. It is through them that I developed a passion for people and a passion for research, both of which were necessary for me to successfully complete this study. Their belief in me and their own example has made me who I am today. To my wife, Kim, words can not express how much I appreciate her love, support, and intellectual acuity. I could not have done this dissertation without her. She was there as I began to form the idea for this dissertation, she encouraged me when I felt the task was insurmountable, and she was my intellectual and spiritual collaborator every step of the way. Her voice and reflections are embedded in each page of this study. Finally, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to the memory of Flyer Swanson Bankart, our quirky greyhound. Flyer was waiting for me when I returned from my first evening class in the program, and he was with me right up until my dissertation defense presentation was completed. His insistence on evening walks and wonderful ear scratches kept me smiling, and more importantly never let me forget the joy of living life to the fullest each day. Thank you for everything, Flyer.

Today's researchers, especially in the SEH disciplines, must be increasingly collaborative if they are to remain fully informed in their fields, continue to compete effectively for funding and recognition, as well as maintain innovative and productive research programs at an international level (Adams & Clemmons, 2009;Etzkowitz, Webster, & Healey, 1998;Jones, 2010 a ;Jones, Wuchty & Uzzi, 2008;Katz & Martin, 1997;Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;Lawani, 1986;Levin, 1992;Luke, 2005;National Science Foundation, 2011;Stephan & Levin, 1992). Underscoring this point, Stephan and Levin (1992) note that, \"Good science necessitates knowledge of the frontier\u2026 Good science also requires up-to-date equipment and access to other scientists knowledgeable about what is going on in the field. Rarely does good science occur in isolation\" (p. 4). If collaboration is understood as essential in today's research environment (Kezar & Lester, 2009;Howard, 2011), a case that will be made in the pages that follow, it is important to understand who is collaborating with whom, how those collaboration skills are obtained and operationalized, and how those collaborations affect the research conduct (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009). These are the fundamental questions that this study seeks to address. There is also a larger overarching purpose to this study, however, which is to develop insights into the patterns and processes of, as well as the motivations behind collaboration in the performance of research. By comparing existing quantitative and original qualitative data, an expanded understanding of collaboration processes and their complexities is developed. This informs our understanding of the limits of existing data, while guiding future research focusing on collaborative research processes."}, {"section_title": "Increased Scholarly Competition and the Expansion of Knowledge Necessitate", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Collaboration", "text": "As doctoral recipients enter into increasingly competitive academic careers, they are expected to be productive. Collaboration, defined for the purposes of this study as working with other scholars in the performance of research, is seen as increasingly important as these scholars seek to make original contributions to their fields, as well as gain public recognition and support for their research (Balog, 1979/80;Beaver & Rosen, 1978;Beaver & Rosen, 1979 a ;Beaver & Rosen, 1979 b ;Eddy, 2010;Hodder, 1979/80;Howard, 2011;Jones, 2010 a ;Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;Katz & Martin, 1997;Kezar & Lester, 2009;Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;Lawani, 1986;National Science Foundation, 2011;Pao, 1980;Pao, 1981;Pravdic & Oluic-Vukovic, 1986;Price, 1963;Price, 1986;Price & Beaver, 1966). Evidence of the increase in research competition is reflected, in part, by growing worldwide expenditures on SEH research. Such expenditures increased at a rate of 7% per year overall in the ten years between 1996(NSB, 2010. Furthermore, that increase reflects a dramatic internationalization of the research effort, with the proportion of expenditures by countries outside North America and Europe, particularly those in Asia, growing at a much faster rate (NSB, 2010). Just as research expenditures have grown, so too have publication rates. The overall growth rate for academic publications from 1960 to 2010 averaged 5.5% per year, resulting in a doubling of the publication rate every 13 years (Jones, 2010 a ). In 2006, 941,000 scholarly articles were published, 846,900 (90%) of which were in the science and engineering fields (Jones, 2010 a ). As the volume of knowledge production has increased, the 'burden of knowledge' on the individual researcher has also increased just as a scholar's capacity to know the research in his or her field decreases (Jones, 2009;Jones, 2010 a ;Howard, 2011). Referencing the 5.5% annual growth rate in publications, Jones (2010 a ) writes, \"If any particular individual meaningfully engages only a fixed number of such articles, then the fraction of extant knowledge known by an individual would decline at the same rate: -5.5% per year\" (p. 2). This points to contributing factors that lead to longer doctoral programs, the narrowing of expertise over time, and an increase in the prevalence of postdoctoral training positions in preparation for academic careers (Jones, 2009). It also illuminates a context for collaboration with other researchers who can bring their unique knowledge to bear on a research problem and potentially enhance the primary researcher's unique contributions to the field and chances for publication. Just as scholarly publication numbers have increased generally and in the science and engineering disciplines in particular, coauthored scholarly articles in the science and engineering fields grew from 40% in 1988 to 64% by 200864% by (NSB, 2010. Researchers are also increasingly coauthoring articles with scholars from other institutions in the same country (42% in 2008, up from 32% in 1988), and coauthoring articles with collaborators from more than one country (22% in 2008, up from only 8% two decades before) [NSB, 2010]. In the context of increasing world-wide expenditures on research and development in the past ten years or so (NSB, 2010), this last finding on international co-authorship is understandable, but also interesting as it implies that as expenditures on research increase across areas of the world, so too do the connections between the researchers located in those areas and colleagues in other parts of the world. This has led many to believe in a growing \"death of distance\" in the area of knowledge production, by which they mean that physical location becomes increasingly irrelevant with advances in technology, communications, and transportation (Jones, Wuchty & Uzzi, 2008, p. 1259. While the death of distance premise may, at least in part, be true, the conditions under and mechanisms by which scholars become connected with their colleagues from afar have not been clearly elucidated in the literature on collaboration. In fact, some have found that contrary to those proclaiming a death of distance between researchers, selectivity has actually increased in recent years with elite institutions and their researchers gaining privileged access to cutting-edge knowledge and technologies at higher rates than ever before (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008). This will be discussed in more detail in the pages that follow. Citation data also speak to the growing network of scholarly research, and possibly to the growing interconnectedness of researchers themselves. Within the 941,000 articles published in 2006, 4,372,000 unique journal articles were cited by their authors (Jones, 2010 a ). Placed within a growth context, the publication Science and Engineering Indicators 2010 indicates that between 1992 and 2007 citations in U.S. science and engineering articles of publications from other countries increased significantly (from 6% overall in 1992 to nearly 10% in 2007) [National Science Board, 2010]. Furthermore, while U.S. researchers have been increasingly citing articles from scholars publishing in China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, international citation data within European Union publications have seen the most dramatic increases, rising from 17% in 1992 to over 23% in 2007. This evidence suggests that scholars are bringing more and more of the work of others into their research. As the rate of growth in publications continues to grow exponentially and investment of research dollars continues to expand world-wide, the ability of an individual researcher to keep pace with new research in a meaningful way and incorporate others' findings into his or her scholarship at a proportional level will decline over time (Jones, 2010 a ). Research partnerships and the citing of the work of others who are also engaged in their own research partnerships are natural solutions to the growing burden of knowledge and enable a deeper exploration of the literature within the fixed period that scholars have prior to timely publication of their work."}, {"section_title": "The Global Knowledge Economy", "text": "The overarching context for this increasing level of collaborative activity in academic production is a growing global knowledge economy in which knowledge-intensive innovation has become central to industry and economic competitiveness (Marginson, 2009;NSB, 2010;Ribes & Bowker, 2011), and access to knowledge has become a central concern (NSB, 2010;Renault, Cope, Dix, & Hersey, 2008). Universities are at the center of this knowledge economy, as producers and consumers of open source knowledge, defined as \"free knowledge goods\" that are produced, exchanged and generally available to the public (Marginson, 2009, p. 41); producers and consumers of knowledge-intensive products in the form of intellectual property and commercial know-how sold in the marketplace; and as producers and consumers of knowledge goods that have both public-and private-good characteristics (Adams & Clemmons, 2009;Luke, 2005;Marginson, 2009;NSB, 2010;Renault, Cope, Dix & Hersey, 2008). Across all forms of knowledge production, however, empirical evidence suggests that academic researchers are increasingly collaborative with partners beyond their institutions' walls (Adams, Chiang, & Starkey, 2001;Adams & Clemmons, 2009;Boardman & Corley, 2008;NSB, 2010). Adding to the coauthorship data cited previously, a study of 4.2 million scholarly works published over three decades found that multi-university collaborations are both the fastest growing kind of authorship structure and create the foundation for the production of papers with the highest impact factors, as measured by how frequently a particular article is subsequently cited in the literature (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008). Jones, Wuchty, and Uzzi (2008) also established that multi-university collaborations rose across all disciplines, but that those rises were the most dramatic within the sciences and engineering, as well as the social science disciplines. What we do not have a firm understanding of, however, are how different factors affect researchers' underlying motivations to collaborate. Nor do we understand the mechanisms colleagues employ to find inter-institutional collaborators on the one hand, and engage them in collaborative research on the other."}, {"section_title": "The Collaboration Problem: Producing Innovative Research within a Complex and Highly", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Interpersonal Global Knowledge Economy", "text": "The distinctions between forms of knowledge production are increasingly blurred within the higher education context (Luke, 2005;Marginson, 2009). Luke (2005) observes, \"Once knowledge and education become commercialized, they are transformed into a purchasable private good -no longer a public good accessible to all regardless of geography or socioeconomic circumstances. The implications for the future of public education and public archives of knowledge such as university libraries and scholarly publishing are dire. Arguably, the 'user pays' rationale has already changed the rules for the dissemination of and access to knowledge generated by academic research, which is fast fading as a public good for public access and benefit\" (p. 165). Nevertheless, references to both open source and commercial knowledge imply that the knowledge economy cannot be wholly explained through traditional economic descriptors. Rather, knowledge flows, defined by Marginson (2009) as the global cache of knowledge that enters the common worldwide knowledge system and is subject to monetary and non-monetary exchange, are driven by human beings and their negotiations with one another. Thus, the flow of knowledge, both commercial and open source, is not an entirely market-based phenomenon, but also inherently social and, as that flow becomes more global, culturally complex (Katz & Martin, 1997;Marginson, 2009;Walton & Guarisco, 2007). Emphasizing the interpersonal nature of knowledge flows, Walton and Guarisco (2007) explain that, \"knowledge is socially constructed, based on experience and transferred by ongoing participation and negotiation within an interactive social network\" (p. 360). As the knowledge economy grows and becomes more global and complex, and as those involved in driving knowledge flows become more diverse, person-to-person collaboration and general awareness of the rapidly expanding volume of scholarship from other researchers becomes all the more essential (Kim, Lee, & Marschke, 2009). Evidence of increasing levels of coauthorship, greater collaboration between universities, the higher impact of articles emerging from collaborative scholarship, and the increasingly complex web of citations in scholarly works all point to the social nature of research today. Ironically, however, with the increasing complexity of the research environment and diversity of the researchers themselves comes the challenge of keeping knowledge flows active. Swan (1999) writes, \"Whilst it might be relatively easy to share knowledge across a group that is homogenous, it is extremely difficult to share knowledge where the group is heterogeneous\" (p. 11). Walton and Guarisco (2007) also emphasize the challenges of sharing knowledge within an increasingly heterogeneous community of scholars, pointing out that as the exchange of information increasingly transcends boundaries, the challenges of geographic distance, language, and culture become more pervasive. A significant factor that contributes further to these challenges is the fact that knowledge does not move smoothly to and from all corners of the world as collaboration occurs, but becomes structured and imbued with new social meanings as it passes through our institutions and publication systems (Marginson, 2009). As such, the individual researcher's human capital (a person's knowledge, skills, as well as cultural and social experiences that increase a person's ability to do their work well and produce at a higher rate [Psacharopoulos, 2006]), becomes an integral part of the highly personal and subjective process of receiving, interpreting, integrating, expanding upon, and conveying new knowledge. If knowledge itself is imbued with social meaning, the social individual will also bring his or her own knowledge, experiences, assumptions, and meanings into the process of acquiring, interpreting, and using new knowledge from the social networks he or she is connected to. The researcher, therefore, must choose the features of new knowledge that are most important, develop an understanding of how those features comport with his or her existing knowledge and understanding of the phenomena at hand, and integrate that new information into his or her work in a fundamentally personal way. In this sense it is important to understand how researchers' credentials, training, cultural background, and/or knowledge networks might impact the way that they go about the process of new knowledge acquisition and application. Individuals' preferences toward different forms of collaboration, their motivations for collaboration, their propensity for acquiring collaboration skills, and the way that they make use of collaborative partnerships may be affected to varying degrees by these factors. It is for these reasons that this study examines the role of both the postdoctoral research training experience, as well as country of origin on faculty members' collaborative research practices. It is important to note that within the knowledge economy, the channeling and restricting of knowledge can create inequities in which researchers in certain locations do not have access to the knowledge, either open source or commercial, that can propel their research forward (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;Kenway & Fahey, 2006;Mc Auliffe & MacLachlan, 2005). Luke (2005) asserts that just as new technologies provide us with access to the world, they also create a \"digital divide\" in which those who have access to hardware and information become ever-more separated from their colleagues who do not have such access (pp. 168-169). In this sense, our knowledge economy remains more bounded by place than truly global in that a scholar's physical location and local access to world-wide knowledge resources still has an enormous impact on his or her ability to conduct informed, cutting-edge research (Altbach, 2002;Ellerman, 2006;Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;Kapur and McHale, 2005;Kenway & Fahey, 2006;Mc Auliffe & MacLachlan, 2005;Solimano, 2002;Welch & Zhen, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Given recognized restrictions to knowledge flows and Walton and Guarisco's (2007) assertion that, \"we create knowledge goods in and via our communicative associations\" (p. 45), it is incumbent upon us to understand when and why communicative associations are developed; how they are operationalized; how different forms of collaboration uniquely contribute to the discovery process, and who is successfully engaging in these communicative associations to overcome the knowledge access barriers they face in research production. To further develop our understanding of these issues, this research integrates both quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry. The study uses both national data from the National Science Foundation and original qualitative data from interviews to gain a better understanding of the forms of collaboration that are most common among early-career faculty members, as well as the factors that predict such collaborative activity. The answers to this line of inquiry regarding collaboration patterns were used, along with social network theory's weak ties hypothesis, to define the parameters for the qualitative interviews' exploration into the motivations behind and mechanisms for collaboration, as well as how researchers related their training to their development as collaborative researchers. Quantitative Research Questions. For the preliminary quantitative stage of this study, two questions served to guide the analyses. These questions were: \uf0a7 What forms of collaborative research activity are most representative of early-career faculty researchers working in the U.S.? \uf0a7 What factors predict early-career faculty researchers' participation in collaborative activities, with particular attention to the unique effects of field of study, institutional type, postdoctoral research experience, and/or international faculty status? In this stage of the study, data from the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) were used to evaluate which forms of collaborative research activity were most representative of early-career faculty members working in the United States. Collaborative research activity is defined by the 2006 SDR in terms of working with an immediate group or team, working with others in the same organization, working with individuals in other organizations in the U.S., and working with individuals located in other countries. For the first quantitative research question, the population of early-career faculty members under study were isolated and frequency analyses were run based on the four forms of collaborative research activity highlighted on the 2006 SDR. For the second quantitative research question, as the collaboration measures that served as the dependent variables were all dichotomous, binomial logistic regression was used to determine the degree to which respondents' field of study, institutional type, international status, age, years since earning the doctorate, tenure status, gender, and/or postdoctoral experience predicted the four collaborative activity types articulated above. The rationale for including these independent variables is discussed in Chapter 3. Fields of study were categorized into four groups for the purposes of analysis. These included the life sciences, the physical sciences, the social sciences and engineering. Details regarding the selection of informants, human subjects protections, construction of the semi-structured interviews, data transcription process, coding, and the process of data analysis are discussed in Chapter 3."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Overview", "text": "Early-career faculty members were selected as the focus population of this study for a variety of reasons. In a relatively short period of time, SEH researchers go from the structured and supervised doctoral student experience to an environment in which they are expected to independently generate original research and form the collaborative partnerships they need to succeed in the global knowledge economy. The record of research accomplishment during this time has been shown to be one of the primary factors considered in the tenure and promotion process (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). Given the pressure to produce and publish innovative research, the higher impact of and citation number for articles published by authors of more than one institution (Adams & Clemmons, 2009;Adams, Gurney, & Marshall, 2007;Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008), along with the increasing burden of knowledge upon the individual researcher and the growing complexity of the research problems themselves (Adams & Clemmons, 2009;Jones, 2009;Jones, 2010a), collaboration understandably takes center stage during this period. Social network theory in general and its strength of weak ties hypothesis in particular were used to frame the study and contextualize the results. While social network theory is described in detail in Chapter 2, for the purposes of this introduction this theory explains how individuals develop and utilize their personal connections or ties to exchange and produce knowledge. Social network theory prioritizes the complex interpersonal relationships people establish in the performance of their work and, in this study, how these relationships affect the processes and outcomes of research. Within this theory the strength of weak ties hypothesis has been used to explore and explain the development of collaborative research networks of faculty members. Simply stated, the strength of weak ties concept hypothesizes that the more an individual is connected to people in different knowledge communities or hubs, the more likely they are to learn new information beyond their immediate sphere of regular intellectual activity (Eddy, 2010). This is important in the context of this study as it explains both the value of developing more extended research networks within and across disciplines, as well as the possible motivations behind participation in certain networking activities as faculty members seek out new and work to enhance their existing collaborations."}, {"section_title": "The Need for a Study on Collaborative Research Processes", "text": "Collaboration as a topic for research is not new and in fact has become an area of enormous popular and scholarly interest in recent years as people come to understand its essential role in the production of new knowledge. As a case in point, in December of 2011, the National Science Foundation released the Mosaic Report in which it articulated key directions for future research for its Directorate of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. In this report they cite a series of white papers that had been submitted to NSF that focus on the importance of developing a stronger understanding of collaboration within the research enterprise. In particular, the report asserts that the future of scientific research is fundamentally data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and collaborative. Reading the white papers themselves, Ribes and Bowker (2011) write, \"Today, knowledge production and sharing are being transformed by sweeping changes in information technology, market relations, and patterns of collaboration\" (p. 1). In a separate white paper, Koschmann, Lewis, and Isbell (2011) make the case as well, stating, \"The ability of individuals, groups, and organizations to make meaningful and productive decisions together will be a hallmark of the twenty-first century. Collaboration needs to play a prominent role in all aspects of society. As such, the full force of the social and behavioral sciences is needed to expand our understanding of collaboration and how we can make better decisions collectively\" (p. 2). Kezar and Lester (2009) situate this need to develop a fuller understanding of collaboration within the context of a higher education institutions themselves, emphasizing that the creation of a collaborative campus environment conducive to research production will not happen by accident. Rather, they emphasize, it will be a process that is both intentional and deliberate. Eddy (2010) concurs, writing, \"Central to organizational or individual collaborations are a series of processes. Better understanding of the components of how collaborations develop can thus result in more effective joint ventures\" (p. vii). While there is indeed a substantial body of literature on knowledge flows, this literature focuses primarily on the products of collaboration, rather than on the development of collaboration skills themselves, the patterns of collaboration, the mechanisms researchers employ when accessing and contributing to the knowledge economy, or on how researchers effectively apply their collaborative efforts to their research (Eddy, 2010;Katz & Martin, 1997;NSB, 2010;Renault, Cope, Dix, & Hersey, 2008). Measures of the benefits and outcomes of collaboration, such as the level of technology transfer, the number of new licenses, the creation of new industries and jobs, the number of citations and patents, coauthorship rates, and the degree to which new products are created, are indeed critically important to researchers and their institutions. This is especially true as researchers continue to compete for the resources necessary to continue their research and lobby legislators, foundations and government institutions for the continuation of support and the creation of new funding programs and initiatives (Renault, Cope, Dix, & Hersey, 2008). However, as federal, state, and private institutions continue to expend scarce resources through grant programs and to develop policies and programs designed to enhance collaboration and produce cutting-edge research while increasing the competitive power and global impact of the research endeavors of the United States, it is also critical that we develop a better understanding of how our programs, institutional structures, and policies can facilitate and enhance the efficacy of collaborative efforts (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009). Furthermore, as the drivers of research at our universities, it is interesting to note that we know very little about how the pressure to collaborate in scientific production affects faculty members' behavior or ongoing development as researchers. Eddy writes, \"Little research exists that discusses the added strain to faculty work that stretches roles to now include institutional collaboration\" (p. 62). An examination of the benefits and outcomes of collaboration make it clear that collaborative work is essential to research success in a rapidly expanding knowledge economy (Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;NSF, 2011;Ribes & Bowker, 2011). However, those metrics say nothing about how researchers can maximize their collaboration skills and effectively apply them to a research problem. Renault, Cope, Dix, and Hersey (2008) note that metrics of success, such as patents and publication numbers, are insufficient for informing policy and constructively changing researchers' behaviors because metrics \"are by-products of the activities that should be encouraged\" (p. 102). In an era of accountability and scarce resources, it seems critically important that we also focus on how we can nurture and maximize those activities, such as effective engagement in collaborative research, that have proven to lead to desirable outcomes (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009;Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011). While we may be able to assume that tomorrow's researchers will understand the importance of collaborative research, we cannot assume that those same researchers will uniformly have the professional training, experience, and background that they need to maximize the benefits of their collaborative activities, or that they will be in a position to make informed choices on their training and development as future innovative researchers. This is especially true as the community within which researchers collaborate becomes more international and the collaborative activities themselves become more complex and challenging due to the increasing heterogeneity of the various actors and contexts in which knowledge resides. Emphasizing the important role that our institutions of higher education play in the development of faculty members' collaborative skills, Eddy writes, \"Faculty members are socialized for their roles during their time in graduate school (Austin, 2002); thus, the faculty role models present in research institutions have a large impact on the professions and on how new faculty members anticipate their roles\" (p. 62). They go on to speak to the individual agency faculty members possess in the conduct of their research. This is possible due to their expertise on the one hand, and through their disciplinary networks with highly skilled colleagues on the other (Eddy, 2010). As doctoral programs increase in length, the postdoctoral training period becomes ubiquitous across the disciplines, and the competition for academic positions continues to increase, early-career faculty members will have less time to transition to and achieve in their chosen careers (Jones, 2009;Jones, 2010 a ;Jones, 2010 b . Federal agencies are already seeing the average age of their grant recipients increase. Empirical data indicate that the average age of innovation has increased significantly over the past century (Jones, 2010 b ). All of this suggests that doctoral programs, postdoctoral training opportunities, and faculty support programs have an obligation to ensure they are appropriately preparing faculty members for collaborative careers and supporting those collaborative activities as soon as they are in those careers. This study uses national data to examine how the backgrounds of early-career faculty members relate to the types of collaborative activity they engage in. By subsequently talking with members of this population about how they came to be collaborative in their research, why they engage in different forms of collaboration, and how those different forms of collaboration help them to achieve their research goals, we gain insight into how individuals understand their own experience within the context of national data. We also gain a deeper level of understanding into the unique, complementary, and contradictory roles that researchers' doctoral programs, postdoctoral training programs, and early academic careers play in their development as collaborative researchers. Furthermore, by talking with scholars directly, this study further develops our understanding of the relationship between collaborative activities and the products of their research efforts. Taken together, the findings of this mixed methods study inform the policies, programs, and actions of federal funding agencies, higher education institutions, mentors, and individual researchers alike and enable the proactive creation a community of skilled research collaborators prepared to work together in the discovery and innovation process."}, {"section_title": "Outline of the Dissertation", "text": "This dissertation is organized into six chapters. The introductory chapter is followed by a review of the relevant literature and an explanation of the theoretical framework used to guide the research questions, data analysis, and conclusions derived from that analysis. Specifically, the literature review provides an overview of what we know about the relationship between time in career, collaboration, and productivity. This discussion is critical to understanding why earlycareer faculty members were targeted for this study on collaboration processes. This is followed by a discussion of the growing role of the postdoctoral research experience as a mechanism for training highly skilled researchers for independent research. The changing demographics of the doctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty ranks are also discussed, reflecting the rapid internationalization of these populations and their high levels of productivity. A discussion of social network theory in general and Granovetter's (1973) strength of weak ties hypothesis in particular conclude the chapter. In particular, the possible interactions between mobility and collaboration are discussed and how that may relate to research productivity within the context of social network theory. Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of the study's mixed methodological approach. This includes an overview of the SDR survey instrument, a description of the SDR sample population studied and variables used, and a detailed explanation of the quantitative analytical techniques employed and their rationale. Chapter 3 also provides a description of the sampling method used to identify participants for the open-ended interviews, the data collection and analysis procedures, and the methods used to verify results and ensure their trustworthiness. In Chapter 4, the results of the quantitative analysis are reported. Chapter 5 examines the results from the qualitative stage of the study. Interviewees' self-reported collaboration patterns and processes for collaboration, as well as motivations for and gains from collaborative activity are explored. Respondents' sense of their development as collaborative researchers are also examined, as well as their ongoing efforts to refine and expand their collaborative skills. The final chapter discusses the overall findings of the study, how those finding relate to social network theory and the weak ties hypothesis, as well as the role of institutions of higher education and agencies in supporting collaborative research in higher education research. The chapter concludes with an overview of the study's limitations, as well as areas for additional research."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "This chapter reviews the literature that informs the study.

Research in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that productivity and original scientific contributions, as measured by publication numbers and the receipt of research prizes, peaked on average between the ages of 25 and 45 (Simonton, 1988;Stephan & Levin, 1992). While more recent research has shown that the average age of peak scientific productivity has steadily increased over the past century due to the increased 'burden of knowledge' (Jones, 2009; Jones, 2010 a ) and the longer training times necessary to prepare scholars for successful independent research careers (Jones, 2009;Jones, 2010 a ;Kaiser, 2008), the relationship between innovative activity and age has been shown to be curvilinear with a steeper rise in productivity as scholars' move through their earlier years and then a gradual decline over time after productivity peaks (Jones, 2010 b ;Simonton, 1988;Stephan & Levin, 1993;Weinberg & Galenson, 2005). The main concern related to the later onset of scholarly productivity is that productivity levels do not seem to have increased beyond middle age (Jones, 2010 b ). In Jones' (2010 b ) words, \"The narrowing of the innovative life cycle reduces, other things equal, aggregate creative output\" (p. 1). Efficiency in training and preparation for independent research careers, as well as developing mechanisms to enhance scholars' life cycle productivity are therefore of great concern to educators, independent researchers, and institutions that fund research alike. The outgoing message of National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Zerhouni is a case in point. Zerhouni spoke urgently about the rising age of the average first-time NIH research grant recipients, which has crept up from 37 in 1980 to 42 in 2008, and called for a reprioritization in their grant programs toward early career scientists (Kaiser, 2008). Part of the rationale for this push toward reallocating funding to early-career researchers can be found in the work of Weinberg and Galenson. Weinberg and Galenson (2005) examined the life cycle creativity of Nobel laureate economists and found significant differences in productivity and the type of innovation achieved by age. They found that Nobel laureates who are more conceptually oriented tend to produce their best work on average at age 25. Experimentally oriented Nobel laureates, however, tended to produce their peak work in their mid-50s. Their conclusion was that experience benefits experimental innovators while newness to a field tends to benefit conceptual innovators. By providing young researchers with research support earlier in their careers, it is thought that they will increase their conceptual innovative productivity early on (Kaiser, 2008). This can then set the stage for researchers' later careers when they begin increasing their experimental innovative productivity as their knowledge and experience grows. Preliminary evidence from NIH's pilot effort to allocate more grants to early career scientists indicates that this population is just as successful in its research and just as likely to be competitive for future NIH funding as their better-established colleagues in the field (Kaiser, 2008). There is another set of reasons for why researchers may be highly productive in their earlier careers. While the young may be naturally more adept at conceptual innovation in their early years (Weinberg and Galenson, 2005), they are also highly motivated toward scholarly productivity, especially if they are in academic careers that require research productivity to earn the security of tenure and the benefits of ongoing promotion. In addition to increasing the chances of earning tenure and promotion, high productivity in the early career can disproportionately affect a scholar's salary, prestige, as well as the number of competitive job offers that he or she receives from desirable institutions (Stephan & Levin, 1992). High productivity among younger scientists is also seen as valuable by employers, largely because it is considered an indicator of future productivity (Stephan & Levin, 1992). No doubt this is one of the reasons research production is given such weight in the tenure review and ongoing promotion process (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). The younger the scientist is, the longer that productivity trend might last if the employer can retain the scholar (Stephan & Levin, 1992). Furthermore, as a younger scholar becomes established and recognized in the field, he or she develops a cumulative advantage that is externally reinforced over the course of his or her career. Robert Merton called this the Matthew Effect, whereby scholars with an established reputation accrue greater recognition for their work than those who contribute equally but have not yet made their mark in the field (Merton, 1968). As Allison, Long, and Krauze (1982) put it, \"Two publications of equal intrinsic merit will receive differential recognition if the authors are unequal in prestige\" (p. 615). The cumulative benefits that an institution might derive from this differential recognition are potentially enormous. An institution of higher education, for example, may benefit from an eminent scholar's ability to attract grant funding, highly qualified graduate students, donations for a research program, or other productive research scholars looking to establish careers at institutions with high levels of innovation, connections, and research productivity (Stephan & Levin, 1992). In light of the high-stakes competitive research environment tenure-track and newly tenured faculty members find themselves in, evidence of high productivity among SEH scientists early in their careers, the emphasis colleges and universities place on research in making tenure and promotion decisions, and the well-documented Matthew Effect, examining the development and application of collaborative research skills among early-career faculty members becomes critically important. Further emphasizing the importance of understanding collaboration within the context of research production in the SEH disciplines is an abundance of evidence indicating a high correlation between collaborative activity and scholarly productivity (Balog, 1979/80;Beaver & Rosen, 1978;Beaver & Rosen, 1979a;Beaver & Rosen, 1979b;Jones, 2010;Hodder, 1979/80;Katz & Martin, 1997;Lawani, 1986;Pao, 1980;Pao, 1981;Pravdic & Oluic-Vukovic, 1986;Price, 1963;Price, 1986;Price & Beaver, 1966). This correlation is undoubtedly due to a number of factors. Collaboration enables the efficient and cost-effective pooling of resources in the production of cutting-edge research (Katz & Martin, 1997); the sharing of information, skills, and techniques among scientists working in related and/or complimentary areas of inquiry (Katz & Martin, 1997;Kuhn, 1970;Peters & Van Raan, 1989;Stefaniak, 1982); as well as quick and cost-effective access to specialized knowledge and equipment (Edge & Mulkay, 1976;Gordon, 1980;Jones, 2010;Price, 1986). Illustrating the potentially critical role that collaboration plays in scientists' early careers, Pravdic & Oluic-Vukovic (1986) found that collaboration with highly productive scholars enhances personal productivity, while collaboration with less productive scholars tends to decrease personal productivity. Supporting Merton's concept of the Matthew Effect, research has also shown that publications with multiple authors tend to have higher acceptance rates (Gordon, 1980), as well as greater impact factors and recognition in the field (Jones, 2010;Lawani, 1986;Nudelman & Landers, 1972). Finally, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration in research productivity and recognition, research has consistently demonstrated that internationally co-authored papers have significantly higher impact factors than papers published by authors from a single country (Adams, Gurney, & Marshall, 2007;Narin and Whitlow,1990). Taken together, this evidence suggests that early-career faculty members are highly motivated to develop the collaborative networks that could enhance their research productivity, original contributions to their field of inquiry, and recognition of those contributions by scholars in their disciplines (Jones, 2010). As detailed in Chapter 3, variables such as age, years since earning the doctorate, and tenure status have been deliberately included in the study in order to explore their relationship with collaborative activity."}, {"section_title": "The Postdoctoral Research Experience and Country of Citizenship", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Postdoctoral Experience", "text": "Simply recognizing the importance and potential of collaborative research and wanting to establish a set of beneficial collaborative partnerships do not in and of themselves result in the effective development and use of collaborative linkages, however. Thus, it is also important to examine the role of scholars' training in the development and fostering of collaborative research skills among early-career SEH faculty members (Brainard, 2005). Various approaches to training can be pursued by doctoral recipients seeking faculty careers, and this varies substantially by field of study (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008;Regets, 1998;Regets 2002). The postdoctoral research position, for example, defined by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [2006] as a temporary position awarded in academe, industry, a non-profit organization or government primarily for gaining additional education and training in research, would seem to be of growing importance as an intermediate step in scientists' transformation from high-potential doctoral students to highly productive and collaborative researchers in the SEH disciplines (Davis, 2005;Hoffer, Gregorian, & Hedberg, 2008;Nerad & Cerny, 1999). The 'postdoc' was first established at Johns Hopkins University in 1876 as an optional way of acquiring advanced specialized skills in preparation for a faculty career (Graduate Employees and Students Organization [GESO], 2001). While these positions also served doctorates for a time as a way to stay employed in the field as the number of faculty jobs dwindled (Cantwell, 2009;Davis, 2005;National Postdoctoral Association, 2009;NSB, 2010), it is also becoming nearly ubiquitous and an increasingly essential developmental experience for those desiring research-related careers in the SEH disciplines (Cantwell, 2009). Between 1981 and 1997, for example, university postdoctoral numbers increased by 125% (GESO, 2001), and between 1998 and 2005 overall postdoctoral numbers increased by another 21% . By 2005, over 50,000 postdoctoral scholars were employed across sectors in the United States (Brainard, 2005, Davis, 2005Lee, 2001;NSB, 2010). More recent postdoctoral scholar estimates by the National Science Foundation indicate that in 2009 there may have been upwards of 89,000 postdoctoral scholars in the United States (National Postdoctoral Association, 2009). Of these 50,000 to 89,000 positions, roughly 69 to 70% are federally funded with 74% of these federally funded positions in the life or health sciences, 22% in the physical sciences or engineering, and 4 % in social sciences or humanities (Davis, 2005;National Postdoctoral Association, 2009). Between 2002 and 2007, 45% of all U.S. Ph.D. program graduates began their careers with a postdoctoral appointment, up dramatically from only 31% in 1981 (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008). The percentage of doctoral recipients who end up pursuing postdoctoral research opportunities varies substantially by discipline and sub discipline, but it is clear that the postdoc is fast becoming a standard career path in the sciences and engineering. For example, of those who graduated between 2001 and 2006, 57% of doctorates in the life sciences; 50% of those in the physical sciences; 21% in engineering, computer, and mathematical sciences; and 23% of doctoral recipients in the social sciences reportedly held at least one postdoctoral position in the past five years (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008). Furthermore, these numbers are rapidly increasing (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008;Regets, 1998). Engineering for example, reflected a 164% increase in the number of graduates who pursued a postdoctoral position (comparing the group who had graduated within 5 years of the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients with all earlier cohorts), and computer/mathematical sciences postdoc numbers grew by 82% (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008). Naturally, these numbers reflect an increase in the numbers of new faculty members who have had postdoctoral experience prior to taking on a tenure-track position. Illustrative of this point, 49% of all former postdocs were found to be employed in the education sector, mainly university and college appointments on the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008). Looking at census data collected by the American Chemical Society, Parr (2002) found that upwards of 71.4% of chemists working within academia have held a postdoctoral position (these numbers vary by sub discipline within chemistry. This number is consistent with the research university survey findings of the Association of American Universities (1998), which found that two-thirds of new assistant professors had held at least one postdoctoral position. With regard to the productivity of postdoctoral researchers, a review of two issues of the internationally distributed journal Science revealed that 43% of the first authors were postdoctoral scholars (Vogel, 1999). The same study found that over a 10-year period, 75% of the papers published out of a Harvard Medical School lab were first-authored by postdoctoral researchers. Furthermore, data from the Sigma Xi national postdoctoral survey indicate that as training becomes more structured for postdoctoral scholars, their productivity, as measured by the number of research publications, increases significantly (Brainard, 2005;Davis 2009). This finding clearly points to the multifaceted connection between the postdoctoral experience, productivity, and training. In terms of collaboration, 78% of postdocs who responded to the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) indicated that they work with an immediate group or team, 61% indicated that they worked with others in the same organization, 48% indicated that they worked with others in another U.S. organization, and 19% indicated that they collaborated with scholars abroad (Foley, 2010). This is despite the fact that these scholars tend to be in more controlled research environments where a higher level of supervision is the norm (\u00c5kerlind, 2005;Brainard, 2005;Davis, 2005;Davis, 2009;Freeman, 2001;Graduate Employees and Students Organization, 2001). These data suggest that the higher levels of supervision expected for postdoctoral mentees do not necessarily result in collegial isolation within the knowledge economy. Postdoctoral scholars seem to be collaborating at high levels despite their general lack of independent researcher status. Emphasizing this last point, data from the 2005 Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey suggest that postdoctoral researchers not only collaborate broadly in the production of their research, but that they are beginning the process of transitioning to more independently generated collaboration. For planning new research projects, for example, only 8% of respondents to the Sigma Xi survey indicated complete control over the planning of new research projects (Davis, 2005). Another 17% felt that they were mostly in control of new project planning. However, the data on collaboration show a possible appropriation of control in this area. Forty-six percent of respondents (13,810 of 29,890) to the 2006 SDR indicated that their current postdoctoral position increased their contacts with colleagues in the field to a \"great extent\" (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2006). Furthermore, 17% of respondents on the Sigma Xi survey indicated that they felt in complete control of whom they choose to collaborate with and an additional 29% reported that they are mostly in control of whom they collaborate with. These findings corroborate those from other data on the Sigma Xi survey. Both U.S. citizens (36.4%) and temporary visa holders (39.2%) indicated that the development of opportunities to collaborate with researchers in the field other than their postdoctoral supervisor were \"very important\" (National Postdoctoral Association [NPA], 2005). Respondents also indicated that the opportunities for collaboration with people other than the supervisor were a \"very important\" reason for choosing their current position over their next best employment option (NPA, 2005). Clearly, collaboration plays a critical role in the professional lives of the highly productive SEH workforce. What we do not now know, however, is how uniquely formative the postdoctoral experiences are in terms of defining the nature and extent of future collaborative work. As postdoctoral researchers go on to pursue independent research careers as faculty members in the SEH disciplines, do they have an advantage in the realm of collaborative activity over those faculty members who have not had a postdoctoral research experience? Clearly training does not end with the postdoctoral position. Many faculty members, for example, receive support from peers and more senior colleagues as they develop their independent research programs and begin to assemble their tenure and/or promotion dossiers (de Janasz & Sullivan, 2004;Diggs, Garrison-Wade, Estrada, & Galindo, 2009;Jacelon, Zucker, Henneman, & Stacciarini, 2003;Knippelmeyer & Torraco, 2007;Mentors Peer Resources, 2010;Mullen & Hutinger, 2008;Pololi, Knight, Dennis, & Frankel, 2002). As the data on age and life-cycle productivity also suggest, the kind of productivity may change over the course of a scholar's life with conceptual innovations coming earlier in the career and experimental innovation and its associated products coming later on as a person's human capital accumulates (Weinberg and Galenson, 2005). These issues are explored in both the quantitative and qualitative stages of the study. It should also be pointed out that the postdoctoral experience is not the only way that new faculty members can develop their collaborative research skills prior to beginning their faculty careers. Many faculty members, for example, collaborated with their faculty mentors as students and were included in their mentors' research projects, as well as in the extensive collaborative networks those mentors had built over time (Cole, 2009;Lei & Chuang, 2009). Thus, we must acknowledge that new faculty members may have had a variety of training experiences over the course of their graduate, postdoctoral, and faculty careers that may have contributed to the development of their collaboration skills. By combining survey data from the SDR and data from semi-structured interviews with faculty members, new insights are gained as to what those key experiences are and their relative importance in terms of informing the individual researcher's perceptions of and involvement in collaborative research activities."}, {"section_title": "Country of Citizenship", "text": "The reason for comparing the development of collaborative activity among U.S.-based faculty members is that international doctoral program graduates undeniably make increasingly substantial contributions to U.S. research interests. Temporary U.S. resident international students received 36% of all science-and engineering-related doctorates awarded in the U.S. in 2005 and more than half of the doctorates in engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, physics, and economics in that same year (Lee, 2001;NSB, 2008). The National Science Board (2008) also reports that nearly all the recent growth in the number of science and engineering doctorates earned in the U.S. is attributable to temporary U.S. residents. Indeed, U.S. census data between 1990 and 2000 show that the percentage of international doctorate-level workers in the science and engineering sector of the U.S. increased from 24% to 38% (NSB, 2003;Tremblay, 2005). In fact, a majority (55-57%) of U.S.-based postdoctoral researchers are temporary U.S. visa holders (GESO, 2001;NSB, 2008;NSB, 2010;Regets, 2007 b ). Beyond the doctoral and postdoctoral ranks, demographic studies have shown that at least 16.9% of new entrants to faculty jobs and 11.5% of those in senior faculty positions are foreign-born (Howe, 2008). Furthermore, at research universities, 26.6% of new entrants and 17% of senior faculty are foreign-born (Howe, 2008). Emphasizing the rapid growth of this international faculty population, the National Center for Education Statistics reports that between 1993 and 2003 non-resident alien full-time faculty numbers grew by an astonishing 96.3% (Howe, 2008). In addition, this population of U.S.-based researchers has been shown to contribute substantially to U.S. research and innovation efforts (Stephan & Levin 2001;Wadhwa et al., January 2007;Vogel, 1999). No doubt this is due in part to the fact that immigration regulations related to permanent residency largely favor the highly skilled, as well as scholars who have substantial publication and presentation records, have received national awards for their research, and can show evidence of other scholars citing their work and seeking their expert opinions. Taken together, the increasing prevalence and substantial contributions of this population suggest that it is important to understand how this population conducts its collaborative research and where they obtained their skills at collaboration. This can not only inform our understanding of how to best prepare doctoral students and postdoctoral trainees for competitive research careers in a global knowledge economy (e.g. encourage doctoral students to spend some time conducting research in a non-U.S. environment), but may inform the policies of federal agencies and other institutions that support U.S. research efforts. Many grant programs, especially federal grants through institutions like NSF and NIH, are unavailable to U.S.-based researchers who do not have U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status (\u00c5kerlind, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "The focus of this stems largely from the theoretical foundation used to frame the research questions and data analysis, as well as from the increasing prevalence of international scholars in the United States studying and working in the science, engineering, and health disciplines. Social network theory and the strength of weak-ties hypothesis (Burt, 1992;Granovetter, 1973;Granovetter, 1983) have been used to guide this study. The exchange and production of new knowledge has been shown to rely heavily upon the interdependent social network ties (social capital) that an individual develops over his or her life (Burt, 1992;Eddy, 2010;Granovetter, 1973;Granovetter, 1983;Jones, 2010;Portes, 1998) [See Figure 2.1]. With the increasingly global nature of the knowledge economy and the rising importance of accessing people and the scholarship that they produce beyond an institution's or even a country's borders (Jones, 2010), the question is explored as to whether or not foreign-born faculty members have a greater number of interdependent ties with scholars within their institutions, beyond their institutions, and beyond the U.S. The strength of weak ties hypothesis predicts that it is the novel information that we gain from outside our normal day-to-day collegial networks that has the potential to contribute substantially to the production of innovative scholarship. Chubin (1976) points out that all scientific fields have a center and a periphery where the periphery is defined by its members' weak ties to the center and to other relevant scientific groups. He writes, \"If the innovativeness of central units is shackled by vested intellectual interests (or perspectives) then new ideas must emanate from the margins of the network\" (Chubin, 1976, p. 460). Researchers rely upon colleagues within their immediate environment to share their ideas, receive feedback, and ensure that they are appropriately applying the knowledge that they are familiar with to the research problem at hand. This form of interaction is characteristic of what Granovetter refers to as strong ties. Particularly characteristic of strong ties is the relatively closed nature of the knowledge network and the redundancy of the information that is shared over time (what Chubin refers to above as \"vested intellectual interests\" (1976, p. 460). In Figure   2.1, strong ties are articulated by the immediate research group and the strong ties between the primary researcher and his or her colleagues within the lab. This is the strongest set of ties for the primary researcher, followed by the ties s/he and her/his immediate colleagues share with others from the same institution (intra-institutional research groups). Granovetter characterizes this \"habit of mind\" as reflective of an \"absence of flexibility\" (Granovetter, 1983, p. 205). By this he means that once the core knowledge of the more immediate group has been accessed and applied to the research problem, new information is harder to come by and less likely to be actively sought after and incorporated. As a result, innovation has the potential to become stagnated."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.1. Social Network Theory and the Strength of Weak Ties Hypothesis", "text": "The strength of weak-ties hypothesis would also suggest that U.S.-based scholars with looser ties to scholars outside their immediate network of colleagues would be better leveraged to access new information and innovation that exists beyond their close circle of colleagues (Burt, 1992;Eddy, 2010;Granovetter, 1973;Granovetter, 1983;Portes, 1998). As Eddy (2010) writes, \"For networking, faculty members can act as the node to connect disparate networks. As Granovetter (1983) noted, it is often these types of weak ties that help create the types of networks required to make partnerships succeed, as they bring together individuals outside the limited range of a tight network\" (p. 64). The connections of the primary researcher to colleagues on an inter-institutional level or an international level may be fairly tenuous. In Granovetter's words, each of us has a collection of close connections or a \"densely knit clump of social structure\" (1983, p. 202), but each of those colleagues has their own dense social structure within which they operate that is distinct from that of the primary researcher's. Colleagues, therefore, serve as links between densely knit social structures. The primary researcher may have to rely upon such a colleague to gain access to knowledge networks beyond his or her local context in the pursuit of needed knowledge, expertise, and/or resources. That mediated connection (shown in Figure 2.1 by the dotted lines) between the primary researcher and the inter-institutional or international research group is what defines weak ties, and it is the resultant knowledge sharing between distinct and separate knowledge centers that Granovetter refers to when using the term \"strength.\" In Granovetter's words, \"The weak tie between Ego (the primary researcher in this case) and his acquaintance, therefore, becomes not merely a trivial acquaintance tie but rather a crucial bridge between the two densely knit clumps of close friends\u2026It follows, then, that individuals with few weak ties will be deprived of information from distant parts of the social system and will be confined to the provincial news and views of their close friends\" (Granovetter, 1983, p. 202). Foreign-born faculty based in the U.S., by nature of their own mobility, are believed to be more likely to have weak ties with scholars in other countries than their U.S. counterparts who have earned their degrees in the U.S., possibly pursued postdoctoral research opportunities in the U.S. and continue to work in the U.S. as faculty members. Indeed, research on the brain circulation phenomenon, in which highly skilled expatriates continue to contribute their human capital to their countries of origin, has shown that international scholars working in their adopted countries can and do maintain personal connections with their source countries, suggesting an accumulation of lasting ties through mobility (Cheng & Yang, 1998;Kahn & MacGarvie, 2008;Saxenian, 2002;Szel\u00e9nyi, 2003). In a related fashion, Granovetter (1983) found a strong link between mobility in employment and the number of weak ties that an individual possesses. Weak ties, in fact, were found to be more influential in job mobility than the number of strong ties that an individual possessed. The implications of this finding for the current study are obvious. International mobility to pursue a doctoral degree, postdoctoral research experience, and a faculty career in the United States may be related to the number of weak ties that an individual has to their dense social networks in their home country as well as those in the United States. These ties can be used, after all, to find doctoral programs, identify postdoctoral positions, and to secure a faculty position. It stands to reason, therefore, that these same weak international ties could be subsequently used to connect the scholars to other scholars outside the United States. In other words, it is predicted that foreign-born faculty members working in the United States will have more weak ties with colleagues abroad than their domestic colleagues and will make use of these weak ties in their research production. There is some reason to question the assumption that faculty members with international status are likely to be more collaborative internationally, however. In his book on the American research university, for example, Cole (2009) makes the point that what makes the American research university unique is its distinct tradition of collaborative work in the lab where faculty members and students work together in a team. Cole contrasts this with the more hierarchical German tradition in which the \"Geheimrat,\" or \"great scientific leader\" serves as the person in charge of a group of subordinates (2009, p. 27). Depending upon the cultural and research traditions that international faculty members come from and identify with, it is conceivable that they may be less inclined to collaborate with others, especially in their early careers when their sense of subordinate status may be more exacerbated. The degree to which an international faculty member identifies with the American collaborative research tradition or another more hierarchical research tradition may also relate to when the person came to the United States for study. These are issues explored in this study. The next chapter explains the overall methodological approach of this dissertation, as well as the specific quantitative and qualitative methodologies that were employed."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH METHODS", "text": "As explained in the pages that follow, a sequential transformative strategy (Creswell, 2003) has been used to guide this mixed methods study. In describing the sequential transformative approach, Creswell (2003) asserts that priority can be given to either the quantitative or qualitative stage, but that it is theory that guides the study, rather than the choice of a particular method of inquiry. Creswell (2003) explains: The purpose of a sequential transformative strategy is to employ the methods that will best serve the theoretical perspective of the researcher. By using two phases (a quantitative stage and a qualitative stage), a sequential transformative researcher may be able to give voice to diverse perspectives, to better advocate for participants, or to better understand a phenomenon or process that is changing as a result of being studied (p. 216). Due to the socially constructed nature of knowledge (Marginson, 2009;Merriam, 1998) and the highly personal nature of how, when, why, and to what effect an individual conducts collaborative research, the qualitative stage of this study has been given primacy. However, the quantitative stage of this research was critically important in establishing the parameters for the semi-structured interviews that follow and in determining the direction of the questioning."}, {"section_title": "Strategy of Inquiry", "text": "Couched within the context of social network theory, the quantitative component of this study uses a national data set to identify the forms of collaboration that U.S.-based faculty members are engaged in and to identify the factors that best account for observed variability in faculty members' collaboration patterns. The qualitative component of the study makes use of interviews to explore how individuals' collaborative experiences and practices relate to the quantitative findings of the study. The interviews are also used to move beyond inferences derived from national data so as to examine participants' motivation for engaging in collaborative activity; how they work to develop, enhance, and maintain that activity; and how they see themselves engaging with a network of other researchers. Furthermore, the interviews examine the degree to which participants attribute their development as collaborative researchers to their doctoral student and postdoctoral training experiences, to their countries of origin, to their fields of research, and/or to the demands placed on them as tenured/tenure-track faculty members pursuing independent research careers. Finally, the qualitative portion of this study enables an exploration of how U.S. citizen and non-U.S. citizen faculty members differ or do not differ in their perception of the constraints on or parameters of their collaborative activity. Specific attention will be paid to the perceived role of faculty members' immigration status as it relates to the development of the four types of collaborative activity defined on the 2006 SDR (team-centered, intra-institution, inter-institution, and international). This is described in more detail in the pages that follow. Merriam (1998) notes that all qualitative research is grounded in the idea that reality is socially constructed by individuals. Reality, therefore, inherently stems from and is informed by people's experiences (Merriam, 1998). This gets at the heart of the reason for using a sequential transformative strategy (Creswell, 2003) to develop a better understanding of SEH researchers' motivations and mechanisms for their collaborative mode of inquiry; the acquisition of those skills; as well as the use, maintenance, and understanding of that collaborative activity. As the process of conducting qualitative research and analyzing data is necessarily interpretive, the end goal of this study is not to deductively develop a set of conclusions or test a set of objective and quantifiable hypotheses developed from a theory, but to inductively develop an understanding of the meaning researchers ascribe to their own collaborative behavior while using social network theory and national data to define the scope of the inquiry and to frame the context for a set of subjective conclusions (Creswell, 2003). In distinguishing qualitative inquiry from entirely deductive processes Merriam writes: Qualitative research primarily employs an inductive research strategy. That is, this type of research builds abstractions, concepts, hypotheses, or theories rather than tests existing theory. Often qualitative studies are undertaken because there is a lack of theory, or existing theory fails to adequately explain a phenomenon. There are thus no hypotheses to be deduced from theory to guide the investigation. Qualitative researchers build toward theory from observations and intuitive understandings gained in the field. In contrast to deductive researchers who \"hope to find data to match a theory, inductive researchers hope to find a theory that explains their data\" (Goetz & LeCompte, 1984, p. 4)  Using an inductive process, the sequential transformative strategy (Creswell, 2003) enables the researcher to move from data (2006 SDR data) and general observations to targeted lines of inquiry (interviews), the development of grounded themes and categories (analysis), and the elaboration of theory (social network theory).   Sampling weights are used by NSF to correct for potential bias due to unequal selection. According to NSF, this is done in three stages: 1) a base weight is calculated for every case in the sample to account for its selection probability under the sample design, 2) an adjustment for unknown eligibility is made to the base weight by distributing the weight of the unknown eligibility cases to the known eligibility cases proportionately to the observed eligibility rate within each adjustment, and 3) an adjustment for nonresponse is made to the adjusted base weight to account for the eligible sample cases for which no response was obtained. The weighted response rate for the survey in 2006 was 78% and item nonresponse rates ranged from 0.0% to 3.6%. for personal demographic data such as marital status, citizenship, and race."}, {"section_title": "Sample Population of the Study", "text": "Within the SDR, respondents meeting the study's selection criteria were filtered out for analysis. As this study focuses on collaboration among newer faculty members, the sample includes those who received their doctorates up to ten years prior to completing the 2006 SDR. This ten-year timeframe was also used by Nerad and Cerny (1999) in their national study (supported by the National Science Foundation and Mellon Foundation) of doctoral recipients' career patterns. As the SDR is administered every two years, this allows for the inclusion of up to five doctoral program completion cohorts. This also allows for the inclusion of a majority of those faculty members who have had a postdoctoral training experience between their doctoral programs and the start of their independent faculty careers (Nerad & Cerny, 1999). Ninety-six percent of 2006 SDR respondents who completed a postdoctoral training experience held only one or two postdoctoral appointments, and the average total length of time in postdoctoral status has consistently been shown to range from 2.4 to 5 years (Brainard, 2005;GESO, 2001;Nerad & Cerny, 2002), depending upon the field of study. Within the population selected for inclusion in the study, respondents included those who were employed by a four-year college or university, medical school, or university-affiliated research institute who also held the faculty rank of Assistant Professor or Associate Professor at the time the 2006 SDR was completed. An additional selection criterion included tenured or tenure-track status. By defining the study population this way, it was possible to examine the early career collaboration patterns of new faculty members at a time when they are experiencing the pressures of developing a strong research portfolio toward tenure and/or promotion (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). By including SDR respondents ten years out from their doctoral programs who are pursuing highly competitive independent faculty careers, it is also possible to examine how researchers' field of study, institutional type, gender, choice of whether or not to pursue a postdoctoral research appointment, and immigration status relate to collaboration habits. After weighting the cases using the NSF-provides weighting variable (WTSURVY), the 2006 SDR has 47,849 respondents who meet these criteria."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "As mentioned in Chapter 1, for the purposes of this study collaboration has been defined broadly as working with other scholars in the performance of research. This definition is inclusive of all types of professional collaboration, both near and far, and comports well with the survey instrument used by NSF in 2006. As the purpose of this study is to examine individuals' patterns of collaboration, as well as the perceptions of the role, development, and application of collaboration skills, rather than on the outcomes of those collaborative efforts, outcome variables "}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "The primary independent variables included respondents' international or domestic citizenship status as faculty members, their decision to pursue or not pursue a postdoctoral training position prior to pursuing faculty careers, and field of study. Respondents' immigration status was determined by whether they indicated \"U.S. citizen\" or \"Non-U.S. citizen\" on the SDR (CTZUSIN). The rationale for using citizenship as the categorical variable, rather than respondents' immigration status is the fact that the non-citizen status includes researchers who are in either non-immigrant status (e.g. H-1B, F-1, J-1, TN, O-1) or immigrant status (permanent residents). Pooling non-immigrants and immigrants together bolstered the sample size and differentiated this group of early-career faculty members from those researchers who had either been born in the United States, or were naturalized earlier on eligibility grounds unrelated to degree-specific employment in a highly skilled area. Employment-based naturalization (through competitive selection for a permanent job) and family-based naturalization (through marriage to a U.S. citizen) to U.S. citizenship status are both lengthy processes that require the obtainment of permanent residency first (a one-to five-year process, depending on country of origin and type of employment-based immigrant petition), and a five-year period of time in permanent resident status prior to obtaining eligibility to apply for naturalization to U.S. citizenship status. International students who graduate from U.S. doctoral programs are unlikely to obtain U.S. citizenship status within ten years of program completion as students on student visas and postdoctoral researchers are both ineligible for permanent resident status on the basis of their primary activity. Of the 2,428 respondents studied, 1,957 (81%) were U.S. citizens and 471 (19%) were Non-U.S. citizens. The second primary independent variable included in the study relates to the decision to pursue or not pursue postdoctoral training. Postdoctoral training is fast-becoming ubiquitous in the physical and life sciences and is growing exponentially in the engineering disciplines, although the overall levels in engineering are still relatively low (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008;Regets, 1998;Regets 2002). While it is true that as the burden of knowledge increases so too do the length of doctoral programs, the degree of specialization within disciplines, and the necessity of a postdoctoral training period (Jones, 2009; Jones 2010 a ), it cannot be taken for granted that a postdoctoral training period enhances a researcher's ability to conduct and benefit from collaborative research. It is quite possible that faculty members without postdoctoral research experience collaborate equally well, in the same fashion, and to the same effect as their counterparts who have pursued postdoctoral research appointments. The value-added impact of the postdoctoral period on scholarly engagement and productivity is an important consideration for funding agencies like NSF and NIH, which contribute millions of U.S. dollars to support the hiring and development of postdoctoral researchers. To determine if respondents had a postdoctoral research position prior to beginning their faculty careers, a new variable, POSTDOC, was constructed as a dichotomous variable from the SDR data. The original survey variable, PDIXS, indicated the number of postdoctoral research appointments held by each survey respondent. Those without postdoctoral histories who had indicated \"zero\" on the survey became \"no\" responses for the newly constructed POSTDOC variable. All responses on the PDIXS variable that were greater than \"zero\" became \"yes\" responses for POSTDOC. The last primary independent variable included in the study was field of doctoral study (NSDRMED). Field was broken down into four general categories: physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. This enabled an exploration of collaborative activity for significant differences between broad disciplinary groups since the sample sizes for many individual fields are too small to be included on their own. Field is an important variable to consider when looking at collaboration for a number of reasons. First of all, the rate of increase in collaborative work leading to scholarly publications and patents has been shown to differ substantially by broad fields (Jones, 2010 a ;Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007). While 170 of 171 science and engineering subfields and 54 of 54 social science subfields reflected a 15-20% increase in team size per decade on publications and patents, the percentage of team publications (and therefore the base from which that growth occurs) differs by broad discipline (Jones, 2010 a ;Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007). Illustrative of this point, while 80% of science and engineering publications had multiple authors or inventors, only 50% of social sciences publications had multiple authors by 2005 (Jones, 2010 a ). Furthermore, recent data show that the share of international collaborations, the publication output emerging from those collaborations, and the impact factors of those publications differ significantly by both field of specialization and the countries involved in the collaborations (Adams, Gurney, and Marshall, 2007;Adams, King, & Ma, 2009;Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;Jump, 2010). In addition to the three primary independent variables, other independent variables such as age (AGE), gender (GENDER), and Carnegie Classification (CARNEG) were examined to assist with the identification of characteristics for prospective participants in the qualitative stage of the study. Gender has been shown to be a significant factor in studies examining research productivity (Davis, 2005); career path, such as whether or not to pursue a postdoctoral research appointment (Lee, 2001;Nerad & Cerny, 1999); and how an individual copes with the challenges and pressures of an academic career (Lee, 2001). Age, on the other hand, has been shown to be a significant factor in academic production. The age of productivity in the sciences has been steadily increasing over the past century, just as training time and the burden of knowledge have been shown to increase (Jones, 2009; Jones, 2010 a ). Indeed, data from NIH indicate that the average age of first-time NIH grant recipients has increased from 37 in 1980 to 42 in 2008 (Kaiser, 2008). The later onset of innovative accomplishment among researchers has resulted in a 30% drop in lifetime productivity since the beginning of the 20 th Century (Jones, 2010 b ). This drop comes in spite of evidence that suggests innovative activity is greater at a younger age, forming a curvilinear production curve over a typical researcher's career (Jones, 2010 b ;Simonton, 1988;Stephan & Levin, 1993;Weinberg & Galenson, 2005). It should also be noted that age distribution differs significantly by field (Stephan & Levin, 1993;Weinberg & Galenson, 2005), perhaps creating a significant interaction effect between field of study and age related to collaboration. Respondents' institutional Carnegie classification (CARNEG) was also included as an independent variable to determine the extent to which the types of collaborative activities are predicted by the type of institution an individual is employed by (e.g. Research 1, Doctorate "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods", "text": "As mentioned, a series of four dichotomous collaboration variables from the 2006 SDR were selected as dependent variables for analysis (WKTEAM, WKSORG, WKUSORG, ICOLLAB). After the respondent selection criteria were applied and the appropriate subpopulation was filtered out in SPSS, frequency analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence with which early-career faculty members engage in each of the collaborative activities highlighted on the SDR. After examining the patterns of collaborative behavior among the different study subpopulations, a regression model was constructed. For the SDR, the dependent variables are dichotomous and the independent variables are a combination of continuous and categorical. Therefore, binomial logistic regression was used for the analysis. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of a positive occurrence in the dependent variables relative to the likelihood of a non-occurrence in the dependent variables based on responses to each of the independent variables included in the study (Pampel, 2000). The basic logistic regression formula that guided these analyses was: For these analyses, the 4 separate dichotomous dependent variables were used in 4 different logistic regression analyses. The same independent variables were used in each of these analyses."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative Methodology", "text": "The overarching goal of the qualitative component of the study is to understand how individual faculty members in the SEH disciplines view their experiences and development as collaborative researchers, why they feel that such collaborative engagement is important to their work, and when they choose to be collaborative in their scholarship. Social network theory and the strength of weak-ties hypothesis form the theoretical lens used to guide this study's sequential transformative strategy (Creswell, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Categories", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, four broad organizational categories or topics guided the participant interviews. These categories facilitated the process of developing and organizing themes from the interviews and situating these themes within a set of theoretically-and substantively-grounded categories as informed conclusions were developed (Maxwell, 2005 strong ties and loose ties. This enables the study to move beyond a spatially defined sense of strong and weak ties, which, it can be argued, is increasingly irrelevant to those with means in a globally connected knowledge economy, and toward a user-defined sense of the relative strength of their ties that is driven by the frequency and redundancy of knowledge exchanged, rather than on where the information is coming from. This line of inquiry adds to our understanding of how social network theory in general and its strength of weak ties hypothesis in particular can explain collaboration within an increasingly heterogeneous population of researchers. For details on the specific questions that were asked under each of the four organizational categories, the full interview protocol can be found in Appendix 2."}, {"section_title": "Site and Sample", "text": "The research site for the qualitative interviews was a North Central Association of The university enrolls nearly 28,000 students on its main campuses and employs just over 2,400 faculty members. Of these faculty members, 77.5% are full-time and 22.5% are part-time, 58.7% are male and 41.3% are female, and 44.9% are tenured and 14.4% are tenure-track. There are 707 assistant professors employed by the university and 570 associate professors. Citizenship data are not publically available for faculty members at the institution. Of the nearly 28,000 students, just over 21,800 are undergraduate students and just under 6,200 are graduate students. The gender breakdown of the student population is approximately 49% male and 51% female. The majority of students (82.1%) are full-time, and just over 69% of the students hail from the state the institution is located in. Just over 1,900 international students are enrolled. Mimicking the population studied using 2006 SDR data, the university participants in the qualitative portion of this study worked as full-time, tenure-track or tenured professors at the assistant or associate rank. All participants held positions within the SEH disciplines and all were within the first ten years of employment at the university. Participants were purposefully selected (Creswell, 2003;Maxwell, 2005;Merriam, 1998;Silverman, 2001) for inclusion in the study based on the criteria just articulated. Faculty profiles on departmental web sites were evaluated for suitability. Faculty members meeting the selection criteria were then contacted by email to see if they would be willing to participate in the study. The same email text was used to contact all participants and a description of the study was included in the body of the email. Inperson interview appointments were arranged with interested participants. Interviews were conducted at a convenient time for the faculty members and, with the exception of two, were held in the participant's own office to maximize the convenience and facilitate their comfort and familiarity with the surroundings. One interview was held in the researcher's own office, and the other was held in a quiet corner of a coffee shop. Upon in-person confirmation of participants' background and eligibility for study participation, a written informed consent form was carefully reviewed with each interviewee and signed prior to the start of the interview. A copy of the informed consent form was given to participants at that time (See Appendix 1). In all, 20 university faculty members were purposefully selected for participation. This group comprised 10 male faculty members and 10 female faculty members. Within each gender group half of the respondents (5 in each gender group) met the study's definition of international faculty members and half met the study's definition of U.S. citizen faculty members. All non-U.S. citizens at the time of the study either held a U.S. permanent resident visa (Green Card) or a temporary U.S. resident visa (such as H-1B, F-1, J-1, TN, or O-1) status. To further protect the anonymity of the participants and ensure a safe environment for conversing, the same group of four broad disciplinary categories was used for identification purposes as for the SDR data. Five faculty members were from the social sciences, 5 were from the life sciences, 5 were from the physical sciences, and five were from the engineering fields. As this study focuses on early-career faculty members, half of the participants were at the assistant professor rank at the time of the interviews and half were at the associate professor rank. Years on the job within each faculty rank varied so as to explore how career transition may or may not impact collaborative research behavior. The only characteristic not purposefully selected for this group was postdoctoral research history. Due to the exclusion of faculty members from the humanities in order to be in closer alignment with the SDR dataset, the prevalence of postdoctoral research experience was high, with three quarters of the group 15having held a postdoctoral position between completion of their doctorates in the United States and the start of their faculty careers. All interviewees completed their Ph.D. within the United States, and those who completed a postdoctoral appointment also did this work in the United States. Prior to beginning the core interviews, two pilot interviews were conducted (one with a domestic faculty member and one with an international faculty member) to test the interview protocol and allow for minor modifications prior to the commencement of the formal study. For the pilot interviews, the procedures and informed consent process were identical."}, {"section_title": "Method of Inquiry", "text": "Each interview session began with five to ten minutes of casual un-recorded conversation to relax the interviewee and to establish a friendly rapport. The formal part of each session began with a test of the recording equipment. Interviews were digitally recorded onto a laptop computer using an unobtrusive high-definition USB microphone. WAV files were generated and transferred to a password-protected external hard drive. Each interview file was labeled with a participant number in sequential order. Names of participants were not stored with the data nor used in subsequent transcriptions or written documents. In cases where a name was used, an alias was assigned. A separate paper document listing participant numbers and names has been kept in a locked file cabinet and stored separately from the interview data. No data or participant names were stored on the laptop computer. The interviews lasted from 45 to 70 minutes each and focused on the four organizational topics articulated above. A semi-structured format was used to guide the interviews and ensure consistent coverage across participants. The interview protocol was divided according to the four organizational categories that have been articulated (see Appendix 2). The first question was designed to engage the respondent in a discussion regarding the types of collaboration he or she engages in when conducting research. The second set of questions was designed to explore the operational aspects of collaboration. Key questions focused on what respondents felt they gain from their collaborative work; how those gains vary by type of collaboration; the professionally-and/or personally-driven nature of their collaborative activities; how the decision on when and who to collaborate with is made; how collaboration choices differ based on the desired project outcomes; how access to collaborators is gained; the process of establishing reciprocity; and the bidirectional or lack of bidirectional nature of collaborative activity. A complete interview protocol can be found in Appendix 2. The next set of questions on the interview protocol delved into participants' perceptions of the relative and collective of impact of the training experiences faculty members had. In particular, participants were asked to describe how each of their experiences impacted their development as collaborative researchers. Participants were also asked about other experiences that contributed to their development as collaborative researchers, and about the nature of their first collaborative research project in order to gain an understanding of when research collaboration typically begins and how formative those experiences are. The final set of questions on the interview protocol addressed participants' perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages that they experienced by nature of their citizenship status with respect to the four types of collaborative activity being explored. Non-U.S. citizen faculty members were asked if they feel that their status facilitates or hinders their collaboration at the departmental, intrainstitutional, inter-institutional, and/or international levels. Their reasons for feeling this way were also explored, as well as how their status affects their choice of the type of collaborative activity to engage in. Citizen participants were asked the same set of questions, but from their perspective as U.S. citizens. The final question on the interview protocol directed the participants to place themselves in the shoes of their counterparts with a different citizenship status and to elaborate on how they would imagine their collaborative work would be facilitated or constrained. Upon the conclusion of each interview the WAV file was transferred to an external hard drive from the computer and password protected before the process of transcription began. For transcription purposes, the WAV files were played back using iTunes. This enabled immediate and seamless pausing and restarting, as well as time coding to enable me to quickly re-locate and listen to sections of interest within the interviews upon completion of the transcriptions. Full transcriptions were written in Microsoft Word for all 20 interviews and in addition to time coding each section of the interviews, each line was numbered to facilitate the process of data analysis. Interviews were conducted in blocks of 4 participants (two U.S. citizens and two non-U.S. citizens in each block). Each block was fully transcribed and evaluated for emergent themes before the next block of participant interviews began. This iterative process enabled me to adapt the main questions and prodding questions for precision and clarity, and enabled me to pursue emerging themes and differences in greater depth in future interviews. This process also provided me with an opportunity to follow up with interviewees to clarify their statements and ensure that I had captured their meaning prior to going too far ahead with the study. Several steps were taken in the analysis of the transcription data. First of all, a constant comparative approach was applied both within a particular transcription and between transcriptions (Merriam, 1998, p. 159). This approach enabled me to flesh out rough categories for the data to guide my efforts over the course of future interviews, draw preliminary conclusions in terms of data trends and themes, and to evaluate the level of internal reliability of what the study participants were saying to enable me to follow up with data inconsistencies or areas that were unclear. In order to apply the constant comparative method, I began coding my data into tentative categories. I did this at the end of each group of four interviews after the transcriptions were complete. This involved reading each transcription several times, while coding and re-coding emergent categories. Changes had to be made frequently in the category labels as my understanding of the categories shifted and became more complete. For each interview, a bulleted summary of emergent or tentative categories was developed. This enabled me to efficiently identify broader themes within a particular respondent's data and, over the course of acquiring additional data from subsequent interviews, identify emergent themes and unique features that spanned across informants. By number-coding each participant's set of categories (a different number for each participant, rather than for each category), I was able to reorganize the data across subjects to more fully describe the categories themselves, and subsequently the themes that these categories fell into. The number coding also enabled me to obtain an understanding of how individual differences are reflected in each of the categories, develop a more complete conception of each category by exploring the different facets that each of my study participants brought to the table, and, as the themes began to emerge, enabled me to explore how each participant might relate to a particular theme. In other words, I was able to examine whether a participant might see a theme as more tangentially or directly related to their own experiences. It should be noted that my language related to category building differs somewhat from that of Merriam (1998). While Merriam refers to the creation of categories and subcategories (or properties) (Merriam, 1998, pp. 179-180), I have been describing the process of identifying categories and articulating their multiple facets. I believe, however, that Merriam and I are referring to the same process."}, {"section_title": "Verification and Trustworthiness", "text": "Two methods were used to verify and ensure the trustworthiness of the data. While David Silverman (2001, p. 236)  has been recorded to date, and more an additional set of data to guide the interpretation of results. That additional data does seem to be important for this study. Given the generosity with which respondents had already given their time to participate in the interviews, I did not want to burden them with full transcriptions of the interviews. Instead, the full write-up of the interview results, quotes, and analysis were shared will all study participants. While I was unable to verify that each participant reviewed these materials, nearly half (8) confirmed that the write-up accurately reflected what they had told me during the interviews. This was also an important step in ensuring that each participant's anonymity had been maintained. The other method that I used to arrive at some sense of the data's trustworthiness was the constant comparative method. After the initial interviews and their transcriptions, I was able to generate a set of categories and tentative themes for those categories based on the first four participants' responses to my interview questions. These categories and themes were evaluated to look for internal inconsistencies and conflicts. As additional respondents were interviewed and their responses coded and analyzed, the categories and themes were continually revised and refined to ensure that they accurately encapsulated the perspectives of the participants."}, {"section_title": "Ethical Considerations", "text": "Prior to beginning interviews, the interview protocol and detailed description of the study were submitted to the university's Internal Review Board (IRB or Human Subjects Committee) for review and approval.

Upon approval from the IRB, participants were asked to read and sign an informed consent form prior to participating in the study. At the time of signing the consent form it was emphasized that all information would be kept confidential and secure, and that the respondent could stop the interview at any time. To protect participants, all names in this study have changed. Furthermore, all recordings, transcriptions, and notes were placed on a password-protected external hard drive to ensure their security. Backup files were also password-protected."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "Naturally there are several limitations with this study. First of all, this portion of the study has limited generalizability due to the fact that only 20 participants were interviewed (Creswell, 2003). Participant numbers were insufficient to make any broader conclusions on collaborative activity by gender, field of study, or immigration status. The prevalence of the postdoctoral research position among those interviewed also meant that those without such experience (5 respondents) were not as well represented within the sample population. An additional set of limitations relates to the scope and timeframe of the study. While member checks and constant comparative methods were employed, observation of the participants in a collaborative research setting was not feasible. Furthermore, multiple interviews were not done with individuals, peer examination of my findings was not be sought, and my results were not be triangulated by other investigators and/or multiple data sources such as document analysis or observation notes. A final limitation of my study relates to the transcriptions themselves. Since I was unable to have someone independently verify the accuracy of my full transcriptions, I was not able to assert with absolute confidence that every line of every transcription was perfectly accurate, especially given that nearly half of the respondents were non-native speakers of English and had varying levels of accent to their English. It was hoped, however, that by providing each respondent with a summary of their comments, the key features and themes of their remarks remained intact."}, {"section_title": "Researcher Positionality", "text": "Just as the subject of inquiry itself, qualitative research reflects a collaborative process in which the interview participants and interviewer negotiate meaning (Merriam, 1998, p. 6). Therefore an understanding of the researcher's positionality is important to the interpretation and understanding of the study's results and the conclusions that are drawn from those results. As a doctoral student and practicing professional in higher education, I bring a motivation and commitment to my research that is fueled by my conviction that such research is critical to developing informed policy, appropriately allocating scarce resources, and creating new programs and services within the context of higher education. I am also convinced that higher education can always be enhanced and that programs should be developed, maintained, adapted, and improved in a deliberate fashion. am hugely reliant upon the affiliations that my university has with institutions abroad. These linkages enable me to bring international faculty, administrators, and students to campus, and provide me with a link for sending our own faculty, students, and administrators abroad. Anecdotally, I have also seen more involvement in the university's international activities and collaborations among international faculty and domestic faculty who have spent substantial time living, studying, and working abroad. Due to these experiences and observations, I am aware of several assumptions that I bring to this study. These include a belief that all universities are collaborative at the local, regional, Several secondary goals, which supplement the primary goals that I have already articulated, have emerged on account of my personal and professional experiences and the assumptions that I have just articulated. While these goals will not all be achieved with this project, it is hoped that this study will enable me to move closer to their fulfillment. These secondary goals include: to hear first-hand from faculty members about why they collaborate and how the different people they collaborate with help them to achieve their research objectives; to develop institutional approaches that can enhance our ability to train tomorrow's researchers to be effective collaborators; to establish mechanisms to encourage and support faculty collaboration at the institutional, national, and international levels; and to collect a strong set of faculty-contributed and experientially-based reasons for collaboration beyond the immediate laboratory environment that can be used to raise awareness and generate momentum for collaborative initiatives. I approach this study with several advantages due to my personal and professional experience. These include: the personal empathy (that comes from substantial administrative experience within the university context and with international collaborations) to hear stories, understand their meaning, and draw these stories out more completely with appropriate and informed follow-up questions; my work in an office that plays a public and largely positive role on campus for its internationalization initiatives and faculty support programs; and a deep understanding of and personal experience with the federal grant environment in which the faculty members live and rely upon to support their research. I also come to this study facing several disadvantages as an investigator. This includes a clear predisposition to focus on the problems and institutional shortcomings related to collaboration. Furthermore, my own experiences and assumptions may have consciously or unconsciously biased my questions, especially in the context of more unstructured interviews where the questions evolve and emerge as the conversations continue. In addition, faculty members may not have been entirely candid with me, knowing that I work for an institution of higher education, have a professional and scholarly stake in higher education, and may know some of their colleagues. Finally, with an overarching goal to enhance collaboration and develop programs and policies that support this activity, I may be reluctant to accept that additional collaboration is not needed, not warranted, or not wanted. As I proceeded with this research I made every effort to account for my experience, connection to the population that I was researching, and the unique set of parameters that I necessarily bring to my work."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4: RESULTS OF THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES", "text": "Chapter 4 describes the results of the quantitative stage of the study.

The gender distribution for the entire population (60% men to 40% women) was similar to that of the U.S. citizen population (58% to 42%), while the international population had a higher percentage of men represented (69%) as compared to women (31%). The gender distribution within the two main study populations is reported in Table 4.2. Tenure status was another descriptive variable that was examined for the study. Just under 76% of the study-eligible respondents were in tenure-track positions but untenured at the time of completing the 2006 SDR (See Table 4.1). With regard to the prevalence of the postdoctoral research position in respondents' employment history, the majority of faculty respondents (63%) had not held a postdoctoral research position prior to beginning their faculty careers (Table 4.1). Over 80% of survey respondents had held only 1 postdoctoral appointment. For those respondents who completed a postdoctoral research assignment prior to commencing their faculty careers, the overwhelming majority (85%) had completed postdoctoral work within the higher education sector. Government postdocs were the second highest sector of employment for this group at 8%, followed closely by postdocs in the private sector (6). Table  4.3 shows this sector distribution, as well as the relative percentages within each sector held across both citizenship types and genders. Academic field was also examined for the SDR population under study. Those working in the social sciences represented the largest field subpopulation, with 36% of respondents fitting into this category. Overall, more women were in the social sciences field (8,711), than any other field category. Among those in the social sciences, 49% of the population consisted of men. Table 4.4 shows the gender and citizenship distribution for each field of study under analysis, as well as the relative overall percentages of respondents in each broad disciplinary category. After social sciences, the next most frequent field among all respondents was the life sciences (28%), followed by physical sciences (20%), and engineering (17%). As reflected in the frequency data reported in Table 4.4, this disciplinary ordering was maintained for both men and women, as well as for U.S. citizens. International faculty were the sole exception to this ordering with the largest group indicating engineering as their field (3,090), followed by social sciences (2,489), physical sciences (2,409), and then life sciences (1,708). These data comport well with the findings of the National Science Board, which indicate a disproportionate and rapidly growing number of graduates with doctorates in engineering are temporary U.S. residents (Lee, 2001;NSB, 2008). The prevalence of the social sciences may be one reason that the overall postdoctoral numbers for the selected respondents from the dataset were relatively low at 37%. Postdoctoral research opportunities are known to be less common in the social sciences (Davis, 2005;Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008;National Postdoctoral Association, 2009). Table 4.5 shows the prevalence of the postdoctoral research experience across the study population by field of study. Across both citizenship statuses and genders, the social sciences had the lowest prevalence of postdocs. Table 4.5 also indicates a high level of within-field consistency across gender and citizenship with respect to the prevalence of the postdoctoral research experience. On average, 1out of every 2 respondents in the physical and life sciences had held a postdoctoral appointment prior to beginning their faculty careers. Comparatively, just around a quarter of respondents in the social sciences reported a postdoctoral research history, while those in engineering averaged around 30%. This is consistent with national data (Hoffer, Grigorian, & Hedberg, 2008). Finally, weighted respondent data was examined to determine the distribution of respondents by Carnegie classification.  "}, {"section_title": "Forms of Research Collaboration", "text": "The first research question addressed in the quantitative stage of this study was, \"What forms of collaborative research activity are more representative of early-career faculty researchers working in the U.S.?\" As shown in Table 4.7, the most common type of collaboration that faculty member respondents reported engaging in on the 2006 SDR was intrainstitutional collaboration beyond the team level. Of the 47,849 weighted respondents, 35,452 (74%) reported collaborating with colleagues at the same university when conducting their research. This was followed by team-level collaboration (63%), inter-institutional collaboration (60%), and international collaboration (26%). Looking across citizenship and gender groups, Table 4.8 shows that intra-institutional collaboration was the highest form of collaboration reported by all subpopulations. For men, women, and U.S. citizens, team collaboration was the second highest form of reported collaboration. The only subpopulation that proved different was the international faculty respondents, who indicated engagement in inter-institutional collaborations (66%) more frequently than team collaboration (61%). This was the opposite for all other subgroups studied.   (Table 4.10) and as Table 4.9 shows, the dependent variables' level of inter-item correlation was relatively low. Removing the dependent variables individually did not improve the reliability scores of the remaining dependent variables. This was a further indication that the dependent variables could not be effectively combined since the removal of individual dependent variables did not improve the reliability statistics for the remaining dependent variables. Table 4.10 shows the change in reliability statistics by a step-wise removal of the individual dependent variables from the equation. Four regressions were initially run to explore for possible interaction effects between respondents' postdoctoral research history and their citizenship. The rationale for examining this interaction effect stems from the frequency data reported in the previous section. The descriptive statistics indicated that the collaboration patterns differed by both postdoctoral research experience and citizenship status. The aim of running these initial regressions was to clarify if the effects of postdoctoral experiences on collaboration patterns differ by citizenship status and if the effects of citizenship on collaboration patterns differ by gender. When each of the four regressions were run with the postdoctoral research history / citizenship interaction effect included, the interaction variable did not prove significant for any of the regression models. Because the product term must be significant for the interaction effect to be interpretable (Center for Family and Demographic Research, 2010), the interaction variable was removed and the postdoctoral experience and citizenship variables were added back in as separate independent variables. The interaction effects of gender and citizenship, as well as gender and postdoctoral history were also examined without statistically significant results. The final four regressions were run without any interaction effects included given that there was no statistical evidence to support the existence of interactions between the independent variables included in the analysis. Age, time since degree, gender, tenure status, field, citizenship, postdoctoral research history, and institutional Carnegie classification were the independent variables included in the regression model.  (Peng, Lee, & Ingersoll, 2002). Hosmer and Lemeshow statistics for the team-level collaboration (Table 4.11), however, had a probability less than .05, indicating that the null hypothesis of a good model fit may not be tenable. The Likelihood Ratio Tests for each of the four regressions, however, were significant at the .001 level, so the four models with the independent variables of the study included were more effective than the null models for each form of collaboration (Peng, Lee, & Ingersoll, 2002). Table 4.11 shows the results of the logistic regression that was conducted with team-level collaboration serving as the dependent variable. As can be seen from the results reported in Table   4.11, age, years since completing the doctoral degree, field, citizenship, and institutional Carnegie classification all proved significant predictors of team-level collaboration. For ease of interpretation (Center for Family and Demographic Research, 2006), the odds ratios (Exp(B))"}, {"section_title": "Team-Level Collaboration", "text": "were converted into the percent change in the odds of the dependent variable having a value of 1 (a positive outcome for team collaboration). This was done by subtracting the odds ratio from 1 and multiplying by 100 (Center for Family and Demographic Research, 2006). The far right column in Table 4.11 shows the percent change in odds for the significant independent variables in the regression equation. As Table 4.11 shows, as age increases by one year for the respondent population the odds of collaborating at the team level increase by 1.9%. For each additional year added since completing the doctoral degree, the odds of collaborating at the team level increased by 9.3%.   "}, {"section_title": "Intra-Institutional Collaboration", "text": "The results of the logistic regression performed for intra-institutional collaboration can be found in Table 4.12. As the table shows, the predictive factors for intra-institutional collaboration were quite different from those predicting team-level collaboration. While field was still a significant factor (with the exception of physical sciences), age, years since earning the doctorate, citizenship status, and institutional type were no longer significant predictors. This may be due to the already high levels of collaboration at this level for all groups studied (74% overall). Gender and citizenship status were both close as significant predictors, but neither variable quite reached the significance threshold of .05 (.052 for gender and .062 for citizenship). The percent change in the odds ratios was also calculated for the significant factors predicting intra-institutional collaboration. These results are reported in the far right column in Table 4.12. The percent change in odds indicate that faculty members in the life sciences had a 52.4% increase in the odds of collaborating at the intra-institutional level as compared to their peers in the social sciences. Engineers had a 53.9% increase in the odds of collaborating at the intra-institutional level as compared to the social scientists surveyed."}, {"section_title": "Inter-Institutional Collaboration", "text": "The next regression model evaluated the factors that predict collaboration between institutions in the United States. These results are reported in Table 4.13. For the inter-institutional variable, only institutional type proved to be a significant predictor. Faculty members working at Research I institutions had higher odds of collaborating with colleagues at other U.S. institutions (211.3% higher) than their peers at other institutions. This was followed by those at Research II institutions (190.6%) and those at Doctorate Granting II institutions (159.5%). None of the other independent variables were significant predictors of inter-institutional collaboration. "}, {"section_title": "International Collaboration", "text": "The final regression that was conducted examined international collaboration. Table 4.14 shows these results. For the first time tenure status proved a significant factor with tenured faculty members having increased odds of collaborating internationally than their untenured colleagues by 33.6%. International faculty members also had 57.2% higher odds of collaborating at the international level than their U.S. citizen colleagues. Among the institutional classifications, faculty members from Comprehensive I institutions (57%) and faculty members from Liberal Arts II institutions (60.2%) were both less likely to collaborate at the international level as compared to their peers at other institutional types. "}, {"section_title": "Summary of Quantitative Findings", "text": "A summary of the results of the four regressions has been provided in Table 4.15. As the summary table indicates, predictors varied greatly for the different forms of collaboration. Increasing age and years since earning the doctorate were only significant predictors for faculty members on the team level of collaboration. Neither gender nor postdoctoral research history were significant predictors for any form of collaboration. International respondents to the SDR survey had lower odds of collaborating at the team level and higher odds of collaborating at the international level than their U.S. citizen peers. While field of study was a strong predictor of higher odds of collaborating at the team level for all three fields as compared to faculty members in the social sciences, only faculty members in the life sciences and engineering had higher odds of collaborating at the intrainstitutional level. Field was not significant as a predictor for inter-institutional or international forms of collaboration. Institutional type was a relatively strong predictor of collaboration at the team, interinstitutional, and international levels, but was not at all predictive for intra-institutional collaboration. This suggests that the vast majority of faculty members collaborate at the interinstitutional level, an assertion supported by the frequency data reported in Table 4.6, while institutional type has greater impact on the likelihood of collaboration on the other forms of collaborative activity. The broad variation with regard to predictors of collaboration among the four forms under study suggests that each form of collaboration has its own mechanisms and underlying motivations from the perspective of faculty members. These questions were explored in detail over the course of the individual interviews with faculty members. The results of those interviews are reported next. "}, {"section_title": "Forms of Collaboration", "text": "To answer the first question regarding forms of collaboration, an expanded conception of how faculty members define collaboration in their lives must first be established to understand the divergences between the preceding quantitative data and the data collected from in-person interviews. A discussion on how interviewees defined collaboration for themselves is followed by a discussion of the types of collaborative activity faculty members self-reported engaging in."}, {"section_title": "A Broader Definition for Collaboration", "text": "As explained in Chapters 1 and 3, collaboration was openly defined for the purposes of the interviews and explained at the outset as working with other scholars in the performance of research at the departmental, intra-institutional, inter-institutional, and international levels. Team-level collaboration as reported in quantitative phase of the study was explicitly included in the departmental label. While it was assumed that collaboration thus defined would frame a discussion on collaboration that would enable an easy comparison to the data from the 2006 SDR, interviewees saw collaboration and their engagement in its practice in a much more complex and expanded way."}, {"section_title": "Part of the response differential between the collaboration data reported on the SDR in", "text": "Chapter 4 and the results of the interviews reported here, is undoubtedly due to the opportunity to negotiate the meaning of the concept of collaborative research in the interviews. Just as Marginson (2009) notes that knowledge becomes structured and imbued with new meaning by the people it passes through, so too do the terms explored over the course of an interview. While the definition of collaboration articulated at the start of the interviews was similarly broad to the questions related to collaborative activity on the SDR, interviewees were able to engage in a dialogue about the meaning of collaboration and reaffirm with the interviewer the broad nature of how collaboration was being defined for the purpose of the study. As a result, respondents maintained broad notions of collaboration and discussed how they saw it infused in nearly all facets of their scholarly work. Over the course of the interviews the important roles that colleagues, students, and mentors have played in faculty members' lives came to life in all its richness and complexity. This finding was an important realization, and enabled this research to broaden its focus on the forms and processes of collaboration writ large, rather than narrowing the focus to forms of collaboration that can be tracked to tangible and more widely recognized and appreciated outcomes. As was emphasized at the beginning of this dissertation, the goal was to focus on the actual doing of collaborative work, not on the byproducts of collaborative processes."}, {"section_title": "Self-reported Collaborative Activity by Collaboration Type", "text": "In contrast to frequency results from the SDR data, which indicated strong variability in participation rates among the four types of collaborative activity, 19 of the 20 interviewees reported engaging in all four forms of collaborative research activity (departmental, intradepartmental, inter-institutional, and international) in the performance of their research. This was regardless of professorial rank, years on the job, gender, postdoctoral research background, field, or citizenship status. The fact that fully 95% of interview respondents reported engaging in all four types of research collaboration reinforces the notion that there were significant interpretative differences between how survey respondents answered the collaboration questions on the 2006 SDR, and how interviewees explained their collaborative research habits in semi-structured oneon-one interviews. It should be remembered that for both the survey and in the interviews, each form of collaboration was considered independently and a respondent or interviewee could differentiate between the forms of collaboration he or she had engaged in and the forms he or she had not engaged in. The overall collaboration patterns for the interviewees are reported in Table   5.1. An interview with an associate professor in the social sciences brings into focus how the four forms of collaboration fit into her own academic life. Her comments also encapsulate well the reflections of many of her colleagues at the university. At the departmental level, this professor described her collegial collaborations as highly research-related and perhaps more technical in nature. She reported going to her departmental colleagues for feedback as she developed new research questions, sought advice on research design and strategies for engaging in field work, and for insights related to field-specific theory that she was perhaps less familiar with.  For the departmental collaboration, the faculty member reported that this came about through the course of regular faculty research meetings within the department. She noted, \"We usually have meetings and there we discuss something interesting and when we see some proposal of course we gonna discuss and say maybe this is a good place to go to submit some research proposals. It usually goes like that way.\" She also stated that her partnership with the colleague in her academic department was the result of complementary overlap in their areas of research so that it made a strong NSF proposal. In delving more deeply into her inter-institutional collaboration within the U.S., this was the result of continued collaboration with her Ph.D. advisor. She reported continuing to engage in active research with him because, \"He is exactly doing the area I'm in.\" However, she did note her concern with maintaining this collaboration in the medium-to long-term and the need to establish an independent research reputation in her field. In her words, \"I think independent and beyond. The two other faculty respondents who were also in their first academic year at the university described collaborative activity that spanned the range of possibilities examined in this study. The next two major sections of this chapter explore the self-reported mechanisms faculty members use in establishing and maintaining those increasingly broad collaborative connections, as well as the motivations behind engagement with others in the performance of research."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms for Collaborative Network Development and Maintenance", "text": "In the initial stages of this research, the second research question, \"What are the   Several researchers spoke directly to the social networking opportunities afforded by conference attendance. Conferences were not only seen as a way to keep connected to old colleagues and classmates, but as an opportunity to see \"who's out there\" and \"what they are doing.\" Furthermore, conferences were seen as important to learning about new prospective students, helping students enter into the realm of academia, gaining referrals of postdoctoral researchers from colleagues, and the like. For students in particular, one faculty member described conferences as essential for students' \"socialization into the profession.\" Not all conferences were seen as alike, however, when it came to the networking opportunities they afforded participants. Conference size, for example, was seen as a major factor in how a particular conference could be used to maximum advantage by an attendee. A physical scientist explained the importance of size this way, \"There is a wide variety of conferences and they are good for different things.  These four examples of collaborative teaching and teaching leading to collaborative research and pedagogical transformation point to the strong role that students play as a conduit and catalyst for collaborative scholarly engagement among faculty members. This was a dominant theme in the interviews and students clearly serve in myriad ways to bring faculty members together as collaborators at the departmental, intra-institutional, inter-institutional, and international levels."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Student Mentoring", "text": "Several informants discussed how graduate student mentoring often leads to collaborative research and joint publications. A faculty member in the social sciences reported, \"Students -we throw to each other. I sent my student from here to work with [a professor  from the physical sciences discussed how he refers his students to other faculty members within the department and even abroad who have mentoring styles or research programs better suited to the student in question so that they get the support that they need. These students often return, however, and ask if the referring professor would consider co-supervising the student's thesis or dissertation, which brings the faculty members themselves closer together in an effort to support the student. The professor from the physical sciences explains, \"I think some collaborations are very easy. When everyone's ego is in check, everybody sort of has their eye on the prize or a particular student's thesis or uh a manuscript outcome, those ones are actually really easy. A student initiated some collaboration for me at the University of Southern Denmark with somebody who is, you know, National Academy in the U.S. and a very intimidating figure in my Just as it has been mentioned that new faculty members will often maintain research collaborations with their doctoral program advisors, especially in their early faculty careers, there was substantial evidence of highly productive collaborative research between faculty mentors and the students they were mentoring at the time of earning the degree. One faculty member in the life sciences explained, \"You know my graduate students or my technicians or undergraduate students that do research in the lab, we always try to get it to a publication.\" This same faculty member, an associate professor, also made it clear that her closest collaborator was her own Ph.D. advisor from her graduate school days. This was a pronounced theme across many of the interviews and extended to all four disciplinary categories. A social scientist at the assistant professor level discussed her recent shift in focus among her research collaborations toward her graduate students. For them, to paraphrase her remarks, collaboration with their professor is important because it is good experience and it gets their names on publications and on conference presentations. The professor was also quick to point out, as were several other interviewees, that the products of collaboration with students also look good on the faculty member's vita. This theme of active collaborations with students was expounded upon by many of the interviewees and the sheer volume and diversity of situations was quite pronounced. Some faculty members discussed how their students' dissertations were spin-offs of highly directed research related to a larger externally funded project. Others emphasized their own roles as directing the research and securing the funding, while it was the students' responsibility to do the actual laboratory bench work and the write-up of results. As one professor stated it, \"Students and postdocs, they tend to be engaged in the chemistry. The professor is the PI, the manager, so the student and postdocs do the bench work.\" Similarly, another professor explained, \"I don't actually do much of my own research. I really direct the research and so -um -the real work, and I sort of lend some ideas to it, but the real work is done by the students. And so um, say 85 or 90% of the work in my lab is done by graduate students, or the productivity comes from graduate students\u2026It's the process of making myself obsolete from their careers.\" In the physical and life sciences especially it was clear that the laboratory served as fertile ground for both expanding the training of graduate students from other departments, and for increasing the capacity of the labs of their colleagues. Demonstrating the level of lab mobility among students for training purposes, one faculty member stated that her colleague's graduate students were gaining training in her area of expertise by interning in her lab. \"I can help advise a student to do that [type of lab work] if you want somebody you know that's trained that way to participate in your grant. And that, that's where people don't think broadly enough [about the value of collaboration].\" In this example, the faculty member's point was that by opening up her lab to a student in a different program, she was both training the student and, upon the student's return to his or her own lab, enhancing the capacity of her colleague's lab by transferring the newly acquired skills. This knowledge transfer resulting from student mobility between labs was referred to by several faculty respondents. Graduate student mobility between labs was not confined to the intra-institutional context. A professor in engineering reported routinely sending her students to labs abroad for short periods of time to gain more training from her colleagues. Similarly, a faculty member from the physical sciences discussed her openness to colleagues' students from Europe as they sought to come to the U.S. for additional training. This type of student sharing activity was reported most frequently by faculty respondents at the associate professor rank, but it was not limited to faculty members of a certain discipline, gender, or citizenship status."}, {"section_title": "Motivations for and Gains from Collaborative Research", "text": "This section explores, respondents' motivations for engaging in collaborative research activity, as well as perceived gains from collaborative activity. The role of granting agencies in facilitating research collaborations will be discussed, as well as perceived changes in the nature of scientific research. Other factors affecting faculty members' motivations related to collaborative research, such as the tenure process, challenges within the academic disciplines, the pressure toward physical academic production, and the logistical and intellectual needs of researchers will also be discussed. Idea-centered and people-centered motivations for collaboration will also be explored as a dominant theme to emerge from the interviews. The final sections of this chapter will examine the more tangible and less tangible gains attributed to collaboration and the various forms of reciprocity achieved by researchers engaged in collaborative activities."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Granting Agencies", "text": "When asking interviewees about why they engage in collaborative work, several consistent themes emerged. Foremost among them was the push by granting agencies to engage in collaborative research. To put this into context, an assistant professor in the life sciences described the pressure he has experienced from NSF to engage in collaborative research, \"My NSF proposal, which was not funded, the main critiques was that okay -this person is doing in good computation -where is his collaboration on the experimental side? So I try. The other challenge faculty members frequently articulated with grant-driven collaborative research is that you can't adapt as well to new challenges or changes, whether externally imposed or internally derived. On the one hand, several respondents discussed how critical it is to be highly organized in large collaborations with roles articulated and point people established to keep the research moving forward in a productive and coordinated fashion. On the other hand, this same higher level of organization makes it difficult to remain \"nimble,\" as one associate professor in the physical sciences put it. One particular challenge articulated by a physical scientist who does collaborative research on climate change on an international level, is that funding cycles and work cycles are different depending on the country of origin for your collaborators. Most grant funding only goes to support researchers from the same country the agency is located in, so many international collaborations have multiple independent sources of funding involved. A frequently cited exception to this, are agency stipulations that require engagement with scholars from the country hosting the research or emphasize local dissemination of research findings. The challenge of having multiple sources of external funding from different countries is that it means that the members of the larger research team are expected to meet different criteria for success and have different timing and reporting expectations. This makes logistical coordination much more difficult, especially for field research conducted in highly remote locations. Several researchers also mentioned the challenges of gaining external support for innovative collaborative research due to high levels of risk aversion on the part of the funding agencies. Publically supported agencies like NSF must show their oversight committees that they are responsible stewards of public funds. If they do not, they will suffer when it comes to appropriations time. The result is, \"They won't fund something -they want stuff that is riskybut not stuff that is too risky,\" in the words of one assistant professor in the physical sciences. The challenge is to \"show that it [the research project] already works so you have to have done the experiment to get the money to do the experiment,\" she continued. This conundrum is frequently solved through collaboration in which a faculty member will partner with a colleague who has an alternate source of funding and needs some help to accomplish his or her research goals. In exchange the collaboration partner is often willing to use some of his or her research funding to help the faculty member pilot a related project in the field. Overall, most of the interviewees felt that the funding agencies played a positive role in facilitating collaborative research. The emphasis on developing external partnerships, for example, has meant that this university and other universities are providing the seed funding faculty members need to build those connections with colleagues beyond the institution. One faculty member in the life sciences mentioned how the university made it possible for her to hold an international research summit on campus to bring her collaborators together and develop new research proposals. Another faculty member in the physical sciences discussed how Brown University did something similar and paid for him to come to campus to iron out a new field research project abroad that will require external funding. Similarly, agency efforts to facilitate dialogue among researchers in the early stages of developing new research initiatives were praised by the interviewees. NSF workshops in particular were lauded as a good way to facilitate collaborative research, as well as grant recipient conferences hosted by agencies. The continuing importance of face-to-face collaboration will be discussed, later, but the role that agencies and institutions of higher education play in facilitating that interpersonal contact, either before receiving a grant, or in the administration of the grant, was highlighted by many informants as absolutely essential."}, {"section_title": "The Collaborative Nature of Scientific Research", "text": "Interdisciplinary Drivers of Collaborative Research. Another dominant theme to emerge from the interviews was an assertion that the nature of science has fundamentally changed and now requires collaboration. The character of this change was seen as multifaceted among the faculty members interviewed. Several informants, for example, spoke to the growing interdisciplinary nature of research today and the growing burden of knowledge that makes it impossible for any one researcher to have sufficient depth and breadth of knowledge to accomplish his or her research goals. In the words of one life scientist, \"We need collaboration because the nature of science -scientific research is more interdisciplinary nowadays and as you know for science people grant is our life, right?\" In describing the growing interdisciplinary nature of science today, the same faculty member discussed how newer fields like computational biophysics require broad knowledge of multiple areas such as computers, biology, physics, and chemistry. At the same time, depth in these areas is critical if innovative and groundbreaking research is to be achieved. That is where many scholars report employing collaboration in their research. In the words of a more senior life scientist, \"I don't think it can be done alone anymore. Especially given the topics. Not even the ones that we want to include in our research when we come across them in pathology or in collecting, or whatever. Or even just molecular tools versus morphology. You just can't be expert in both of it. And therefore I think collaboration is a must.\" When asked why he sought out departmental and campus collaborations, an assistant professor of engineering answered the question from the perspective of the actual research questions he seeks to answer through empirical research. \"Everybody is doing a certain type of interdisciplinary work,\" he said, \"The reason for that -in order to solve a problem there is no discipline. A problem is just a real world problem. There is no discipline. So if we break down the problem into pieces, then we start to see the disciplines there. But if we focus on the real problem, then we have to pull all these pieces together\u2026No one has experience to do everything. So, I would think everybody have some certain need to do interdisciplinary collaboration -  feasible for her to do the pieces she needs to do, and collectively we can do this thing that sounds like science fiction. And when it was scientifically reviewed they really had no criticism because even overall the thing that we are doing is amazing, you couldn't claim that any of us in particular would be unable to do the thing that we need to do to make this work\u2026The one question is whether we'll be able to put together the pieces, but that's exactly the focus of this grant."}, {"section_title": "Discipline-Centered Drivers of Collaborative Research. For the faculty members", "text": "interviewed, collaboration was often seen as a way to access and incorporate the perspectives of others from within the discipline into their research. The relationship between the perspective sought and the physical location of the collaborator, however, was quite complex and often seemed to work against conventional wisdom and the efforts of the agencies funding research. collaborating with senior colleagues within his department, these colleagues were thought to be out of his personal reach. While collaboration with more senior colleagues in the same department was clearly seen by many as essential to gaining their support in the tenure process, outside collaborations with more renowned scholars were also seen as playing a significant role in the tenure process. It should also be noted, as it was by several interviewees, that the service commitment of faculty members increases with tenure. This takes time away from teaching and research, and therefore also serves to encourage faculty members to distribute the time burden related to research through collaboration."}, {"section_title": "The Matthew Effect", "text": "In Chapter 2, Robert Merton's notion of the Matthew Effect was mentioned, which refers to the cumulative advantage scholars develop over the course of their careers. Those with established reputations are, all things being equal, able to accrue greater recognition for their work than those who contribute to the same degree but are lesser known. This translates into higher rates of publication, greater impact factors for journal articles, increased likelihood of gaining precious funding for research, and higher citation rates. Of the 20 faculty members interviewed, 9 made comments that support the notion of a Matthew Effect and made the connection between that effect and their motivations for collaborative research. For many of the faculty members interviewed, the Matthew Effect was considered a leveraging tool to be used. In the very first interview, for example, an associate professor in the social sciences described her shock as an assistant professor when she became an editor for one of her professional journals. This idea of aligning one's research with a respected name in the field also came up in a discussion with a life sciences professor going up for tenure. He explained that as a young faculty member, if the Chancellor or Provost sees that he is collaborating with a \"big guy\" in the field they are more likely to be impressed and promote him with tenure due to the affiliation, the presumption being that \"big guys\" don't affiliate themselves with substandard researchers. Interestingly, this also seemed to serve as a deterrent to collaboration. As he explained it, he would like to collaborate with younger peers, but his impression is that none of the young people want to collaborate with people who aren't \"big guys\" because it would be seen as a waste of time. The Matthew Effect was also seen in the actions of some tenured associate professors. A physical scientist, for example, explained how senior colleagues have a responsibility to actively promote the work of their junior colleagues, just as their junior colleagues have a responsibility to promote graduate students. The mechanism for this was to use the senior author's name on a publication to get it out to press, but to affiliate younger and less established colleagues' and students' names with the work to begin establishing their corpus of research and reputation in the field. An unexpected manifestation of the Matthew Effect came from a social scientist who now works with a federally-funded center on campus. She attributed her prior exclusion from a number of conference panels, collaborative paper invitations, and invitations to contribute chapters to edited volumes to not being formally affiliated with a particular center on campus. The center, in her case, was considered the academic barometer for her area of research. Since she was known to be at the university, but was not listed as an affiliated faculty member on the center's website, colleagues beyond the institution assumed she was either unengaged in her research, or simply producing work of poor quality. Lack of affiliation with a renowned center was a Scarlet Letter. This notion of the Matthew Effect being embodied by an institution was supported by another faculty member from the life sciences who said that a big benefit of joining the faculty of a renowned university is that it attracted good students to help with the research, funding to support that research, and colleagues that can help drive the research forward in innovative directions and help gain recognition for those research accomplishments. On the recipient end, one well-established associate professor in the social sciences reported that she has been contacted to collaborate on research projects because of her name and the money she could attract, rather than for her intellectual contributions to any particular project. \"They needed a big name in the area,\" she recalled, \"They were doing this research so I came in to help them design the work, but it wasn't so much an intellectual contribution to the degree that many of my others are.\" The funding-related motivations behind such collaborative activity were also made clear by a junior faculty member in the life sciences who explained, \"As a junior faculty, it gave me a lot of cach\u00e9 to say that I was collaborating with [name]. Clearly [colleague's name] lab is very well-funded, and so we wrote a proposal together that did get funded and I got much of the money from that. Um -so I work with [colleague's name].\" Affiliation with well-known people in the field was seen as an important mechanism for advancement and support in a number of other ways as well. An assistant professor asserted, \"The advantage for me is that my collaborations -so, because I came from a very well-known lab as a postdoc, I met a lot of very well-known scientists -now when I email them, they know who I am. In some sense I think ambitiously. Maybe this is ego -I think good people tend to collaborate together. We could both bring something that the other one needs. And so I've been very lucky that it has raised my profile a little bit working with very well-known people.\" Similarly, this sentiment was shared by a faculty member from the social sciences who recounted his efforts to recruit senior scholars in his field to serve as discussants for an edited volume he had been working on so that their clout and stature would lend weight to the publication at press time."}, {"section_title": "Intellectual and Logistical Incentives to Collaborate", "text": "For all 20 informants, collaboration was seen as critical to securing both logistical and intellectual support. For some faculty members these two seemed to go hand in hand and several interviewees spoke of logistical collaborations evolving into rich intellectual collaborations. For others, however, they chose some collaborative opportunities because of the logistical support they would or could provide, while other opportunities were chosen purely for the intellectual opportunities they would afford. While some collaborations were clearly seen as purely technical [logistical], in that the contributors are each contributing their own small piece to the greater project without much involvement at the development or synthesis stages, the two examples just articulated were given by the respective faculty members as evidence of logistical collaborations being combined to create something of unique intellectual merit. As one engineer put it, you can bring together people with a different take on things and their individual findings can be brought, \"all together for a bigger goal and bigger analysis [than] we had in the project proposal\u2026\" Some collaborations seemed to have been initiated out of logistical necessity, but became The last example was a recurring theme in the interviews and speaks to the value of collaboration, as well as to the drive to collaborate with colleagues in the same general field but with differing subspecialties. To illustrate this point, it is instructive to hear how an assistant professor in the life sciences describes the benefits he derives from close collegial collaboration. He stated, \"So often we'll have a very specific question that we'll want to get an answer to. It's a case where the question is something that will require some type of experiment that should be standard but is outside our expertise. And so in that sense, we are not asking someone to develop a way of measuring something that they don't know how to do. We are asking someone for something that should be pretty easy for them.\" In this example, one group has developed the question and made the predictions, while the other group receives an interesting question and applies their experimental expertise to see what the answer is. The intellectual outcomes are both the answer to the question itself, and the novel application of an experimental methodology. While many faculty members insisted that it was impossible to separate logistical collaboration from intellectual collaboration since tools, in one form or another, are always essential in completing a particular research project, there was evidence that some faculty Interestingly, it did seem that some faculty members looked to different places to find logistical and intellectual collaborators. An engineering professor asserted that if she were looking for particular skills or a certain technology she would be more likely to look for collaborators on campus because access would be easier and quicker. On the other hand, this same researcher said she looked to national and international collaborations for skills and access to unique equipment as well, but that the focus was often broader in nature and the development of the research idea and the empirical approach to examining a particular research problem was more collaborative in nature. She explained, \"I'm looking for people with other skills more on campus, whereas nationally I think I'm looking for people with collaborative interest [verbal emphasis on \"interest\"].\" This sense that intellectual collaboration was driven by shared interest between researchers was a concept articulated differently by the 20 faculty members interviewed, but one that seemed to resonate with nearly everyone. In discussing their underlying motivations for collaborative activity, to a person the interviewees expressed a strong desire to learn something new from collaborative research and a willingness to engage with others in a variety of ways to accomplish that goal."}, {"section_title": "Idea-and People-Driven Collaboration", "text": "Every respondent interviewed discussed the complicated relationship between peopledriven collaboration and idea-driven collaboration. Some saw these as separate and distinct mechanisms for bringing about collaborative research, while others saw these two approaches to collaboration as inseparably linked. The concept of idea-driven versus people-drive collaboration was brought up in the very first interview with an associate professor in the social sciences. When asked how she picks her collaborators, this faculty member said, \"I don't know if it's been deliberate. I mean, I guess it's been. Sometimes they are idea-driven and sometimes they are people-driven, if that makes any sense.\" She went on to explain that some projects have emerged because of the people she became involved with. Serving on panels, for example, were articulated as opportunities to get to know another scholar's research, develop trust and respect, and explore possible opportunities for future collaborative projects. These types of collaboration could be seen as convenience-related. People with similar interests become aware of each other, grow to respect and like each other, and find ways to bring their research together for a collaborative project. The main draw is the human dynamic and the opportunity to work with another scholar on a new project, rather than a set of research questions. On the other hand, idea-driven collaboration was articulated as more idea-or researchquestion centered. In this scenario, a faculty member develops a new research project first. The topic takes precedence. The idea may be the result of a call for proposals from a funding agency, an article read in a journal, a workshop participated in, or a poster session attended at a conference. The key point, however, is that the collaboration starts with the emergence of a research idea within an individual. That researcher then pulls in the collaborators needed to accomplish the goals of the project. While this social scientist treated these concepts as dichotomous, most of the other interviewees spoke of an interaction between the people on a collaborative project and the power of the idea that brought people together in the first place. In the words of an engineering professor, \" I would think that each collaboration is a combination of idea-driven and also people-driven. We need to have the right chemistry between the two collaborating people, and the base should be a solid idea.\" Similarly, a social scientist asserted, \"Even if you are just purely driven by the idea, you know not everyone else who you wanna draw into this project is the same idea-driven. So that's why I'm saying that almost immediately that idea-driven project becomes Nearly all those who articulated a bias in favor of choosing collaborators because of the people who would be involved, were relatively new assistant professors at the university. This is not to say that others didn't feel that the interpersonal dynamics played an important role in collaborative research, but for most people there was more of a balance between excitement to collaborate with certain people and the excitement of collaborating on a particular project because of the power of the idea. However, for those who did seem to favor collaborations with those that they had stronger personal relationships with, time in the field and culture seemed to play a major role. A first-year Chinese faculty member in the social sciences, for example, explained that she had collaborators in China because it was important to her to maintain those ties to friends from her home country. This same faculty member also spoke of her collaborations with her former Ph.D. advisor, reinforcing the notion that newer faculty members maintain ties to their Ph.D. and postdoctoral mentors as they establish themselves in their new careers. Another assistant professor, a faculty member in the physical sciences, also spoke of a strong bias toward choosing collaborative projects based on the people involved. She said, \"I think 95% of the collaborations that I've been involved with have been the latter [people-driven]. It's the people. You are like -hey -and then you chat about ideas and you come up with ideas. [But] it's rare that you are kind of -this is the skill that I need, who can I farm -who can I -you know -bring into that project?\" That being said, this same faculty member did emphasize that much research collaboration is \"opportunistic.\" She explained that you never know when you will be talking with someone and a good idea will come your way. While the inter-personal dynamics are clearly important, and everyone seemed to agree that collaborative research is more efficient, more rewarding, and more likely to be successful when there is a positive rapport and trust between the project stakeholders, it must be said that many spoke of the power of a good idea to draw them into a project. One life scientist described contacting colleagues because he wanted to have access to a particular molecule that could be evaluated using a novel protocol that he had developed and really wanted to test. This same faculty member spoke to his previous efforts to build collaborative teams based on people that would bring unique strengths to a particular project he felt strongly about. Both cases indicated a desire to bring in people to accomplish a goal-oriented project."}, {"section_title": "Hard Currency Gains from Collaboration", "text": "Experienced gains from collaboration ranged from the highly concrete to the more intangible. On the concrete side, what one faculty member referred to as the \"hard currency\" of collaboration, faculty members had collaborated in order to generate co-authored publications, capitalize upon on or gain access to scarce resources, or establish new research programs that might lead to successful collaborative proposals for funding. When exploring these tangible outcomes from collaborative research, it was somewhat surprising that only 5 out of the 20 interviewees brought up publications as a specific outcome experienced. Three of these interviewees were at the assistant professor level and while three of the interviewees were in the physical sciences, the life sciences and engineering were also represented in this group. In other words, there were no clear patterns with regard to the focus on publications as an outcome by such factors as faculty rank or field. However, 4 of the 5 who indicated that a major focus of their collaborative efforts was to generate co-authored publications were male. Gains experienced through the sharing of scarce or unique resources were probably the most commonly articulated tangible outcomes that interviewees had experienced. These gains ranged from the sharing of timesaving lab protocols, skills, tests, and techniques, to the actual exchange of equipment, labs, molecules, and even students. As one faculty member in the physical sciences put it, \"We use their [colleagues'] laboratories, our students take their classes, there is a lot of swapping of analytical techniques, and students go back and forth. Samples are being run sort of one place or the other.\" These hard currency exchanges were mentioned by faculty members across fields and genders, as well as across both ranks. The final dominant hard research currency mentioned in the interviews was currency itself. Several faculty members spoke of how their collaborative efforts yielded tangible results in the form of external grants to support their research. Indirectly, for example, the collaboration may have yielded a needed letter of institutional support for a research proposal, as was mentioned by one life scientist. It was also mentioned that the names on a joint proposal may have simply added credibility to it in the eyes of a review committee. In the words of an assistant professor in the life sciences, \"Having a paper together with your collaborator -name only -that has a benefit and [sends] a clear message to your grant proposal reviewers that I'm not -you know -lying [about the fact that I can do this]!\" Naturally, external funding was considered critical to establishing a sustainable research program. It is also important to be aware, however, that in the eyes of many researchers, collaboration is not the end goal, but rather a means to achieving a higher order goal such as funding for research. Letters and proposal clout are welcome intermediate gains from the collaborative process, but in the absence of funding as the ultimate outcome prior to the commencement of the research itself, collaboration can quickly fall apart. An engineering professor explained it this way, \"Well certainly collaboration in preparing proposals you know, if it doesn't get funded it's hard to keep the project going. So until the project gets, you know [going], the collaboration tends to be you know, just helping write the proposal until you get funding. At which point it becomes a much more dynamic collaboration typically.\" This speaks to the differing levels of collaborative activity and how funding can move a collaboration from a relatively low or peripheral level to more intense intellectual engagement leading to academic production."}, {"section_title": "Soft Currency Gains from Collaboration", "text": "On the \"soft currency\" side, gains from collaboration were much less tangible, but equally, if not more, rewarding. An associate professor from the social sciences described it this way, \"What are the products of these collaborative processes? We don't have a paper. There was no grant. That may turn out to be a good collaboration.\" Collaboration was seen as a mechanism for bringing new knowledge into a research group or project through informal hallway or coffee shop conversations, as well as through more formal partnerships. This knowledge was not necessarily for a specific purpose or a specific research project currently underway, but often served as intellectual capital to engage with and that might bring added insight into research problems. One researcher pointed out that collaboration was a means for learning more about colleagues' work, sort of a networking outcome. This was seen as helpful in choosing future projects in that it was easier to assemble a collaborative team when all the possible contributors' areas of expertise are known and the potential could be seen. An excellent example of these perceived outcomes is described by an assistant professor in the social sciences who discussed the role that she would like her senior colleagues to play in terms of generating positive outcomes through collaboration with her. In her interview she explained, \"I have to be called to take part. I have to be introduced to the possibility of collaboration by somebody else\u2026There is this more senior figure with more experience, with more networking, with more publications, but who wants to do this project and sees that I can benefit the project. And this person inspired me, this person generates ideas, listens to me, directs me. I learn from, you know, this person and the process of collaboration.\" This last quote really captures the larger and more lasting gains that many faculty members felt that they get from their collaborative activities. However, as was discussed in the section on tenure and collaboration, many faculty members were wary of too much collaboration, despite all of the potential positive outcomes. There was also concern among several interviewees that collaboration can lead to unhealthy dependencies upon others and either slow down or harm the overall research objectives of faculty members. As one life scientist put it, \"I moved away from collaborations and thought, I have to have a way not to [collaborate]. Collaborations are great it they bring ability to do new things. But we can't be totally dependent It must be emphasized that authorship was not universally seen as an indication of reciprocal contribution. Earlier, the concept of \"token\" collaboration was mentioned, in which a person gains authorship on a paper even though they didn't contribute substantially to the project in any way. A professor in the physical sciences hinted at how this might come about when she said, \"I can be a co-author on a paper and not have met a number of the people on that paper, you know? And I know like 80% of them [the co-authors] haven't even read the paper that they are on\u2026\" This type of arrangement can come about in a number of ways. One professor in the physical sciences discussed how she uses authorship to acknowledge facility directors that have provided access to key equipment for a research project. This same faculty member also discussed the pressure to include people's names as coauthors, not because of their contribution to a particular project, but because of the anticipated contribution that had been agreed upon and a shared understanding [developed in advance] of how authorship would be shared. Even when the colleague's contribution was reneged upon, this faculty member expressed how hard it is to rescind an authorship agreement and how avoiding conflict is often the easier route to take. In her words, \"We've had issues where I've been the lead author where I basically didn't want to put somebody on because I didn't feel like they contributed, and my colleagues said, well we decided everybody is going to be on every paper. I always try to err on the side of you know\u2026I'm just going to do it because in the end it's really no skin off my back.\" While communication seemed essential in the eyes of most of the researchers interviewed, especially for assigning work and determining authorship, for others there seemed to be a set of assumed universal principles with regard to collaborative research that were considered common sense, and therefore did not need to be actively communicated to partners. For example, a life scientist described the rules for the attribution for research quite simply when she said, \"The person who writes it [up] gets their name on first and you know, I don't think it's ever really been an issue.\" A different faculty member in the life sciences felt that authorship should be decided based on the \"level of intellectual contributions\" each participant had made. Yet another group of people felt that a person's status as the Principal Investigator gave them the right to assert their first author rights because they were thought to be the drivers of the idea and were the key resource people involved, since the PI's role is make sure everything is done right."}, {"section_title": "Intangible Forms of Reciprocity", "text": "On the more intangible side of reciprocity in collaborative research, lies the mutually understood value of the research, as well as trust. With regard to value, the main theme to emerge was the sense that research collaborations were only as valuable as the degree to which they enhanced the research itself or brought a new perspective into the mix. In other words, collaboration was seen to play a highly functional role and was not, generally, done simply for the sake of collaboration itself. That being said, many faculty members did comment on how much enjoyment they got out of collaborating with others. A life scientist talked to the value of collaborative research in this way, \"You put your knowledge in [to the collaboration], but at the same time you wanna learn things from that other side, right?\" Similarly, another faculty said, \"I would be looking for somebody who has a different perspective on it. Who can have a fresh set of eyes. It's an ideal scenario -it's also the shared workload.\" Other interviewees chimed in as well and talked about the degree to which collaboration helped broaden their perspectives. Many faculty members spoke to a personal sense of responsibility in terms of bringing value to the collaboration in the form of time, passion, effort, and new ideas. When this cannot be done, many indicated that they would not engage in collaborations. In the words of an engineer, \"If I feel that I cannot contribute at all, then of course I say I can't contribute.\" The contribution of time, ideas, energy, and passion, however, are generally discussed within the context of the mutual benefits to be derived. A natural scientist articulated this balance well when he said, \"My willingness to engage with inquirers depends on whether the project engages me intellectually. How open and receptive and mutually beneficial will the collaboration be?\" Faculty members' general sense of the importance of mutual benefit in collaborative research [wanting to give to something, as well as to receive a benefit from it], is not to say that they are seeking an absolute balance in contributions. Indeed, the comparative contributions were seen to be highly fluid over time, and many faculty members emphasized how collaborative activity and level of contribution must be viewed over time. earlier, this was seen as especially critical on funded projects where distribution of work was essential to timely completion, while the Principal Investigator was largely responsible for ensuring that the work was done on time and to the agency's expectations. Failure was not seen as an option given the adverse effect it would have on the faculty member's ability to acquire external funding in the future. Risk averse researchers, therefore are not going to engage in highstakes collaborative research unless they know they can depend on their colleagues to live up to their end of the bargain. Trust was a deeply personal issue, with many of those interviewed feeling that a colleague's personal investment in and commitment to a project was even more important than the level of the contribution made. As the quote in the preceding paragraph makes clear, people are willing to give their colleagues some slack in the near term if the longer-term prospects of a productive collaboration are considered strong. Overall, authenticity and the belief in a mutual sense of commitment were critical considerations for those interviewed."}, {"section_title": "Collaborative Skill Development", "text": "Addressing the third qualitative research question, \"What is the perceived relationship between the collaborative work done in graduate school, the postdoctoral research period, and the respondents' faculty careers?\" this section develops a grounded understanding of how faculty members feel they developed their collaborative research skills. After a brief review of interviewees' first reported collaborative research experiences, the role of respondents' academic and postdoctoral training will be explored. Special attention will be given to the role of researchers' training at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, the role of institutional structures in the fostering and development of collaborative skills and finally, the impact of mentoring received from colleagues on the faculty. While undergraduate training was not initially part of the research question on the development of collaborative skills, its recurring inclusion as an important developmental period for the faculty members interviewed demanded its inclusion."}, {"section_title": "First Collaborative Research Experiences", "text": "A portion of each interview was devoted to a discussion on how faculty members developed their collaborative research skills. As summary Table 5.1 showed 8 faculty members indicated that their first collaborative research experience was at the undergraduate level, 11 indicated that this experience occurred during graduate study, and only one faculty member indicated that her first collaborative research experience was prior to her undergraduate career. As these overall numbers indicate, every faculty member interviewed had a collaborative research experience prior to beginning his or her faculty career. Furthermore, for the 15 informants who had completed a postdoctoral research experience, all had at least one prior collaborative research experience. For those who indicated that their first collaborative research experience was during their undergraduate years, a variety of experience types were articulated. One of the social scientists, for example, got her first taste of international field research by serving as a research assistant for one of her professors on a trip to Africa. She recounts, \"It's not like I was a co-author, but that project wouldn't have happened without me and so it was at that moment that I realized you can get more done as a team than you can as an individual.\" The majority of those interviewed reported their first collaborative research experience at the Masters or Ph.D. level. Three of the 11 were faculty members from the social sciences, 3 were from engineering, 3 were from the life sciences, and 2 were from the physical sciences. One of the social scientists who reported a first research collaboration during her graduate years was a faculty member who had taken a course on experimental design. After the course had ended, she collaborated with her research partner, another graduate student, to publish their first paper together. This was one of only two examples given of peer-to-peer collaboration at the graduate level. The other example was offered by a different social scientist who had also worked on co-authoring a paper with a colleague from his program. Among the remaining group of faculty members who reported an initial collaborative research experience in graduate school, most reported working as researchers on larger teams comprised of other graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty members. Two interviewees, however, one in the social sciences and one in the life sciences, had worked oneon-one with a faculty member on field research and had become co-authors on resulting publications. There were also a few anomalies among those interviewed. One engineering professor, for example, had completed an internship at a national laboratory where he had the opportunity to work collaboratively with a large group of people. Another engineering professor recounted how her Ph.D. advisor had connected her with a visiting speaker on campus, which had led to her first research inter-institutional collaboration. Finally, a faculty member from the physical sciences described how he had become part of a multi-institutional research team during his graduate program. The remainder of this section will examine the perceived role these experiences had in respondents' development as collaborative researchers. How faculty members rank ordered the impact of their overall experiences prior to beginning their faculty careers, including their postdoctoral research experiences, will also be explored. Finally, perceived gaps in people's training will be discussed briefly, along with the mechanisms interviewees had employed as faculty members to close these gaps."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Undergraduate Training", "text": "In discussing the impact of their undergraduate research experiences, two highly related themes emerged. The first of these was the concept of connections spanning academic departments. As one life scientist put it, \"I learned that things are connected and [that] these artificial silos associated with departments are really artificial. There are people who are better chemists in the geology department than the chemistry department. People in the Geology department who could easily be called biologists.\" This remark shows an understanding shared by many of those interviewed and speaks to why many faculty members indicated strong and mutually beneficial connections at the intra-departmental level. There are not only people across departments with shared training and fundamental understandings, but there are research questions that simply demand the informed merging of different academic schools of thought. The second related theme to emerge was the idea that depth of specialization within a particular discipline has its limitations. A life scientist described it this way, \"I was an undergrad\u2026and you know we had it [lab] set up as a shop. We sort of did everything in-house\u2026So I did a very much chemistry-centric type of undergraduate research experience. And so there wasn't really any applied method.\" He went on to explain that because of the isolation he had experienced as an undergraduate due to the depth of specialization, he had felt the need during his doctoral work and postdoctoral research to delve into that \"applied\" side of chemistry so as to get to the point of seeing what the molecules he had created actually do. This latter experience speaks, to some extent, to the theme that many interviewees articulated in terms of why they collaborate at the departmental level. Bridging the divide between the theoretical and the experimental can give one a sense of completion on a project, and the merging of the two areas of specialization within a particular discipline serves to enhance the opportunities and experiences for both sides. This was summed up well by another life scientist who spoke about why he collaborates with experimentalists within his department. In his words, \"I mean, we all have strategies for our labs and I mean you have to have a motivation for taking on any project that you are going to [do], and I don't think mine are any more selfserving than most. I mean they should be -they have to be self-serving. But really, I think all collaborations in my lab stem from that [undergraduate] experience. Because in all cases we are doing our thing, [and] our thing is going to be fine without you. But value would be added if you want to help. And those are the types of collaboration that I've really pursued because those are the only ones I feel quite comfortable with.\" Both of the general themes discussed above represent life-long lessoned learned from faculty members' undergraduate careers. These experiences and the realizations that emerged from them, significantly affected their decision-making related to the choice of graduate or postdoctoral research program, and still affect the way that they collaborate as faculty members. We now turn to the role of graduate training in the development of collaborative research skills."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Graduate Training", "text": "Graduate training was seen as enormously impactful by nearly all interviewees with regard to the development of collaborative research skills. For some, graduate school served to introduce and reinforce the importance of collaborative research directly. For others, as was the case for both undergraduates in the life sciences referenced above, graduate school served as negative reinforcement in that they found their experiences so limiting or so isolating that they dedicated themselves to a more collaborative approach in their future careers. Many reported that graduate school was a time in which collaboration was extremely difficult. Even in departments where faculty members were clearly working collaboratively, doctoral students were encouraged to work independently, to be \"self-reliant\" as one physical Several other faculty members spoke of their graduate programs' emphasis on developing them as independent scholars. A life scientist recalled that his doctoral program advisor's \"stated theory of graduate education was to throw them in the ocean and see if they can swim. He saw it as a hindrance that he would be too directly involved.\" Another life scientist described how he was left on his own to do his dissertation research, only to be told that the corresponding senior author on the resulting publication would be his doctoral advisor, even though he felt that his advisor had not helped him at all along the way. It should be noted, however, that this negative sentiment was only articulated by one interviewee. It was far more common for respondents to talk favorably about the one-on-one collaborative experience that they had with their doctoral program advisor and the active mentoring that they had received. A social scientist summed it up this way, \"You're a grad student [and] you collaborate with a professor. You do the data analysis and they do the write-up, or vice versa. And you get credit for it, which is great. Actually, for\u2026a lot of my graduate colleagues at my institution, that was how it was. And it simulated to some degree what that version of social science was supposed to be.\" While it was clear that some felt their graduate advisors had been unhelpful when it came to fostering the development of collaborative research skills, others found their advisors to be absolutely instrumental in their indoctrination into the realm of collaborative research. One associate professor in the life sciences, who still maintains an active research collaboration with her doctoral program advisor, discussed how her advisor had worked hard to integrate her into the scientific community and bring her into her own network of scholars. Many faculty members who reported maintaining collaborations with their graduate mentors spoke of how these mentors actively worked to bring them into their larger scientific networks. The broader network of ties that seemed to get established at that time seemed to serve a dual purpose in that they connected the Ph.D. students with a broader community of collaborators, while reinforcing the mentormentee relationship as it evolved into a relationship between peers. A key mechanism for being brought into that broader network of collaborators was conference attendance. While some discussed attending conferences on their own and meeting other graduate students who would later become collaborators at other institutions, others spoke of how their advisors had carefully included them at conferences, helping them to expand their knowledge networks in more deliberate ways. Relating her own experience with this, a physical scientist recalled, \"I'm really grateful to my Ph.D. advisor for bringing me along to a lot of conferences when I was a student, and also my Masters advisors, because you know it really allowed me to meet those key players early on so that, you know, ten years from [that time] I feel like I know them well.\" It was also clear that many faculty members learned about the power of collaborative research from their mentors' modeling behavior. This took on a number of forms. For some, it was becoming part of a larger research team under the direction of a faculty mentor. In the words of one physical scientist, she \"saw the network in action\" and became a part of it. This reinforced the importance of exposing doctoral students to larger collaborative research projects involving multiple faculty members, graduate students, and postdocs. For others, observing a mentor's decision-making with regard to how and when to collaborate in research was informative. In terms of when, some faculty members recalled learning how collaborating with colleagues at other institutions was critical to securing grant funds. Others emphasized learning about the importance of collaboration to gain access to key equipment or necessary materials for an experiment [lab samples, for example]. In terms of how to collaborate, several faculty members spoke of the cultural knowledge they had gained by serving on large and diverse teams as graduate students. An associate professor in the life sciences explained, \"We used to laugh because you know we more or less had the United Nations in the group we worked with because we had people from\u2026Italy, we For a small portion of those interviewed, graduate school was not enough in terms of the training needed to collaborate effectively. Three faculty members, for example, spoke of the limited collaboration that they had been able to engage in as graduate students and how this had caused them to pursue postdoctoral research opportunities in the U.S. so that they could gain that experience and begin expanding their research networks. That being said, others pursued postdoctoral research opportunities for the opposite reasons. One faculty member, for example, spoke of an intensely negative collaborative experience he had in graduate school. He had been reliant upon a postdoctoral researcher to run some tests for him with highly specialized equipment residing in another lab. The results of these tests were critical to his research, but the postdoc was absolutely unwilling to work with him, despite a request from the postdoc's direct mentor. The outcome of the research was ultimately unsuccessful because of the missing pieces and the graduate student's inability to get the postdoctoral researcher to work with him. The decision to pursue his own postdoctoral research experience was an overt effort to learn about a different set of technical skills so that he would never be wholly dependent upon another researcher for the successful conclusion of his research again. While many recognize that the increasing burden of knowledge virtually necessitates collaboration at some level, and others made it clear that collaboration is advisable in situations where someone's depth of expertise in a complementary area can really enhance the overall project, many noted, \"How limiting it can be when your group is completely dependent on collaborators.\" The next section discusses the perceived role of the postdoctoral research experience in the development of collaborative research skills."}, {"section_title": "The Role of the Postdoctoral Research Experience", "text": "While many interviewees felt that their postdoctoral research experience had been helpful to them in the development of their collaboration skills, some respondents expressed frustration with the lack of acknowledgement that they had received for their contributions. One researcher in the life sciences described it this way, \"Any individual you hire you wish them to be creative, On the one hand this passage shows how complicated attribution can become for original scientific work. In the case above, the PI earned a grant that enabled him to hire a postdoc. That postdoc then produced original work and, at one level, was recognized for that work by members of his field. However, in the grant world, the agency only recognized the PI for the project outcomes, in effect making it difficult for the postdoctoral researcher to acquire future funding as an independent researcher to capitalize upon his or her past research successes. On the other hand, the shadow collaboration that this person had engaged in as a postdoctoral researcher, taught him in turn to engage in that same pattern of collaborative activity as an independent researcher by taking ownership over the accomplishments of the team that he had assembled and supported through his grants. Shadow collaboration aside, the overwhelming majority of those faculty members who had a postdoctoral research experience reported very positive outcomes. This is not to say that those outcomes came without stress, however. A physical scientist, for example, explained that as a postdoctoral scholar his supervisor had been so busy that he \"ended up doing a lot of work that an assistant professor would do.\" By being the \"go-to\" person in the lab, he learned how to bring in other people strategically to keep the research moving forward. Ironically, while some faculty members reported that serving as a postdoc in a small lab afforded them more opportunities to engage in collaborative research, some faculty members said the same thing about serving as postdocs in larger labs. A life scientist, for example, discussed how his postdoctoral lab was so big and compartmentalized, that his mentor frequently advised him to contact outside colleagues to lend their specific expertise to the pieces of the project he had been working on. In this case, the size and busyness of the lab resulted in lack of access to the mentor and the mentor's skills. This necessitated reaching out to others beyond to immediate team. that people would notice things that we weren't doing that we could be doing better even though they were competitors and inevitable they would tell him, and our research would get better. And so he had such an open sharing attitude, and eventually I saw the benefit that he was deriving from it, so I sort of adopted that for my lab as well.\" This is a perfect description of the type of collaborative attitude that many faculty members derived from their postdoctoral mentors. This was not an explicit lesson in collaboration, but a skill learned on a much more tacit level. With regard to the skills learned from the postdoctoral experience, several interviewees spoke of using their postdoctoral research time to learn a new skill to enable them to become more independent researchers. While it may seem ironic to collaborate with someone to develop independence, as was explained in the previous section, negative experiences associated with having too much reliance on a research collaborator were major motivators in this regard. As one physical scientist put it, \"When I was a postdoc I went to work for a group that was more synthetic -more making molecules, because I saw that one of the downfalls of having collaborations is that sometimes you are just sitting there doing nothing, cause you are waiting for people to send you stuff.\" In terms of making connections, the postdoctoral research experience was seen as absolutely essential by many faculty members. Nearly all faculty members who had completed a postdoctoral appointment, for example, still maintained research collaborations with their former mentors. In addition, connections were often maintained with those who interviewees had established collaborations with during their postdoctoral years. A life scientist described maintaining collaborations with many of the researchers who had come through his postdoctoral mentor's lab during his time there. Similarly, institutional connections established during the postdoctoral years were often maintained by faculty members as they began their independent research careers. The postdoctoral experience was seen as a time to build critical long-term connections with institutions supporting and colleagues engaging in research related to their interests. By way of example, a faculty member in the life sciences chose his postdoctoral research experience not because he wanted to acquire a particular set of skills, but because he wanted the chance to merge his skills with a different skill set. He described his postdoctoral mentor has having a complementary set of skills, creating a \"nice division of labor\" in the research. The result has been a 15-year collaboration that has continued long into the faculty member's independent research career."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Institutions in the Ongoing Training of Early-Career Faculty Members", "text": "It became abundantly clear over the course of the interviews that faculty members saw their development as collaborative researchers as an ongoing process. For some, their faculty careers were the first time that they had a chance to engage in independent research collaborations in which they retained the locus of control. For others, their collaborative work as professors was a chance to continually refine their skills, expand their networks, and develop fresh ideas. For nearly half of the interviewees (8), centers within the university had proven instrumental in their collaborative endeavors. Centers served a number of purposes. For many, centers had become a place to meet colleagues, sound out new ideas, and gain support for grant proposals. A social scientist described the role of centers in her research life this way, \"I think if we had more centers like that and people had a research affiliation, things could grow by leaps and bounds. I mean because I do feel like when I have a research idea they are going to support it. There are going to find some way to support it, you know?...Those types of places on campus, those moments and spaces are invaluable for my development I think.\" A physical scientist recounted how a center at a different university brought him into a new research group at the inter-institutional and international levels by providing their campus faculty with the funding they needed to bring scholars in from across the globe for a research brainstorming session. They came to the meeting without a particular project in mind, but to meet, get to know each other, network, and discuss how they might collaborate in the future. The activity led to a $5 million multi-institutional grant for overseas field research. This speaks to the important leveraging centers can do as they support faculty members' new research ideas and serve to increase capacity through the establishment of linkages to scholars outside the immediate environment. Similarly, a faculty member at the university spoke of how her center affiliation on campus had served as a mechanism for gaining new affiliations with scholarly networks beyond the campus. There was a networking component to this, as well as a skill development component. On the networking side, the national reputation of the center attracted talent from knowledge hubs across the country and world. By being on the center's faculty affiliate list, she was frequently connected with new people looking to collaborate with the center on an area of research related to her field of specialization. On the skill development side, however, the faculty member reported how she had participated in a center-sponsored seminar on interdisciplinarity. In her words, \"I think I learned the most about interdisciplinarity, which is misused and misunderstood across the board. I joined a faculty seminar for the Center\u2026[which] actually taught me a lot, including [about] interdisciplinary. My colleague and I, we were both in that seminar one semester preceding the semester that we taught together.\" Centers, especially area studies centers with different geographical foci, were also seen as places that facilitated research involving international collaborations. Faculty members reported limited endorsement within their own academic departments for international research and international partnerships. However, centers were places that connected colleagues from different disciplines with a shared regional focus for dialogue and other collaborative activity. A social scientist described it this way, \"I find a little bit more, you know, comfort in the regional center where there are their own biases towards arts, and culture, and languages. I just find much more appreciation of the kinds of things that are frowned upon [in my academic home department].\" Just as centers facilitated collaboration among researchers from different disciplines with a shared regional focus, centers also facilitated collaboration among researchers from different disciplines with a shared interest in a particular research area. A physical scientist described the center that she is affiliated with as attracting the federal grant dollars and the scholars from around the country that she needs in order to engage in high-level interdisciplinary research. By serving as a hub for sponsored interdisciplinary research, her center introduces her continually to new ideas, new people, and new opportunities for research. A life scientist described a new type of center that had proven critical to his own successful research program. The university had established a number of core laboratories for the purpose of providing localized expert support on research projects. These labs are staffed by highly trained scientists, and they remain neutral with respect to particular academic departments, in as much as they provide free or heavily discounted guidance and lab expertise to anyone who comes to them, regardless of their home department. The benefit of collaborating with these labs was seen as multifaceted. They were seen as cost-effective, providing expert guidance, enabling access to key technologies and equipment, and a way to collaborate locally with a dependable and trustworthy collaborator. Because the core labs' viability is tied to their ability to connect with faculty members and provide them with the fee-based services needed in the performance of their research, they were seen as dependable and inherently trustworthy. In the words of the life scientist who brought these core labs up, \"They have the mindset that they want to help other people's research rather than do their own.\" In addition to the on-going roles that campus centers play in helping faculty members hone their collaborative skills, connect with relevant colleagues, and gain access to key components for their research, nearly a third of the interviewees spoke of how important faculty peer-mentoring is to their continuing development as collaborative researchers. All of these respondents were faculty members at the assistant professor rank. A new professor in engineering spoke of how she collaborates with senior colleagues in her department to develop her ideas, identify areas where collaboration is needed, and find potential collaborators at the departmental, intra-institutional, and inter-institutional levels. She specifically appreciated her colleagues' willingness to help her tap into their own engineering networks. This idea of working with senior colleagues to work through new ideas and identify areas where collaboration would be useful and advisable was mentioned by 3 of the 6 interviewees who brought up peer-mentoring as an important contributor to their development. There were also assistant professors in the interview pool who cried out for peer-support within their academic department, and felt that they were lacking it. One faculty member, an international woman in her first year on the faculty reported feeling, \"too young and na\u00efve.\" She went on to assert that, \"Senior colleagues wouldn't be interested in collaborating with me.\" That being said, she felt strongly that her senior colleagues could be instrumental in introducing her to new networks and in helping her become more collaborative."}, {"section_title": "Another assistant professor from an engineering program expressed his frustration with", "text": "what he perceived to be favoritism expressed by his senior colleagues within the department. While he expressed a strong desire to be mentored and learn the ins and outs of his profession from his more experienced peers, he saw his peers as unreachable for him. In his words, \"There are protected species [in the department], and there are some that they don't want to protect. So apparently I'm outside the protection zone.\" He went on to explain that for him, this meant that he was more on his own in terms of finding colleagues across campus and beyond to collaborate with. However, he saw his younger peers within the protection zone and getting much more guidance and assistance with collaboration."}, {"section_title": "Relative Importance of Different Experiences in Developing Collaborative Research", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Acumen", "text": "When discussing the relative importance of faculty member's pre-career developmental experiences related to collaboration, responses fell into three categories: those who felt that their undergraduate or graduate programs had been foundational, those who felt that their postdoctoral research experiences were the most important, and those who felt strongly that each experience contributed independently but in a synergistic way to their overall development as collaborative interviewees also spoke of the direct collaboration skills they had learned as graduate students. An engineering professor spoke of how she simply became immersed in a collaborative research environment during graduate school and that's how she learned to work. In many ways, it had become a state of being, rather than a skill. She explained, \"I was into collaboration from day one, and until the last day I was collaborating with different people in different regions because I wanted to do interdisciplinary work. So for me, I cannot imagine a moment where I did not collaborate\u2026I can't point out one moment where I saw it. It was important, but I can't imagine a moment without it.\" Another professor in the social sciences described a similar experience in his interview. He spoke of his mentor teaching him how to collaborate and engage others by modeling this behavior and constantly bringing him into collaborative field research projects. For him, the collaborative approach simply became his understanding of how you engage in social scientific research. This same faculty member described collaborating with a peer in his doctoral program to put together a conference paper that ended up getting published in a top-tier journal. He recalled this experience fondly and how it taught him that collaboration could be \"lateral\" rather than always \"hierarchical.\" For him, he took from this experience that if you do good research, align yourself with good people, work hard, and trust in others as you trust in yourself, the merits of the outcomes will be recognized. For a smaller group of respondents, the synergistic qualities of their many developmental experiences were emphasized, rather than assigning primacy to one particular developmental period in their preparation. One engineer, for example, spoke of her doctoral work and her postdoctoral research as equally collaborative and foundational. However, she saw these experiences as bringing in different facets of collaboration. For her, her time as a doctoral student was a time to learn how to work as part of team. This entailed doing good work, being on time, and following the directives of her doctoral program advisor. This was not a particularly creative time for her, but her work was intimately involved with that of those around her. In What this interviewee was describing is the increased autonomy she experienced as a postdoctoral researcher. She was still reliant upon, and collaborating with others in the performance of her research, but she was allowed the freedom and expected to bring her own creativity and innovation to the research problem at hand. For other faculty members, they saw their time as graduate students and postdoctoral scholars as fundamental to network development. A life scientist explained, \"I start to build a network\u2026You do research during your Ph.D. and you see the importance of collaboration. And you do the research during your postdoc and you also see the importance of collaboration\u2026We are exposed to that kind of thing from the beginning.\" For this scholar, and many others, their developmental experiences were indeed seen as fundamental to their network development, and many referenced on-going and highly active collaborations with their former mentors from their doctoral and postdoctoral times, as well as with the research partners that they had been exposed to during those periods."}, {"section_title": "Lack of Pre-Career Training in Collaborative Research", "text": "While all interviewees indicated active collaborative engagement with colleagues on multiple levels, two women, both international faculty members from different regions of the The interview excerpt above followed a discussion about how difficult collaboration is for international women due to cultural and skill-based barriers. On the cultural front, both women spoke of how difficult it is to assert themselves in scholarly venues. For the woman from Asia, walking up to someone at a conference, for example, was seen as presumptuous and boastful. This was not something that someone in China would do, especially if the person was a prominent scholar in the field. Similarly the woman from Europe expressed her reluctance to engage with scholars she doesn't know at conferences because she is so unknown. In terms of skills, both women spoke of how difficult it is to internalize the skills of social networking at professional venues. From greetings, to talking about one's own research, to challenging the assertions of more prominent scholars working in similar areas, these were considered difficult hurdles to overcome. Furthermore, as the quote above indicates, both women reported encountering hidden biases among their colleagues in the field related to their gender and national origin. These biases will be explored in more detail in the final section of this chapter."}, {"section_title": "Constraints on and Opportunities in Collaboration by Subpopulation", "text": "Answering the last qualitative research question, the final section of this chapter explores the differences between international and U.S. citizen faculty members regarding the perceived constraints on and opportunities available to them as they relate to the development of collaborative partnerships. In particular, international faculty members' sense of their own advantages and disadvantages as non-citizens will be discussed. U.S. citizens' perceived advantages and disadvantages as they relate to their citizenship will also be discussed. Finally, barriers relating to gender and socio-economic class will be briefly mentioned."}, {"section_title": "Advantages for International Faculty Members", "text": "As international faculty members discussed the advantages they had experienced in the performance of collaborative research, several themes emerged. Some of these advantages were more logistical in nature, while others were more intellectual. On the logistical side, several interviewees spoke of how their strong family ties in their country of origin and their frequent visits afforded them more opportunities to collaborate with scholars physically located in those countries. A faculty member from China explained, \"My parents are living in another country, so By way of explanation, a recurring theme, even on independently produced articles and other publications, was how much money and time international faculty members spend to have their papers proofread by native English-speaking experts prior to journal submission. Furthermore, even after having their work proofread, a pronounced bias against non-native speakers among top-tier journals was strongly felt by many interviewees. Several international faculty members, in fact, indicated that they had stopped sending their articles to American scientific journals because of this bias. In the words of an international professor in engineering, \"Some journals focus on language, not content. So you learn not to submit to those.\" Instead, many international faculty members reported sending articles to top European scholarly journals because of their more egalitarian approach to language. On the cultural front, several interviewees, especially those from Asia reported difficulty reaching out to colleagues for new collaborations. This was especially articulated as a barrier at conferences when meeting people for the first time. As one faculty member explained, \"I While this comment came from a faculty member from Europe, this idea of finding it difficult to \"brag\" about ones skills and research agenda was a common theme. A new professor from the social sciences who hailed from China explained how hard it is to connect with her U.S. colleagues because she's not used to being \"aggressive\" or \"assertive.\" She characterized her American colleagues as \"boastful\" when talking about their research. Furthermore, as a young Chinese woman, she reported finding it very difficult to overcome her cultural deference to scholars with seniority. Approaching senior colleagues was viewed as presumptuous and acting beyond one's station. While everyone interviewed acknowledged that they understood how the U.S. academic culture works and how they \"should\" behave, many reported feeling uncomfortable interacting in this environment and ignoring ingrained cultural edicts."}, {"section_title": "Advantages for U.S. Citizen Faculty", "text": "There were several perceived advantages experienced by faculty members holding U.S. citizenship. Most of these advantages were on the more logistical side as they related to collaboration. While language and culture were not articulated as issues for U.S. faculty members, their international colleagues did see U.S. citizens as having natural advantages in this realm. In the words of one international faculty member, \"I didn't grow up here. I didn't do my undergraduate here. I was not taught a lot of social skills, and even though I feel very confident about my language, it is still not where the language of my colleagues [is].\" She went on to explain that she views her U.S. colleagues as much more \"articulate\" and \"persuasive\" and thus able to attract collaborations much more easily. This did come up in one interview with a U.S. faculty member from the life sciences. In discussing his own sense of how his U.S. citizenship had affected his collaborations he stated, \"If anything else, in part because I have the cultural context of the U.S., [it] probably makes me more sought out, in the fact that there are strong things in the U.S. and the fact that we have a pretty strong research component. I am probably reaping the benefits now when people call me on the phone or send me an email asking me to send stuff to them.\" Several U.S. respondents did speak to the ease with which they are able to collaborate within the U.S. context. While it may be perceived that language and culture are a part of this, it was also pointed out that access to U.S. government research funding to support larger collaborative projects was more available to those with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. A physical scientist, for example, spoke of the rich array of resources available to her to support her collaborative research. These resources were seen as attractive to collaborators from abroad especially, so garnered her attention from colleagues both near and far. experience and the unanticipated barriers. She said, \"Having been in the U.S. and having most of my collaborators in the U.S\u2026it doesn't always become apparent to you that people do things a different way. And so for instance, that issue with the Norwegians [a particularly difficult collaboration she had described earlier], they were actually very very concerned about me, as an American, stealing all of their work. It was a shocking -jarring experience because I had no idea -that hadn't even occurred to me that I would be doing that.\" This comment speaks to the importance of gaining experience in international collaborations for U.S. citizens in order to overcome perceptual and cultural barriers. It is interesting to note that only two out of the 10 U.S. citizens could articulate barriers that they experienced as they related to their citizenship status. Most interviewees slipped into discussing the difficulties they had experienced because of the fact that they were located in the U.S., rather than because of their cultural or linguistic heritage. Issues related to collaborating with colleagues from different time zones, on different funding cycles and with different funding agency reporting requirements, for example, could easily be experienced by all U.S.-based faculty members whether they were U.S. citizens or not."}, {"section_title": "Gender, Socio-Economic, and Discipline-Centered Barriers to Collaboration", "text": "While this was not a particular focus in the interviews, several interviewees brought up gender-related and socio-economic barriers that they had experienced when trying to collaborate with colleagues. Two interviewees drew attention to gender issues that they had experienced. Both women worked in the social sciences, with one holding U.S. citizenship and the other an international faculty member. For the international faculty member, she reported feeling like a \"triple minority\" as a \"woman,\" a \"woman of color,\" and as an \"international woman of color.\" In describing how this affected her collaborative efforts she spoke of how she felt that an underlying sexism made it more difficult for her to gain respect from her male colleagues within the department. She also spoke of how her male-dominated field was difficult to break into in her attempts to collaborate. Taken together, the results of the qualitative phase of the study suggest that faculty members are deeply engaged in collaborative research and that these collaborations increasingly transcend institutional and political boundaries. Furthermore, interviewees' expanded notions of what constitutes collaboration reinforces the importance of focusing on the processes of collaborative research, rather than on the products of collaborative engagement alone that can be traced back to multiple contributors. Tangible and intangible forms of collaborative behavior were a dominant theme to emerge from the interviews. The faculty members interviewed articulated a diverse array of mechanisms that they employ in developing and maintaining collaborative networks, as well as a broad range of reasons for wanting to engage in collaborative research in the first place. From the pressure of earning tenure or a promotion, to overcoming the challenges of producing novel research, faculty members actively used their collegial networks (ties), conference attendance, and even their teaching and mentoring to develop their collaborative networks. One of the most pronounced findings in the qualitative phase of the study was the discovery that all faculty members had collaborative experiences prior to their postdoctoral research periods and/or prior to beginning their faculty careers. This suggests that faculty members are trained within an environment that is collaborative by nature and that reinforces, at least to some extent, the importance of collaborative research from the very beginning. Finally, interview data focusing on citizenship status, gender, and socioeconomic status suggest that while faculty members' personal backgrounds create inherent challenges and provide natural advantages in the realm of collaboration, faculty members are able to engage in all forms of collaborative activity studied here. The concluding chapter that follows will discuss and integrate the findings of the two phases of this study, explore their importance and implications, and articulate future directions for research. With regard to the implications of this study, specific attention will be given to the implications for institutional policy makers, granting agencies, and academic departments engaged in the training and development of tomorrow's collaborative researchers."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION", "text": "The overarching purpose of this study has been to develop a better understanding of the patterns and processes of collaboration in the performance of research, as well as to understand why and how early-career faculty members engage in collaborative partnerships. With an eye toward institutional policy and academic programming, special emphasis was also placed on how faculty members perceive the role of their diverse developmental experiences as they relate to the acquisition of collaboration skills. Following the order of the research questions that have been posed, this chapter begins with a discussion of the results of the two phases of this study. Collaboration patterns are discussed as informed by the study's quantitative and qualitative results. This is followed by a discussion of the factors that predict different forms of collaboration according to the SDR, as well as the primary motivations behind and mechanisms for engaging in collaborative research as learned from interviews. Referencing the third qualitative research question, the study's focus on the respective importance of various developmental and training experiences is then explored as these experiences relate to the development of collaborative research skills. The section concludes with a discussion of the findings related to citizenship status. The importance and implications of the study's findings are discussed next, focusing in particular on how they inform both research and practice. In particular, this section focuses on how the study's findings relate to social network theory's strength of weak ties concept, lessons to be learned from the perspective of institutions of higher education, and the power that external funding agencies have to foster or hinder collaborative research. The chapter concludes with a summary of the study's main findings, limitations and directions for future research."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Collaboration Patterns", "text": "The forms of collaboration that faculty members reported engaging in were the focus of the first research question for both phases of the study. For the quantitative phase, data from the 2006 SDR were examined to determine the prevalence of team-level, intra-institutional, interinstitutional, and international forms of collaboration in early-career faculty members' lives. Similarly, in the qualitative phase of the study interviewees were asked to describe their collaborations at the departmental/team level, within the university, with colleagues at other universities within the U.S., and on an international level. A comparison of the results of these two phases of the study yielded differences that suggest some degree of caution should be used in interpreting data on collaboration from the 2006 SDR, as well as in interpreting data from the qualitative interviews given that interviews were only conducted on a single Research I university campus. The results also have implications for future quantitative studies examining collaborative processes among faculty members as the qualitative data on forms of collaboration suggest a rich diversity of collaborative engagement among this population. Unanticipated forms of collaboration were articulated in the interviews that challenge traditional understandings of collaboration and how it relates to scholarly productivity and the products of collaborative work. With regard to the SDR data, the form of collaboration with the highest frequency across all groups was intra-institutional collaboration with nearly \u00be of respondents indicating that they had engaged in this form of collaboration in the performance of their research. For all subpopulations, with the exception of the international faculty subpopulation, team collaboration, inter-institutional collaboration, and international collaboration followed in that order. International faculty members were the sole exception with inter-institutional collaboration coming after intra-institutional collaboration, followed by team collaboration and international collaboration respectively. International collaboration was reported with the lowest frequency across all groups. The descriptive statistics would suggest that the faculty members interviewed would be most likely to collaborate within their own institutions, but beyond their academic departments, and least likely to collaborate on an international dimension. Furthermore, the descriptive data from the SDR suggest that differences might emerge related to faculty-members' self-reported collaborative activity and how that activity is predicted by factors such as gender and citizenship status. In particular, it was expected that U.S. citizen status would predict higher odds of indicating active collaboration at the local levels (team and intra-institutional collaboration), while their international colleagues would be more likely to self-report higher frequencies of collaboration at the national and international levels. The descriptive statistics on citizenship lend support to the assertion that mobility serves to expand faculty members' collaborative networks of ties beyond the campus (Cheng & Yang, 1998;Kahn & MacGarvie, 2008;Saxenian, 2002;Szel\u00e9nyi, 2003), since by definition international faculty members have had greater personal mobility, at least in the past. While grounded in national data on self-reported forms of collaborative engagement and in inferential statistics that explored for statistically significant predictors of collaborative behavior outcomes from among the independent variables included in the analysis, these predictions on the relationship between the factors considered and forms of collaboration did not hold true for the group interviewed. This is despite that fact that the interview population matched the characteristics of the population studied on the SDR, with the exception that all interviews were conducted with faculty members working at a Research I institution. As reported in Chapter 5, with only one exception, all faculty members interviewed at the university selfreported utilizing all four forms of collaboration in the performance of their research. While the relative frequency of each type of collaborative activity was not ascertained during the interviews, it should be noted that the collaboration measures on the SDR were also all-ornothing measures. In other words, an indication of \"yes\" for a particular type of collaboration on the SDR was in no way an indication of the frequency of collaboration at that level. While the exact reasons for the collaboration pattern differences between the SDR and the interviews call for additional research, part of the explanation may lie in the interactive nature of the interviews themselves. When completing a survey, a respondent must read a question, interpret the meaning of the question, and give their answer within a highly structured environment. Certainly this was true for the SDR in 2006. It may be possible, for example, that survey respondents assumed that they should only indicate \"yes\" for a particular type of collaborative activity if there had been a tangible and successful outcome from the collaborative activity that could be shown as hard evidence of productive collaboration. Such tangible outcomes could include co-authored publications or successful grant applications, to name a couple. Indeed, in talking with faculty members, these more tangible outcomes and faculty members' perceptions of their importance with regard to such professional objectives as promotion and / or tenure, were cited regularly as sources of stress and tension among interviewees. This finding corresponds well with the literature on promotion and tenure that suggests faculty members feel a great deal of pressure when going up for tenure and/or promotion due to the need to demonstrate research productivity (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). Since we do not know how people interpreted the questions on the SDR, we cannot be certain as to what the frequencies of the four different collaborative activity types represent, nor can we truly understand why there might be statistically significant variation across the different subpopulations. For semi-structured interviews, however, the interviewee and interviewer are engaged with one another and able to develop a mutually derived understanding of the questions being asked (Marginson, 2009). In the present study, this opportunity to interact led into rich discussions regarding the forms of collaborative research and called for an expansion of the definition of collaboration itself. Collaborative teaching, for example, was articulated as a form of collaboration that had powerful impacts on faculty members' thinking, perspectives, and research, but yielded little in the way of research products that could be easily identified as collaborative. The informal hallway conversations with departmental colleagues, discussions with colleagues from other disciplines at center-hosted workshops, and logistical support from international partners at a far-off field site were all considered examples of collaborative engagement that didn't necessarily lead to co-authored publications or successful joint grant proposals. In short, it became overwhelmingly clear over the course of the many hours of discussion that faculty members' collaborative activities lead to both tangible and intangible outcomes. Several respondents did indeed speak of co-authored grant applications that had turned into successful collaborations, co-authored publications, and co-presentations at professional conferences. This suggests an orientation toward collaborative activities that develop into high yield / high impact outcomes such as co-authored articles. This makes sense in light of literature that suggests that the fastest growing type of authorship structure consists of multi-institutional collaborations (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008), that collaborative research is more productive (Balog, 1979/80;Beaver & Rosen, 1978;Beaver & Rosen, 1979a;Beaver & Rosen, 1979b;Jones, 2010;Hodder, 1979/80;Katz & Martin, 1997;Lawani, 1986;Pao, 1980;Pao, 1981;Pravdic & Oluic-Vukovic, 1986;Price, 1963;Price, 1986;Price & Beaver, 1966), and that faculty members feel the pressure to produce research in a timely fashion in order to secure tenure and/or promotion (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). On the intangible side, however, faculty members spoke of collaborative proposals that failed to gain the funding necessary to produce the desired research, false or missing attribution of contributions on published articles, intellectual and logistical exchange with trusted colleagues, as well as the informal and formal sharing of knowledge and human capital through the elaborate scientific networks that faculty members develop. While the intangible outcomes were no less significant in faculty members' research lives, they may represent a collection of activities, connections, and involvements that were not elicited by the collaboration questions on the SDR. Importantly, none of the faculty members interviewed started their discussions on the type of collaborations that they had engaged in by talking about failed collaborations or collaborations that had led to intangible outcomes. Those collaborations that had manifested themselves in more tangible results (team-taught courses, coauthored papers, conference panel participation, co-edited volumes, et cetera) were the first to come to mind. What became clear over the course of the interviews, however, was that faculty members from the university were highly engaged with their colleagues in the performance of their research and that engagement included, but extended far beyond the department and into knowledge hubs across the world. This finding certainly supports, at least in part, the \"death of distance\" concept in which researchers are able to use technological advances in communication to bridge the physical distance between them and their collaborators (Jones, Wuchty & Uzzi, 2008). Overall, collaboration cannot be understood in the context of these interviews as simply a series of individual acts of engaging others in an effort to meet a particular project's end. Collaboration was much more organic and represented a way of life for the researchers interviewed. As such, any and all colleagues could be engaged at multiple points."}, {"section_title": "Data-Driven Predictive Factors for Collaboration", "text": "Turning again to the quantitative stage of analysis and the final quantitative research question on the predictive factors related to different forms of collaboration, logistic regression models were built for each collaborative form. As reported in Chapter 4 and summarized in Table 4.15, field of study was the single best predictive factor related to collaboration, especially with regard to collaboration at the team and intra-institutional levels. For these two forms of collaboration, the odds of engaging in this kind of work were significantly higher for those in the life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences than for their colleagues in the social sciences. Only the odds of engaging in intra-institutional collaboration for those in the physical sciences were statistically the same for those in the social sciences. As might be predicted from the descriptive statistics that were reported, a faculty member's international status significantly increased the odds of collaboration at the international level. However, international status did not increase the odds of collaborating at the inter-institutional level, despite the fact that the descriptive statistics indicated a higher frequency of collaboration of this type among the early-career international faculty members surveyed as compared to their U.S. citizen peers. Furthermore, neither gender nor postdoctoral research history significantly increased the odds of collaborating at the team, intra-institutional, interinstitutional, or international levels. While tenure status only proved a significant predictive factor on the international collaboration dimension, possibly because of the pressure associate professors experience to earn promotion to full professor in the post-tenure phase of their careers, as age and time since degree increased so too did the odds of collaborating at the team level. Faculty members were 9.3% more likely to collaborate at the team level with each additional year post-Ph.D. completion, and 1.9% more likely with each additional year of age. It is interesting to note that age was not as strong a predictive factor as years since earning the doctorate. This suggests that experience postcompletion of the Ph.D. was more important in predicting collaborative behavior at the team level than a person's life age. In other words, getting older is not so much a predictor of collaboration habits, as much as gaining research experience after the acquisition of a high level of field-relevant human capital. This speaks to the notion of collaboration as a skill developed over time, rather than as an innate quality or set of abilities. Just as researchers have been shown to be more experimentally innovative over time and with experience (Weinberg & Galenson, 2005), respondents seem to develop more team collaborations with time and experience. When examining the SDR data by Carnegie classification, it became clear that institutional type also played a major predictive role, especially with regard to team-level, interinstitutional, and international collaboration. Carnegie type was not a significant predictor of intra-institutional collaboration, most likely because this type of collaboration was already so highly engaged in across the different subpopulations. For team-level collaboration, however, those attending Research I, Research II, Doctorate Granting II, Comprehensive I, and Medical schools had significantly higher odds of collaborating than their peers at other institutional types. At the inter-institutional level, the odds of collaborating were higher for those working at Research I, Research II, or Doctorate Granting II institutions. On the international dimension, those at Comprehensive I institutions, as well as at Liberal Arts II institutions had higher odds of collaborating. Taken together, these results suggest that different forms of collaboration are encouraged and supported differently across institutional types. They may also suggest that collaborative engagement in the performance of research may relate to the emphasis individual faculty members place on teaching, research, and service respectively within their careers. Team level collaboration was predicted by the greatest number of institutional type variables, followed by inter-institutional forms of collaboration. In other words, where you work, does make a difference on the less prevalent forms of collaboration."}, {"section_title": "Interviewees' Preparation for, Motivations behind, and Mechanisms for Establishing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Collaborative Networks", "text": "The results of the qualitative interviews suggest a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of collaborative research and what those drivers are affecting is called for than might be derived from the results using SDR data. Moving into the second qualitative question regarding the mechanisms employed in the development of collaborative networks, how those networks are maintained, and why collaborations are pursued in the first place, if field, citizenship status, age, time since the doctorate, and institutional type were significant factors related to faculty members' collaborative behavior on the SDR, some degree of variation among the faculty members interviewed would be expected based on their own fields, background characteristics, and time since receiving their doctorates. As interviews were only conducted at a Research I institution, the role of institutional type could not be cross-examined in this study. Even without the ability to examine variation by institutional type, however, no variation was found related to the other background characteristics examined in the quantitative data. Every single faculty member collaborated at the team and inter-institutional levels, and all but one faculty member collaborated on the other two dimensions under study. Part of this divergence from what was expected may be explained by the fact that the faculty members spoken with had long histories with collaborative research and truly saw collaboration in its many forms as a way of life. Interviews brought to light the fact that engagement in collaborative research had started well before faculty members' university careers had begun, and even prior to their time as postdoctoral researchers. Ranging from middle school to graduate school, with the majority of interviewees (11 of the 20) having had their first collaborative experience in graduate school, those interviewed unanimously recalled these early experiences and saw them as part of their developmental history and engagement in collaborative research. While we do not know what happens to students who do not gain these early formative experiences in collaboration (they may choose not to pursue faculty careers, for example), we do know that all faculty members interviewed had these experiences prior to beginning their faculty careers and for those who had postdoctoral research experiences, their collaborative work had begun prior to that period as well. The divergence in collaboration patterns between the SDR respondents and the interview informants may also be in part due to the fact that the interviews were all conducted at a single Research I institution. As institutional type, and the Research I type in particular, has been shown to be a powerful predictor of the forms of collaboration, with the exception of the most subscribed to form of collaboration (intra-institutional), it makes sense that the faculty members interviewed at a Research I institution would have greater odds of collaborating at the different levels examined in the study. Intra-institutional collaboration has been shown to be the most prevalent form of collaboration by the SDR data, and for team collaboration and interinstitutional collaboration alike, respondents from Research I institutions had the highest predicted odds of collaborating at these levels, as compared to any other institutional type. In other words, interviews were conducted at an institutional type with the highest likelihood of collaborative activity across all levels but the international dimension. We also know from the interviews that regardless of their motivation to engage in collaborative research, the establishment and maintenance of research connections was a major priority for the faculty members spoken with. From acquiring competitive external funding or earning tenure and/or a promotion, to the learning of new things and engaging in projects that capitalize upon and synthesize the experience and depth of knowledge of multiple scientists, faculty members self-reported a highly complex and multilayered set of efforts to engage and maintain that engagement with the local, national, and global research community. This supports the assertions of agencies and researchers alike that the nature of scientific research has become more complex and simply demands collaborative work (Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;NSF, 2011;Ribes & Bowker, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "The Development of Collaboration Skills", "text": "The realization that interviewees' collaborative experiences had begun long before their faculty careers had started or before pursuing a postdoctoral research experience made it difficult to answer the third qualitative research question directly regarding the relative importance of various developmental and training experiences in faculty members' lives. While respondents clearly felt that they gained important skills and insights related to collaboration from their undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early-faculty careers, interviewees were unable to rank order or prioritize these experiences. Instead, most informants compared and contrasted their multiple experiences collectively and talked about the novel insights they had gained from and choices they had made as a result of the system [emphasis] of experiences as a whole. This suggests that there is not a particular sequence of training experiences or set of characteristics related to those experiences that must be engaged in, in order to develop collaborative habits in the conduct of research. Indeed, even those who had not had a postdoctoral experience reported engaging in all forms of collaboration, as did those who had highly isolated research experiences as graduate students or postdoctoral scholars."}, {"section_title": "Collaboration Differences by Citizenship", "text": "Network development in particular was seen as hugely important to faculty members regardless of their citizenship background. The awareness of and focus on network building supported the use of social network theory and the strength of weak ties hypothesis to frame this study (Burt, 1992;Eddy, 2010;Granovetter, 1973;Granovetter, 1983). Whether it was attending conferences, attending agency-or university-sponsored workshops, making use of known colleagues' more distant connections, or simply following up directly with those publishing cutting edge research in scientific journals, the establishment of human connections was seen as fundamental to research and these mechanisms were reportedly actively being employed by the faculty members interviewed. Nearly every single faculty member interviewed spoke of the necessity of collaborating with others on multiple levels in an era of such complexity and specialization. To push knowledge forward and address the research questions at hand, working with others was seen as essential. What was not borne out in the interviews, however, was the sense that the modern technological era had led to a complete death of distance in which people's proximity to each other no longer mattered. While it is true that all faculty members reported engaging in all four forms of collaborative activity, it is also true that to a person, interviewees spoke of the importance of building connections in person. While technologies such as email and video conferencing were seen as fundamental to maintaining [emphasis] contact with collaborators, opportunities to meet people in person at conferences, to serve on panels together, to attend workshops together, to work out logistical details at a research site together, to teach together and learn from each other over the course of a semester, were seen as essential and powerful drivers of ongoing collaborative activity. Several interviewees spoke of how important it is to argue with colleagues and to engage in less directed back and forth conversations where knowledge is shared not for a particular project goal or to accomplish a particular task, but to explore ideas more organically and light upon new and unanticipated concepts that would be interesting to explore together. The unstructured nature of in-person conversation was seen as invaluable to the development of new ideas, whereas technology provided the means to have more structured and regular follow-up meetings to work through project-specific issues. All of this suggests that knowledge hubs continue to persist and that information access is still restricted to those who have the financial, travel, and technological resources at their disposal (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi 2008). In light of the importance respondents placed on in-person connection making and support for the existence of defined knowledge hubs, it might be presumed that international faculty members, by nature of having more frequent opportunities or reasons to go abroad to visit family, friends, and colleagues, would be more likely to collaborate internationally. Indeed this was part of the rationale for the last qualitative research question regarding citizenship status and interviewees' perceptions of how that status either enhances or hinders the development of their collaborative partnerships. Significant differences by citizenship in the quantitative data suggested that status does in fact impact collaboration differently according to the type of collaborative activity under consideration. While it was made clear in several interviews with international faculty members that they do in fact have stronger ties with colleagues from their home countries and regions and often extend personal visits to enable them to connect with those colleagues, it was also clear that international conferences, whether based in the U.S. or abroad, were the levelers of the playing field. By attracting scholars from different knowledge hubs around the world, conferences, just as centers were shown to do on the campus level, served to build bridges between colleagues, irrespective of the location of their careers. This evidence suggests that while the strength of weak ties hypothesis remains incredibly relevant to collaboration, strong ties and weak ties are not necessarily geospatially defined, but rather defined by the quality and depth of the research partnerships themselves. Further emphasizing social network theory's strength of weak ties concept and its relevance to collaborative research (Eddy, 2010), conferences were also articulated as a means for colleagues to introduce each other, identify talent to recruit to doctoral programs and labs, and learn about the activities of others. Sometimes the connections were direct between conference attendees. At other times, however, a poster presenter, a questioner at a session, or a panelist would peak the interest of an attendee and help that colleague forge a new connection with colleagues not at the conference. In this sense, conferences themselves reportedly served the dual purpose of helping faculty members maintain their strong ties, irrespective of their primary geographical location, while placing them in positions to expand their scientific networks into new areas through the establishment of weak ties that may later develop into stronger connections."}, {"section_title": "Implications of the Research Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Implications for Research", "text": "While the limited SDR data on collaboration seem poorly suited for examining social network theory and its strength of weak ties hypothesis due its complex and highly interpersonal nature, the qualitative results lent themselves well to such an exploration. Social network theory in general, and Granovetter's weak ties hypothesis in particular, were originally postulated to explain how individuals find jobs (Burt, 1992;Granovetter, 1973;Granovetter, 1983). The concept claims that people who have a diverse array of weak interpersonal connections with people are more likely to hear about distant job opportunities than those who have a very close but much smaller collection of interpersonal connections. In other words, you are more likely to hear about a job outside your circle of immediate friends if your friends in turn are tied into a broader (and different) group of social networks themselves. Results from the interviews conducted in this study support the work of other researchers who advocate for the extension of this theory to explain the processes involved in collaborative research (Eddy, 2010). Collegial networks figured prominently across the interviews. Most obviously, perhaps, people spoke of their networking efforts when participating in academic conferences or workshops. As mentioned previously, attendance at such venues resulted in opportunities to meet new people through introductions made by colleagues. Interviewees also reported using conferences to meet prospective graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or even future colleagues on the faculty. All of these are examples of the strength of weak ties concept in action. Beyond conferences, however, interviewees described a broad and complex set of networks and opportunities used to expand their collaborative networks. For example, more senior departmental colleagues reportedly served to introduce their junior colleagues to researchers outside of the academic department. University centers also served to bring people from disparate research areas together for interdisciplinary discussions on a theme of mutual interest. Furthermore, project-related colleague referrals on campus served to bring people together through their mutual connection with a single colleague. Similarly, international field research often benefitted from the strength of weak ties between colleagues, rather than from the direct connections established through international travel or experiences. As reported, a physical scientist conducting field research in Indonesia connected his U.S. colleague with his research partners abroad. This led to several successful research projects, grant opportunities, and eventually to a funded project involving everyone together. While some connections were made quite deliberately to serve a particular researcher's or project's needs, many other connections were more serendipitous, resulting in unanticipated but highly rewarding projects. The researcher describing a multi-national interdisciplinary project involving the creation of memories in mice through the shining of light on their brains is a perfect example. His participation in this research project was facilitated by a third-party researcher who had the idea to bring three complex and completely different research areas together to address a novel research problem that none of the researchers could have developed on their own or addressed independently. It was the third party's knowledge of their independent research areas (strong independent ties with each researcher) and his ability to connect them with each other (establish weak ties that could develop into strong linkages) and integrate their work in novel ways that made the project so successful. The organic picture of collaborative relationships that emerged from the interviews and the ongoing nature of faculty members' development as skilled collaborators, support the assertions of researchers who tie research collaboration processes to the strength of weak ties hypothesis (Eddy, 2010). This validates using this particular theoretical frame in future research that examines collaborative processes. What emerges that is new from this study, however, is the notion that collaboration is not the result of a series of discrete and sequential processes or developmental experiences, but has become infused in a systemic way throughout the research experience. Those interviewed derived different lessons on collaboration from their training and ongoing work as independent researchers. Negative collaborative experiences ironically created incentives to collaborate with others to learn new skills that would make them even more independent in the future. Positive collaborative experiences often led in unexpected ways to new collaborations through new ties. Even richly independent activity, such as presenting a paper at a conference, served as a mechanism for increasing collegial awareness of other's research so that unanticipated collaborative initiatives could be pursued. Taken together, these results serve to emphasize the assertions of scholars and institutions alike, that the future of research will be interdisciplinary, data-intensive, and collaborative, with collaboration playing an increasingly important role in scientific circles (Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;NSF, 2011;Ribes & Bowker, 2011). For research on collaboration itself, these findings have significant implications as they suggest that collaboration must be examined from a more systemic perspective since it involves complex networks and processes that connect researchers with others in the research community in myriad ways and with stunning and unanticipated results. Finally, the findings of this research bring into focus a characteristic of the strength of weak ties hypothesis that is seldom highlighted. It is easy to think of the strength of weak ties as a static set of processes where strong relationships with certain people create opportunities for loose coupling with those outside a researcher's immediate collegial network. However, as several of the personal narratives make clear, the nature of the ties between people also become transformed over time. Weak ties established through strong ties often become strong ties in and of themselves and enable researchers to network more broadly than ever before across knowledge hubs. With information technologies and social networking tools enhancing our ability to connect with others and foster those ties further, we are no longer confined to a geospatially defined knowledge network, but part of a network that is defined by the research questions that we ask and the tools and knowledge needed to arrive at the answers."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice", "text": "With regard to practice, this study has numerous implications. Kezar and Lester (2009), as well as Eddy (2010) make the case that facilitating collaborative research must be an intentional and deliberate effort that is informed by knowledge of the processes behind how collaboration works. The results reported here lend support to those notions, emphasizing the complexities involved in collaborative research, and the powerful impact our institutions have in either facilitating or inhibiting collaboration. What this study emphasizes even more, however, is how enormously influential institutions of higher education and granting agencies are in this process. Institutions of Higher Education. The results that have been reported emphasize that collaborative experiences can and do occur at multiple points in a person's development as a researcher. From the undergraduate years to graduate school, the postdoctoral research experience and beyond, interviewees expressed how important their collective experiences had been and continue to be to their formation as collaborative researchers. While it is clear that not a single faculty member interviewed lacked an early collaborative research experience, what is less clear is how these experiences individually or cumulatively affect researchers' future collaborative efforts. First of all, since all interviewees reported engagement in highly active collaborative research careers, it is impossible to say from this study that certain types of collaborative experiences are less useful than others, or that having collaborative experiences earlier are more beneficial. Supporting prior research (Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;NSF, 2011;Ribes & Bowker, 2011), collaboration in the present study was seen by most as a scientific necessity and neither negative previous collaborative experiences nor readily acknowledged barriers such as the added time, expense, or loss of control involved in research collaboration changed the fact that every single faculty member, save one, reported collaborating on all four levels. What is clear in this study, however, is that exposure to collaborative activity is important and can lead to new connections and new collaborations (Eddy, 2010). It also became clear over the course of the interviews that understanding the value of collaboration and having the opportunity to engage in collaborative research helps faculty members develop new interests and maintain a sense of excitement regarding their careers. Furthermore, collaboration introduced faculty members to new concepts and ideas, often provided them with focus in their research, and enabled them to accomplish research goals that would have been impossible otherwise. Such activity, in the minds of those interviewed, facilitated their branching out from disciplinary silos and enabled them to capitalize upon the knowledge of others while bringing their own perspectives and expertise to the table. Collaboration was seen as a major mechanism for overcoming these widely perceived barriers (Howard, 2011). In recognizing the value of research collaborations, institutions have a number of opportunities to instill collaborative skills and facilitate their use among students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty members alike. For students, collaborating with peers and mentors were important learning experiences that interviewees claimed helped them learn how to collaborate, when to collaborate, and why to collaborate. Jointly authoring scholarly papers as students, helping a faculty member with field research abroad, or learning how to take the results of bench work and turn them into grant proposals and academic papers were invaluable with regard to learning the value of working with others. These student experiences should be supported and encouraged by colleges and universities. As a training ground for researchers and producers of cutting edge research, colleges and universities do not have the luxury of assuming that the people starting their studies or careers at their institutions have received a strong or uniform background in how to engage in collaborative research. This came up in several interviews, with faculty members feeling underprepared for their collaborative roles, despite (and sometime because of) their training and previous collaborative experiences. Some reported that their Ph.D. advisors had shunned collaborative research. Some reported that in pursuing their doctorate they had no chance to work with others and were trained to be self-sufficient in their research efforts. Others spoke of the cultural and linguistic barriers that made collaboration less comfortable or of the gender biases that affect their underlying collegial relationships. Still others spoke of their motivations for pursuing postdoctoral research opportunities as stemming from negative collaborative experiences and their desire to become more self-sufficient in their research careers through the acquisition of new skills. Taken together, these lessons from interviewees speak to the importance of providing students, postdoctoral researchers, and new faculty members with the support, incentives, and opportunities that they need to engage in collaborative activities. From involving students in collaborative projects with peers and faculty members, to enabling postdoctoral researchers to float between labs and attend conferences in order to pull together disparate areas of activity toward the successful completion of a project or the development of a new collaborative project, these experiences can help individuals hone their collaboration skills, develop coping mechanisms for the difficulties that they will inevitably encounter, and help them establish a realistic set of expectations with regard to the potential and limitations associated with collaborative research. For faculty members in particular, comments from interviewees reinforce the power of campus centers to facilitate networking and the creation of new interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborations. Their comments also spoke to the critical role that conference attendance plays in faculty members' lives with regard to establishing new and maintaining existing collaborations. Post-secondary institutions wishing to promote collaborative research among their faculty members could go a long way toward achieving this goal by supporting and expanding the presence of research centers on campus and by providing faculty members with the flexibility and financial support that they need to attend scientific gatherings. Finally, for assistant professors and associate professors alike, the tenure and promotion processes were seen as fundamentally related to research collaboration. Mixed messages were received at the departmental, school, and university levels regarding the value of research collaboration. These mixed messages may be at least partially responsible for the stress that other researchers have found faculty members experience in their collaborative endeavors (Eddy, 2010). The emphasis on sole-authored publications was seen as a major inhibitor with regard to collaborative research as well, and in some cases led faculty members to appropriate recognition for the collaborative work of their own research teams. While the nature of scientific research today, the funding environment, and faculty members' own drive to produce novel and ground-breaking research provide the impetus for engaging in collaborative research, unclear messages, the active practice of discouraging research with others, and a lack of logistical and financial support needed to engage in collaborative research hinder it. Furthermore, strict tenure and promotion guidelines and timeframes inhibit participation in large complex collaborations in which outcomes are uncertain, individual contributions are hard to articulate, and the timing of outcomes relate to many variables beyond the control of the faculty members going up for tenure or promotion in the future. It is understandable that faculty members would steer clear of activities that would contribute to the stress of promotion and/or tenure or hinder their chances of success through delayed research productivity since such productivity, especially with regard to research, has been shown to be key in the tenure and promotion process (Greenbank, 2006;Greene et al., 2008;Gubitosi, 1996;Terpstra & Honoree, 2009;Zabriskie, Dey & Riegle, 2002). Barriers to collaboration must be examined by institutions, mechanisms must be established that facilitate engagement in collaborative research, and the message must be communicated to schools, departments, and faculty members across the institution that collaborative research is an important and respected component of a researcher's portfolio. The Importance of a Diverse Faculty. This study reinforced how important it is to institutions of higher education to have a diverse faculty. This has implications for the institutions themselves, as well as for national immigration policy and the agencies that support higher education's research efforts. Among the international faculty members interviewed, it became clear that they have a distinct advantage when it comes to collaboration with colleagues in their home country and regions. Personal connections and personally motivated travel provide cost-effective opportunities to maintain and establish new connections with colleagues abroad. Their facility with local languages and cultures also provide them with ideal opportunities to collaborate with scholars who are incredibly skilled, but who do not speak English or understand U.S. institutions of higher education or their unique academic culture. Advantages aside, however, international faculty also have unique disadvantages when it comes to collaborative research. Language issues related to English proficiency, publication bias against international authors, and cultural background can inhibit communication in collaborative initiatives and delay the outcomes of the research. By teaming up international faculty members with their U.S. colleagues, however, the research not only benefits from differing expertise and knowledge, but the U.S. faculty members' language facility and cultural familiarity can enhance access to colleagues within the institution, with other institutions inside the U.S., and at professional conferences within the U.S. context. The international partner on the other hand, brings his or her ties to bear in the research at hand. In short, by fostering diversity within the faculty, institutions are able to leverage the existing networks that each faculty member brings to the table. The more diverse the faculty is, the more unique weak ties there are likely to be. The Power of Granting Agencies. It was also made abundantly clear in the interviews that granting agencies have enormous power in terms of facilitating or inhibiting collaborative research. Several faculty members spoke of their efforts to find collaborators in order to gain external funding for a project. These same interviewees, however, spoke of the difficulty they had in finding research collaborators due to conflicting incentives on the institutional side that emphasize the traditional lone-wolf approach to research. In order for granting agencies to successfully encourage collaborative research, they may need to develop partnerships with the institutions themselves that go beyond the work of individual researchers. Such partnerships may involve the development of policies at the university level that give extra weight in promotion and tenure review to successful research projects that are both collaborative and supported by external funding. Just as overhead rates for facility use and maintenance, as well as cost share rates are negotiated in advance between many federal agencies and research institutions, similar mutual expectations and commitments with regard to institutional support for collaborative research could be established in advance. For example, universities might establish programs designed to help their faculty members become more competitive at a national funding level by providing the seed funding researchers need to build their research networks, develop collaborative projects, and engage in the pilot efforts needed to establish project feasibility. Beyond the conflict between the academy's emphasis on independently produced research and funders' emphasis on collaborative scholarship, granting agencies were found to engage in a number of practices that inhibit research collaboration. The limited time window, for example, was cited by several faculty members as limiting the extent to which researchers engaged each other in the performance of research on a funded project. In one example, the grant period was so short that the researchers simply had to split tasks up and work on the components independently to complete the project on time. As a result, the researchers never really worked together, despite the fact that they shared funding for the project from a single agency. Such evidence suggests that agencies should reconsider the grant periods that they have established for grants and take a particular project's needs and expectations into account, rather than a particular funding cycle that cannot take the actual research or the nature of the problem (or the steps needed to address the problem) into consideration. It may also be necessary to implement more flexible funding time periods to accommodate unanticipated barriers and delays related to collaborative research. Because of strict time constraints, several faculty members reported being unable to adapt to new challenges posed by the research. A great deal of anxiety was associated with this and faculty members feared the longer-term funding and career consequences of not being able to successfully complete a project prior to a grant's end date. In a related fashion, several faculty members spoke of the difficulty they had experienced on multinational collaborative projects where multiple funding sources with different time frames were also involved. Because of a lack of coordination between agencies, the production and reporting time frame for one group of researchers could be very different than that for a team working on a complementary area of research related to the project. For projects that require a particular sequencing of activities or efforts, this can create many problems, especially if the funding period for the last stage of the research is shorter than the period of the earlier stages of the research. By maintaining more flexible time periods that can accommodate the realities of the research and the unique constraints posed by other agencies also supporting the research, agencies would be able to enhance access to their funding sources and select projects more on the basis of merit rather than on the timing feasibility. Finally, several faculty members spoke of the risk-averse nature of agencies, virtually requiring researchers to have done the project and proven its feasibility before they will consider the provision of funding. This puts researchers in a difficult position and hampers the pursuit of novel and innovate collaborate projects that are truly exploratory in nature. Granting agencies might consider the development of more diverse funding options in their portfolios so that seed funding is available to assess the feasibility of new and unproven projects. These small grants might include provisions that allow for competitive access to larger grants if the pilot phase of the research proves successful. Overall, faculty members' perceptions of the agencies supporting innovative collaborative research are that they are too rigid and rely too heavily on more traditional models of independently produced research. By creating new funding opportunities, engaging with universities directly, and becoming more flexible in terms of the timing and reporting expectations, agencies could use their funding to enhance the prevalence of collaborative scholarship and push the boundaries of science."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations and Directions for Future Research", "text": "In addition to the methodological limitations articulated in Chapter 3, this study had several more general limitations that lead to important areas that would benefit from future research. A primary limitation of this study was the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients itself. While this survey asked respondents to indicate whether or not they collaborated at each of the four levels of collaboration studied, these were the only collaboration-specific questions on the SDR. This necessarily limits our understanding of collaboration and how we can interpret the data that are there. Frequency data and an exploration of how well survey-reported factors predict different forms of collaboration do not help us understand how respondents define collaboration. Furthermore, the predictive factors that were examined could only include variables from a survey whose main purpose was only tangentially related to collaboration at best. Due to the nature of scientific research today (Howard, 2011;NSF, 2011), interview data that suggest faculty members are nearly all collaborating on all four levels studied, and the importance of the role of collaborative research engagement to scientific research production and the acquisition of external funding (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009), a national longitudinal study examining patterns of, motivations for, and outcomes of collaborative research is called for. Such a survey could provide us with a better understanding of when people are collaborating, who they are collaborating with at different levels, how much they are collaborating, the cumulative effects of collaboration over time, and how collaboration affects their efforts to obtain financial support for their research. Another area of future study would be to examine how early collaboration experiences affect respondents' career decisions. As was previously discussed, all faculty members interviewed reported having a collaborative research experience prior to beginning their postdoctoral research positions or faculty careers. What we do not know from this is how the absence of such early experiences with collaboration affects later career decisions. It is possible, for example, that without collaborative research experiences at the undergraduate or graduate level, students are less likely to pursue faculty or other scientific research careers in the future. Neither phase of this study was able to examine this question since both phases looked only at early-career faculty members. Finally, for the qualitative phase of this research, faculty members from only one institution were interviewed. While it is difficult and rarely advisable to generalize results from qualitative research involving such limited sample sizes, by extending the interviews to more institutions and to different institutional types, a more rigorous examination of the results would be possible. For the present study, for example, it is impossible to rule out the impact of a unique institutional culture, set of policies, or precedents on faculty members' collaboration practices. Results from the quantitative phase of the study suggest that institutional type has significant predictive power as it relates to collaborative engagement. Procedures related to tenure and promotion, for example, may be unique to the institution and affect faculty members in unique ways. Similarly, an institution's broader reputation in the academy and its ability to attract talent and resources may affect the collaborative opportunities of its faculty. By including more institutions, it may be possible to examine the roles of different policy choices, educational approaches, criteria for promotion and tenure, and resource allocation strategies in promoting a culture of scientific collaboration."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Thoughts", "text": "This study has examined collaboration among early-career faculty members from the perspective of national data, as well as from the perspective of individual faculty members at a single public university. The results of the two phases of the study support those who argue that collaboration is rapidly growing in its importance in the lives of today's researchers (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009;Koschmann, Lewis, & Isbell, 2011;NSF, 2011;Ribes & Bowker, 2011). As local, national, and global knowledge hubs continue to exist, scientific expertise and knowledge continue to deepen and expand, and the sharing of knowledge across all types of institutional and political boundaries becomes increasing essential to researchers striving to produce responsible, informed, and ground-breaking research, we simply must know more about how we can act to train and enable scientists to become effective and successful collaborative researchers (Eddy, 2010;Kezar & Lester, 2009). The training of researchers to be effective collaborators, and the incentives and support mechanisms needed to maintain collaborative engagement require an informed and multifaceted approach (Kezar & Lester, 2009). The responsibility for enacting this approach must be broadly shared. Institutions of higher education, for their part, must work to ensure that undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty members alike receive the training, mentoring, resources, and opportunities to pursue research collaborations. Graduation requirements, postdoctoral researcher performance expectations, as well as expectations for the promotion and tenure of faculty members could be better aligned to emphasize and support collaborative practice. Agencies on the other hand, must develop the programs, policies, practices, and lines of communication needed to foster and further enable innovative collaborations, rather than hinder them. As the funders of much of the research occurring at institutions of higher education, agencies should partner more with universities to develop a set of more synergistic and complementary programs that enhance the power and potential of collaborative research. It is hoped that this dissertation serves as a motivator to institutions of higher education and agencies supporting higher education research to develop the mechanisms needed to achieve these important ends. Finally, this study provides strong support for the use of social network theory's strength of weak ties hypothesis in developing our understanding of how collaborative processes work and are maintained. Developing this understanding is increasingly critical as our knowledge base deepens, our research communities expand and become more diverse, and our research questions become more complex. Collegial networks, both physical and virtual are the key to bringing in information from pertinent knowledge hubs and applying it in innovative ways to the questions that attract our imagination."}]
