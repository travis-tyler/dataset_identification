It has become increasingly important to find novel, immunological biomarkers that can track AD development and progression. When exploring biomarkers, neuroinflammation may be a useful process to examine, as it is an early and continuous feature of AD (Hensley, 2010) that underlies neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits (Dursun et al., 2015) .\nIt is now known that neurotoxic inflammatory mechanisms may initiate AD pathogenesis (Akiyama et al., 2000) . Neuroinflammation, on the cellular subunit level, occurs through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), Interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), primarily from microglia as well as astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (BECs), and neurons themselves (Akiyama et al., 2000; Guillot-Sestier and Town, 2013; Lee et al., 2008; Tai et al., 2015) , all of which are potential immunological AD biomarkers. Levels of these cytokines and downstream effectors are higher in the AD brain (Griffin et al., 1989) and may mediate neural atrophy over time (Lee et al., 2008) .\nHowever, while the classic pro-inflammatory cytokines do potentiate brain atrophy, they are not necessarily ideal AD Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.
