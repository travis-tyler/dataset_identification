[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: As a growing number of older adults are using social networking technologies, understanding the uses and activities associated with it are critical for designing interventions to maintain social connectedness and promote healthy aging. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics and perceptions of rural older adult social network site (SNS) users and nonusers, and the relationship between them in regards to social connectedness. Methods: A convenience sample of 350 rural older adults age 65 years and older in Southeast Idaho rural counties participated in this quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire including a demographic survey, the Social Networking Site survey, and the Social Connectedness Scale -Revised. Quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics and correlational and hierarchal regression. Results: Controlling for demographics, social connectedness was not an indicator of SNS use. Rural older adults who had home Internet, felt comfortable using the Internet, and viewed SNSs as important were more likely to use SNSs. Younger-old adults, married, with college education and/or higher income, were more likely to be SNS users. Lack of interest and lack of access and knowledge about SNSs were the main reasons nonusers chose not to use SNSs. Conclusion: Overcoming negative perceptions of SNSs and having access and ability to use SNSs may increase likelihood of use, and offer an interventional strategy for social connectedness."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Adults age 65 years and older currently comprise 13% of the US population, over 35 million people, and their numbers are expected to double by the year 2030 to 72 million as baby boomers approach old age [1] . An increasing proportion (17%) reside in rural areas, and on average, have social and economic disadvantages that place them at risk for poor health outcomes [2] . These disparities combined with physical and mental decline, changes in social roles, and diminishing peer networks can limit opportunities for social engagement [3, 4] , and may lead to social isolation [5] . A growing body of evidence demonstrates a significant positive association between social interaction and health and well-being among older adults [6] , and significant adverse effects of social isolation on mortality [7] , physical inactivity [8] , depression [9] , and suicide [10] , in older adults. A majority of rural older adults experience some degree of loneliness and depression [3, 4] , and are even more likely to experience social isolation than urban older adults [11] . These considerations emphasize the need to address social factors when developing successful interventions to close the gap on health inequities [12] , and improve the quality of life for rural older adults.\nSocial connectedness, defined by the CDC as \"the degree to which a person or group is socially close, interrelated \u2026 with other persons or groups\" [13] , is an important component of the social determinants of health that are primarily responsible for producing health differences among social groups [12] . Membership in social networks can provide vital opportunities for social engagement, and are important determinants of how older adults perceive their health; the more socially connected, the higher the perceptions of social, physical, and mental health and quality of life [11, 14] . The wide-spread use of social networking technologies such as Facebook provide an innovative tool that can overcome rural older adult barriers, and meet the need for social connectivity of this growing population.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, one third (35%) of older adults age 65 and older are using social media, compared with 2% in 2005 [15] . More than half (56%) prefer Facebook, the most popular social media site online [16] , primarily to stay in touch with family [17] . Previous studies have shown that age is a significant factor in social networking site (SNS) use. Age was negatively correlated with SNS use and online network size [18] , and the older the adult, the less likely to have computer access and confidence using information technologies, and the less likely they are to access SNSs [19] . Intrinsic motivations such as positive attitudes and personalities, perceived benefits of physical and emotional independence, and the perceived value and satisfaction with the activity, also influenced SNS use [20] . The mixed age group and lack of representation of older adults in the studies, however, has made it difficult to generalize findings and improve our understanding of the role SNSs can play in rural healthy aging [17] . Studies of older populations have included people age 50 as older adults, assuming they have the same usage and motivations as older adults. Research has demonstrated different ages have different motivations and patterns of usage [21] , an important consideration for tailoring future interventions.\nA variety of indicators have been used to measure social connectedness, with mixed results. Social network use has been associated with higher levels of social role satisfaction [18] and improved aspects of everyday life [22] , and has been shown to augment, rather than replace, traditional communication among older adults [19] . Although significant differences in perceived loneliness between users and nonusers has not been found, higher frequencies of Facebook communication was significantly associated with less loneliness among active users [18] . These findings suggest that social networking technologies have the potential to maintain and improve the social health of rural older adults, yet little is known about social networking use in this population. There is a scarcity of research focusing specifically on understanding the role of SNS use and social connectedness among older adults, and a gap in the rural setting.\nApproximately one third of older adults are using social networking technologies [15] , but research is lacking in the uses and activities associated with it, that would enable health care practitioners to develop interventions with this application to increase social connectedness. These considerations highlight the importance of understanding the role of social networking use and the relationship with social connectedness among rural older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics and communication behaviors of rural older adult SNS users and nonusers, the relationship between age and network size, and the relationship between social networking users and nonusers and social connectedness, after controlling for the effects of age, sex, marital status, education, and income, among rural older adults."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This study was a quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study, using standard survey methods of paper and pen questionnaires for data collection.

Part 1 investigated the demographic characteristics differentiating SNS users from nonusers among rural older adults of age, sex, race, marital status, education, and income. Part 2 was a Social Network Site survey, retrieved from an online questionnaire from SurveyMonkey (n.d.)

Part 3, the Social Connectedness Scale-Revised [25] , is a 20 item, 6-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree) that measures social connectedness as a psychological sense of belonging. The 10 negatively worded items are reverse scored and added together with the 10 positive scores that characterize a feeling a sense of closeness with others, and maintaining and seeking connection. A range of scores from 20 to 120 is possible, and higher scores represent a stronger sense of social connectedness [25] . The scale has been shown to have good internal reliability with a Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient of 0.92-0.94, and appropriate convergent and discriminant validity [25] , and has demonstrated good internal and external consistency, and good construct and criterion validity, with an internal item reliability of Cronbach \u03b1 of 0.88 [26] .

Not only has it been researched in the United States, investigators from Portugal, Mexico, Canada, Britain, and other parts of the globe have also found a connection between older individuals' SNS use and the value to connect with family [17] . In this study, there was a significant relationship between social awareness and social presence variables and social connectedness. SNS users who publicly posted, and had a high frequency of SNS use, longer length of time as a member, and a high number of online social networks tended to have higher social connectedness scores, although these characteristics were not predictive of social connectedness. Whether SNS users in the study become more socially connected due to the type and frequency of communication, and size of online social networks, or SNS users who are already socially connected have different patterns of usage and larger social networks than nonusers cannot be determined.\nThe Pew Center reports that US older adult SNSs users socialize more frequently on a daily basis, compared with nonusers [21] . However, in this study, although SNS users had slightly higher average social connectedness scores than nonusers, socially connected rural older adults in the study were not more likely to use SNSs, after controlling for age, sex, race, marital status, education and income, and SNS users and nonusers in the focus group expressed feeling socially connected.\nAlthough there is a gap in research regarding social connectedness, prior studies have demonstrated the types and frequency of SNS communication have an influence on loneliness [18] , and a high frequency of directed communication was correlated with higher social role satisfaction [19] , and Facebook users were significantly more satisfied with their social roles, compared with nonusers [18, 22] . Consistent with previous studies and Pew Center statistics, SNSs were mainly used to stay in touch with family and friends, indicating a difference in motivation from younger generations who use SNSs mainly to stay in touch with friends [27] . In addition, among SNS users in the study, age was significantly negatively correlated with online social network size, as oldest-older rural adults had smaller online social networks, attributed to a variety of factors. SNSs were used mainly to connect with family and friends, and less with colleagues and social groups, to augment face-to-face communication. Prior research indicated young-old Facebook users tended to have more friends on Facebook than old-old adults, and staying connected with family was the primary reason for use [18] . This finding has implications for health care professionals tailoring interventions to the needs and motivations of this population for social connectivity.\nFurthermore, SNS users in the study had a lower mean age than nonusers, and younger-older adults with a partner, higher education, and/or higher income were more likely to use SNSs, and were significant predictors of SNS use. This is consistent with prior studies [18] , and the Pew Center, who reported youngerolder adults were significantly more likely to use SNSs [16] . Similar to this study, the Pew Center reported American older adults with a spouse or partner, college education, and higher income were more likely to be SNS users [15] , although only one other study noted significant differences in marital status, education, and income [20] . Previous studies that have been urban based may have had less variation in education and income among users and nonusers in the samples.\nAlthough there were more females than males in the study, the difference was not significant, which may be due to a reported narrowing of the gap among SNS users [15] . Some rural older adults in the study who shared a SNS with their spouse may have considered themselves nonusers if they did not have a separate profile on the SNSs, which may have contributed to the lower numbers of male use, and the questionnaire did not differentiate about sharing. The sample was (95%) Caucasian, and the pew Center statistics have found similarities of SNS use among whites, Hispanics, and African-Americans [15] , therefore, it is not surprising that race was not significantly different between SNS users and nonusers in the study. Although it has been reported that rural residents lag behind urban and suburban residents in SNS use, rural older adult SNS use was the same as US statistics for American older adults [15] . In addition, rural older adults in the study who had home computers and Internet, were comfortable using the Internet, and viewed SNSs as important and privacy policies as effective, were significantly more likely to use SNSs, compared with nonusers. Although home Internet and viewing SNSs as important were significant indicators of SNS use, feeling comfortable with the Internet was the largest predictor of likelihood of using SNSs, suggesting educational strategies that address these considerations may be an effective way to increase the likelihood of SNS use [28] .\nAmong nonusers, the primary reason for not using SNSs was lack of interest, and second, lack of computer access and knowledge about SNSs. Negative stereotypes that SNSs were complicated, time consuming, and lacked value, and privacy and security concerns, were also barriers to SNSs. This is consistent with prior studies and the Pew Research Center findings that unless older adults felt confident using technology and had positive perceptions of and valued SNSs, they were less likely to use them [19, 21] . More SNS users had home computers and access to the Internet, and felt more comfortable using the Internet compared with nonusers, demonstrating access and ability are important mediators of SNS use. However, these findings suggest perceptions of relevancy and trust in privacy policies are still important factors in positive perceptions of SNS use, and pose a significant barrier for using SNSs, even if the rural older adult has access and ability to use SNSs. Having a home computer was not predictive of SNS use, which was not surprising as SNS users also indicated that they used a smartphone and/or tablet to access SNSs. New technologies such as smartphones that are easier and more convenient to use may lower barriers and change the patterns of SNS use, and may increase the likelihood of SNSs use in this population.\nThis study has expanded the knowledge base of social determinants of health research in the context of the technological and rural environment. As the rural older adult populations rapidly increase, developing innovative interventions for social connectedness to augment limited community resources and overcome rural disparities is vitally important."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "People who participated in the study were recruited from senior centers and other public places.
