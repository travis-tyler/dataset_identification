[{"section_title": "Does postsecondary enrollment vary by when students last took Algebra I?", "text": "The earlier a student successfully completes Algebra I, the more time he or she has to take advanced math and science courses. 1 Additionally, taking advanced math courses is associated with attending a 4-year college or university (Long, Conger, and Iatarola 2012;Schneider, Swanson, and Riegle-Crumb 1997). y A higher percentage of students who last took Algebra I before grade 9 enrolled in a 4-year postsecondary institution compared to students who last took Algebra I after grade 8 (figure 1). 2 y Similarly, a higher percentage of students who last took Algebra I in grade 9 enrolled in a 4-year postsecondary institution compared to students who last took Algebra I in grades 10-12 (figure 1). y Students who last took Algebra I in grades 9 or 10 enrolled in less-than-4-year postsecondary institutions at higher rates than students who last took Algebra I before grade 9 (figure 1).

(figure 2). \u2022 Black students reported the lowest percentage of Algebra I coursetaking before grade 9 (15 percent) (figure 2). \u2022 Black and Hispanic students reported higher rates of Algebra I coursetaking in grade 9 (70 percent and 65 percent, respectively) than did White (57 percent) and Asian (41 percent) students (figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "1 The data presented in this Data Point on when a student last took Algebra I do not necessarily indicate successful completion of Algebra I. 2 Reporting standards were not met for the less than 1 percent of students who never took Algebra I. Those students have been excluded from the analyses in this Data Point. This NCES Data Point presents information about education topics of current interest. It was authored by Allison LaFave of AnLar. Estimates based on samples are subject to sampling variability, and apparent differences may not be statistically significant. All stated differences are statistically significant at the .05 level using a two-tailed Student's t test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize effects of nonsampling errors, such as item response, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error.
