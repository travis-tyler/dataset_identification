[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Adult-onset hypogonadism is a syndrome often underdiagnosed, undertreated, or incompletely explored. There are various reasons for this: firstly, undefined age range of men in whom testosterone levels should be investigated and then no definitive serum cutoff point for the diagnosis of hypogonadism; and finally, variable and non-specific signs and symptoms; men and physicians do not pay adequate attention to sexual health. All these factors make the diagnostic criteria for hypogonadism controversial. The evaluation of the clinical features and causes of this syndrome, its link with age, the role of testosterone and other hormone levels, and the presence of any comorbidities are all useful factors in the investigation of this population. The purpose of this manuscript, after an accurate analysis of current literature, is to facilitate the diagnosis of hypogonadism in men through the use of the CATCH acronym and a checklist to offer a practical diagnostic tool for daily clinical practice. A narrative review of the relevant literature regarding the diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism or adult-onset hypogonadism was performed. PubMed database was used to retrieve articles published on this topic. A useful new acronym CATCH (Clinical features [symptoms] and Causes, Age, Testosterone level, Comorbidities, and Hormones) and a practical checklist to facilitate the evaluation of hypogonadism in aging men were used. The evaluation of the clinical features and causes of hypogonadism, the link with age, the role of Testosterone and other hormones, and the evaluation of comorbidities are important in investigating adult-onset hypogonadism. The CATCH checklist could be helpful for clinicians for an early diagnosis of both hypogonadism and associated comorbidities. We suggest the use of this acronym to advocate the investigation of declining testosterone in aging men.\nAdult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) is defined as a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by a deficiency of testosterone with associated signs and symptoms and a failure of the body to produce an adequate compensatory response (Khera et al., 2016) , causing in many cases serious sexual dysfunction.\nAlgorithms to investigate hypogonadism in aging men have been proposed in various studies and guidelines of scientific societies. However, not all of these defined the age-group or range of T values required for diagnosis. Furthermore, hypogonadism needs to be checked to prevent its different effects on reproductive and sexual health, on metabolism, and on cardiovascular and bone balance (Corona et al., 2015a,b; Golds et al., 2017; Pastuszak et al., 2017) . The discrepancies, together with other features linked to clinical evidence of hypogonadism and the importance to prevent worsening of comorbidities, could lead to a definitive checklist that might be useful to fill the gap of being overlooked. To facilitate the evaluation of hypogonadism in men and a correct diagnostic evaluation, we therefore developed the acronym CATCH (Clinical features [symptoms] and Causes, Age, Testosterone level, Comorbidities, and Hormones) alongside a practical checklist to use in daily clinical practice.\nWe performed a narrative review of the relevant literature regarding the diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism or AOH. We used PubMed database to retrieve articles published on this"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "topic using the following search terms: late-onset hypogonadism, AOH, hypogonadism and/or age, and/or comorbidities, and/or clinical features, and/or diagnosis.

Finally, we carried out an examination and a comparison of the differences in study and guideline methodologies and results. No review protocol or registration number was required because it was a narrative review."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiological data", "text": "The prevalence of AOH reported in epidemiological studies varies from 2.1% to 38.7%, making the real prevalence difficult to establish Huhtaniemi & Forti, 2011; Ventimiglia et al., 2017) . These studies are not easily comparable, given the different criteria used to define hypogonadism and a lack of validated standards for defining the cutoff for different age-groups. Some authors focused only on hormone criteria. In the Hypogonadism in Males (HIM) Study (Mulligan et al., 2006) conducted on 2162 subjects aged over 45 years, Mulligan et al. found a prevalence of 38.7% with the sole criterion of low total testosterone (TT) (<10.4 nmol/L -300 mg/dL). The risk of hypogonadism increased by 17% for every 10-year increase in age, with reported prevalences of 34% in men aged [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] 40 .2% in men aged [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] 39 .9% in men aged [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] 45 .5% in men aged 75-84, and 50% in men over 85 years.\nIn another study conducted by Harman et al. [Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)], the prevalence of low-level TT was 12% in subjects aged 40-80 years, increasing to 19% in the over 60s and 49% in the over 80s (Harman et al., 2001) . Diagnosis was based on low TT (<11.3 nmol/L -<325 ng/dL) or T/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (free T index) <0.153 nmol/L. In contrast, Yeap et al. (2007) , in the Health in Men Study, found a drop in serum-free T and a rise in SHBG and luteinizing hormone (LH) with increasing age in 3645 men aged 70-89 years, while TT remained within the normal range.\nOther studies diagnosed hypogonadism on the basis of both TT and associated signs and symptoms. The criteria for diagnosis in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) conducted by Araujo et al. (2004) on 1667 subjects aged between 40 and 70 years were low TT (<6.9 nmol/L or 6.9-13.88 with free T <300 pmol/L) and \u22653 signs or symptoms (sexual signs or symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction (ED) and hypoactive sexual desire, or others, such as inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, irritability, and depression). They reported a 6% prevalence of hypogonadism. The Boston Area Community Health Survey conducted on 1475 subjects aged 30-79 years diagnosed hypogonadism on the basis of one specific symptom (e.g. ED, hypoactive sexual desire, or osteoporosis) or \u22652 non-specific symptoms (e.g. depression or sleep disturbance) and low TT (<10.4 nmol/L) with low free T (<170 pmol/L). The prevalence was 5.6% but rose with increased age, ranging from 3.1 to 7% in subjects aged below 70 years to 18.4% in those over 70 years. The European Male Aging Study-EMAS conducted by Wu et al. (2010) on 3219 subjects aged 40-79 years revealed a 2.1% prevalence of hypogonadism. This may have been lower than in other studies due to the use of \u22653 sexual symptoms (e.g. decreased erections in the morning, ED, decreased frequency of sexual thoughts) and low TT (<11 nmol/L) with free T <220 pmol/L as the criteria. The percentage of subjects with hypogonadism was 0.1%, 0.6%, 3.2%, and 5.1%, respectively in men aged 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 , and 70-79 years (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Different guidelines on AOH", "text": "The diagnostic criteria for hypogonadism are controversial, and not all the guidelines issued by the scientific societies address the issue of aging. As recently highlighted in the EMAS position statement, the symptoms of hypogonadism in aging are usually sexual (decreased libido, decreased spontaneous erections and ED) (Dimopoulou et al., 2016) Guidelines, 2018, are summarized in Table 2 ( Petak et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2009a,b; Paduch et al., 2014; Dean et al., 2015; Bhasin et al., 2018) . Screening for hypogonadism is recommended in Guidelines, EAU 2015, ISSM 2015, and Endocrine Society Clinical Practice 2018 for patients with pertinent signs and symptoms. The AUA's 2013 Guidelines focus more on the laboratory determination of TT. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines divide signs and symptoms into specific, suggestive, and non-specific aspects, while the ISSM classes them by physical function, cognitive function, and sexual function. In relation to the age at which screening should be considered, one of the most recent definitions (2015) of AOH comes from a panel of experts from the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) (Khera et al., 2016) , who describe it as a syndrome clinically distinct from classical primary and secondary hypogonadism and highlight the role of age on the onset of the disease.\nVarious disorders are commonly associated with hypogonadism, including osteoporosis (Golds et al., 2017) , type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome (MetS). To this regard, Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology recognized that all men who have an increased waist circumference or who have obesity should be assessed for hypogonadism (Garvey et al., 2016) and, when diagnosis is confirmed, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in addition to lifestyle intervention may be considered. In the presence of signs or symptoms (especially sexual symptoms) suggestive of AOH, evaluation of morning TT is indicated. TT is considered low when below 264 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/ L), as reported in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (Bhasin et al., 2018) , or the lower limit used in the reference laboratory. AOH is diagnosed on the basis of low TT and low or normal LH."}, {"section_title": "CHECKLIST FEATURES C-Clinical features (signs and symptoms) and causes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical features (signs and symptoms)", "text": "The classic signs and symptoms associated with AOH are often ignored, leading to a delay in its treatment or even a failure to treat it at all (Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010) . This may be due to the variable and non-specific characteristics of these signs and symptoms, which often present slowly Rosen et al., 2011; Bhasin et al., 2018; Buvat et al., 2013) . The most common symptoms are those related to sexual function, such as ED and reduced spontaneous erections, reduced sexual desire, delayed ejaculation (DE), and reduced semen volume (Mulligan et al., 2006) . In any case a physical examination, although not necessary for the definitive diagnosis of AOH, is essential to rule out small testicular and/or penis size, changes in testicular consistency, small prostate size, gynecomastia, and scant pubic and axillary hair (Isidori et al., 2008; Khera et al., 2016) (Table 3) . Furthermore, non-sexual signs and symptoms including changes in body composition (lean mass and fat mass), cognition deficit, spatial memory, mood, mild anemia, and sleep disturbances should be investigated (Khera et al., 2016) . Patients with hypogonadism may present with inability to perform strenuous activity, fatigue, hot flushes, excessive irritability, and memory loss, as shown by the EMAS (Lee et al., 2009; Ahern et al., 2016; Khera et al., 2016) . Finally, various questionnaires could be helpful (Wang et al., 2009a,b; Chueh et al., 2012; Huhtaniemi, 2014; Bhasin et al., 2018) , such as the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (ADAM) (Morley et al., 2000) , Massachusetts Male Aging Study Questionnaire (Morley et al., 2000) , EMAS Sexual Function Questionnaire , and the Aging Male Symptom Score (Heinemann et al., 2004 ) (O'Connor et al., 2008 Corona et al., 2012a,b) . Moreover, besides self-reported questionnaires, also structured interview are available, such as the NERI Hypogonadism Screener (Rosen et al., 2011) and ANDROTEST (Corona et al., 2006a,b; Millar et al., 2016) , that showed both the most favorable positive likelihood ratio (range 1.9-2.2) and the most favorable negative likelihood ratio (range 0.37-0.49) for detecting hypogonadism."}, {"section_title": "Causes", "text": "Hypogonadism may be induced by testicular failure (primary hypogonadism) or by hypothalamus or pituitary defects (secondary hypogonadism) resulting in low T levels due to insufficient Leydig cell stimulation, or by a mixture of hypothalamus and/or pituitary as well as testicular defects (mixed hypogonadism) (Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010) (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "A-Age", "text": "Aging is associated with degenerative systemic changes and chronic diseases in both men and women. However, in men, the drop in T and the consequent onset of sexual and reproductive signs and symptoms are progressive and slower than in women during the menopause, and the symptoms are often minimized or ignored (Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010) . Sexual symptoms such as low libido, ED, or decrease in spontaneous erections may be the most important in leading to a diagnosis of AOH (Khera et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, age is a very important independent factor for the pathogenesis of hypogonadism . Some studies report a natural reduction in T levels of about 0.3-2% per year (Harman et al., 2001; Feldman et al., 2002) . Some authors affirm that T begins to drop after the age of 30, but more quickly after 65 years (Bhattacharya & Bhattacharya, 2015) , while others state that this drop begins at the age of 40 . The prevalence of hypogonadism consequently increases with age (Harman et al., 2001; Araujo et al., 2004 Araujo et al., , 2007 Mulligan et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010) , but it is very difficult to establish the real prevalence given the different criteria for diagnosis and the different cutoffs used for age. The HIM Study enrolled subjects older than 45 years (Mulligan et al., 668 Andrology, 2018, 6, 665-679 2006), while the BLSA included men aged between 50 and 80 years (Harman et al., 2001) . The MMAS (Araujo et al., 2004) considered men aged between 40 and 70 years; in the Boston Area Community Health Survey , the range was 30-79 years. Finally, the EMAS considered men aged 40-79 years.\nAdult-onset hypogonadism is an acquired, irreversible, and age-related condition (Saad & Gooren, 2014) involving impaired testicular and hypothalamic-pituitary function (Nieschlag et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009a,b; Khera et al., 2016) . It is probably caused by various conditions: (i) a reduction in the number and function of Leydig cells (Rubens et al., 1974) ; (ii) reduced LH production and reduced periodicity and amplitude of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production (Veldhuis et al., 2010; Araujo & Wittert, 2011) ; and (iii) increased SHBG production and consequent reduction in free T (Araujo & Wittert, 2011) . Besides, the combination of TT within the normal range and high gonadotropins has been described as subclinical or compensated hypogonadism and associated with an increased risk of developing primary hypogonadism (Harkonen et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2008; Corona et al., 2014; Eendebak et al., 2018) .\nFurthermore, functional HPG axis suppression, in the absence of HPG axis diseases, is characterized by gonadotropin level within the normal range and modestly, or occasionally severe, low T level (Grossmann & Matsumoto, 2017; Corona et al., 2018) . Finally, even if age is characterized by a reduction of T levels, several studies, including EMAS, have documented that in healthy subjects T levels ream within the normal range even at an older age (Ahern et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "T-Testosterone serum levels", "text": "One of the most difficult but crucial factors in the diagnosis of hypogonadism is the measurement of TT and establishing its normal range. In the last few years, numerous studies have attempted to develop an accurate way to check serum TT level. However, difficulties are encountered in relation to physiological variation, age, weight and lifestyle of the subject, type of diet and food composition, methodological variability within and across assays and laboratories, and a lack of consensus on normal serum TT levels (Khera et al., 2016; Terrier & Isidori, 2016; Trost & Mulhall, 2016) (Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Time of blood sampling", "text": "A non-randomized controlled study on young-and middleaged men showed a significant diurnal serum T rhythm (Diver et al., 2003) , while specific recommendations from a randomized trial performed by andrological societies lead us to suggest that serum samples for TT should be obtained between 7 and 11 AM (Wang et al., 2009a,b) . Fasting conditions should be preferred."}, {"section_title": "Testosterone assay", "text": "Accurate measurement of TT is one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome in the diagnosis of hypogonadism, with variables related to both the different measuring techniques and the different reference ranges used. Immunoassay with chemiluminescent detection and mass spectrometry (MS) are the best techniques (Trost & Mulhall, 2016) . Immunoassay techniques are commonly used and show acceptable performance at normal T levels. In particular, EMAS documented that a validated platform immunoassay is sufficient to detect subnormal testosterone concentrations (Huhtaniemi et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, decreased accuracy at low TT was observed, magnifying interlaboratory differences in relation to the affinity and specificity of the antisera. The disposal of the radioactive waste generated by this technique is another important issue (Khera et al., 2016) . Mass spectrometry is the gold standard with excellent sensitivity and specificity at high and low TT, but is expensive and requires frequent calibration (Trost & Mulhall, 2016) .\nThe establishment of definitive normal TT ranges is undoubtedly an urgent goal to enable the diagnosis of hypogonadal status. The ISA, the ISSAM, the EAU, the EAA, and the ASA suggest (Wang et al., 2009a,b) . In the recent Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (Bhasin et al., 2018) , the authors suggested no routinely replacement treatment to all men over 65 years aged; furthermore, an individualized therapy is suggested, after an explanation of the potential benefits and the possible risks with the patient. There is therefore still no definitive reference range for TT assays; moreover, Le et al. (2016) , analyzing samples from 120 different laboratories, showed a significant variability in the reference ranges they used.\nSex hormone binding globulin and free testosterone Measurement of SHBG, albumin, and free T to complete the analysis of T status is quite common, because SHBG binds with high affinity about 40% to 50% of the circulating T in men (Khera et al., 2016) , and its quantification thus enables calculation of the bioavailable or free T in blood. SHBG levels can be influenced by systemic conditions. Obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes all reduce SHBG, while other diseases such as hyperthyroidism increase its levels (Table 6 ) (Wallace et al., 2013; Aydin & Winters, 2016) . Furthermore, when SHBG is out of normal ranges, TT could be not sufficient to describe the status of androgen; in fact, when SHBG is high, independently of TT, it is linked to either signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency, suggesting that besides a hypogonadism due to a T production not in normal ranges, may exist a hypogonadism due to a reduced biological activity of T (Rastrelli et al., 2017) . About free T levels, it is well known that it could be normal in some conditions in which TT levels are diminished; this should be taken into account to avoid overdiagnosis of AOH (Table 6 ). Many methodologies are available for free T measurement including the reference methods. So calculation or measurement of free or bioavailable T by equilibrium dialysis, steady-state gel filtration, ultrafiltration is not recommended because these methods are not for routine use, are lengthy, require technical skills, and finally, there is a lack of evidence of superiority over the measurement of TT (Shea et al., 2014; Dean et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "As discussed above, the patient's age has a significant impact on testosterone levels. Many studies have demonstrated that T drops by 0.3-1.4% per year from the age of 20-30 years (Harman et al., 2001; Feldman et al., 2002) . In a longitudinal cohort of men aged 40-70 years, the MMAS found a decline in T of about 0.8% per year (Feldman et al., 2002; Trost & Mulhall, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Intra-individual variations", "text": "Testosterone values can fluctuate on the same subject even with samples taken at similar times, making it difficult to arrive at an accurate assessment (Trost & Mulhall, 2016) . Several studies have confirmed this: Brambilla et al. (2007) measured T alongside other sex hormones in 121 men enrolled in the Boston Area Community Health Survey, performing paired blood samples, 1-3 days apart at entry and 3 and 6 months later. The results showed a large variation in serial intra-individual measurements. In subjects with TT <250 ng/dL (8.7 nmol/L) at the first assay, 40% also had mean TT <250 ng/dL (8.7 nmol/L) at the final visit, while 20% presented mean levels >300 ng/dL (10.4 nmol/L) (Brambilla et al., 2007) . A single TT measurement is therefore generally insufficient, and even multiple measurements may not be completely accurate."}, {"section_title": "Lifestyle and diet", "text": "Several studies show that lifestyle factors affect the agerelated decline in T levels (Isidori & Lenzi, 2005; Trost & Mulhall, 2016) . Physical exercise may influence serum T levels positively or negatively, depending on the type, intensity, and duration of activity Hayes et al., 2017) . Sgro et al. (2014) showed that a 30-min submaximal endurance exercise acutely increased serum T to a similar extent to maximal exercise. Khoo et al. (2013) evaluating men performing more than 200 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, showed greater increases in T than those performing about 100 minutes. Finally, a meta-analysis conducted by Corona et al. (2013) showed that weight loss is associated with an increase of T levels.\nThe effect of smoking on T levels is not entirely clear, although Jeng et al. (2014) found diminished T in subjects with a history of 20 pack-years. A systematic review and a meta-analysis in 2016 (Zhao et al., 2016) on 22 studies of 13,317 men showed that smokers had higher mean testosterone than non-smokers using a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting. For sure, new compounds need to be evaluated, as in e-cigarettes, and more studies are needed.\nAlcohol could inhibit testicular and hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of T, and excessive intake should thus be considered an important risk factor for T insufficiency in older men (Gordon et al., 1978; Emanuele & Emanuele, 2001; Isidori & Lenzi, 2005; Terrier & Isidori, 2016) . Furthermore, Castilla-Garcia et al. (1987) showed an increase in T in alcoholics who had stopped drinking. Several studies assessed the effect of drug on T levels. A 2015 meta-analysis of 17 studies with 2769 participants (800 opioid users and 1969 controls) showed that T levels are suppressed in men with regular opioid use (Bawor et al., 2015) .\nDiet and food composition can influence T levels (Terrier & Isidori, 2016) . Consumption of olive oil could increase serum T levels (Derouiche et al., 2013) . A vegan or vegetarian diet has no significant influence on T levels compared to carnivores (Key et al., 1990; Allen et al., 2000) . A soy-based diet, rich in isoflavones with its estrogen-like properties (Siepmann et al., 2011) , may reduce T levels, but this effect is not yet clear and might depend on the quantity used. "}, {"section_title": "Genetic heritability", "text": "The heritability of circulating T is a newsworthy topic that clarifies some aspects of T variability. Data from male participants in the Framingham Heart Study showed that heritability has an important role on circulating T levels in adult men (Travison et al., 2014) . Other studies have confirmed this link: The Dutch Study on adolescent twins and their parents showed about 60% of variance in T levels was heritable in nature (Harris et al., 1998) , while Sung et al., in a community-based cross-sectional study on Korean men (142 pairs of monozygotic twins, 191 pairs of brothers, and 259 father-offspring pairs from the Healthy Twin Study), showed that heritability of TT was 0.56 after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI) (Sung & Song, 2016; Trost & Mulhall, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Ethnic origin and geographic location", "text": "Ethnic origin and where a person actually lives have an interesting role in T levels, sometimes inducing fluctuation. In 2002-2005, a community-based study was conducted in Boston to investigate racial/ethnic variations in T and other sex hormones, finding no significant differences in T (Litman et al., 2006) . Rohrmann et al. (2007) , analyzing male participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), found that T levels did not differ notably between black and white population, but were higher in Mexican Americans than in white population. An interesting survey of older Asian, African American, and white men in the United States and Canada showed that levels of TT and bioavailable T were lowest in white population, highest in Asian Americans, and intermediate in African Americans (Wu et al., 1995) .\nMore evident variations in T levels were found in relation to geographic location. Orwoll et al., in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) involving participants from Japan, Tobago, Hong Kong, Sweden, and the United States, found that the proportion of men with T <230 ng/dL differed by location (e.g. 3% in Hong Kong and Japanese men, 5-6% in U.S. Caucasian and Swedish men), with TT levels in Asian men in Hong Kong and Japan, which is approximately 20% higher than in other subjects from other countries (Orwoll et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "C-Comorbidities", "text": "The chronic diseases which often occur in advanced age could be associated with hypogonadism (Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010; Khera et al., 2016) .

The HIM Study presented odds ratios for different comorbidities in patients with hypogonadism (Mulligan et al., 2006) , finding them to be significantly higher in men with obesity (2.38), history of MetS, diabetes (2.09), hypertension (1.84), osteoporosis (1.41), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.40), and prostate disease (1.29) (Mulligan et al., 2006) . Furthermore, some other conditions such as end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, infertility, cryptorchidism, pituitary disease, delayed puberty, and corticosteroid treatment may also be associated with low T levels (Khera et al., 2016;  Table 7 ). In such conditions, the reduction of testosterone level with normal gonadotropin concentration and in the absence of a clear alteration of HPG axis may be due to a functional hypogonadism (Grossmann & Matsumoto, 2017) instead of an organic disease."}, {"section_title": "Obesity and metabolic syndrome", "text": "Different studies have investigated the relationship between obesity, MetS, and hypogonadism or drop in serum TT (Laaksonen et al., 2004 (Laaksonen et al., , 2005 Allan & McLachlan, 2010; MacDonald et al., 2010; Brand et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Yassin et al., 2016) . Obesity is an important risk factor for health and could be the single most common cause of a drop in T levels, with about 52.4% of all obese men presenting T levels <300 ng/dL (Mulligan et al., 2006; Lamm et al., 2016) . Various studies show an inverse linear relationship between TT and BMI and an inverse relationship between free and total T levels in serum and visceral fat mass, demonstrating a positive correlation between hypogonadism and obesity in obese males (Kapoor et al., 2005; Dandona et al., 2008; Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010; Szulc et al., 2016; Defeudis, 2017) . Some interesting studies suggest that serum TT could predict the development of central obesity and accumulation of intraabdominal fat (Allan & McLachlan, 2010; MacDonald et al., 2010; Brand et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011) , while vice versa, waist circumference could be a predictor of health-related quality of life in men with hypogonadism (Yassin et al., 2016) . Although there are different and bidirectional correlations between obesity and hypogonadism in relation to the role of fat on testosterone and vice versa, these mechanisms have not yet been completely clarified (Morelli et al., 2014; Corona et al., 2015a,b; Lamm et al., 2016) . Finally, a longitudinal study on the EMAS population has shown that the development of low T is frequent in obese men and it is accompanied by the development of sexual symptoms, so predisposing aged men to the development of secondary hypogonadism, which is frequently reversible with decrease in weight (Rastrelli et al., 2015) . MetS [defined as central obesity in addition to any two of the following four factors: raised fasting plasma glucose (\u2265100 mg/dL) or previously diagnosed T2D; hypertension (\u2265130/85 mmHg); reduced HDL (<40 mg/dL in males); and raised triglycerides (\u2265150 mg/ dL) (Alberti et al., 2016) ] is clearly linked to hypogonadism, given that all these factors play a part in the latter (Laaksonen et al., 2005; Traish et al., 2009) . Finally, aromatase hyperactivity in visceral adipose tissue is another possible mechanism, given its role in inducing a low T concentration through the conversion of T to estradiol (Phe & Roupret, 2012; Defeudis et al., 2015) . However, these data are in contrast with other studies showing that increased estrogen levels are not involved in the mechanism linking obesity with hypogonadism Dhindsa et al., 2011 Dhindsa et al., , 2016 . Type 2 diabetes Once a disease affecting a small minority, T2D has now spread to every country in the world and is an important health condition for the aging population (American Diabetes A, 2016). In 2004, Dhindsa et al. (2004) showed the relationship between hypogonadism and T2D. Kapoor et al. (2007) showed that T levels were low in men with T2D. Different cross-sectional studies demonstrate that T levels are lower in patients with T2D, while in prospective studies, higher serum T levels indicated the importance of T in reducing the risk of T2D (Ding et al., 2006; Khera et al., 2016) . The link between symptoms of hypogonadism and diabetes has also been investigated. A significant part of this population has symptoms of hypogonadism, with ED one of the most common symptoms (Corona et al., 2006a,b; Kapoor et al., 2007; Defeudis et al., 2015) . Moreover, El-Sakka et al. (2008) underlined the importance of good blood glucose control, affirming that poor control reduces T levels, thus exacerbating ED.\nAlthough some hypotheses have been put forward in relation to the pathophysiology linking hypogonadism and diabetes, the mechanisms have not yet been clarified (Defeudis et al., 2015) .\nInterestingly, SHBG concentrations are inversely correlated with glycated hemoglobin, both in diabetic and non-diabetic males. Furthermore, low SHBG concentration is associated with an increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes, with an important role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis (Wallace et al., 2013) . Insulin resistance could be responsible also of a reduced insulin activity in the hypothalamus causing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Bruning et al., 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Hypertension", "text": "The hypothesis that hypertension and lower T levels in men are related has been investigated in different studies, with conflicting results (Svartberg et al., 2004; Zarotsky et al., 2014) . Some cross-sectional studies showed an inverse association with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, highlighting the relationship between low T and hypertension (Khaw & Barrett-Connor, 1988; Svartberg et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006) , while others were unable to confirm this (Lindholm et al., 1982; Dai et al., 1984; Bonithon-Kopp et al., 1988; Svartberg et al., 2004) . This association, if it does exist, could be explained by a genetic link. Endre et al. (1996) investigated the relationship between peripheral insulin sensitivity and T in the development of hypertension, finding that men with a family history of hypertension had lower levels of T. Moreover, Pandey et al. (1999) showed that mice lacking the gene encoding the natriuretic peptide receptor A (Npr1) have high blood pressure but also low T levels, demonstrating the importance of this gene in the maintenance of serum T levels and testicular steroidogenesis. Given that T induces endothelium-independent relaxation of the blood vessels, low T levels may have a role in hypertension (Yue et al., 1995; Costarella et al., 1996; Svartberg et al., 2004) . Furthermore, pre-clinical and clinical studies have found a correlation between endothelial dysfunction and androgen deficiency (Miller & Mulvagh, 2007) , and various in vitro studies of androgenmediated vasodilatation in different human and animal blood vessels show that inhibition of the L-type calcium channels leads to the relaxing effects of T and 5a-DHT on vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles (Hall et al., 2006; Francomano et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Osteoporosis and fractures", "text": "ISA, ISSAM, EAU, EAA, and ASA Guidelines stress the important role of bone metabolism in patients with hypogonadism (Wang et al., 2009a,b) . The prevalence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fracture is greater in both young and old hypogonadal men, and the risk of fracture is significantly higher in patients with reduced T levels (Meier et al., 2008) . Moreover, about 66% of elderly men who have experienced hip fractures presented hypogonadism (Abbasi et al., 1995; Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010) . T prevents osteoclastogenesis, probably due to direct and indirect inhibitory effects on human osteoclast formation and bone reabsorption (Michael et al., 2005; Epstein et al., 2016) . Osteocalcin (Ocn), an osteoblast-derived hormone known as a marker of bone formation, is released during the reabsorption phase (Ferron et al., 2010) , acting on Leydig cells, and stimulates T production in mice; T is reduced in Ocn-deficient male mice (Oury et al., 2011; Palermo et al., 2016) . The MrOS showed that higher SHBG (but not estradiol or T) could be an independent risk factor for vertebral fractures in older men (Cawthon et al., 2016) .\nThe relationship between bone metabolism and T is further demonstrated by various studies showing the efficacy of T replacement in hypogonadal men, increasing bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar and femoral sites (Aversa et al., 2012; Isidori et al., 2015) . Finally, an interesting trial by Pepe et al. (2014) underlined the difficulties in treating fractures using risedronate and noted the higher BMD in subjects with adequate androgenization compared to HIV males with osteoporosis and symptomatic hypoandrogenization, confirming the poor physical condition induced by low androgen levels.\nLow levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D have been described in patients with hypogonadism. This could be caused by testicular impairment and consequent reduced expression of CYP2R1, an enzyme that hydroxylates the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol (Foresta et al., 2011 (Foresta et al., , 2015 . This enzyme is expressed under the stimulation of LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)."}, {"section_title": "Infertility", "text": "Fertility may be affected by low testosterone levels. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulates the production of spermatozoa through the secretion of T in the testes. The number of couples looking to become parents in their 40s is rising. It is well known that advanced maternal age is more important than advanced paternal age (Liu & Case, 2011; Mazzilli et al., 2017) , and the effects of age on semen quality (such as DNA fragmentation and increased risk of genetic alteration) are still under debate (Chen et al., 2008; Ramasamy et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2015) . However, AOH could cause or contribute to infertility in the male partner of infertile couples. The reduced periodicity and amplitude of GnRH production and consequent reduction in FSH frequently associated with aging could impair spermatogenesis (La Vignera et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Human immunodeficiency virus", "text": "Low T is more frequent in male HIV patients than in the general population (Ashby et al., 2014) . Studies confirm that about 20-50% of this population receiving constant antiretroviral therapy are hypogonadal (Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010) . The HP axis is impaired in these patients, with low T levels associated with inappropriately low or normal serum LH (Khera et al., 2016) . Various pathophysiological causes induce low T, including poor clinical or nutritional status, changes in body composition and lean body mass, disruption of the HPG axis resulting from malnutrition, increased levels of estradiol and SHBG, lipodystrophy induced by highly active retroviral medications, illegal drugs such as methadone and opiates, low CD4 cell count, opportunistic infections causing testicular atrophy, and the effects of medications which inhibit steroid biosynthesis (Crum-Cianflone et al., 2007; Kalyani et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2007; MorenoPerez et al., 2009; Dandona & Rosenberg, 2010; Sadeghi-Nejad et al., 2010; Rochira et al., 2011; Zona et al., 2012; De Ryck et al., 2013; Ashby et al., 2014; Tripathy et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "H-Hormones", "text": "The guidelines do not offer unequivocal indications in relation to the hormone profile enabling a diagnosis of hypogonadism and the discovery of its origin, nor are potential differences seen in cases of AOH specified (Table 8) ."}, {"section_title": "Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone", "text": "GnRH stimulates the production of the gonadotropins LH and FSH, which respectively stimulate the production of T in the testes and spermatogenesis. The limits are not universally applicable and, pending different recommendations, each clinician should rely on the limits provided by the laboratory, which performed the measurements (Andersson et al., 2004) . The evaluation of gonadotropins is necessary to distinguish primary hypogonadism (testicular, with low T and high gonadotropins) from secondary hypogonadism (pituitary-hypothalamic, with low T and low gonadotropins) (Isidori et al., 2008) . The AACE Hypogonadism Task Force recommends the concomitant measurement of LH, FSH, and T time (Petak et al., 2002) . The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (Bhasin et al., 2018) recommend LH and FSH evaluation only in the case of hypogonadism, to distinguish between primary and secondary forms. The ISA, ISSAM, EAU, EAA, and ASA Guidelines (Wang et al., 2009a,b) and the ISSM Guidelines (Dean et al., 2015) recommend LH evaluation alone to differentiate between primary and secondary forms. Giannetta et al. (2012) underline the importance of gonadotropins for the diagnosis of subclinical hypogonadism. T within the normal range and LH and FSH in the upper part of the normal range or marginally elevated could indicate mild subclinical hypogonadism. Markedly elevated gonadotropins could be considered as severe subclinical hypogonadism. These conditions can also be used for the early diagnosis of hypogonadism (low T levels), thus preventing advanced hypogonadism."}, {"section_title": "Prolactin", "text": "Pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion is regulated by the hypothalamus. The AACE Hypogonadism Task Force recommends evaluation of PRL alongside gonadotropins and T (Petak et al., 2002) . The ISA, ISSAM, EAU, EAA, and ASA Guidelines recommend PRL evaluation with T <5 nmol/L (Wang et al., 2009a,b; Dean et al., 2015) . Only severe hyperprolactinemia (PRL >35 ng/mL or 735 mU/L) caused by prolactinoma or non-secreting pituitary adenoma can cause low T production and sexual dysfunction. This may be due to the mass effect or PRL-induced gonadotropin suppression. Finally, it has been reported that PRL levels increase with age due to the physiological reduction in dopamine (Giannetta et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Estradiol", "text": "In male subjects, estrogens derive from androgen aromatization. The normal range of estradiol in adult men is 18-40 pg/mL (66-147 pmol/L) (Rochira et al., 2000) . Estrogens have an important role in the regulation of gonadotropin feedback, reducing LH and FSH (Finkelstein et al., 2013 ). An inappropriate increase in estradiol (E2) can induce a decrease in testicular volume, impaired spermatogenesis, and sexual dysfunction (El-Sakka, 2013; Schulster et al., 2016) . Moreover, estradiol too has effects on the body fat mass and sexual function. So studies about the role of estradiol and its importance in men's health balance showed that estrogen deficiency could be an important pathophysiological point in male hypogonadism, and an increased conversion of testosterone in estrogens during TRT needs to be considered (Matsumoto, 2013) . Although estrogens play an important role in male hypogonadism, the guidelines do not suggest the evaluation of estradiol (Isidori et al., 2008) , also due to limitations using immunoassays for its measurement (Huhtaniemi et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Sexual hormone binding globulin", "text": "The role played by SHBG is discussed above. The AACE Hypogonadism Task Force, Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines, ISA, ISSAM, EAU, EAA, ASA, and EAU all recommend the evaluation of SHBG to enable the calculation of free T (Petak et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2009a,b; Bhasin et al., 2018) . The ISSM Guidelines only recommended the evaluation of SHBG in obese and older men (Dean et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone", "text": "Some studies report that primary hypothyroidism is associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, so evaluation of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) levels could be useful (Bunch et al., 2002; Lunenfeld et al., 2015) . This form of hypogonadism seems to be reversible after thyroid hormone replacement therapy (Meikle, 2004) . However, other studies affirm that hypogonadism is not associated with thyroid function or dysfunction (Wang et al., 2009a,b; Corona et al., 2012a,b) . Thyroid function seems to have an indirect effect on T levels through its influence on SHBG levels. Hyperthyroidism can increase SHBG, thus reducing FT (Hammond et al., 2012; Khera et al., 2016) . The guidelines do not suggest routine TSH evaluation in cases of hypogonadism."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The purpose of this manuscript is to facilitate the screening and consistent diagnosis of hypogonadism in men by suggesting a useful new acronym (CATCH) and a practical checklist (Table 9 and Fig. 1 ). The evaluation of the clinical features and causes of this disease, its link with age, the role of T and other hormone levels, and the evaluation of comorbidities are important in investigating this population. This checklist could be helpful for daily practice of clinicians to avoid neglecting some clinical aspects. Furthermore, the early diagnosis of both hypogonadism and associated comorbidities may helpful for the patients in terms of changing lifestyle and appropriate treatment. Finally, we suggest the use of this acronym to advocate the investigation of declining T in aging men."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "Medical writing assistance was provided by Marie-H el ene Hayles during the preparation of the manuscript.
