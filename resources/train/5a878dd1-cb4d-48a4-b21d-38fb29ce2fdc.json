[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide, fibrillary tangles of intraneuronal tau and microglial activation are major pathological hallmarks. One of the key molecules involved in microglial activation is galectin-3 (gal3), and we demonstrate here for the first time a key role of gal3 in AD pathology. Gal3 was highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients and 5xFAD (familial Alzheimer's disease) mice and found specifically expressed in microglia associated with A\u03b2 plaques. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the LGALS3 gene, which encodes gal3, were associated with an increased risk of AD. Gal3 deletion in 5xFAD mice attenuated microglia-associated immune responses, particularly those associated with TLR and TREM2/DAP12 signaling. In vitro data revealed that gal3 was required to fully activate microglia in response to fibrillar A\u03b2. Gal3 deletion decreased the A\u03b2 burden in 5xFAD mice and improved cognitive behavior. Interestingly, a single intrahippocampal injection of gal3 along with A\u03b2 monomers in WT mice was sufficient to induce the formation of long-lasting (2 months) insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates, which were absent when gal3 was lacking. High-resolution microscopy (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) demonstrated close colocalization of gal3 and TREM2 in microglial processes, and a direct interaction was shown by a fluorescence anisotropy assay involving the gal3 carbohydrate recognition domain.

The classical hallmarks of AD include the formation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. Over the course of the disease, the deposition of A\u03b2 and the formation of the NFTs appear to be correlated with the on-going hippocampal neurodegeneration [6] . Hippocampal neurodegeneration has a negative effect on the cognitive ability of patients, especially in the formation of new memories. The mechanisms triggering the deposition of the A\u03b2 or the formation of NFTs are 1 3 currently under investigation. However, several mechanisms and factors have been suggested to be involved in the initiation and the progression of the disease, including activation of the innate immune system, environmental factors and lifestyle [42] . The innate immune system has been widely studied and has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases [19] . Over the last few years, several studies have suggested that inflammation plays a major role in the initiation and progression of AD [17, 20, 62, 66] .\nThe inflammatory process in the central nervous system (CNS) is generally referred to as neuroinflammation. Glial cells have a leading role in propagating neuroinflammation. Among glial cells, microglia are considered the main source of proinflammatory molecules within the brain [18, 27, 63] . It is believed that sustained release of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, nitrogen reactive species (NRS) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can create a neurotoxic environment that drives the progression of AD [1, 19, 46] . Moreover, there is strong evidence supporting the role of inflammatory molecules, such as iNOS, in the initiation of plaque formation due to post-translational modifications of \u0391\u03b2, leading to a faster aggregation [31, 32] . Indeed, counteracting the aggregation process has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate the progression of the pathology [58] .\nConclusive evidence supporting a direct role of microglia in human neurodegeneration was revealed with the recent advent of massive genome analysis. Specifically, geneticassociated studies have identified several AD-risk genes strongly associated with the innate immune system, including, among others, triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2 (trem2), cd33, cr1, clu, epha1 and ms4a4a/ms4a6a [7, 16] . Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies of microglia have pointed out galectin-3 (Lgals3; gal3) as one of the most attractive molecules in brain innate immunity associated with neurodegeneration (see recent review [10] ). Indeed, Holtman et al. [22] analyzed transcriptional profiles of isolated microglia from different disease mouse models, including AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging, and revealed a shared transcriptional network in all conditions, including a strong upregulation of gal3. Interestingly, the authors analyzed the most likely candidates to orchestrate the microglial activation phenotype and found four major hub genes: Lgals3, Igf1, Csf1 and Axl [22] . Two other recent studies characterized the molecular signature of microglial cells associated with different disease conditions, including aging and AD [27, 30] . Again, a common microglial neurodegenerative disease-associated phenotype was identified, supporting that (1) the microglial phenotype was driven by TREM2 and (2) gal3 was one of the most upregulated genes.\nRecent findings from our group have demonstrated that gal3 is released by LPS-treated microglia and acts as a ligand of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is one of the canonical receptors involved in the microglial inflammatory response [9] . Based on our previous studies and recent findings from the AD field related to the role of inflammation in the disease, we hypothesize that the reduction of microglial activation by removing/inhibiting gal3 will counteract the inflammatory response present in AD and slow the progression of the disease. In this work, we demonstrate (1) a significant upregulation of gal3 in human AD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, (2) the preferential expression of gal3 in microglial cells in contact with A\u03b2 plaques both in human and mouse, (3) a clear reduction of the inflammatory response in microglial cells challenged with A\u03b2 fibrils (fA\u03b2) following gal3 inhibition and gal3 deletion in microglial cultures, (4) a significant A\u03b2 plaque reduction and better cognitive outcome in 5xFAD mice lacking gal3, and (5) the role of gal3 as a ligand of TREM2 through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) domain, which confers the ability to bind glycans."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Animals", "text": "5xFAD-Gal3 KO transgenic mice were generated by crossing heterozygous 5xFAD (\u00b1) mice with homozygous Gal3KO (\u2212/\u2212) mice to get 5xFAD (\u00b1)/Gal3 (\u00b1) mice. Subsequent crossings between animals expressing this genotype allowed for the generation of 5xFAD (\u00b1)-Gal3 (\u2212/\u2212) mice, hence referred to as 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice. 5xFAD/ Gal3 mice are hence referred to as 5xFAD mice.

In short, increasing concentrations of galectins are first tittered against a fixed concentration of saccharide probe (0.02 \u00b5M).

To establish the dissociation constant (K d ) values between TREM2 and gal3 wild-type or R186S mutant, a competitive variant of the FA assay was used. In this assay, increasing concentrations of TREM2 were tittered against fixed concentrations of galectin and probe (see below for details).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.

Despite this close association, further experiments are required to decipher its biological significance. We also investigated if other cell types in 5xFAD mice expressed gal3 by looking at GFAP-labeled astrocytes and NeuN-labeled neurons. This study demonstrated that plaque-associated microglia is the predominant cell type expressing gal3. Yet, 13% of reactive astrocytes expressed gal3 in 6-month-old 5xFAD mice. That figure dropped to less than 2% in 18-month-old 5xFAD mice (suppl. Fig. 2 , online resource 2).

Fig. 5d , online resource 5) and the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines (suppl. Fig. 5e , online resource 5). Next, we challenged BV2 cells with 10 \u03bcM fA\u03b2 along with increasing concentrations of gal3 inhibitor (10 and 25 \u03bcM) for 12 h. The conditioned media was collected, and inflammatory-related cytokines were measured. Notably, the release of proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL12 and IL8 was significantly reduced in response to gal3 inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner (suppl. Fig. 5f , online resource 5). The same was true for iNOS, a classical proinflammatory marker as measured by western blot (suppl. Fig. 5g, online resource 5) . We also evaluated the levels of insulin degrading enzyme 1 (IDE-1) in BV2 cells. IDE-1 is an enzyme involved in A\u03b2 degradation [48] . IDE-1 was downregulated in BV2 cells challenged with fA\u03b2 in a concentration-dependent fashion (suppl. Fig. 5i , left, online resource 5). Strikingly, with gal3 inhibition, the downregulation of A\u03b2-induced IDE-1 turned into a significant upregulation in a manner dependent on inhibitor concentration (suppl. Fig. 5i , online resource 5). To confirm our in vitro data, we evaluated the inflammatory response using primary microglial cultures from WT and Gal3KO mice. Primary microglial cultures were challenged with fA\u03b2 at 3 and 10 \u03bcM. Similar to BV2 cells, the lack of gal3 reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, IL8 and TNF\u03b1 (Fig. 2a) . Other cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL4 and IL12, were not affected by the lack of gal3. We next analyzed the effect of gal3 on the phagocytosis of either A\u03b2 monomers (mA\u03b2) or A\u03b2 fibrils (fA\u03b2) by primary microglia. To achieve this, primary microglial cells were either pretreated (30 min) or simultaneously with gal3 (1 \u00b5M) upon challenge with mA\u03b2 or fA\u03b2. Microglial uptake of A\u03b2 was increased when mA\u03b2 and gal3 were added simultaneously (suppl. Fig. 2e , online resource 2). Interestingly, when using pretreatment of fA\u03b2 (suppl. Fig. 2f , online resource 2), we found a reduced microglial uptake, suggesting a perplex role of gal3 in A\u03b2 phagocytosis. We have previously demonstrated the ability of gal3 to be released by proinflammatory microglia in response to TLR activation, which was shown to be a determinant feature in driving microglia-related immune responses [9, 64] . Given the strong response to either gal3 deletion or gal3 inhibition in the prevention of the fA\u03b2-induced microglia proinflammatory activation, we next analyzed if cultured microglia challenged with fA\u03b2 actively release gal3. Gal3 levels were analyzed in conditioned media using ELISA.

WT and Gal3KO mice showed quite similar profiles, suggesting a limited role of gal3 in promoting inflammation in the absence of pathology.

Notably, the plaque burden was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice lacking gal3 at 6 months in the CA1 region (Fig. 4a) . At 18 months, we could not find any difference between the groups, possibly due to oversaturated plaque deposits in the hippocampi (Fig. 4b) .

This analysis first demonstrated that aged animals exhibited a near threefold increase in plaque area in both experimental groups when compared to 6-monthold animals. Notably, at 18 months, we found a significant reduction in plaque perimeter and circularity in 5xFAD/ Gal3KO mice compared to 5xFAD mice (suppl. Fig. 6c , online resource 6). Next, we measured cortical A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 levels in soluble brain fractions. The levels of A\u03b240 were significantly lower in 5xFAD/Gal3KO (vs. 5xFAD) brains at 18 months but not at 6 months (Fig. 4a, b) . Conversely, A\u03b242 levels were significantly higher in 5xFAD/ Gal3KO (vs. 5xFAD) brains at 6 months ( Fig. 4a ) but with no change at 18 months (Fig. 4b) . In the insoluble A\u03b2 fraction, we found reduced A\u03b240 levels in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice A\u03b2 load in hippocampus (CA1) and thalamus at 6 months (a) and 18 months (b) with A\u03b2 load analyzed in 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice (% in frames).

Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM at 6 months (suppl. Fig. 6a, online resource 6 ). Changes in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were not due to a change of APP expression as 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice showed comparable levels at both ages measured (suppl. Fig. 6b , online resource 6). A\u03b2 is cleared from the brain by different mechanisms, including microglia phagocytosis, drainage to the ventricular system and activity of extracellular proteases, such as IDE-1 [18] . We found a significant increase of A\u03b242 CSF levels in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice compared to 5xFAD mice (Fig. 4c) , mimicking the clinical situation in which A\u03b2 in the CSF is inversely related to the A\u03b2 plaque load in AD patients. Interestingly, hippocampal IDE-1 levels were increased in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice at 6 months compared to 5xFAD mice (Fig. 4d) , confirming our in vitro data (suppl. Fig. 5i , online resource 5). Since phagocytosis is also involved in A\u03b2 clearance, we analyzed CD68-labeled phagosome areas that have been shown to correlate with in vivo A\u03b2 phagocytosis [65] at 6 months and 18 months in 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice. No significant differences were found between both experimental groups at any of the ages examined (suppl. Fig. 6d , online resource 6). Taken together, our data are suggestive of an important negative role of gal3 in A\u03b2 clearance in 5xFAD mice. This view is sustained by the higher CSF levels of A\u03b242 and increased expression of extracellular IDE-1 in 5xFAD/Gal3 KO mice when compared to 5xFAD mice (Fig. 4) .\nHaving established that gal3 is a main driver of the ADassociated inflammatory response and that gal3 deficiency reduces A\u03b2 plaque burden, we next studied the impact of gal3 deficiency on cognitive behavior. The cognitive ability was evaluated using the Morris water maze memory test. Remarkably, the lack of gal3 in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice resulted in better cognitive performance compared to 5xFAD mice as the 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice were able to navigate and reach the platform using a shorter path (Fig. 4e) ."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 drives microglia reactivity in A\u03b2 plaques", "text": "In light of our findings that gal3-reactive microglia are strictly confined to A\u03b2 plaques and that gal3 deficiency impairs the inflammatory response and A\u03b2 plaque load, we next analyzed microglial coverage on the surface of amyloid plaques in cortex from both 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice at 18 months of age. First, we found that 5xFAD/ Gal3KO mice showed reduced Iba1 immunoreactivity in the cortex when compared to 5xFAD mice (Fig. 5a ). These differences were particularly evident in plaque-associated microglia in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice (Fig. 5b) . Remarkably, gal3 deficiency significantly reduced Iba1-labeled microglial clusters around A\u03b2 plaques (Fig. 5c) . Still, an analysis of microglial coverage over plaque surfaces showed that a high subset of plaque-associated microglia (~ 50%) expressed high levels of gal3 (Fig. 5d) . Interestingly, these findings are, to some extent, similar to the findings seen in studies of 5xFAD/TREM2KO mice [39, 59, 65 ], yet, substantial differences are evident between 5xFAD lacking either gal3 or TREM2. Thus, contrary to that seen in 5xFAD lacking gal3, 5xFAD/TREM2KO mice exhibits increased A\u03b2 deposition in the hippocampal formation [59] . Further, microglia lacking TREM2 fail to colocalize in A\u03b2 plaques [59] , an ability present in microglia lacking gal3. Taken together, our data suggest that gal3-associated biological effects may be associated with TREM2 signaling without excluding other significant biological pathways (i.e., TLR signaling)."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 acts as a TREM2 ligand", "text": "Recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses of microglia under different conditions of neurodegeneration, including AD, have revealed that gal3 is one of the most upregulated genes in processes that have been suggested to be TREM2-dependent [30, 38] . We have demonstrated that gal3 is released by reactive microglial cells [9] and may thus interact with different receptors controlling key functions of microglial cells, including TLR4 [38] and MerTK [43] . One of the main pathways altered in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice was related to DAP12 signaling (Fig. 3b) . Since DAP12 is a downstream regulator of TREM2, we wondered if gal3 could act as an endogenous TREM2 ligand. To test our hypothesis, we first performed TREM2, gal3 and 6E10 staining on 5xFAD brain sections and found that the majority of TREM2-labeled microglia were gal3 + (83.4 \u00b1 5.7% and 94.0 \u00b1 3.02% at 6 and 18 months, respectively), an indication that gal3 immunoreactivity may label the DAM phenotype [27, 30] (Fig. 5e, suppl. Fig. 7a , online resource 7). To further support this view, we performed Clec7a immunostaining on 5xFAD brain sections. Clec7a has been identified as a specific microglial marker associated with both the DAM phenotype [27] and the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype [30] . Our confocal analysis demonstrated that plaque-associated microglia express the markers Clec7a and gal3 (suppl. Fig. 2d , online resource 2), thus supporting the view that DAM express gal3. Our analysis also demonstrated a striking cellular colocalization of TREM2 and gal3 in microglial cells around A\u03b2 plaques (Fig. 5e , f, suppl. Fig. 7a, online resource 7) . Despite the clear relation between TREM2 and gal3 in microglial cells-associated amyloid plaques, further experiments (such as single-cell analysis) are required to fully elucidate how gal3 is related to DAM microglia.\nWe next used quantitative high-resolution confocal microscopy and super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to determine whether TREM2 and gal3 physically interact in brain sections from 5xFAD mice. Our ultrastructural analysis clearly revealed the physical interaction between gal3 (green) and TREM2"}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "(red) over the membrane surface of microglia (see yellow dots in Fig. 5g) . We further assessed the direct TREM2-gal3 interaction by determining the ability of soluble TREM2 to inhibit the binding of a fluorescent glycosylated probe to gal3 as measured by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 6a) . This analysis demonstrated a strong interaction between WT gal3 and TREM2 with a K d value of 450 \u00b1 90 nM (Fig. 6a) , which was in the same range as other preferred glycoproteins [11, 12] . A mutant gal3 (R186S, deficient in the carbohydrate-binding domain with severely reduced affinity for LacNAc-structures) [49] , in comparison, weakly bound to TREM2 (K d of 5900 \u00b1 600 nM; Fig. 6a ). This means that gal3 interacts strongly with TREM2, with a K d in the same range as, for example, some serum glycoproteins such as transferrin and haptoglobin [11, 12] . The data also suggest that the interaction between gal3 and TREM2 is carbohydrate dependent. The hypothesized interaction was modeled based on previously reported TREM2 and gal3 structures (suppl. Fig. 7c , online resource 7). Next, we tested whether gal3 could affect TREM2 signaling using a TREM2-DAP12 reporter cell line, and we found that added gal3 triggered TREM2-DAP12-dependent signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6b) .\nOverall, our data demonstrate that gal3 is an endogenous ligand for TREM2."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 induces the formation of insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates following injections of A\u03b2 in the hippocampi of WT mice", "text": "We have previously demonstrated that gal3 can be released by reactive microglial cells in vitro and in vivo [9] . In this study we provide convincing evidence that primary microglia and BV2 cells actively release gal3 when challenged with fA\u03b2 and that gal3 may act as an endogenous TREM2 agonist. Intriguingly, TREM2 has been associated with A\u03b2 plaque compaction [65] , and, hence, the possibility emerged that gal3 may have a role in A\u03b2 aggregation. To address this, A\u03b242 monomers (10 \u00b5M) were incubated alone or in the presence of gal3 (10 \u00b5M) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (suppl. Fig. 6f , online resource 6). A ThT assay was performed under the same conditions and demonstrated that fA\u03b2, which reached the maximal ThT fluorescence intensity, was the predominant form of A\u03b2 aggregates used for the in vivo injections (suppl. Fig. 6f, online resource 6 ). Two microliter of the prepared A\u03b2 was injected in either the left (A\u03b2 + gal3) or the right hippocampi (A\u03b2 alone) of WT mice. The analysis was performed 2 months post-injection. The injection of A\u03b2 alone failed to induce A\u03b2 aggregation in the injected hippocampi (Fig. 7a) . In sharp contrast and remarkably, A\u03b2-like plaques were evident in the hippocampi injected with A\u03b2 + gal3 (Fig. 7b, c) . These A\u03b2 aggregates were positive for gal3, A\u03b2 (detected with 6E10 antibody) and thioflavin-S (Fig. 7d, e) , which demonstrate the amyloid structure of the A\u03b2 deposits. These amyloid deposits were surrounded by Iba1 + -labeled microglia (Fig. 7f) and GFAP + reactive astrocytes (Fig. 7g) . Animals injected with A\u03b2 alone did not present aggregate deposits or microglial/astrocyte activation (suppl. Fig. 6e , online resource 6). Our data shed light on the role of gal3 as microglial-associated agent involved in A\u03b2 aggregation."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Recent findings suggest an important role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases [18] . Thus, selective mutations in microglia/myeloid-specific genes, including the gene encoding TREM2, have been associated with AD [16] . Experimental AD studies have suggested that TREM2 is instrumental in neuroinflammation [24, 35] and drives DAM microglia [27, 30] . Gal3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, is one of the most upregulated genes associated with DAM [30, 34, 38] . Holtman et al. (2015) anticipated gal3 as a gene strongly related to microglial DAM phenotype [22] . To study the role of gal3 in AD pathogenesis, we have analyzed human brains from AD patients and 5xFAD mice lacking gal3. The main conclusions from our study are (1) gal3 protein is increased tenfold in human AD brains and is mostly restricted to plaque-associated microglia in humans and 5xFAD mice, (2) certain SNPs linked to the LGALS3 gene are associated with AD, (3) gal3 deficiency reduces A\u03b2 plaque burden and the overall proinflammatory response and plaque size and improves cognitive performance in 5xFAD/ Gal3KO mice, (4) gal3 is an endogenous TREM2 ligand, (5) gal3 is released in response to fA\u03b2 and (6) gal3 interacts with A\u03b2, affecting amyloid plaque morphology. Hence, gal3 emerges as a central upstream regulator of AD-associated pathology.\nGiven the relationship between innate immune systemrelated genes and AD incidence [18, 19] , deciphering how A\u03b2 aggregates trigger neuroinflammation is of critical importance. For this purpose, we first analyzed the role of gal3 in the A\u03b2-induced inflammatory response in microglial cells. To this end, we took advantage of both chemical inhibition and gene deletion. Gal3 inhibition robustly reduced fA\u03b2-induced iNOS expression in BV2 cells, an + cells expressing gal3 in 5xFAD (% of \u0391\u03b2 area). e, f Gal3 and TREM2 in plaque-associated microglia in the brain of 5xFAD mice reveals colocalization of gal3 and TREM2. g Gal3 and TREM2 colocalization in 5xFAD mouse brain using STORM microscopy. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test. *p < 0.05. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM. All images were taken in 5xFAD mice at 18 months \u25c2 effect that was extended to proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL8 and IL12, which we confirmed in primary microglia cultures from WT and Gal3KO mice. These data suggest that gal3 is a critical alarmin that amplifies the A\u03b2-induced proinflammatory response. Since inefficient clearance of A\u03b2 may play a determinant role in AD pathogenesis [67] , we analyzed the effect of gal3 in two major mechanisms involved in A\u03b2 clearance: A\u03b2 phagocytosis and IDE-1 levels, a key metalloprotease involved in A\u03b2 degradation by microglia [48] . Gal3 was able to alter A\u03b2 phagocytosis in vitro showing a complex role of gal3 in A\u03b2 phagocytosis depending on A\u03b2 species (monomers or fibrils) or if pretreated or not (see suppl. Fig. 2e -f, online resource 2). Hence, further experiments are needed to clarify the exact role of gal3 in the whole dynamic process of A\u03b2 phagocytosis and clearance. We found gal3 deficiency to increase IDE-1 levels in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a detrimental role of gal3 in A\u03b2 clearance. Supporting this, CSF levels of A\u03b242 were significantly higher in 5xFAD/Gal3KO as compared with 5xFAD. Overall, our study demonstrates an instrumental role of gal3 in driving the fA\u03b2-induced proinflammatory response and in contributing to a deleterious effect in A\u03b2 clearance.\nRecent transcriptomic analysis of microglia at the singlecell level has identified a common disease-associated microglia phenotype, which has been suggested to be driven by TREM2 and apoE [27, 30, 38] . Interestingly, Krasemann et al. (2017) identified gal3 as one of the most upregulated genes in plaque-associated microglia, supporting our findings in human AD brains and 5xFAD mice [30] . Recently, Yang et al. overexpressed TREM2 in 5xFAD mice (5xFAD/ TREM2) and found gal3 as one of the main genes affected by TREM2 overexpression [34] , suggesting that gal3 plays an important role in microglial function under disease conditions. We generated 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice to answer whether gal3 plays a role in microglia-associated AD pathogenesis and to test if gal3 signaling is associated with TREM2. To answer this question, we performed an inflammatory gene array, demonstrating an age-dependent inflammatory response, involving complement components, chemokines, interleukin receptors, toll-like receptors and DAM genes in 5xFAD mice. This inflammatory response was highly attenuated in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice, thus confirming gal3 as a master regulator of AD-associated brain immune responses. Pathway analysis in mice at 6 and 18 months of age identified TLR and DAP12, a TREM2 signaling adaptor protein, as one of the most significant pathways associated with gal3 in the 5xFAD mice. This gene expression data suggest an important role of gal3 in the AD neuroinflammatory response, perhaps by stimulating NF\u03bab-related regulators whereby TLR4, and/or other TLRs [9, 25] or glycoproteins, such as TREM2 [14, 65] , are involved. Despite the clear connection between gal3-, TLR-and TREM2-related pathways, the regulation of these pathways is not known, and further experimentation is needed.\nConsequently, we investigated whether gal3 interacts with TREM2, a key receptor that has been suggested as a driver of the DAM phenotype. Our confocal microscopy study demonstrated a remarkable cellular colocalization of TREM2 and gal3 in microglial cells around A\u03b2 plaques and a near 100% correspondence between both microglial markers, an indication that gal3 specifically labels DAM. [11, 12] . The ability of gal3 to stimulate TREM2 was finally confirmed by a TREM2-DAP12 reporter cell line. Overall, our data suggest that the switch from homeostatic microglia to DAM is accompanied by significant upregulation of both TREM2 and gal3. Gal3 may thus bind to and activate different microglial receptors including TREM2 (present study), TLR4 [9] , IGFR [33] and MerTK [43] . In fact, because gal3 is relatively promiscuous in its interactions with glycoproteins, it may be behind the chronic and detrimental activation of microglia in AD. Regardless of this possibility, what our study demonstrates is that the pleiotropic activity of gal3 drives important amyloid-associated immune responses. Additionally, our study has uncovered an unexpected role of gal3 as a powerful A\u03b2 binding agent. We have previously demonstrated the ability of LPS-induced reactive microglia to release gal3 [9, 64] . More recently, we have demonstrated a significant increase of gal3 levels in CSF from mice exposed to traumatic brain injury [64] , an indication that gal3 is released by reactive microglia. In this study, we provide evidence that gal3 is actively released by microglia in response to a fA\u03b2 challenge. In APP mice, gal3 is present in the extracellular space and associated with amyloid fibrils (unpublished). Taken together, the possibility that gal3 directly interacts with A\u03b2 to affect aggregation becomes plausible. To test this possibility, we incubated A\u03b2 monomers with or without gal3 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and injected 2 \u00b5l of each condition into either the left or right hippocampi of WT mice. A ThT assay demonstrated fA\u03b2 as the predominant form of A\u03b2 present in both injections. A\u03b2 deposition was analyzed 2 months after injections. While no A\u03b2 deposition was found in animals injected with A\u03b2 monomers alone, co-injection of A\u03b2 monomers and gal3 resulted in evident insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates, suggesting that gal3 is directly involved in A\u03b2 plaque formation. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates long after A\u03b2 brain injections in WT mice. Thus, Meyer-Luehmann et al. [40] injected brain homogenates from aged APP mice in the hippocampus of WT mice and found no evidence of A\u03b2 aggregates 4 months after injection. In contrast, injections of the same brain extracts in AD transgenic mice led to robust deposition of A\u03b2 [15, 28, 40, 44] . Further, repetitive A\u03b2 injections into the hippocampus of WT mice demonstrated that A\u03b2 deposits are drastically reduced from day 1 to day 7 after injections [15] .\nRecently, Heneka et al. have demonstrated that ASC specks released from reactive microglia physically interact with A\u03b2, acting as an A\u03b2 cross-seeding agent [57] . Eliminating microglia has been shown to prevent plaque formation in APP transgenic mice [54] , suggesting that factors released from microglia may seed amyloid plaques. Our study reinforces the view that reactive microglia play a critical role in A\u03b2 plaque dynamics and associated immune responses by releasing A\u03b2 cross-seeding agents (i.e., ASC specks) and gal3. A\u03b2 plaque formation is believed to precede the appearance of clinical symptoms, so elucidating the earlier molecular mechanism involved in A\u03b2 plaque formation appears critical for the establishment of early promising therapeutic strategies aiming at halting the development of AD early. Gal3-inhibition appears to be a promising A\u03b2 therapeutic target. The ability of gal3 to drive proinflammatory fA\u03b2-associated immune responses and hinder A\u03b2 clearance makes this protein a strategic upstream regulator of AD pathology. Indeed, the pathogenic role of gal3 was confirmed in adult 5xFAD mice lacking gal3 as those mice had a significantly lower A\u03b2 load and ameliorated cognitive/ spatial memory deficits, which was observed in the Morris water maze test.\nOur results suggest that LGALS3 gene variants affect the risk of developing AD, as indicated by the 5 SNPs in the LGALS3 gene that we found to be related to increased AD frequency. However, according to the GWAS catalogue (https ://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), none of the variants reported in suppl. Table 3 (online resource 10) or those in linkage disequilibrium with them (suppl. Fig. 3b, online resource 3) , have been previously associated with AD. This could be due to the fact that the GWAS approach requires large samples to detect modest effects, partly due to the multiple testing corrections applied. However, the impact of these LGALS3 SNPs appears to be similar to other SNPs included in the GWAS, supporting a role for this gene in the development of AD. Our meta-analysis only comprised those SNPs belonging to a linkage disequilibrium block located at the 5\u2032-end of the LGALS3 gene, therefore, we do not know if other regions have genetic variants that could lead to stronger effects. At present it is difficult to speculate in what way the SNPs of gal3 is altering the function or expression of the protein.\nFurther replication studies covering the entire genetic region of this locus will be necessary to confirm our results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, we provide evidence that gal3 is a central upstream regulator of the microglial immune response in AD. It drives proinflammatory activation of microglia in response to fA\u03b2 along with impairment of fA\u03b2 degradation and clearance.

Gal3 plays a role as an endogenous TREM2 ligand, a key receptor driving microglial activation in AD. As a result, gal3 inhibition may be a potential pharmacological approach to counteract AD. "}]
