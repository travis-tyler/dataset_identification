In modern, postindustrial society, the lines between work/career and training/education are not only blurred, but increasingly do not follow in orderly succession, nor are they always predictable. People in many sectors of the labor force find themselves needing additional formal or informal education throughout their working lives. Skills considered \"cutting edge\" today may become passe in a relatively brief span of time. Most Americans can anticipate being lifelong learners in the 21st Century. Historically, NCES has fulfilled its mission to report on the condition of education in the United States by focusing on the compulsory and postsecondary education systems. As educational needs and opportunities have grown, NCES has begun to broaden its focus to include both preschoolers and adults. In the past decade, NCES has mounted considerable effort to collect data that examine the educational activities adults pursue, who does and does not participate in adult learning activities, and the barriers to participation. In addition to numerous surveys of postsecondary education participants, two surveys on adult education, and a major assessment of adult literacy, NCES also conducts a series of longitudinal surveys that span the high school years and continue several years after most formal education is completed.

Lifelong learning also extends beyond \"formal\" education, which leads to a degree, to include \"informal\" education, which does not lead to degree attainment. The brief discussion here will not satisfy researchers requiring detailed information about NCES data; nor will this report necessarily answer all the questions that researchers bring to a new analysis. But it provides a comprehensive list of NCES data that are available on most topics pertinent to lifelong learning, and provides guidance on how to obtain more information, including the data files."}, {"section_title": "2.2", "text": "Using NCES data NCES data are a rich resource for researchers interested in national-level statistics. The data sets meet rigorous standards for quality and have undergone extensive review and cleaning. Longitudinal surveys are required to have a response rate of at least 90 percent; cross-sectional 9 2 surveys are required to have response rates of at least 85 percent. A census of public schools usually obtains close to 100 percent of all institutions reporting. For these reasons, researchers using NCES data may be confident when they report national-level statistics. The picture changes, however, when analysts' research questions involve special populations or less than national-level populations. Although the sample size of some data sets may appear to be sufficient to conduct lower-level analyses, caution should be used. For example, with the exception of NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress), it is usually inappropriate to use NCES sample surveys to conduct state-level analyses. In fact, many public-use data sets do not contain state identifiers. (Restricted-use data are available for some NCES studies and often include state variables. For procedures to access restricted-use data, see Appendix.) On the other hand, universe surveys covering a whole population, as is the case with the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (WEDS), may be used to generalize about individual states."}, {"section_title": "2.3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Report overview", "text": "All NCES data sets that report on the educational efforts of adults (ages 16 and older) are included in this report.

NPSAS is a nationwide study of students enrolled in degree-granting institutions, less-than-2year institutions and community colleges. Each NPSAS survey has included at least 50,000 students from more than 1,000 institutions. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, NPSAS includes a longitudinal component and collects baseline data for a specified cohort of students.

The topics in this section are divided into four general groupings based on survey type and survey population: (1) longitudinal data on high school students; (2) cross-sectional data on postsecondary students; (3) longitudinal data on postsecondary students; and (4) cross-sectional data on adults. The section begins with the longitudinal data on high school students. The three surveys that fall into this category were each started while the survey subjects were in secondary schoolone while they were in eighth grade, one when they were in tenth or twelfth grades, and one when they were twelfth graders. For the purpose of lifelong learning, these surveys are useful because they follow the students as they leave high school and enter adult roles, usually work and family formation or postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "3.1", "text": "Longitudinal data on secondary school students In the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 former twelfth-graders were followed for 14 years; with the High School and Beyond Study, former sophomores were last surveyed 10 years after most had graduated from high school in 1982; and in the National Education Longitudinal Study, the former eighth graders of 1988 will again be surveyed in 2000, eight years after most graduated from high school. With each of these studies, it is possible to examine a cohort's posthigh school transition and to make inter-cohort comparisons. NLS-72 was the first longitudinal study conducted by NCES; this survey documents a cohort of students as they left high school and entered adult life. Participants in the study were selected in the spring of 1972 when they were seniors in high school. As shown in table 3 below, the records include data collected during the base year (1972) through a fifth follow-up (1986). It should be noted, however, that findings from NLS-72 can be generalized only to adults who were in the high school class of 1972."}, {"section_title": "High School and Beyond (HS&B): Sophomore class of 1980 and senior class of 1982", "text": "HS&B was the second longitudinal survey that NCES conducted. It began with two cohorts of students in 1980those who were high school sophomores and those who were seniors. Subsequent follow-ups tracked their entry into the work force and/or postsecondary education for up to ten years after high school for the sophomore cohort and six years after high school for the senior cohort. Questions about educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, dropping out of high school (after the lOth grade) and community activities may be addressed with these data. Many survey questions in HS&B were designed to parallel those asked in NLS-72.  Selected data analyses also may be conducted using the Data Analysis System (DAS), available on CD and via the Internet (see the NCES website, www.nces.ed.gov/das/). The research questions that could be addressed using HS&B data are similar to those listed in the previous section on NLS. In addition, the following research issues could be addressed with HS&B data: How, when, and why do students, particularly older students, enroll in postsecondary education? Among those who had aspirations to complete a bachelor's degree, what are the differences in the characteristics of degree completers versus those who did not complete degrees? Do individuals who continue their education through the period of early adulthood earn more than those who do not? What is the effect of student financial aid on students who return to postsecondary education for either bachelor's or advanced degrees? For other types of education? What are the characteristics of people who enter the work force full-time in the area for which they are qualified compared with those who do not enter in their major field of study?

The sample is nationally representative of eighth-grade students in 1988. Longitudinal or cross-sectional data analyses may be conducted using various waves of the study. The multiple survey components are listed in table 5 below; appropriate units of analysis are the individual subjects (who were eighth-graders in 1988), their parents (base-year only), and their schools (base-year only). Cases were added (the \"freshened\" sample) with each wave of the survey to include sufficient numbers to provide national estimates for cross-sectional analyses. The first wave of data collection for NELS:88 surveyed eighth graders in 1988, and the most recent wave of the study was conducted in 1994, two years after the majority of respondents had completed high school. As indicated in table 5 below, NELS contained data from multiple sources including parents, school administrators, teachers, and school records. NELS is a valuable source of information about high school dropouts and \"stop-outs\" (those who did not complete high school \"on time\", but then returned to complete high school or attain a GED). How do recent high school graduates who continue their education differ from those who do not? How do non-college attenders who say they plan to return to school differ from those who do not have plans for further education? As with previous longitudinal studies, the findings from NELS:88 can be generalized only to adults who were part of the original NELS cohorts, rather than to all adults. 2 5 "}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "WEDS surveys2.

All data collected by WEDS are public and available on the Internet; early releases of data are also available on the Internet. When data are finalized for release, with a typical lag time of about two years from the time of data collection, they are available on CD accompanied by software to facilitate access. The latest CD was issued in May 1998 and included data for five academic years, 1991-92 through 1995-96.

One objective of BPS was to design a study that includes both traditional and non-traditional students. Following students after they have entered postsecondary institutions allows analysts to compare traditional and non-traditional students concerning the relationships between work and education and the effects of postsecondary education. The BPS provides a rich source of data for analyses on topics related to postsecondary education, including information from postsecondary transcripts and financial aid records for the entire undergraduate career. Because NPSAS data are linked with BPS, information about family background (as reported by parents) prior to undergraduate admission are available, as well as student and school reports of academic persistence, educational aspirations, and various demographic information. BPS data are available only in restricted-use form, although many variables are included in the DAS for BPS. Information about either format is available on the Internet. In addition to those listed for NPSAS, possible research topics that can be addressed with BPS data include the following: What are the differences in persistence and attainment between traditional and non-traditional students? Which non-traditional students are most likely to enter graduate school? Which non-traditional students are most likely to drop out of baccalaureate programs and to return to postsecondary education? What educational and work experiences are related to persistence and degree attainment? Do non-traditional part-time (or discontinuous) students have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent students? How do nontraditional students compare to traditional students in these categories? What are the similarities and differences between traditional and non-traditional students regarding their educational goals and finances and their timing and entry into graduate The B&B is a longitudinal survey; the base-year survey consists of NPSAS:93 students who completed their baccalaureate degrees in the 1992-93 academic year. The survey was, administered to a nationally representative sample of students who where graduating in 1992-93. Follow-up surveys have been conducted in 1994 and 1997, including the collection of undergraduate transcript records in 1994. The plan is to follow each B&B cohort for 12 years, covering the period when most students, including those who enroll in graduate school, make the transition to employment. The data collected in the first year after graduation (the first followup, with NPSAS being the base year) may be treated as cross-sectional data and are comparable to the previous, Recent College Graduates survey (RCG)3. Of particular policy interest in B&B are the career paths of those students who enter public service areas, especially teaching. All of the NPSAS data components (the Student Record Abstract, the Student Interview, and the Parent Survey) described above are available as the base year of B&B. About 11,000 students who completed their degrees in the 1992-93 academic year were included in the first B&B (B&B:93). The First Follow-up (1994) includes student interview data and undergraduate transcripts. With these data, employment and enrollment patterns may be explored for sub-groups of degree recipients, including students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students from families with low incomes, and older students. B&B data are available only in restricted-use form, although many variables are included in the DAS for BPS. Information about either format is available on the Internet. Possible research topics that could be addressed using B&B include most of those listed above for NPSAS and BPS. In addition, B&B can address the following research questions: What is the relationship between family status and entry to graduate school? Are there differences for traditional and non-traditional students? What is the effect of postsecondary education on the economic outcomes for non-traditional versus traditional students? What are there differences between bachelor-degree recipients who continue their education and those who do not? To what extent do bachelor-degree recipients obtain employment in an occupation consistent with their major field of study? Are there differences in earnings between those who work in their field and those who do not? 3.4 Cross-sectional data on adults Cross-sectional studies do not afford the opportunity to examine change over time, unless there are repeated measures taken over time. This section describes three cross-sectional studies, two of which were repeated, at least in part, so that changes in the populations studied could be examined over time. The NALS consists of two componentsa literacy assessment and a background questionnaire. The literacy assessment is comprised of three literacy scales that measure the ability to perform tasks that simulate real-life experiences. Literacy was measured along three dimensions: (1) prose literacythe ability to understand and use information from texts such as editorials, Public NALS data are accessible through the Internet (www.nces.ed.gov/nadlits/data.html) and consist of three primary data files (the prison sample, sample of adults who were paid and adults who were not paid) and three spreadsheet files containing prose, document, and quantitative literacy item parameters (from a three-parameter item response theory model). . The International Adult Literacy Survey was a collaborative project designed to inform both education and labor market policy and program development activities in participating countries. Originally conducted in seven countries (Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, "}, {"section_title": "37", "text": "The background survey5 has nine sections including (1) general information covering country of origin, immigration history, and educational attainment; (2) linguistic information, (3) parental information; (4) labor force information; (5) reading and writing (at work) and looking for work; (6) adult education; (7) reading and writing (general); (8) family literacy; and 9 Among respondents with the lowest literacy scores, are there differences between countries in respondent attitudes about wanting to increase their literacy level? How do literacy levels vary by country and economic opportunity; i.e., is there a greater deleterious effect of a low literacy level in some countries compared with others? Respondents were asked the names of courses, number of separate adult education activities, the general subject matter, reason for taking the course, course sponsors and location, employer requirements, instructional practices, education financing and costs, class length, completion status, and, in the 1991 survey, class work to prepare for naturalization as a citizen. If the respondents had not taken any adult education, they were asked what factors deterred them from enrolling in adult education. All respondents also were asked if they had used a public library. The NHES:95 largely repeated questions from NHES:91, but divided adult education activities into seven categories: English-as-a-second-language; basic skills and GED preparation; credential programs; apprenticeship; career-or job-related activities; other formal structured activities; and computer-only or video-only instruction. Detailed information about adult 39 education activities is available, although analysts are cautioned about the complexity of the data, as respondents may have participated in more than one activity. NHES:91 and NHES:95 data are available on CD. ECB software comes with the data files to assist analysts in extracting the sample of their choice. Public-use and restricted-use data files are available. The types of research topics that may be explored with the NHES adult education surveys include the following: What are the characteristics of those who participate in adult education compared to nonparticipants? What are the patterns of adult education participation (by demographic and labor force characteristics)? In what types of programs do adults participate? What kinds of support (employer-sponsored or other financial support) do participants receive? How does the type of education activity change over the life span (i.e., do older adults engage in different kinds of activities than those who are younger)? The RCG was designed to produce national estimates on the potential supply of new elementary and secondary teachers; however, these data also may be used for analyses of the immediate postdegree employment and education experiences of bachelor's or master's degree recipients from colleges or universities in the United States. The RCG sample was drawn from the universe of postsecondary students within one year after attaining a bachelor's or master's degree. The 1991 RCG study used a two-stage sampling design. The first stage consisted of drawing a stratified sample of schools, using IPEDS institutions as the initial sampling frame. The second stage called for the selection of a core sample of 18,000 graduates from the selected institutions. Oversampling was done to ensure adequate sample sizes for groups of interest including blacks, Hispanics, math and physical science bachelor degree recipients, and education majors. The RCG was conducted sporadically from 1976 to 1991. In 1994, NCES replaced the RCG with Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B, discussed above). The RCG provides data on the relationship between courses taken, student achievement, and occupational outcomes. Transcript data also are available for 1987 bachelor degree recipients, including courses taken at up to five postsecondary institutions. Data components in RCG include date of graduation; field of study; graduates newly qualified to teach; further enrollment; financial aid; employment status; job characteristics and earnings; and demographic information. RCG data are available on CD as restricted-use files. There is no DAS for the RCG.
