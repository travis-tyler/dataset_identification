In the ninth article, a novel quantitative parameter, the stress-to-rest ratio of the signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR), was proposed to quantify the myocardial perfusion image generated from a cadmium-zinctelluride (CZT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanner. Results from the study demonstrated that the RSNR was a useful index to assist the diagnosis of triple-vessel disease. Now, more and more physicians and scientists are interested to use artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning for assistance in medical image-based diagnosis. In the sixth paper, the authors proposed to use two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), V-Net and W-Net, for lesion detection on 68 Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT images. e deep learning method was evaluated by phantom-based simulation data and multiple myeloma 68 Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT patient study. Traditional machine learning methods for tumor detection including random forest classifier (RF), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM) were also applied to the same data sets for comparison. Results from the study showed that the proposed deep learning method with PETand CT provided highest lesion detection accuracy.\nFunctional MRI of the brain's (FMRIB's) linked independent component analysis (FLICA) is a data-driven approach for multimodal image data analysis. e authors in the fifth paper applied FLICA to FDG PET images collected from Huashan Hospital and multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies. ey found that some brain regions were negatively correlated with age, and the correlations between those brain regional SUVRs and 3 clinical assessments were significantly improved if age correction was applied to SUVRs.\nIn the past years, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been considered as an important and potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes. Reportedly, results of BAT imaging can be varied under different conditions such as cold exposure and thyroid hormone levels. In this special issue, two groups have reported their results from preclinical mouse imaging or human imaging. e authors in the seventh paper showed that spectral unmixing imaging with a near-infrared fluorescent probe could be used to dissect the imaging signal from BAT activation and BAT mass. In addition, the authors in the fourth paper showed that elevated TSH condition before RIT, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism had no significant impact on BAT visualization with FDG PET-CT imaging.\ne researchers in the tenth paper previously demonstrated that 111 In-labeled autologous leukocyte scintigraphy could be used to detect osteomyelitis in living juvenile pigs. To further confirm the exact location and better image interpretation, imaging after euthanasia is always necessary. In this paper, they indicated that SPECT/CT with the same imaging probe at 24 hours after euthanasia could provide the same detectability of osteomyelytic lesions as in living pigs."}, {"section_title": "Yun Zhou", "text": "Jie Lu Chongzhao Ran Jianhua Zhang"}]
