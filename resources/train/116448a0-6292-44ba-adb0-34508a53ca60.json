[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Data visualization (Blasius, 1998;Sutherland et al., 2000) is a graphical tool for understanding abstract relationships among variables and it is frequently used to help interpret the meaning of data collected for scientific purposes in many disciplines, such as biology (Chiu, Chiu, Lin, & Moore, 2000;Chiu, Wang, Chiu, Lin, & Moore, 1999), data mining (Sutherland et al., Rossini, Lumley, Lewin-Koh, Dickerson, Cox, & Cook, 2000), digital imaging (Fayyad & Smyth, 1999), educational testing (Chiu, 2001;Friendly, 1999), finance (SPSS, 2001a;Viscovery, 2001), healthcare and medical research (Eddy et al., 1999;Lumley & Heagerty, 2000), market research (SPSS, 2001b), software engineering (Church & Helfman, 1993), statistics (Hyndman, Bashtannyk, Grunwald, 1996;Madigan, Mosurski, & Almond, 1997;Muruzabal & Munoz, 1997;Solka, Poston, & Wegman, 1995;Theus & Lauer, 1999;Tukey, 1993), telephone network analysis (Wills, 1999), and other disciplines including cognitive psychology (Boyack, Wylie, & Davidson, 2001) and survey analysis (Clark, Cleveland, Denby, & Liu, 1997). Many have indicated that visualization goes hand-in-hand with traditional statistical techniques to solve problems and to analyze massive datasets (Nielson, Brunet, Gross, Hagen, & Klimenko, 1994). Among the many advantages, graphical methods compensate traditional statistical techniques by displaying massive data points in one or multiple graphs such that the global data patterns can be comprehended while several level of details can be revealed. Data visualization techniques can be very useful for social and behavioral sciences, particularly when we have categorical data collected in longitudinal research (hereafter multidimensional data). Recently, many have developed cutting-edge techniques and frameworks for graphical displays (e.g., Carey, 2002;Chen, 1999;Ligges, 2002;McCulloch & Barnard, 2002;Narasimhan, 2002;Swayne & Lane, 2002;Unwin, 2002). However, displaying categorical data remains a challenge (e.g., Friendly, 2002). Regardless the technological innovations, we do not find an appropriate method for displaying survey data collected by the government. In this paper, we first discuss some challenges faced by survey analysts in displaying multidimensional data. Second, we propose a method followed by an illustrated example using an occupational survey."}, {"section_title": "Occupational Data", "text": "Visualization tools that can capture complex relationships for longitudinal and categorical data are particularly in demand, as described by Syverson (1996), who calls for research methodologists to develop ways to track, visualize, and interpret panel data, in particular, the job change patterns for doctorates. Syverson stated: \"If any of you have really clever ways to follow career paths, we would love to look at your survey, so that we can benefit from your experience\u2026 how do you efficiently collect information on all of the possible things that people do in 10 years, we don't have a solution to this yet. If someone in this group has a clever way to do that, a matrix or a way to code this, we would love to see it and to use it.\" In light of developing a graphical method to facilitate data analysis for policy and decision making, we have developed a graphical method, SEER (SEE Repeated data), which 1. is a process-oriented and interpretable tool for fitting and displaying categorical data with a time-dependent variable; 2. enables multiple-group comparisons that do not require the multiple groups to be mutually exclusive; 3. saves time for policy makers, analysts, and researchers to understand the trends in longitudinal data measured at the nominal level or higher; 4. stresses on unique combinations of category; 5. is designed to present massive amounts of data and can show the dynamics of changes that occur among categories without requiring a colored plot to show the dynamics; 6. does not require extensive knowledge in graphical techniques to understand the context, and; 7. is accompanied by matrix notations to enable its implementations to be software independent."}, {"section_title": "Illustrations", "text": "To illustrate the concepts of the SEER method, we use the following table to show the occupation history of ten hypothetical survey respondents in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999. For simplicity, we used only three occupations, namely computer system analysts, statisticians, and lawyers and judges. The three-digit codes shown in the table are actual codes printed on the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). As displayed, the majority of the respondents (six) are employed as computer system analysts and they stayed in the same occupation category across the four survey years. Respondents #7 and #8 worked as a statistician. Similar to the computer system analysts, the statisticians stayed on the same job across all the survey years. This stable trend can be observed for the last two respondents who were classified as lawyers and judges. Overall, one can conclude that doctorate holders appeared to exhibit a high degree of stability throughout 1993 and 1999. The three occupations had no changes from one year to another. Such a scenario represents one of the ideal cases of occupation stability. The scenario can be visually represented by the following three-dimensional graph. Each column represents the occupation of a doctoral recipient in one of the four years they responded to the biennial survey. Because there were four survey years, each occupation has four sets of columns. The axis labeled \"Years / Occupations\" is used to identify the occupation of the recipients in the four survey years. For example, doctoral recipient #1 (in the back of the graph) was a computer system analyst in 1993. The stable occupation for this particular recipient is indicated by the locations of the four side-by-side columns. Had the doctoral recipient shifted jobs from being a computer system analyst to being a statistician in the 1997 and 1999 survey years, one would have seen two of the respondents' columns standing in the block denoted \"statisticians.\" The graphical representation has a number of advantages over the categorical representation in the table format. First, it provides a bird's eye view of occupational change over time for all job categories. Every pattern of occupation status is associated with a trend that can be viewed with little effort. Second, the graphical representation can capture massive amounts of data all at once. By reducing the dimension of the 3-D graph to two dimensions, one can represent thousands or even tens of thousands of occupations in one graph. Indeed, we experimented plotting 40,000 cases using this approach in a twodimension plot and we still could see a clear pattern in a real data set. Indeed, using the zooming features (e.g., zoom in and out), available in many statistical packages (e.g., SAS, SPSS, and MATLAB) and a dynamic look-up table (which associate each data point with additional information such as age), we were able to apply the SEER method interactively."}, {"section_title": "THE SEER TECHNIQUE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Single-case scenario", "text": "Assume that a longitudinal dataset is analyzed and each case in the dataset has four measurements or observations (e.g., four survey years). Further assume that the variable of interest is a categorical variable that can take on five values (e.g., 1: computer & mathematical sciences, 2: life sciences, 3: physical sciences, 4: social sciences, and 5: engineering). In a hypothetical case where a person is employed as a computer scientist in the first and last survey years but is employed as an engineer in the middle two years, the person would have a categorical vector of data reflecting the occupations reported in the four survey cycles: [1 5 5 1]. We use a hash function (Ford & Topp, 1996), Equation 1, to convert this vector into a binary vector with only zeros and ones. This binary vector is then plotted in a scatterplot (Glass & Hopkins, 1996). The variable s in Equation 1is a spacing factor, which spaces out each category so that the plot will not be too dense for visual interpretation and examination. For example, assuming that we desire to insert three spaces to separate each category (s = 3) and we are interested in displaying the second (t = 2) categorical data point (c = 5) among the four data points (n t = 4) collected from a survey respondent, we can apply Equation (1  where is the index or cell position of a data point in the binary vector; the value of a is data point in the categorical vector; is the number of observations or the row size of the categorical mat In practice, a data set frequently contains multiple cases as opposed to only one case. It is useful to represent Equation (1) in a vectorized form, or matrix notations, which can handle all observations of all n p cases simultaneously. To this end, we developed a hash function to map the categorical data points onto a two-dimensional space using Equation (2). Specifically, we use a matrix X to represent a data set for the n t observations of the n p cases. Each element in matrix X can take on any discrete value between 1 and c and for this reason, X is denoted as a categorical matrix. Equation 2shows a vectorized version of the hash function shown in Equation 1. In general, it has a linear form o x = kx + b where x and b are vectors for intermediate computations and k is a scaling constant (i.e., x is a vectorized form of the data matrix X and b is a shifting vector). More generally, kx represents a between-category shifting factor and b a within-category shifting factor for the location of the categorical data.  (1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999); and (d) were employed in at least one of the four aforementioned survey years. The panel of 14,901 respondents represented a population of over half a million doctoral degree holders in the United States. For employment research purposes, the occupational titles of the SDR respondents were recorded every two years using a standardized list of approximately 126 occupations, which were in turn grouped into six major categories, namely computer and mathematical sciences, life and related sciences, physical and related sciences, social and related sciences, engineering, and non science and engineering. The occupational titles were coded as a categorical variable (e.g., \"052\" represents Computer System Analysts). We used the SEER technique to address two substantive research questions. "}, {"section_title": "Figure 1: Relationship Between Occupations and Educational Fields", "text": "Three obvious patterns emerge in Figure 1. First, a diagonally dominant pattern suggested that many graduates from each of the five Science and Engineering (S&E) disciplines have been employed in occupations related to their doctorate degrees for multiple years, while the off-diagonals indicates the amount of switching to other occupational disciplines. Second, the dense column labeled \"non S&E\" in the right side of the figure suggested that a considerable number of science and engineering doctorates have worked in what NSF classifies as non-science and engineering disciplines for a good portion of their career, assuming that the biennial report reflects a stable occupation until the next report. Third, the dense column labeled \"logical skips\" indicated that every one of the five educational fields has doctorate recipients whose occupations were not recorded due to logical skips. Due to the considerable number of logical skips, we further investigated the reasons for which respondents did not report their occupations. This is accomplished by separating those who skipped with known reasons (NSF did not require retirees and managers to report their occupations and hence they skipped the occupational question) and those who skipped with unknown reasons. Consequently, we added two categories \"retirees\" and \"managers\" and graphically reanalyzed the data. Using the SEER graphs, we found that: (1) relatively few respondents entered the computer and mathematical sciences profession from life and related sciences, nor from social and related sciences; (2) among those who \"exited\" the profession, a considerable number of respondents either retired or became managers including those managing in computer and mathematics settings and those managing in other settings; and (3) it is very rare for a non working retiree to reenter the workforce in the discipline computer and mathematical sciences. See Chiu and Fecso (under review) for a more in-depth discussion."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "Frequently, researchers in social, behavioral, economical, psychometrical, and marketing sciences need a tool for exploring the patterns of longitudinal data from a survey in which data are observed in the nominal scale. To this end, we developed the SEER technique, which can display massive amounts of categorical data all at once. The technique is equipped with a feature to create a panel of visual displays suitable for presenting data with a large number of categories (over 100 categories). This feature is especially useful when it becomes overwhelming to view too many categories in one graph. In addition, the SEER technique can summarize cross-classified longitudinal data (i.e., a data point has multiple group memberships such as occupations). This is an important feature because it empowers researchers to graphically examine survey respondents with multiple concurrent jobs (e.g., several part-time jobs) and examine those with job responsibilities cutting across several job titles. Having applied the SEER method in a national sample, we visually found that: (1) a considerable number of doctorate recipients in Science and Engineering tend to work in the same discipline as their degree field (see Figure 1) and (2) in some disciplines such as computer and mathematical sciences, doctorate recipients are much more likely (approximately two times as likely) to work in the discipline when their degree field matches their occupation. Chiu and Fecso (under review) illustrates the applications of using panels of SEER plots to draw the second conclusion. In addition to occupational data that are measured in categorical values, Chiu (2002) applies the SEER method to display large score difference for repeat test takers of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Although in the current paper, we have illustrated the SEER method using data from the Science and Engineering disciplines, the method can be applied to other areas. For researchers interested in careers for legal professionals, they may use the SEER plots to examine the effects of undergraduate majors on the first 10 years of career paths for law school graduates who have passed the Bar Examination."}]
