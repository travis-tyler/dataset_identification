[{"section_title": "LIST O F TA B LES", "text": "viii ABSTRACT I present a quantitative stu d y of habitat use, secondary production, an d trophic export by intertidal nekton. I used 1.75 m 2 drop rings and throw rings to sam ple com m unities of shallow w ater nekton at h ig h and low tides in salt m arshes, intertidal flats, a n d seagrass beds (Ruppia maritima). Thirty-tw o species of nekton w ere captured betw een June a n d O ctober 1995, with a m ean overall a bundance of 28.6 inds m '2 and a mean biomass of 3.8 g m '2 (dry weight). The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, was the biom ass dom inant species. Seagrass a n d m arsh edge habitats were extensively used by all sizes of blue crab, from recruiting juvenile to adult. Yearto-year variation w as seen betw een 1995 an d 1996 in blue crab recruitm ent. Palaemonetes shrim p were the m o st abundant nekton in the study, and interesting p a tte rn s of allopatry and app aren t sym patry w ere found am ong the three species inhabiting this area. Fundulus heteroclitus, F. majalis, an d Lucania parva w ere the dom inant m arsh resid e n t fishes, while Gobiosoma bosc w as the m ost abundant fish in seagrass habitats. C ertain sciaenids used m arsh habitats in a tran sien t or opportunistic m anner, as did Menidia menidia. The m arsh surface w as apparently u se d as a night-tim e refuge by M. menidia. Behavioral p attern s for five m arsh residents (F. heteroclitus, F. majalis, L. parva, G. bosc, a n d P. intermedius) differed from p attern s reported elsew here. This is taken as evidence of behavioral flexibility in habitat use betw een regions. On the com m unity level, each sam pled habitat saw a unique p a tte rn of use. Seagrass a n d m arsh edge areas both supported a large biomass of nekton at high tide, b u t seagrass habitats held g reater densities of nekton. Fundulids, blue crabs, Palaemonetes pugio and transient fishes u se d m arsh surface habitats at high tide an d took low -tide refuge in adjacent habitats. Secondary production in m arsh habitats was estim ated at approxim ately 7.4 -8.0 gdw m '2150 d '1 (28.4 -30.7 gww m'2 150 d '1) for the entire salt m arsh nekton com m unity between June and October, 1995 (150 days) if corrected for poorly sam pled sm all size classes and for the rem oval efficiency of the gear. G ut contents of nekton were exam ined, a n d a m athem atical m odel was constructed to estimate consum ption by nekton in m arsh and unvegetated habitats. The m odel also estim ates export of anim al tissue as predation by transient species. Predation on invertebrates w as h ighest in m arsh edge areas, at 44.2 gdw m'2 150 d 'l of anim al prey rem oved; p redation at the edge by transients (export) was 28.0 gdw m '2 150 d*1. The value of m arsh edge w as clearly linked to both the vegetated and the unvegetated sides of the interface as refuge and feeding. Predation in the entire marsh area flooded at m ean high tide was approxim ately 13 g d w m '2150 d '1, and transient export was 5.6 gdw m '2150 d '1. The m ajor path for export from m arsh interior habitats into deeper w aters was blue crab p red atio n on the m arsh resident crabs Uca and Sesarma. Predation in unvegetated areas w as 13.3 -17.0 gdw m'2 150 d 1 and export w as 8.0 -11.7 gdw m '2 150 d '1. The unvegetated intertidal w as an im portant resource for nekton d u e to long periods of inundation and abundant polychaete prey. The largest p a rt of the in tertid al nekton com m unity used all three habitat types (m arsh, unvegetated, and seagrass), and the trophic contribution of each habitat w as significant.

W ater, m obilized by the tw ice-daily action of the tides, continuously floods and drains these areas. M obile aquatic anim als follow the tidal pulses into a n d out of each habitat. In this way, the various shallow w ater habitats are connected by the m oving w ater and by the associated organisms.

The major goals of this project are to q uantitatively exam ine tidally-driven pattern s of habitat use by nekton in shallow w aters, to examine production of these nekton on the salt m arsh, and to estimate the flows of biomass an d trophic en ergy that connect habitats.

John Clark (1974) identified m arshes as \"param ount am ong the vital areas of m any coastal ecosystems\". Yet the im p o rtan t trophic energy transfer processes w ithin m arshes, and those that connect m arshes to other w aters are poorly understood and have never been directly quantified on an ecosystem scale. This project contributes to a better u n d erstan d in g of the larger scale ecological processes involved in betw een-habitat energy transfer. The project also adds to our know ledge of habitat use by shallow w ater nekton. These are im portant goals tow ards an im proved understanding of m arsh and estuarine function. Many aspects of p red ato r -prey interactions in estuarine ecosystem s are well described in the scientific literature. Trophic energy transfer betw een m arshes, shallow w aters, and deeper w aters is less well studied, how ever, and m any im portant questions rem ain unansw ered (Kneib 1997a). T hayer et al. (1978)  This project attem pts to address three gaps that exist in m arsh habitat an d energy flow research. First, m ost studies are reductionist and do not consider the entire com m unity (M attila 1992). M any insightful papers (Kneib and Stiven 1982, Q u am m en 1984, Wiltse et al. 1984, M clvor and O dum 1988 concentrate on one or a few predator-prey relationships. Other projects have focused on one area along a m arsh-to-open w ater gradient: Teal (1962) prim arily investigated low er trophic levels on the m arsh surface, Nixon and O viatt (1973) focused on a shallow subtidal em baym ent, w hile W einstein and W alters (1981) looked a t fish in subtidal m arsh creeks. Second, several m arsh energy transfer studies (Rountree an d Able 1992a, 1992b d o not quantify the described flows of energy on a per square m eter basis. Third, m ost of the studies that are quantitative exam ine biom ass, b u t do not investigate production. Production characterizes energy flow, grow th, and yield (Diaz and Schaffner 1990). Each of the p roblem s m entioned above can be solved by the use of easily deployable gear that sam ples effectively along an entire estuarine d ep th gradient. M y project uses sam pling gear that is q u an titativ e in the habitats of concern a n d give results th at allow valid com parisons betw een habitats. This dissertation includes habitat use determ inations a nd secondary production w o rk A practical objective of m y study is to help coastal m anagers develop and im plem ent m ore realistic habitat protection and restoration plans. Both land use m anagers a n d fisheries scientists benefit from a better understanding of m arsh trophic dynamics. H oude a n d R utherford (1993) m ention that \"an incom plete knowledge of trophic dependencies and transfer efficiencies lim its the ability to p redict estuarine fishery production an d y ields\"; this is an area that needs research. A m ore detailed knowledge of interdependencies betw een estuarine habitats is vital to m anaging an d protecting overall estuarine function. The case for protecting shallow w ater ecosystem s is stronger if those ecosystems can be trophically a n d econom ically linked to deeper w aters an d to fisheries species. Boesch and Turner (1984) state that \"In addition to the inherent scientific im portance of the food and refuge issues, understanding the functional relationships betw een fishery production and coastal w etlan d s is of great practical im portance.\" I hope to address som e of these issues through the analysis of trophic transfer from shallow w aters to deeper w aters via predation.

Enclosure traps tend to underestim ate densities of all fishes by a factor of 0.81 for aim 2 d ro p trap, and in p articular to underestim ate densities of large fishes (Jacobsen and Kushlan 1987). These lim itations of the sam pling gear m ust be considered in evaluating reported fish densities. M itigating factors in the particular case of m y dissertation are the generally turbid w aters of C hesapeake Bay and the focus of this project on vegetated habitats. Both of these factors help to visually obscure the approaching gear; in addition, the vegetation m ay provide a perceived refuge for nekton a n d m ay decrease the inclination to flee. Sam ples taken from unvegetated h ab itats and, particularly, low tid e (shallow ) unvegetated h a b ita ts should be interpreted w ith these issues in m ind.

In spite of the above m entioned concerns w ith drop trap gear, it is difficult to envision an easily em ployed m ethod that w ould avoid these problem s and provide as m uch sam pling precision over the m arsh, unvegetated, a n d SAV habitats investigated in this project. All existing sam pling gears are subject to som e form of bias (Rozas and M inello 1997). D rop traps are no exception, b u t at this point in the science no better options m ay exist for shallow w ater fish capture a n d quantification in different habitats. In fact, drop sam plers a re the only gear type recom m ended highly for all shallow w a te r habitats I sam pled (Rozas a n d M inello 1997). to cut through thick m arsh vegetation and form an effective seal w ith the sedim ent. A lighter (24 kg or 52 pounds) shallow -w ater m odel of this was used as a throw trap w here w ater depths precluded sam pling from a boat; it also h a d a diam eter of 1.48 m but was effective only in short form Spartina altemiflora, in SAV beds, a n d in unvegetated habitats because it lacked the w eight to cut th ro u g h the heavy vegetation of tall form S. altemiflora. These cylinders were p o u n d e d into the sedim ent as necessary by jum ping on a plank laid across the top of the ring to ensure an effective low er seal. The ring w as dro p p ed or throw n in a different location each time. A random num bers table was used to select a 5 m x 5 m area for sam pling; the exact placem ent of the ring w ithin this area w as then haphazard. The order in w hich habitats w ere sam pled w as selected w ith a random num bers table. W ind force on the drop cylinder frequently caused steering problem s in field use w ith a vessel. This was d u e to the large lever arm created by the extending boom. O ne person poling the boat or p u sh in g from the stem (as in M inello et al. 1994) was unable to control the boat at or m ore knots of w ind. Rather than adopt tw o procedures for differing w ind speeds, a single procedure was developed to allow consistent deploym ents by tw o people at all w ind speeds betw een 0 and 20 knots. The boat was rigged with m ast and boom several h u ndred m eters from the deploym ent area and the m otor w as never intentionally raised above idle speed (900 rpm ) once in the sam pling area. The boat w as pow ered by a up-tilted outboard m otor at idling speed to typically w ithin 10 -30 m eters (depending on w ind strength) of the random ly selected site. A t this point the m otor w as shut off an d the boat allowed to glide the rem aining distance to the site. Once the drop ring was over the proper habitat stra tu m (see below) the ring w as allow ed to free fall. The 2.5 cm diam eter pull line m oved o v er large polyurethane rollers on greased stainless steel shafts so that silence was m aintained until the device struck the w ater. Silence w as m aintained in the boat as m uch as possible d u rin g the entire period of sam pling, a n d especially in the m om ents approaching a sam pling site. N onetheless, the d ro p p in g of the ring itself and the procedure of rem oving organisms from the ring did constitute a disturbance of the sam pling area, and potentially affected subsequent sam ples. The interval betw een sam ples was always greater than 20 m inutes, and no sam ples w ere taken closer them 50 m eters from the previous sam ple. Avoidance is of particular concern in the sam pling of large transient p red ato rs such as seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) th at have the m obility to leave a sam p lin g area entirely. A som ew hat different procedure w as developed for deploym ent of throw rings. The ring used for this procedure was supported by an internal crosspiece m ade of wood, alum inum , stainless steel, and epoxy. The crosspiece supported one h andle for m anaging the ring an d was connected to the ring at five points w ith rem ovable fasteners. A nother handle w as affixed to the outside of the ring itself. For sam pling on the m arsh surface, the ring and the plank used for jum ping on the ring w ere carried to w ithin 10 meters of w here the operator w ould stand to throw the ring. The operator w ould then w ait for several m inutes to allow any fish disturbed by the approach to retu rn to the area, then w alk the ring at a predesignated tim e to the predesignated spot and throw . The throw w as initiated w ith the ring in a vertical position, facing the site to be sam pled. A good throw w ould place the ring alm ost 3 m eters above the w ater surface at the apex and at least 4 m eters from the operator upon landing, m easured from the center of the ring. In order to seal properly, the ring m ust fall straight dow n at the end of its trajectory and land horizontally so that the cutting edge of the ring strikes the sedim ent at the sam e instant around the entire circumference. In throwing, it w as necessary to attain as m uch altitude w ith the ring as possible to allow sufficient hang time that forw ard m otion of the ring w as nearly arrested by air resistance by the time the ring landed. This produced the necessary straight vertical fall. The flat horizontal landing of the ring w as achieved by placing a very slight forw ard spin on the ring from the initial vertical position so that the ring had rotated exactly 90 degrees at the instant of landing. Given that the ring w eighed 24 kg (over fifty pounds) and was aw kw ard to handle, this procedure required a fair am ount of practice. After throw ing, the operator w ould run the plank to the ring, place the plank on top of the ring, and jum p up and dow n to create a good seal w ith the substrate. In practice, the ring typically sealed around 90 -95% of the circumference upon initially landing, and the jum ping procedure was used to seal any rem aining gaps caused by irregular topography of the m arsh surface. Even after m uch practice with the ring, it was still necessary to redo m any sam ples because of inadequate sealing to the m arsh surface caused by pits in the m arsh, shell clum ps of Geukensia demissa un d er the edge of the ring, or poor throw ing procedure. The decision to redo a sam ple was always m ade before emptying the ring so as to avoid scientist bias. The ring was alw ays checked com pletely for a satisfactorily seal prior to em ptying; if the ring was em ptied, then the collected sam ple was retained for analysis. In unvegetated and SAV habitats it was never necessary to jum p on the ring w ith a plank; the ring typically sealed com pletely if throw n properly. Both the drop ring and the throw ring w ere em ptied in the same m anner using the device described below."}, {"section_title": "Removal of organisms from drop traps", "text": "To em pty these traps, a hinged rotating clearing device ( Figure 4) w as folded up on itself a n d inserted into the drop ring after the internal support/crosspiece of the drop or throw ring w as removed.

Few larval and early juvenile fishes (< 1 5 -2 0 mm TL) w ere captured in m y study on the m arsh surface in 1995 using this gear. This m ay well have been caused by the elim ination of very shallow m arsh surface habitats. If these larval fishes selected w ater 5 cm deep or less on the m arsh surface, they w ould be unavailable to the sam pling gear. The raking device was effective at capturing larval fishes in deeper water, evidenced by high catches of larval Menidia menidia in the spring of 1996 (G. Cicchetti, unpublished data). The raking device also is effective at sam pling soft-bottom ed unvegetated habitats in w ater as shallow as 1 cm, because the rake is used to shovel the entire top layer ( 3 -5 cm) of sedim ent into the cod end. The m ud is then sieved through the cod en d for processing. It rem ains true, how ever, that this stu d y cannot provide good inform ation on larval and early juvenile fish use of the m arsh surface. Since the habitats which w ere sam pled may not have been prim e m icrohabitat for these very sm all fishes, the study concentrates on use by fishes an d crustaceans greater than 15 -20 m m TL. Sam pling design for the prim ary h ab ita t/tro p h ic study Sam pling for the m ain part of this project w as carried out from June through O ctober 1995 using the devices described above ( from the edge (henceforth referred to as the \"M arsh Fringe\" habitat), the d ep ositional m arsh edge itself (w ith the d ro p ring half on the m arsh an d half in the unvegetated area), the unvegetated s a n d /m u d are a w ithin 10 m of the m arsh, and the shallow Ruppia marilima habitat w ithin approxim ately 20 m eters of the m arsh. Sam pling took place w ith in 1 to 2 hours of slack high tide based on the finding of Kneib an d W agner (1994) that nekton abundance and species richness w as greatest on the m arsh surface at slack high tide. Low tide habitats included the 0 to 10 cm deep unvegetated shallow s w ithin 3 m eters of the w ater's edge, the slightly deeper (10 to 30 cm of water) u n vegetated shallows w ithin 10 m of the w ater's edge, and the shallow Ruppia maritima h abitat w ithin 20 m eters of the m arsh . The statistical design of drop sam pling for the habitat use and trophic linkage projects considered one depositional m arsh as a sam pling area and eight habitats. A stratified random sam pling design w as applied with habitats as strata ( Figure 6). The sam p lin g design was random ized spatially w ithin each m arsh habitat as m uch as possible using a ran d o m num bers table and the constraint of not sam pling adjacent areas consecutively. The o rd e r in which habitats were sam pled w ithin each tide w as also determ ined using a ran d o m num bers table. Replication w as carried out on 3 separate days, w ith each of the 8 habitats (5 at high tide an d 3 at low tide) sam pled each day. Sam pling on consecutive days is recom m ended by Vam ell et al.

ABSTRACT Shallow w ater com m unities of nekton were quantitatively sam pled from June through October, 1995, in a contiguous m arsh-unvegetated-SA V system at the G oodw in Islands N ational Estuarine Research Reserve, York River, Virginia. Drop traps (1.75 m2) w ere used to sam ple five habitat strata at high tide and three at low tide for a total of eight habitats. Species abundance an d diversity was high in these habitats; 32 species were c a p tu red and the overall m ean abundance was 28.6 inds m ': w ith a m ean biom ass of 3.8 gdw m '2. Callinectes sapidus was the biomass dom inant a n d Palaemonetes shrim p were the num eric dom inants. Fishes m ade up 75% of the num ber of species captured. Fundulus heteroclitus was the m ost abundant fish in m arsh habitats; Gobiosoma bosc was the m ost a b u n d an t in SAV habitats. Species that m igrated on and off the m arsh w ith each tide w ere Fundulus heteroclitus, Lucania parva, F. majalis, Callinectes sapidus, a n d Palaemonetes pugio. In contrast, Gobiosoma bosc, P. vulgaris, and P. intermedius rem ained in SAV habitats at all tides. For m any of these species, habitat use differed from reports for other m arsh areas. This suggests behavioral flexibility betw een regions. Recruitm ent to the m arsh edge by juvenile C. sapidus was docum ented, and this habitat is hypothesized to be an im portant blue crab nursery. Significant year-to-year variation w as found in crab recruitm ent betw een 1995 and 1996, however. Transient m arsh fish species were m ost abundant at the m arsh edge in A ugust and Septem ber (m ean 1.3 inds m '2) but w ere less com m on in other m onths and in other m arsh habitats. Menidia menidia was significantly m ore a b u n d an t on the m arsh surface during nig h t high tides than d u rin g day high tides. Interesting exam ples of spatial partitioning were seen betw een palaem onid shrim p. P. vulgaris and P. intermedius appeared to be sym patric inhabitants of SAV habitat, w hereas P. pugio was found in m arsh habitats as well as SAV habitats. N ekton use of intertidal habitats was found to be very complex. C om m unities of nekton in m arsh habitats differed betw een the m arsh edge and the m arsh interior, w ith edge habitats containing m ore species, higher biomass, an d greater num bers of m any species, though these trends were not alw ays statistically significant. M arsh interior habitats contained greater num bers of Fundulus heteroclitus and P. majalis. In general, SAV habitats were characterized by greater num bers and by m ore species than were m arsh habitats, but biomass of nekton was statistically sim ilar betw een SAV an d m arsh edge habitats. At high tide, SAV and m arsh habitats were used significantly m ore by most species and groups than were unvegetated habitats. At low tide the unvegetated --an d in particular the shallow (0 -10 cm) unvegetated --saw extensive use by m arsh residents as a refuge. A nim al-habitat relationships were com plex, and significant exchanges betw een m arsh, SAV, and unvegetated habitats took place. Most individuals (65%) and biomass (86%) of nekton w ere of species found in all three habitat types at different tidal stages, an d were regularly redistributed betw een habitats w ith the tw ice-daily tides of Chesapeake Bay."}, {"section_title": "IN TR O D U CTIO N", "text": "Nekton use of the salt m arsh surface and of adjacent habitats can be an alyzed in several ways along different spatial a n d tem poral scales.

Rozas (1993), in a review of published quantitative studies, concluded th at densities of nekton using A tlantic coast m arshes w ere at least an o rd er of m agnitude low er than those reported from Gulf coast m arshes. A yvazian et al. (1992) found that values of su m m er biomass in unvegetated areas adjacent to m arshes in southern M aine (the Acadian zoogeographic province) were an order of m agnitude low er than w ere values for sim ilar h abitat in southern M assachusetts (the Virginian zoogeographic province). It is difficult to d raw general latitudinal conclusions based on this inform ation despite the fact that, in each of these comparisons, abundance of nekton is higher in the south. The higher abundances of Gulf coast vs. Atlantic coast m arshes m ay be d u e m ore to hydrologic a n d geom orphologic factors than directly to latitude (Thom as et al. 1990, Zim m erm an et al. 1991, Rozas 1993. M ost of the Atlantic m arshes used by Rozas (1993) in his com parison w ere in the C arolinian province, a n d I could find no direct com parison studies betw een m arsh nekton from the Virginian an d Carolinian provinces. W est coast m arshes of the U nited States also exhibit their ow n unique set of geographic patterns. This discussion, how ever, will concentrate on m arshes located on the east and Gulf coasts of the United States, in part because of the m uch greater body of litera tu re available for these areas (Kneib 1997a). O ne m ajor aspect of geographic location that plays a central role in nekton use of m arshes is the difference in flooding regim es found in each area. O dum (1980) discusses the hypothesis of tidal subsidy, w herein (w ithin limits) increased tidal range leads to increased prim ary production on the m arsh surface. Zim m erm an et al. (1991)  high tidal am plitude, which can result in the form ation of raised levees at the m arsh edge (W iegert and Freeman 1990). This also affects nekton use of m arshes (Peterson and Turner 1994). Deegan and G arritt (1997) also suggest that the connection betw een m arshes and aquatic estuarine food webs is dependent on tidal range, and on the extent that the m arsh floods at high tide. Tides are a central force in the dynam ics of m arshes (Teal 1962, Kneib 1997a, and any com parison between nekton use of different m arshes m ust account for the tidal signal. Tem perature is also an im portant factor dividing biogeographical provinces. T em perature m ay drive latitudinal patterns of species com position, but secondary production is also linked to tem perature. Secondary production is generally th o ught to increase w ith higher tem peratures for invertebrates Schaffner 1990, Edgar 1990, Tumbiolo and Dow ning 1994) a n d for fishes (Edgar et al. 1995a), at least up to a certain point. Tumbiolo and Dow ning (1994) suggest that this m ight be due to Q 10 effects of increased physiologicai rates at w arm er tem peratures. A longer grow ing season is coupled with higher tem peratures in southern latitudes. This may in p art explain a general trend of increasing nekton biomass in the southern direction, if a trend in fact exists. M any of the factors potentially driving differences in m arsh use between zoogeographic provinces are linked, an d are difficult to separate. W hatever the reasons for geographic trends in m arsh use by nekton, the end result is that m arshes, and the com m unities of nekton th at in h ab it them, differ significantly w ith geographic location. This result should be considered in any com parison betw een m arshes from different geographic locations. Spatial patterns betw een marshes: differences w ithin one estuary W ithin one estuary, the difference in salinity along the estuarine gradient is clearly a very im portant factor in structuring nekton use of salt m arshes. Rakocinski et al. (1992) found that salinity was the m ajor determ inant of com m unity structure for m arsh-edge fish species. W einstein (1979) found that higher salinity (polyhaline) m arshes w ere characterized by a low er standing crop b u t greater species richness than w ere low er salinity marshes. Sheridan (1983) found similar trends in a study of the G alveston Bay system that did not directly consider m arshes. In his study, num bers of fishes w ere higher in the u p p e r part of the estuary w hile diversity was greatest at the m outh of the Bay. W einstein et al. (1980) com m ents that m any m arine stenohaline fishes are restricted to salinities greater than 16 parts per thousand; the absence of these fishes in areas of low er salinity tends to decrease species diversity. D eegan and Garritt (1997) used isotopic analyses to show that utilized sources of prim ary production varied along an estuarine gradient from oligohaline areas to the lower estuary, and that consum ers used organic m atter produced in the location they inhabited. Salinity has been show n to have im portant structuring effects on com m unities of estuarine nekton, including m arsh nekton. Stream order w ithin m arshes (the ranking of aquatic pathw ays on a scale from sm all tidal creeks to large bodies of water, O dum 1984) also plays an im portant role in determ ining m arsh use. Rozas and O dum (1987) show ed that total num bers of fishes in tidal freshw ater m arshes (salinity 0 -1.8 parts per thousand) was greater a t headw ater (O rder 2) and m ain creek (O rder 3) stations than at river (order 4+) stations, though they suggested that this result m ay in p art h ave been d u e to the presence of SAV in low er order streams. Ayers (1995) conducted a flum e w eir com parison of a bay-exposed fringing m arsh (high stream order) an d a sheltered creek channel m arsh (low stream order) at the G oodw in Islands, York River, Virginia. Though salinities were sim ilar at her two sites, the creek m arsh was characterized by considerably h ig h er fish densities and biomass, m ostly of m arsh residents. Species composition in the exposed m arsh was less dom inated by m arsh residents, and was m ore variable over the sam p lin g season than it was in the protected m arsh. H ettler (1989a) used block nets to com pare nekton use of channel m arshes (Stream O rder 3) to rivulet (Stream O rder 1) m arshes n e a r Beaufort, N orth Carolina. Both sites experienced sim ilar salinities, b u t in addition to stream o rd e r differences, channel m arshes differed from rivulet m arshes in having a steep bank, higher energy, and in the proxim ity of deeper water. H ettler found that rivulet m arshes contained few er species, but higher num bers and biomass than channel m arshes (except during winter). C hannel m arshes contained m ore blue crabs and greater num bers and biomass of all fishes except killifishes, w hite m ullet, and spotfin m ojarra. The general trend in these studies is tow ards higher abundances (especially of m arsh residents) at low stream order areas an d to w ard s higher diversity at high stream order areas. This trend parallels the salinity-driven pattern s seen in the larger estuary (see previous section). Sedim ent type also m ay play an im portant role in determ ining nekton use of shallow w ater habitat, th o u g h sedim ent type is generally associated w ith stream o rder as well. W einstein et al. (1980) found that distribution patterns for several species of nekton w ere significantly correlated w ith sedim ent type. Diaz and Schaffner, in a 1990 review of estuarine benthos, concluded th at m ixed sedim ents supported higher secondary production of invertebrates, though their stu d y did not directly evaluate secondary production specific to m arshes. M any of the factors w hich structure living com m unities along an estuarine gradient do not exist in isolation. H igh-energy, high stream order m arshes tend to abut deeper w aters, have coarser substrates an d tend to provide more erosional edge due to the higher energy regim es involved. Low stream o rder m arshes in general m ay be shallow er, m u d d ier and m ay feature m ore depositional edges. Low stream o rder m arshes can experience generally low er salinities as well, if located fu rth e r from open estuarine areas m ore influenced by oceanic w aters. In m any cases it is difficult to analyze one factor in isolation w ithout considering o ther inextricably linked factors th at determ ine nekton use of an area. Indeed, m any of the studies cited above, w hich prim arily com pare one aspect of m arshes, are actually com paring several aspects. This is often no ted by the authors of those studies. It is perhaps m ore accurate to consider stream order, sed im en t type, salinity, edge type, w ater depth, energy regim e, an d proxim ity to d e e p er w a te r as linked factors that affect nekton distributions. Spatial patterns w ith in m arshes: differences betw een edge and interior M arsh edge habitats often su p p o rt higher densities of estuarine nekton than do m arsh interior habitat (M inello a n d Z im m erm an 1992, Baltz et al. 1993, M inello et al. 1994, P eterson an d Turner 1994. This m ay have im plications for the use of m arsh system s by nekton; w ithin an area of m arsh, the edge in p lan view can be reticulated w ith sm all islands, channels, and m arsh creeks, or it m ay be stra ig h t and relatively featureless. Reticulated m arshes w ith extensive edge m ay su p p o rt hig h er num bers and biomass of nekton per hectare than do featureless m arshes. In fact, it is recom m ended that m itigation m arshes be constructed to m axim ize available edge for this purpose Zim m erm an 1992, Peterson andT urner 1994, but see Fonseca et al. 1994). Rozas (1993) concluded in a review p a p e r that estuarine transient species selected fo r m arsh edge over interior areas. The extent of m arsh edge relative to interior area m ay be an im portant factor in determ ining abundance and com position of the nekton com m unity frequenting a m arsh system. Spatial patterns w ithin m arshes: differences betw een types of edge M arsh edge can v ary considerably in profile. In high energy areas, erosional processes can rem ove peat so as to leave a sheer overhang (Figure 1, erosional edge). W here w ater velocities slow dow n in low energy areas, sediments m ay fall out of su sp en d ed load and accrete to form a gradually inclined surface leading to m arsh vegetation (Figure 1, depositional edge). H igh energy areas w ith erosional edges in m arsh system s typically include open bay sites exposed to w ave energy, a n d the outsides of bends in tidal creeks w here greater current velocities occur. Low en ergy areas w ith depositional edges include m arsh sites that are protected from w ave energy by land formations or by extensive shoal areas, and the insides of bends in tidal creeks w here currents m ay slow down. Erosional and depositional m arsh edges are used differently by nekton. M clvor and O dum (1988) used flum e n e ts to show that, in tidal freshw ater creeks, depositional m arsh edges were characterized by higher abundances of sm all fishes than w ere erosional m arsh edges. W hile SAV m ay also have played a role in these processes, experim entation showed greater infaunal food availability a t depositional sites and higher levels of piscivorous predation at erosional sites. H ettler (1989a) used flum e nets in a polyhaline creek system and found sim ilar results, th o u g h the focus of this w ork was prim arily a stream o rder comparison (see discussion of stream o rd er above). Gradually sloping depositional rivulet m arshes offer a shallow w ater refuge from predation for small fishes (Hettler 1989a). Furtherm ore, greater num bers and biomass of m o st transient m arine species and piscivores occurred in deeper channel m arshes that were adjacent to a steep bank (Hettler 1989a(Hettler ). H ettler (1989a suggested that piscivores forage m ore effectively in these deeper areas. Both of these studies indicate different patterns of fish use betw een erosional and depositional edges in m arsh creeks, linked also to stream order in H ettler's study. Note, however, that Rozas (1992) found no significant differences in predation o n tethered Fundulus grandis along different types of edge in Louisiana salt m arsh channels. Rozas suggested that the difference in edge profile between sites might not have been sufficient (due to subsequent edge slum ping) to cause significant differences in predation. In general, nekton use of m arsh edge habitat is linked to edge type. Even along a depositional edge m arsh area, nekton do not use the entire edge uniformly to access the m arsh surface. Rivulets are lower-elevation sites along a depositional creekbank "}, {"section_title": "D ep osition al vs. Erosional Marsh Edge", "text": "Depositional M arsh Edge Erosional M arsh Edge that act as channels for w ater m ovem ent during flooding and ebbing tides.

Rozas concluded, how ever, that m ore fishes accessed the m arsh surface along depositional creekbanks due to the very small relative area of rivulets. The extent of available edge influences use of a m arsh by nekton, b u t the type of edge (erosional or depositional or rivulet) does as well. M arshes contain large am ounts of distinct edge that natant m acrofauna cross each tidal cycle; this physical structure is an im portant aspect in the dynam ics of m arsh nekton."}, {"section_title": "Spatial pattern s w ithin m arshes: nekton use of tidal creeks", "text": "A lthough tidal creeks are n o t investigated in this project, they are very im portant in the function of m arshes that feature them , and serve as m ajor conduits of organism s into m arsh habitats (Kneib 1997a). In addition, these creeks are probably the best-studied m arsh environm ent w ith regard to non-resident nekton. In fact, m any of the studies referenced above were conducted in tidal creeks or in m arshes adjacent to creeks (W einstein 1979, W einstein et al. 1980, Rozas and O dum 1987, M clvor and O dum 1988, Rozas et al. 1988, H ettler 1989a, Rountree and Able 1992a. Creeks also provide a great deal of m arsh edge habitat an d often include both erosional and depositional areas. Several studies h ave docum ented considerable use of tidal creeks by comm ercially valuable fishes and crabs (Shenker and Dean 1979, W einstein 1979, W einstein et al. 1984, Rulifson 1991 Spatial p atterns w ithin m arshes: differences across the m arsh surface Spatial differences in m arsh surface use are prim arily driven by tidal regim es a n d by m arsh elevation in an area (Zim m erm an and M inello 1984, Yozzo et al. 1994b). This is because nekton use of the m arsh surface depends ultim ately on inundation (Kneib and W agner 1994). Rozas (1993) suggests that tw o factors are of particular im portance in nekton selection of m arsh surface habitats: subm ergence tim e, and proxim ity to subtidal habitat. Kneib (1997a) points out that frequency a n d duration of flooding varies betw een marshes, and can constitute a m ajor factor in determ ining nekton use of the various habitats on the m arsh surface in any m arsh system. A lthough different factors m ay structure com m unities of different m arsh surface systems, m any studies have concluded that a major division in nekton use of the m arsh surface seems to be betw een a m arsh edge comm unity and a m arsh interior com m unity (Rakocinski et al. 1992, Peterson a n d Turner 1994, Minello et al. 1994. Rozas (1993) and Peterson and Turner (1994) described four general patterns of m arsh surface use. Peterson and T urner (1994) studied a Louisiana m arsh using flumes of different lengths. These au th o rs found that densities of m ost captured species were greatest w ithin three m eters of the m arsh edge, an d that m arsh interior areas were prim arily used by m arshresident fishes. These patterns characterize nekton use of the m arsh surface and are depicted in Figure 2. First, \"interior m arsh residents\" (Peterson an d Turner 1994) or \"resident species\" (Rozas 1993) are generally juvenile fishes and crabs that stay on the m arsh surface thro u g h the entire tidal cycle ( Figure 2). For example, m um m ichogs use m arsh surface m icrohabitats as low tide refuge u n til they reach approxim ately 15 m m in size (Kneib 1997a) at which tim e they begin to m igrate off of the m arsh surface at low tide.

S heridan (1983) an aly zed trawl differences betw een years in fish use of the different parts of the estuary, b u t noted that m ean fish biomass w as relatively stable betw een years. Rulifson (1991) in a four year study of m arsh creeks, found significant variation due to year for many of the a b u n d an t species exam ined. In a suction-sam pling study of lower Chesapeake Bay betw een 1982 and 1986, O rth an d van M ontfrans (1987) report significant yearly variability in recruitm ent of blue crabs up to 11 m m in size in seagrass m eadow s and tidal creeks, but no significant variability betw een years for individuals larger than this. Rountree an d Able (1992a), in a w eir stu d y of tidal m arsh creeks in 1988 and 1989, found significant yearly differences for tw o (Callinectes sapidus and Pomatomus saltatrix ) of the nine m ost abundant species in both years. Year-to-year variation seem s very com m on for subtidal residents of habitats associated w ith salt m arshes, b u t is less well docum ented for dom inant fish species of the salt m arsh surface itself. This m ay in part be d u e to the typically local developm ent of m arsh resident fish larvae, w hile m any other estuarine species have a w ide-ranging planktonic larval phase. Fundulus heteroclitus, w hich lays eggs in m arsh habitats (Able 1984), is generally very abundant every year in m ultiple year studies. Even so, year-to-year variation exists. The data of Yozzo an d Smith (1998) show almost a doubling in num bers of this species collected from one year to the next, but in both years this species was still by far the num erically dom inant fish. Yozzo and Smith (1998) also found m arkedly different abundances of Fundulus luciae betw een tw o sam pling years. W erme (1981) noted the absence of Cyprinodon variegatus in one year of her study, while it w as present (albeit in low num bers relative to other m arsh residents) the next. Year-to-year year variability in m arsh surface fish populations is im portant, but the sam e few species tend to rem ain as dom inants every year in m ost long term studies of the m arsh surface. T em poral patterns: seasonal differences in m arsh use A yvazian et al. (1992) describe seasonal m ovem ents of species in the Virginian zoogeographic province from deeper inshore w ater to shallow nearshore habitats as w ater tem perature increases in the spring, follow ed by the reverse m igration as tem perature declines in the early fall. R ountree and Able (1992a) found a strong seasonal pattern th at repeated itself over two years in a m arsh creek w eir study conducted in N ew Jersey. Biomass peaks w ere p resen t in M ay and A ugust, and species com position differed betw een seasons. Allen et al.

Ayers (1995) reports a strong seasonal signal at the G oodw in Islands as well. These and other works show that studies of shallow w ater nekton m ust recognize seasonal patterns of faunal abundance. T em poral patterns: differences in m arsh use d u e to life history strategy Several schem es have been developed to categorize estuarine fishes based on their life history strategies. A com m on approach, used by Peterson and Turner (1994) and by other w orkers, is to divide fishes into estuarine transients and estuarine residents. In this scheme, estuarine transients spend only a portion of their life cycle w ithin an estuary, w hile residents sp e n d their entire lives w ithin the estuary. M cH ugh (1967), Day et al. (1989), a n d Ayvazian et al. (1992) presented m ore explicit schem es to divide fishes based on their dependence on estuaries into residents, nursery species, m arine species, and adventitious visitors. This essentially subdivides the estuarine transient category into nursery species, m arine species, a n d adventitious visitors. All of the categorizations used above, however, a p p ly to the entire estuary, and n o t specifically to m arshes. These schem es are valuable in evaluating the im portance of estuaries in relation to the coastal ocean, b u t are less directed to m arshes. In the case of this dissertation, it is m ore central to evaluate the im portance of m arshes in relation to the larger estuary. The estuarine categorizations above can easily be shifted to describe m arsh dependence rather than estuarine dependence. Certain m arsh workers have adopted this approach as well, notably Kneib (1997a). Peterson and T urner (1994) also distinguish betw een resident species, in the sense of estuarine residents, and m arsh-residents as well. A life-history approach to the categorization of m arsh nekton recognizes perm anent m arsh residents W agner 1994, Kneib 1997a) a n d transient m arsh nekton (sensu Kneib 1997a). Perm anent m arsh residents such as Fundulus spp and P. pugio are trophically tied to the m arsh for essentially th eir entire lives (although P. pugio has a planktonic larval stage). M arsh transients use m arsh habitats only for a portion of their life cycle (Kneib 1997a). The m arsh transient nekton category can be further broken into m arsh nursery species a n d opportunistic m arsh visitors, sim ilar to the approach of M cH ugh (1967), Day et al. (1989), a n d Ayvazian et al. (1992). M arsh nu rsery species are those that frequent m arshes as juveniles, b u t not as adults, and regularly use m arshes as food or refuge su p p o rt for their m aturation. O pportunistic m arsh users are those species w ho utilize m arshes sporadically d u rin g various parts of their life history, b u t also use other habitats extensively and w ould not be considered dep en d en t on m arsh habitat. For the purposes of this dissertation the m ost valuable divisions are betw een perm an en t m arsh residents and m arsh transients, w hich is further broken into m arsh nursery species and opportunistic m arsh visitors. The degree to which a com m unity of m arsh nekton consists of perm anent marsh residents, m arsh n ursery species, a n d opportunistic m arsh visitors is of great interest in defining a m arsh system . Z im m erm an and M inello (1984) found that residents (Palaemonetes pugio, Gobiosoma bosc, and Fundulus similis) w ere the m ost abundant m acrofauna in a drop ring stu d y of a Texas m arsh. After these species, m ost m acrofauna were transient juveniles of estuarine d ependent species. Life h istory strategies of estuarine nekton can be exam ined in m any ways. Export of energy from m arsh habitats in particular is linked to life history strategy; these processes are discussed further in C hapter 4.

W ater drains completely off the m arsh surface at m ost low tides in this area. A t this time, the larger m arsh nekton take refuge in the shallow unvegetated areas and SAV beds. M arsh residents w ere seen to feed actively in these areas at low tide. At high tide, w ater floods the m arsh, and residents feed even m ore intensely on the m arsh surface. Blue crabs and transient fishes also m ove into m arsh areas at high tide, in particular exploiting the resources of the m arsh edge. The unvegetated area was found to be of major im portance to trophic processes as well. In this sam pling area, the m arsh surface, unvegetated, a n d SAV h ab itats are linked by their close spatial proxim ity. Though SAV-specific predators w ere not investigated for trophic patterns, it is e v id en t that certain species of nekton are usin g all three habitats w ithin a single tidal cycle. The entire area, including all three h abitat types, is clearly of great value in supporting the abundance and diversity of m arine life seen in these shallow waters. In this pristine area, adjacent habitats are linked as the tidal w a te r m oves up an d dow n a gradual incline of intertidal substrate, covering and uncovering one habitat after another.

Also, gobies have been captured in low num bers in other studies of the m arsh surface at the G oodw in Islands. Densities reported by Ayers (1995) for m arsh edge habitats w ere com parable to those of my study (< 0.1 ind m '2).

The n um ber of fishes captured in my study are slightly h ig h er than in A yers' analogous exposed site, but low er than in h er protected site (mean of m y study: 2.4 m '2 for June to October, 1995, for habitats com parable to those used by Ayers). I conclude that m y stu d y provides num bers that are com parable to those obtained in other local qu an titativ e studies. Some other geographic regions that have been sam pled quantitatively, how ever, have show n m uch greater use of m arsh habitats. Baltz et al. (1993) (Table 3); a sim ilar delay in recruitm ent to m arsh creeks was seen in O rth and van M ontfrans (1987). In considering habitat use by juvenile crabs, the rem oval efficiency of the gear m ay have caused crab densities in m arsh habitats to be significantly underestim ated relative to SAV habitats. Table 1 in C hapter 1 shows a rem oval efficiency of 39% -15% (95% Cl) for SAV habitats and 16% -12% (95% Cl) for m arsh habitats. If w e correct the d ata for the know n removal efficiencies, then SAV and m arsh edge densities m ay be sim ilar, on the o rd e r of 30 -40 inds m '2. These densities are comparable to the 1 3 -9 0 inds m '2 reported for SAV beds in Chesapeake Bay at this tim e of year using m ore efficient suction sam pling gear (O rth and van M ontfrans 1987). U nvegetated habitat was n o t exam ined for removal efficiency for blue crabs, but it is thought that rem oval efficiency here w ould be greater than for either vegetated habitat. Both vegetated habitats had substrates w hich crabs < 20 m m could b urrow into (G. Cicchetti, personal observation). In m arsh a n d SAV habitats, the clearing device w as raked through the vegetation and sedim ent at the top of the root m ass and did not rem ove substantial am ounts of sedim ent. In unvegetated habitats, the clearing device w as used to scrape m uch of the top 2 -5 cm of sediment into the m esh collecting b a g /c o d end. The collected m ud was then sieved in situ through the 2 m m m esh cod end, and it is assum ed that sm all burrow ing crabs were caught w ith efficiency. There were significant differences in crab use of m arsh habitat betw een fall 1995 and fall 1996 (Table 6, W ilcoxon-M ann-W hitney test result chi-sq = 4.31, p = 0.038). M uch of this difference was due to the low num bers of small crabs * 25 m m on the m arsh surface in 1996. Year-to-year variability in recruitm ent of sm all juvenile crabs has also been noted in SAV beds in this region (Orth and van M ontfrans 1987). These authors linked recruitm ent of crabs to SAV beds w ith supply of m egalopae from the plankton, but noted that d ispersal into shallow w ater habitat m ight also be im portant. Year-to-year variability m ay be a consistent feature of blue crab recruitm ent to these habitats. Forw ard et al. (1996) (Table 3). Juvenile blue crabs do have the ability to take refuge on the salt m arsh surface at low tide (Kneib 1997b, Yozzo andSm ith 1998). O th e r studies indicate that larger crabs retreat to the subtidal at low tide (Ryer 1987, Fitz andW iegert 1991). Blue crabs can be considered habitat opportunists. A lthough SAV seems to be preferred habitat for crabs in C hesapeake Bay, populations of crabs also exist w here seagrass is locally absent. Likewise, if all m arsh in an area were to be destroyed, blue crabs w ould no doubt still exist in unvegetated areas. Indeed, it is quite possible that a substantial num ber of individual blue crabs never en ter either an SAV bed or a marsh. M arsh and SAV habitat nonetheless offers im p o rtan t benefits to those individuals that do exploit these habitats, and expand the range of habitat open to this particular species. Consequently, opportunistic m arsh use m ay be of great im portance to w ard s the m aintenance of blue crabs in C hesapeake Bay at a certain population level, even if the species does not depend on m arsh hab itat in the strictest sense."}, {"section_title": "Palaemonetes pugio", "text": "These sm all shrim p were the m ost abundant nekton captured in this study, as has been found for other studies th at have considered the entire m arsh com m unity as well (Nixon and Oviatt 1973  At low tide, Palaemonetes pugio was found to take refuge on the m arsh surface as evidenced by pit traps, w here 303 individuals were captured ( Figure 5). P. pugio also took refuge in SAV beds a n d in the shallow (0 -10 cm deep) habitat at the w ater's edge. P. pugio was significantly m ore a b u n d a n t in this shallow w ater habitat than in the adjacent deeper (10 -30 cm) habitat (Table 4 E, significant difference at p = 0.05).

This preference for shallow w ater and for vegetation is presum ably to take refuge from deeper aquatic pred ato rs (see Ruiz et al. 1993).  et al. 1994). In areas w here the two species coexist, it h a s been suggested that P. vulgaris has a n ability to com petitively displace P. pugio from p referred habitat (Thorp 1976). As discussed above, P. pugio w as distributed over m arsh surface and SAV habitats at high tide, and took low tide refuge on the m arsh surface, in very shallow unvegetated areas, and in SAV hab itat (Tables 3 an d  intermedius betw een m y m arsh a n d these Texas m arshes m ay very well be forced by these differences in inundation. Palaemonetes pugio and P. vulgaris were allopatric species w ith overlap in h a b ita t use in m y study. P. vulgaris and P. intermedius appeared to be sym patric. G iven the obvious m orphological sim ilarities of the three species, this situation is interesting for evo lu tio n ary reasons, and m erits further study.

N one w ere captured in m arsh habitats, though benthic Uca, Sesarma, an d xanthid crabs were ab u n d an t in m arsh habitats.

Juveniles of the com m ercial shrim ps Penaeus aztecus and Penaeus duorarum w ere also present in SAV habitats, b u t at densities typically less than 1 ind m '2 (Table 3) In m y study, several species used habitats differently from w h a t is reported for other geographic regions. Size of m um m ichogs decreased w ith distance into the m arsh; the opposite result w as reported by Kneib and W agner (1994) in expansive G eorgia m arshes. This m ay be a result of forcing from the environm ent rather than a behavioral choice, in that only larger m um m ichogs can sw im fast enough to return to low tide refuge in K neib's extensively flooded G eorgia marshes. N onetheless this shows w hat the species is capable of adapting to, and can be considered as flexibility in this way. Rainwater killifish were seen to significantly prefer m arsh habitat over SAV habitat at high tide; they w ere ab undant in both m arsh and SAV at high w ater in a Texas m arsh that was alm ost constantly inundated (Rozas and Minello 1998 in press). R ainw ater killifish seem to exhibit a behavioral choice th at differs betw een regions. In m y m arsh Palaemonetes intermedius were found alm ost exclusively in SAV habitats; they w ere m ore abundant in m arsh habitats than in SAV habitats in the long inundation period were obtained from the prim ary sam pling area ( Figure 1, C hapter 1). Two additional areas were selected for study ( Figure 1, C hapter 1), and the m arsh fringe habitat was sam pled at all three areas in July and A ugust of 1996 as described in the m ethods section above. Table 5 shows the results of this comparison. N o statistical differences am ong areas were found for abundance of any individual species. The trend for three of the four abundant species, how ever, w as for greatest num bers at Area 3 an d lowest num bers at A rea 2 (Table 5). A significant difference was found am ong areas for gram s dry weight of total nekton (Kruskal-Wallace test, p = 0.018, Table 5). T he D unn test show ed that total biomass in A rea 3 was significantly greater than in Area 2, but th at biomass in A rea 1 was not significantly different from either Area 2 or Area 3, consistent w ith the trend seen for the individual species. A n analysis of total nekton by grams dry weight p er sam ple m ay be thought to be heavily influenced by large blue crabs, especially in this case w here crab num bers m irrored the pattern of total nekton biom ass (Table 5). To test for this influence, the Kruskal-W allace analysis w as also run on total nekton excluding blue crabs. Results from the test excluding blue crabs also led to a significant conclusion (Table 5). Consequently, the results of the test on total nekton biom ass are accepted as indicative of comm unity trends and not just of blue crab trends. The test on total nekton excluding blue crabs is not m eant to be evaluated as a separate test, as The lack of significant differences in use pattern s by any individual species suggests that com m unity composition was sim ilar among areas. The standing stocks of the entire com m unities d id differ among areas, however. The m ost obvious differences in physical appearance am ong these areas relate to the energy regim es they experience. A rea 1, the p rim ary site, is exposed directly to Chesapeake Bay and receives a fair am ount of w ave energy on a regular basis. Area 2 (arrow 2, Figure 1, C hapter 1) is sim ilar in gross m orphology to Area 1 b u t lies inshore of several small islands and a series of shallow sand bars. A rea 2 is m ore protected from the wave energy of Chesapeake Bay, and the small bay that abuts A rea 2 is som ew hat shallow er than the sim ilar bay of A rea 1. Area 3 sees a very different en ergy regim e from A reas 1 and 2 and the small channel passing betw een islands here (arrow 3, Figure   1, C hapter 1) experiences strong tidal currents at every tide as w ater is exchanged betw een the Spartina altemiflora is greater. Associated with the differences in energy regim e b etw een A reas 1, 2, a n d 3 are many linked factors including sedim ent type, flora, detrital exchange rates from the m arsh surface, w ater depth, and m ore. W hile it is prem ature at this p o in t to assign causes to the differences in nekton biomass seen am ong these areas, it seem s likely that energy regim es, or factors correlated to energy regim es, m ay play a part in determ ining these differences. Area 1, the prim ary sam pling area, appears to be fairly representative of bay-exposed m arshes at th e G oodw in Islands since no significant differences were found betw een it a n d either sites 2 o r 3. Ayers (1995), however, conducted a comparison study betw een bay-exposed an d protected creekbank m arshes at the Goodwin Islands in 1994 and found significant differences betw een these types of areas. A yers' creek sites w ere located in the small tidal creek that separates the easternm ost m ain island from the sm aller islands, about 400 m east of m y Area 1 (Figure 1, C hapter 1). H er exposed sites were located at m y A rea 3. Ayers' creek m arsh was characterized by considerably higher fish densities and biom ass, m ostly of m arsh resident fishes, than was the exposed site. Species com position in the exposed m arsh w as less dom inated by m arsh resident fishes, and was more variable over the sam pling season th an it was in the creek m arsh. While m y A rea 1 m ay be representative of bay-exposed m arshes w ithin the G oodw in Islands system , it alm ost certainly sees very different use by nekton in comparison to local creekbank m arshes such as studied by Ayers. Year-to-year variation in nekton use of the salt m arsh surface Utilization of the m arsh surface was compared betw een 1995 and 1996 by sam pling in all marsh surface habitats. The design of this com parison is described in the m ethods section. This study found a significant difference in abundance of blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) on the m arsh surface betw een 1995 and 1996 (W ilcoxon-M ann-W hitney test, chi-sq = 4.31, p = 0.038, Table 6). No statistical differences w ere found between years for biom ass of total nekton, or for use by any individual species other than blue crabs (Table 6). The difference in use by blue crabs was prim arily due to a poor recruitm ent of juvenile crabs to these habitats in 1996; sim ilar year-to-year variation for juvenile blue crab recruitm ent has also been seen in seagrass beds (Orth and van M ontfrans 1987). To conclude, I found that significant year-to-year variation in use of the m arsh surface did exist for the blue crab, but not for any of the other species that w ere ab undant in these years. Similar variation in use of m arsh habitat by one o r m ore species is docum ented in W erm e (1981), Orth and van M ontfrans (1987), Rulifson (1991), Rountree and Able (1992) and Yozzo and Smith (1998).  (Table 7). Several species w ere n o t sufficiently a b u n d a n t to include in the statistical analysis; for these only the total n u m b ers caught are listed in Table 7. Palaem onid use of the m arsh surface w as very sim ilar betw een Menidia menidia w as seen to be significantly m ore abu n d an t on the m arsh surface at night h ig h tides than at day high tides (W ilcoxon-M ann-W hitney test, chi-sq = 7.74, p = 0.005, Table 7) C om parisons to SAV and u n v egetated habitat SAV habitats supported g reater num bers of species than d id m arsh or unvegetated habitats ( Figure 4). SAV h ab itats also supported a significantly h ig h er biom ass of crustaceans than did the m arsh interior habitat (Table 4 G). O f m arsh habitats, the m arsh edge at high tide had the h ig h est abundance, biomass, and diversity of nekton, though this trend was in general not statistically significant (Table 4). The m arsh edge su p p o rted a biom ass of crustaceans and of fishes that w as very close to that su p p o rte d by the SAV habitat at high tide (Table 4 G, I, J). N u m b ers of individuals and species richness, how ever, were generally lower at the m arsh ed g e th an in the seagrass bed ( Figure 4). Lowtide unvegetated a n d SAV habitats were used as a refuge for m arsh surface species, w hich were rarely caught in these habitats a t high tide. This low tide refuge use probably accounts for the generally g reater densities and biomasses in u n vegetated and SAV habitats at low tide com pared to the sam e h ab itats a t high tide. At high tide m ost species of fishes and crustaceans were significantly m ore ab u n d an t a n d num erous in m arsh or SAV habitats than in unvegetated habitats (Table 4 A -F). This w as also true for total fish biom ass (Table 4 I) and for total nekton biom ass (Table 4 J In fact, the Low tide Shallow (unvegetated) habitat supported the greatest densities of P.

This is in p art d u e to the shallow w ater d epths, a n d to the presence of Ruppia maritima as the do m in an t seagrass. Ruppia exists inshore of Zostera marina at the G oodw in Islands (Buzzelli 1995 Blue crab recruitm ent to m arsh edge habitats is hypothesized to be an im portant aspect of blue crab life history in C hesapeake Bay; this has been found in other areas but not in Chesapeake Bay (Thomas et al. 1990, Rozas andMinello 1998 in press). H ow ever, year-to-year variation in this recruitm ent w as also found to be statistically significant, w ith low er recruitm ent in 1996. Biomass of larger blue crabs were found to be especially large in SAV and m arsh edge habitats. Palaem onids w ere the num eric dom inant in all areas except the deeper unvegetated habitats. A t low tide, Palaemonetes pugio was more abu n d an t in shallow (0 -10 cm) unvegetated habitats th an in deeper (10 -30 cm) unvegetated habitats. P. pugio show ed a clear spatial partitioning w ith P. vulgaris and P. intermedius, but P. vulgaris and P. intermedius appeared to be sympatric. M arshes are generally thought to be very productive ecosystems, yet production studies of m arsh nekton are rare. I used the size-frequency a n d allom etric equation techniques to estim ate the secondary production of m arsh nekton, including Fundulus heteroclitus and F. majalis, Lucania parva, an d Palaemonetes pugio. The results from the two techniques w ere sim ilar. Total m arsh surface production w as estim ated a t 7.4 -8.0 gdw m'2 150 d '1 (28.4 -30.7 gw w m '2150 d '1) for the area flooded at m ean high tide if corrected for poorly sam pled small size classes and for the removal efficiency of the gear. These com m unity estim ates are lower than w hat has previously been reported for production of F. heteroclitus alone. A n argum ent is developed to show that previously reported high estim ates for this species m ay n o t truly be applicable. M arsh surface production of the larger size classes of resident fishes m ay be less than is generally believed. M arsh-derived production of transient users w as evaluated using allom etric equation techniques. Production was estim ated at 1.1 gdw m '2150 d 'l (4.2 gw w m\"2150 d '1) for the entire m arsh area flooded at m ean high tid e if corrected for gear rem oval efficiency; the value of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) production p e r square m eter of m arsh edge habitat was estim ated at 6.0 g d w m '2150 d'l, or 22.1 gww m '2150 d '1. These results are w ithin the ranges reported for other productive shallow w ater ecosystems. As is true of previous m arsh production studies, m y w ork did not quantitatively sam ple the smallest size classes of nekton. The results described above were corrected conservatively to account for this. Recent quantitative w ork indicates that production of the sm allest size classes m ay be very high, yet at this po in t it is unclear how high. A study to exam ine production of larval and juvenile nekton on the m arsh surface is much needed. The contribution of marshes to estuarine secondary production includes the quantified production values as well as unquantifiable m arsh functions. M arshes have a refuge value, particularly for sm all size classes of nekton; this refugia allows populations to develop. M arshes are available over broad spatial scales an d are relatively stable on tem poral scales from seasons to years to decades in the M id-Atlantic a n d elsewhere. The value of m arshes may be of g reater im portance w hen considered on time scales longer than one year.

The analysis of production provides a better characterization of energy flow, grow th, and yield (Diaz and Schaffner 1990). The estim ation of production is an im portant step in u n d erstanding ecosystem function, and is of particular value in understanding predator-prey relationships (Minello and Zim m erm an 1992). A t the sam e time, in som e cases the m ore basic estim ation of prey standing stocks can be equally critical. Miller and D unn (1980) rem ark that, for transient predators, standing stocks of prey m ay be a m ore im portant factor than p roduction of prey in determ ining use of an area. Since m arsh nekton are both predators and prey, determ inations of production as well as standing stock provides a more complete approach to understanding ecosystem function. Production and grow th estim ates for salt marsh resident fishes Production estim ates for m arsh surface fishes can vary considerably even w ithin one species and one zoogeographic province. Day et al. (1989) provide a range of productivity estim ates for Fundulus heteroclitus from 12.5 to 64.0 gw w m '2y r'' (based on 3 studies) and for F. majalis of 2.1 to 6.3 gw w m '2yr'l (w ithin one study). In general, salt m arshes are thought to su p p o rt very high rates of fish production (Valiela et al. 1977, M eredith and Lotrich 1979, W eisberg and Lotrich 1982a. G row th of individuals is directly linked to production, and grow th studies of m arsh nekton show a rapid accum ulation of tissue. M arsh fishes in their first season can grow at a rate of 5% of their body weight per day during m id sum m er (Kneib a n d Stiven 1978). W eisberg and Lotrich (1982b) report a grow th of larger m um m ichogs in experim ental p en s at natural density and with free access to the m arsh a n d subtidal areas at 0.342% of body w eight per day. W hile estimates of grow th and p roduction vary betw een m arshes, the literature suggests th at these areas su pport high rates of g ro w th and production. Valiela et al. (1977) Table 1 of Valiela et al. (1977) are entered into the length-w eight regressions on page 137 of Valiela et al. (1977), values in m illigram s are produced w hich are exactly ten tim es sm aller th an w hat is rep o rted in Table 2 (Valiela et al. 1977) as the corresponding m ean w eights for these fish. For exam ple, the 4.5 cm fish in the upper left of Table 1 (Valiela et al. 1977) should h av e a m ean w eight of 221 m gdw or 0.221 gdw using the regression on page 137 of Valiela et al. (1977). These 4.5 cm fish are show n in Table 2 w ith a m ean weight of 2.21 gdw , and the error is repeated for every group of fish in the table. This erro r is also evident in Figures 4 and 5 a n d Tables 2 th ro u g h 4 in W right (1972), the thesis u p o n w hich this part of Valiela et al. (1977) is based. Furtherm ore, com parisons to other studies indicate that the w eights of fish in Table 2 of Valiela et al. (and in  w hen converted to dry w eight). Since the biom ass estim ates of Table 2 (Valiela et al. 1977) are carried throughout the rest of the production estimates in this w ork, I suggest th a t the calculations of Valiela et al. (1977)  In spite of this, it is quite possible th at production of m arsh surface fish is relatively high. M ost studies of production of m arsh surface nekton sam pled only the larger size classes (W right 1972(W right , Valiela et al. 1977, M eredith a n d Lotrich 1979, m y study). While these production studies include estim ates for the contributions of the very small fishes, the estim ates w ere not based on actual sam pling a n d were intended as m inim um estim ates by the authors. These studies (m y ow n included) m ay substantially underestim ate production by failing to properly sam ple the sm allest size classes and by using very conservative estim ates for their production."}, {"section_title": "Fish production estim ates for salt m arsh tidal creeks", "text": "Several excellent production studies exist for nekton in tidal creeks.

These allom etric equations do not consider species-specific differences in grow th, or take food availability into account, how ever (Edgar 1990) unequal biweekly sam pling periods were combined to form a single m onthly estim ate, the result w ould be a data structure in which the anim al collections were not evenly spaced in time.

These sam pling periods w ere therefore not considered acceptable for production estimates. To achieve uniform spacing of the rem aining sam pling periods, samples from the m iddle period of each m onth were used for analysis.

O ther than the duration of tim e for which production w as calculated, the size-frequency m ethod was used as specified in H am ilton (1969), W aters (1977), and M enzie (1980), and met all the requirem ents spelled out by these authors. and M eredith and Lotrich (1979). Of these studies, the size structure of the p o pulation reported in Valiela et al.

Lucania parva, the rainw ater killifish, did not attain the same m axim um size as F. heteroclitus an d F. majalis. Therefore, a separate size-frequency analysis was co n ducted for L. parva. Pa (relative grow th rates between the five size categories) for L. parva w as assu m ed to be sim ilar to F. heteroclitus an d F. majalis. L. parva is a smaller fish though, and w as assum ed to grow to a m axim um size in tw o seasons, giving a 365/C P I ratio of 0.5. Values used for L. parva are show n in Table 2. Cohort-free size-frequency m ethods: Palaemonetes pugio Size-frequency analysis was also carried o u t for the grass shrim p Palaemonetes pugio. Values for Pa w ere estim ated based on the observation by Kneib (1987b) that grow th in juveniles is about twice as rap id as in adults. Sikora (1977) found that grow th rates rem ained constant as adults increased in size. This is also incorporated into estim ates of Pa, and accounts for the lack of change in P e/P a betw een the larger size classes (Table 3). The CPI for P. pugio was estim ated at 5 m onths based on Wood (1967) and Welsh (1975). The values of P e /P a and CPI used in these calculations are show n in Table 3. C orrection for poorly sampled sm all size classes The clearing device used to remove creatures from drop rings in m y study was ineffective in very shallow m arsh surface habitats (Chapter 1). These areas m ay be used extensively by the sm allest size classes of m arsh resident nekton (Talbot andAble 1984, Kneib 1997b). I captured very low num bers of small nekton (Figures 1 and 2), and assum e that the smallest size classes of nekton were poorly sam pled in my project. Previous studies of production of m arsh surface nekton have also sam pled only the larger size classes of m arsh nekton (Wright 1972, Valiela et al. 1977, Sikora 1977, M eredith and Lotrich 1979. Several production studies (Valiela et al. 1977, M eredith andLotrich 1979) include estim ates for the contributions of the small individuals. Valiela et al. (1977) estim ated that production of the small size classes (< 45 mm) was a t m inim um 44% of the total production by considering that the production of the unsam pled 0 age-class fish was equal to the biom ass of the captured 1 age-class fish. M eredith and Lotrich (1979) used a conceptually sim ilar approach to estimate that the contribution of poorly sam pled size classes (< 60 mm) was at least 78% of the total production. if P e/P a a n d 365/C PI are assum ed to be accurate, then Nj for each group does m eaningfully represent the n u m b er of individuals recruited into that size range over the stu d y period. If these assum ptions are m ade, then the population structure betw een size categories of Tables 1 -3 can pro p erly be used to generate estim ates for the production of the poorly sam pled sm all size classes. In m y study, the population structure betw een size categories (Tables 1 -3 )  arbitrarily assum ed to be 75% betw een the first and second size group, an d 50% betw een the second a n d th ird size group (Tables 1 -3 ) .

T he raw data w ere converted using the rem oval estim ates of Table 1 Blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, present an added difficulty in the application of these allometric equations. Blue crabs grow larger than the range of anim als m aking up the invertebrate d ata set used by Edgar (1990) to construct the equations. While Edgar (1990) suggests that the general invertebrate equation m ight be applied to larger creatures as well, it is possible that out-of-range problem s m ight occur in applying these exponential equations to very large blue crabs. A previous production study of blue crabs in Chesapeake Bay seagrass beds was reported by Fredette et al. (1990), w ho em ployed size-frequency and instantaneous grow th m ethods. As a test, the allometric equations of Edgar (1990) and Edgar and Shaw (1995) were applied to the blue crab data of Diaz and Fredette (1981), w hich contains the raw data used in Fredette et al. (1990). Results of this test were com pared to their production estimates. Allometric equations consistently produced underestim ates relative to the instantaneous grow th and size-frequency m ethods. The closest results were obtained by applying the juvenile invertebrate equation to sm all crabs (< 1 g afdw) and the fish equation to larger crabs. This approach w as used in m y calculations. A pplication of these equations assum es that sm all blue crabs produce somatic tissue sim ilarly to other juvenile invertebrates, while large blue crabs produce somatic tissue at rates sim ilar to fish. This last assum ption is supported in Edgar (1990), w here differences in taxonomic group were m uch less im portant in predicting production than were differences in individual m ean biomass. Large crabs are sim ilar in size to m any of the fish used by Edgar an d Shaw (1995) to construct their fish production equation. N onetheless, com parisons to d a ta an d results of Diaz and Fredette (1981) and Fredette et al. (1990) suggest that the production values I report for blue crabs m ay still underestim ate the true values. Calculations for production of transient species are based on daytim e sam pling. The As should be obvious from the above discussion, estim ates for m arsh-derived production of transient species should n o t be interpreted as precise and flawless quantifications. Production calculations for m arsh transient species are carried out to pro v id e a first-order evaluation of an ecosystem function that has not previously been well quantified. N onetheless, it is believed that the overall a p p ro ach to calculating this production is so und, and th at the results provided do approxim ate the tru e values.   approxim ately equivalent to 13.9 gww m\"2 150 d '1 (Table 4) The allometric technique was also used to estimate m arsh-derived production of m arsh transient species (Table 4).

Several key w orks that report high production (W right 1972(W right , Valiela et al. 1977 an d Lotrich 1979) cannot properly be applied to the m arsh surface (see Introduction). M y w ork suggests that secondary production in m arshes m ay be comparable to secondary production in o th er shallow w ater habitats. This should not, how ever, dim inish the perceived im portance of m arshes in any way. Most shallow w ater habitats, including m arshes, are very productive.

The value of edge springs from the com bination of refuge value and trophic value provided by the juxtaposition of two habitats.

This sm all scale variation m ay be very im portant to feeding dynam ics; if prey exist in patches of abundance, then their perceived density to mobile p red ato rs m ay be higher than if these p rey w ere evenly dispersed. Patterns of invertebrate distribution m ay have significant consequences for nekton feeding in marshes.

The literature often reports low er num bers of organism s in unvegetated areas relative to the m arsh surface (see above) b u t it is clear th at exceptions do exist, a n d that unvegetated habitats can support very large invertebrate biom asses in some cases.

Once recruited, m arsh residents essentially n ever leave the area of the m arsh and adjacent low tide refuge; therefore they contribute to o ther ecosystem s only w hen eaten by a predator from the different ecosystem. These species are im portant \"relay\" species of Kneib (1997a), and act as vectors betw een m arsh surface and d eeper w aters by feeding on m arsh surface invertebrates at h ig h tide, then m oving off of the m arsh at low tide. Away from the refuge of the m arsh surface, they m ay be consum ed by larger aquatic and avian predators. This pathw ay is also suggested by Kneib and W agner (1994), but is not quantified in my dissertation due to a lack of the p roper type of data. Drop rings do not effectively sam ple larger piscivorous fishes (Jacobsen and K ushlan 1987). M arsh transients are defined as those species that m ove between marshes and the open estuary, exporting energy from m arsh system s in the process. N ote that these m arsh transient species as defined here differ from m arine or estuarine transients as defined by Peterson and T urner (1994), that m igrate betw een the estuary and the coastal ocean. Marsh transient species use m arshes for a portion of their life history. These organism s need not be im m ediately fed upon in order to contribute to deeper w ater trophic processes; they m ay move out of a m arsh system never to return, and in doing so bring w ith them w hatever energy they consum ed w ithin the m arsh ecosystem. M arsh transients m ay fall to predation w ithin the estuary, and if so they contribute in this w ay to deeper estuarine food webs. O ther transient species m ay m igrate out of the estuary and into the coastal ocean, contributing directly to oceanic food webs. Exam ples of these ocean-m igrating or ocean-spaw ning species are Bairdiella chrysoura (Chao an d M usick 1977), Leiostomus xanthurus (Chao and M usick 1977), Pomatomus saltatrix (Day et al. 1989), Callinectes sapidus (Day et al. 1989), an d Menidia menidia (Fay et al. 1983). M any of these species are juveniles w hen using the m arsh habitat, and if they reproduce before being preyed upon, then the food and refuge provided b y the m arsh has contributed to the propagation of that species as well. In m y study an d in the stu d y of H ettler (1989a) W agner 1994, Kneib 1997a). Kneib (1982) found that blue crabs appeared to be im portant predators on m um m ichogs in confined pool habitats, and suggests that blue crabs m ay be very im portant predators on m um m ichogs in salt m arshes (Kneib 1986). Other studies suggest or docum ent predation on killifishes by a variety of predators (Butner and Brattstrom 1960, W right 1972, Valiela et al. 1977, Yozzo 1994) but this link is very difficult to quantify. Kneib (1986) points out that m uch of the information about predation on m um m ichogs is anecdotal, and that \"few species at higher trophic levels are know n to prey heavily on m um m ichogs\". Rountree and Able (1992b) show ed evidence of predation on Fundulus heteroclitus and Palaemonetes vulgaris by sum m er flounder in m arsh creeks, how ever. Export of production by bird predation m ay also be considerable, b u t note that Kneib (1982) found little effect of w ading bird predation on m um m ichog populations. Kneib, in a 1997(a) review paper, points out the im portance of flooding w ater and m arsh landscape in determ ining the rates of transfer of energy from the m arsh surface to deeper w ater habitats. Kneib (1997a) indicates that periods of overlap betw een populations of perm anent m arsh resident prey and their potential deeper w ater predators will occur at certain specific points in the tidal cycle. Kneib (1997a) suggests a \"trophic relay\" in which production is m oved from the m arsh surface into deeper w aters via predation by progressively larger predators in progressively deeper water. This takes the form of y o u n g resident nekton (interior m arsh residents, Figure 2, C hapter 2) being preyed on by adult resident nekton (interior m arsh users, Figure 2, C hapter 2) w ho are preyed on by juvenile transient p red ato rs (Kneib 1997a). In this w ay, energy is m oved off the m arsh in stages. Export via m igration of transient species from m arsh habitats Kneib (1997a) suggests that em igration of transient species from m arsh habitats holds the m ost potential to m ove production from the m arsh surface into d e e p e r estuarine and oceanic w aters. Indeed, D eegan (1993) estim ated that average export of gulf m enhaden (Brevoortia patronus) out of a Louisiana estuary w as 38 g m '2 y r'1 (dry weight), calculated per area of m arsh habitat. This num ber w as about 5 -10% of the prim ary productivity o f the area (Deegan 1993) and represents not just an enorm ous abundance an d biom ass of fish, b u t also a trem endous export from the shallow m arsh an d bay to the ocean. Peters a n d Lewis (1984) have indicated th at A tlantic m en h a d e n (Brevoortia tyrannus) has a n ability to digest Spartina-derived detritus. If this detritus constitutes a significant part of the nutritional su p p o rt of these fishes, then the exported value of m arsh surface prim ary p roduction to ocean w aters through this p athw ay has the potential also to be very large. A tlantic m enhaden are not only very abundant fishes, they also serve as a direct food source for m any estuarine a n d oceanic predators. Since m enhaden feed at a low trophic level, they can very efficiently convert organic m atter into fish biom ass. Atlantic m en h a d e n m ay not rem ain for an entire season in areas associated w ith m arshes to the extent th at G ulf m enhaden do (Deegan 1993), b u t occur in high num bers in areas adjacent to m arshes for shorter periods of time. Nixon and O viatt (1973)  H ow ever, Nixon and O viatt com m ent that these m enhaden seem ed n o t to be obtaining sufficient food for grow th in this area, b u t rather appeared to be seeking refuge from the voracious bluefish found in deeper p arts of the estuary. O ther authors have noted Atlantic m enhaden in areas adjacent to m arshes as w ell (Rulifson 1991). It is possible that in som e areas the contribution of m arshes to the trophic su p p o rt of Brevoortia tyranmis d u rin g the time that these fishes feed in w aters adjacent to salt m arshes m ay represent a significant export of m arsh prim ary production into open w aters and higher trophic levels on the Atlantic coast. The A tlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, m ay also be a particularly im portant species in the transfer of energy from m arsh and estuarine areas into the coastal ocean. This species spaw ns in shallow estuarine w aters including the m arsh surface (Fay et al. 1983). Silversides are p reyed u p o n by a variety of predators w ithin estuaries (Fay et al. 1983). Silversides also u n d ertak e a w in ter m igration into the coastal ocean w here they are further preyed upon by oceanic fishes, a n d experience considerable m ortality (Fay et al. 1983). Fitz an d W iegert (1991) suggested that blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, m ay function as vectors of carbon transport from the m arsh surface, though densities of crabs in their study were relatively sm all (40 -50 per hectare). These sam e authors also show ed through a tagging study that som e of the crabs w ere returning to the m arsh of initial capture: 28 of 107 m arked crabs were recaptured at least once in this study. Kneib (1982) al. (1980) found an im portant link betw een shallow estuarine habitats a n d the coastal ocean via export by m arine transient species in tidal creeks of the Cape Fear River estuary, and estim ated that biom ass available for ex port to the coastal ocean via m arine transients from these tidal creeks w as about 1.51 grains dry w eight p er square m eter of habitat at low tide. These patterns are seen in o th er species as well.

The data incorporated into the m odel are identical to the d ata used in the prim ary h abitat stu d y of C hapter 2, and are displayed in their entirety in Table 3 and Figures 3 an d 4 of C h a p te r 2. Since these data are thoroughly described in C hapter 2, the inform ation is n o t repeated here. Tw enty-three species of fishes and four species of crustacean These equations are show n in the Appendix. The function of the resulting descriptive m odel is to incorporate tide, tem perature, daylength, predator biomass, and p red ato r diet data into a dynam ic m athem atical calculation that predicts the consum ption of various prey groups by each nekton species in each habitat over time (Figure 1). This calculation was based on the daily ration for each p red ato r, the sam pled biomass of the predators, the percent by w eight m ade up of each prey item in the diet, and the time allowed by tidal in u ndation for feeding in each habitat, w ith a correction for tidal compression of habitats. D aily rations were taken from the literature and w ere adjusted to tem perature and to predator body size. This was done using Q io values from the literature and using W inberg's k for body size (W inberg 1960). M odel forcing functions were tem perature (from means m easured at the site), tidal height (from correlated N O A A tide data), and daylength (using an algorithm for the region). These forcing These can be seen in the last sections of the Appendix, w here they are individually docum ented. Daily rations (Table 1, also Appendix) w ere taken from the literature, then recalculated to be specific for a 1 gram (wet weight) anim al feeding at 20\u00b0 C. Exceptions to this were the calculation for paiaem onids, which applies to an 0.1 gram (w et weight) anim al and for large crabs, which applies to a 10.0 gram (wet weight) animal. Wet weights w ere Q 10 equations for predators were used to adjust the daily ration to tem perature, so that food intake increases with tem perature. Q,\" values were taken from the literature to apply to a tem perature range of 18\u00b0 C to 32\u00b0 C. These were w ritten to produce a value of 1.0 at 20\u00b0 C. These Q I0 expressions are docum ented in the last section of the Appendix. In general, Q 10 values less than 2.0 w ere found in the literature. A Q l0 value of 2.0 was used if literature w as n o t available. T he value of 2.0 produces results more com parable to those of Krogh's norm al curve for this tem perature range. K rogh's norm al curve is a m athem atical expression, sim ilar to Q I0, which is described in W inberg (1960) as a generally applicable description of m etabolic changes w ith tem perature in fishes. Diel feeding cycles for each pred ato r were also described w ith a param eter, m athem atically constructed so that a value of 1.0 indicates equal feeding during day a n d night (this is explained and docum ented in the last section of the Appendix). The fraction of tim e during d ay or night time that coincides w ith high tide w as calculated (see forcing functions above), an d related to the extent that each species uses m arshes during the day vs. the night. In practice, since consum ption is calculated by the m odel as a daily ration applied to a period of 24 hours, this calculation is not of great consequence to the final results. Tidal foraging efficiency was also described as a param eter for each species (see  The contents of the stom ach were exam ined for fish species that have distinct stom achs. Fundulids, however, have no distinct stom ach; for these species the content of the corresponding Section I of the gut (Babkin and Bowie 1928) w as examined. For crustaceans, the content of the cardiac stom ach (\"gastric mill\") was exam ined. Percent com position by volum e of dietary items in the guts w as estim ated indirectly (H yslop 1980) using a grid on the stage of a dissecting microscope (Odum 1970). Percent composition data from the gut content stu d y is reported as percent volume of item s in the gut content upon exam ination (Table 2). This does not necessarily reflect the d esired descriptor, which is the percent by w eight of item s th at are actually eaten in the diet. The conversion from percent of volum e to percent by w eight w as m ade by assum ing that all item s in the gut h ad approxim ately the sam e specific gravity, i.e., that all item s were slightly h eavier than water. Precedent for this can be found in Sw edberg and W alburg (1970). This does introduce some inaccuracy, in com parison to directly w eighing each item in a gut, but it is felt th at the inaccuracy resulting from this is not a m ajor concern. Certainly the savings in time resulting from this m ethod are very significant. Samples were preserved in the field using liquid nitrogen, and were transferred to an ultracold (-80\u00b0 C) freezer for storage. This m ethod assured that digestion was stopped com pletely w ithin m inutes after capture, and sim plified the processing of these samples.  (Table 1), this m ucus has been m athem atically rem oved from the percent volum e of gut contents show n for each prey; this was done to facilitate com parisons w ith other studies. The estim ated percent of m ucus is included in the m odeling of consum ption, how ever; regardless of origin, m ucus is an item that occupies volum e and has to be passed through the foreguts of predators. If m ucus w ere to be elim inated from the percent-of-gut data applied to the m odel, then the predicted percents-of-gut of all other prey items w ould increase accordingly, by a value of 20 -30% for species w hose guts regularly contained m ucus. The analysis of g ut inform ation in m y stu d y was collapsed w ith regard to season so as to provide m ore detail and better replication in exam ining patterns of habitat use and feeding. Guts obtained throughout the study are grouped into a m ean for June through October. This was necessary in order to provide enough g u ts for a m eaningful analysis. It should be noted that other a u th o rs have show n seasonal shifts in feeding (Schmelz 1964(Schmelz , W erm e 1981(Schmelz , M ansour 1992; these shifts are lost in my analysis. For this reason, my results are generally reported as values for the entire 150 days of the stu d y .

If various prey items are digested at different rates, then gut contents will tend to underestim ate the im portance of rapidly-digested items. H yslop (1980) rem arks that the error induced by differential digestion is m inim ized by sam pling as close to the period of peak feeding as possible, as in the high tide sam pling periods of this project. It is also thought that im m ediate preservation in the field w ith liquid nitrogen elim inated digestion after capture in this study, b u t digestion before capture is of course still a concern. The dom inant fish studied, Fundulus heteroclitus, does n o t possess a distinct stom ach, b u t rath e r a tubular digestive tract th at can be divided into 3 segm ents, I -III (Babkin and Bowie 1928). M um m ichogs feature an alkaline digestive system (Nicholls 1931) and digestion is rep o rted to be m inim al in the first h o u r following feeding (Nicholls 1931, W eisberg andLotrich 1982a). G iven the short time perio d of access to m arsh habitats, food item s consum ed on the m arsh surface w ere generally well preserved and easily identified. The question of differential digestion of the gut content, how ever, is not ad d ressed by this. In m y study, only items in segm ent I were removed from fundulids for analysis. A review of the published literature on differential digestion in fishes show s that several studies have been carried out, b u t on a w ide variety of fish species. Three studies w ere fo u n d w hich quantified rates of digestion of small, easily digestible particles versus larger a n d h a rd e r food items. G raphs in Kionka an d W indell (1972) show th at the background m atter of easily digestible particles in rainbow tro u t was processed up to 1.5 tim es faster than were large chitinous invertebrate parts. Swenson an d Smith (1973) found th at sm all m innow prey in w alleye g uts were digested about 2 tim es faster than were larg er m innow s at the same tem p eratu re (mean from data points if regressions are plotted). Lankford and Targett (1997) fo u n d that m ysid shrim p were evacuated 1.8 times faster th an larger, thicker shelled Crangon sh rim p in juvenile Cynoscion regalis (weakfish). Although these stu d ies em ployed different p red a to rs, different prey, and different m ethodology, they all seem to provide sim ilar results. Therefore the m ean value of these studies, 1.8, is used as a correction factor to account for slow er digestion of large h ard food item s in all fishes. It should be noted that the stu d y results w ere presented as rates, w hereas m y correction w as applied as a single factor. Fish guts in n atu re contain a m ixture of food that has been ingested over a period of time; in this situation a single correction factor can perhaps be appropriately applied. A nother trend w hich surfaces in the literatu re is th at rates of digestion seem sim ilar betw een different item s that are not large, hard-shelled, or bony. W eisberg et al. (1981) exam ined evacuation rates in m um m ichogs using trout chow pellets and chopped Palaemonetes spp at 20\u00b0 C. They found that rates of digestion w ere sim ilar for both food types tested, an d that both item s h a d passed through in 1 to 2 hours. Kionka and W indell (1972) found that sm aller chitinous parts w ere passed through the g u t at about the same rate as \"digestible organic m atter\" and that large size of chitinous particles played a bigger role in im peding progress than d id hardness alone. Kennedy (1969) reported that oligochaetes w ere rapidly digested by dace, b u t did not com pare rates to digestion of other m atter since oligochaetes w ere the only food offered to the experim ental fish. In fact, oligochaetes rem ained identifiable in the stom achs of dace until they passed to the intestine 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Parts of cuticle rem ained identifiable for up to 24 hours in the intestines of dace, an d w ere recognizable for as long as they rem ained in the fish (Kennedy 1969). It is certainly possible to interpret K ennedy's results to indicate that oligochaetes are n o t digested so rapidly as to constitute a differential rate problem in gut content studies. Because of the results of these studies I conclude that there is insufficient evidence to w arrant ap plying a correction factor to account for m ore rapid digestion of very soft prey relative to the general background of \"digestible organic m atter\" (sensu Kionka an d W indell 1972). The only correction for differential digestion in fishes, then, was to div id e percents of gut content for large, hard shelled prey such as crabs and m ussels by 1.8 relative to other p rey so as to approxim ate the actual percent of diet. Follow ing this correction, all percents of gut content were then readjusted by the factor necessary to bring the total back to 100%."}, {"section_title": "Q uantification of differential digestion in crustaceans", "text": "D igestion in crustaceans m ay differ from digestion in fishes. A prim ary reason to explain this in the case of the blue crab and certain other crustaceans is the presence of a toothed, m uscular gastric mill (\"grinding stom ach\" ). Differential digestion in blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) w as studied by C uster (1985). Interestingly, for sm all and m edium sized crabs (mean carapace w idth 35 and 51 mm), C uster found no significant differences in rates of digestion of m ussels (eaten w ith shell), shrim p (Penaeus), o r fish (w hole small Bairdiella chrysoura). A significant difference w as found, however, for large crabs (mean carapace w idth 84 mm) in that m ussel and shrim p prey were cleared from g uts m ore rapidly than w ere fish. Fish bones often rem ained in stom achs of large crabs 12 hours after feeding, while m ussel and shrim p food w as cleared w ithin 6 hours. Custer used fish p rey that w ere sized appropriately to each crab size class, and it is possible that the slower digestion of fish in large crabs vs. small and m edium crabs results from her use of larger fish prey (with larger bones) for the larger crabs. C uster noted that m ussel shells were regurgitated by the crab within 2 -6 hours from feeding, an d that this accounted for the unexpected rap id rem oval of these h ard item s from the stom ach. Even though no statistical differences were found, a slight trend in rates, w ith m ussels being rem oved fastest, then shrim p, then fish is evident from the regression lines presented in C uster's Figures 2 through 5 for crabs of all sizes combined an d individually. Also, it should be noted that C uster found that soft fleshy tissue was always digested w ithin two hours. The purpose of C uster's stu d y was to com pare digestion of m ussels, shrim p, and fish; but it can also be inferred from h er results that digestion of soft organic tissue w as perhaps 3 times as rap id as was digestion of shell, carapace, and bone. This conclusion results from her findings, for sm all and m edium sized crabs, that flesh is cleared w ithin two h o u rs w hile harder parts are cleared w ithin 6 hours. Consequently, although C uster's study reported m inim al differences in digestive rate for the tested prey items, a difference is im plied for rates of digestion betw een the tested item s and soft tissue. Based on the w ork of Custer, a correction is m ade for digestion of very soft prey in crabs (annelids) b u t not for digestion of any hard b o died creatures. It is assum ed that soft unshelled organisms pass through crabs 3 times faster th an d o shelled organism s or the general m atrix of refractory m aterial th at typified crab gut contents. This factor w as applied in the sam e way that the correction for fishes was applied, w ith the sam e caveat regarding rates vs. single factors. Again based on Custer, no correction is m ad e for differences in rates of digestion between types of hard-shelled organism s or betw een these organism s and the general matrix of crab stom ach content. The slight (not statistically significant) trends in rates seen among prey types in C uster do not suggest that corrections are necessary between types of hard bodied prey to obtain reasonable results in predicting diet. Palaem onid shrim p also consume invertebrates (Sikora 1977, M organ 1980, Kneib 1985, b u t no inform ation could be found dealing w ith differential digestion in these crustaceans. M cTigue and Feller (1989) suggest that differential digestion probably takes place in penaid shrim p, and point o u t that the gastric mill of penaids is less calcified than in o th er decapods; this seem s true of palaem onid guts upon exam ination as well. The palaem onid sh rim p I studied did n o t show a trem endous variety of food size and hardness in their diets. M ost g u t m aterial was decaying organic detritus, at times m ixed w ith algae or other vegetative m atter. C om m on prey item s were nereids and insect larvae (Table 2). N o hard parts of larger prey w ere seen. Based on the uniform appearance of the gut content of these animals, and on the lack of inform ation in the literature, no correction factor for differential digestion in palaem onid shrim p is offered. U nfortunately, little quantitative inform ation exists to describe differences in feeding on the m arsh surface w ithin the cycle of h ig h tide. It is not know n to w h a t extent nekton are actively feeding w h en they are com pressed by tides into edge habitats. If a n assum ption is m ad e that feeding is uniform at all stages of the tide, then consum ption in habitats n e a r the edge is calculated to be very high due to this tidal p o pulation com pression. It m ay be loosely im plied from the d a ta of Kneib and W agner (1994)  and it is obvious from this type of calculation that feeding cannot be uniform through the entire tidal cycle as residents are concentrated by falling tides. In order to deal w ith this problem , I applied \"tidal correction factors\" to m arsh resident use of the entire m arsh surface. The correction factors are applied uniform ly to all high tide habitats to adjust daily ration. First, the uncorrected total consum ption of each m arsh resident species is estim ated from the basic (uncorrected) model. The uncorrected consum ption figure results from model assum ptions of: population densities as determ ined at slack high tide, equal feeding efficiency in each habitat for the tim e p e rio d that each h a b ita t is in u n d ated , a n d no tidal compression of populations w hen tides differ from slack high. This results in an underestim ate of consum ption, because the m odel only considers anim als in high m arsh habitats to exist during the time p eriod of high m arsh inundation. N ext, a second consum ption estim ate is derived for the entire population as sam pled at slack h ig h tide, had all anim als rem ained on the m arsh for the entire time p e rio d th at any m arsh h a b ita t was in u n d ated . This second estim ate predicts w h a t the sam pled p opulation should consum e d u ring the entire time period th at the m arsh is flooded. Both of these estim ates are generated in an identical m anner, using the published daily ratio n s th at are inco rp o rated into the m athem atical m odel described above (w ith corrections for low -tide feeding). T he \"tidal correction factor\" is taken as the ratio betw een these tw o estim ates. This is don e on the m ean results of the entire five m o n th study to achieve a single correction factor for each species. In use, results of the uncorrected m odel for each habitat are m ultiplied by the correction factor so th a t resident nek to n actually consum e their entire daily ration. If no correction is applied, th en m arsh resid en t nekton populations consum e considerably less th an their expected daily ration, w hich is clearly an unacceptable situation. The correction factor w as rem arkably sim ilar for all species of fu n d u lid at about 3.0. The correction factor for palaem onid shrim p w as sm aller, a t 1.8. A nother correction factor w as applied similarly to estim ates o f low tide co n su m p tio n by m arsh resident fishes, so that the complete daily ration of the estim ated populations of residents w ere m et. The population of larger m um m ichogs and strip ed killifishes w as not well sam pled at low tide. This is thought to be due to gear avoidance of the throw -sam pler w hen u se d in shallow unvegetated areas (see C hapter 1). Kneib (1997a) suggests th a t adult fishes do not use the m arsh surface as a prim ary low tide refuge. In any case, the low tide estim ates of adult m um m ichog population num bers are about 5.3 tim es less than the h ig h tide estim ates if the area available to the population is considered in each case. This value w as applied as a correction factor to the low tide population estim ates, again to m aintain th e daily ration of the population a n d to avoid underestim ating consum ption at low tid e . These correction factors are based on several assum ptions, the first of w hich is that the pop u latio n of each species of m arsh residents in this area is adequately described by slack h igh tide sam pling. O nce an estimate of the total population is obtained, then this population is assum ed to be closed w ithin a tidal cycle; the entire group feeds on the m arsh surface at high tide, and the entire g ro u p feeds in the subtidal at low tide (note that an adjustm ent is m ade for use of m arsh surface m icrohabitat as low tide refuge b y small nekton, how ever). The correction factors are then ap p lied to provide the population w ith the a p p ro p riate daily ration over the en tire tidal cycle. W hile the application of \"correction factors\" is generally not desirable, they are felt to be necessary in this case for resident nekton. Both transient and resident m arsh nekton w ere sam pled as a snapshot at slack high tide; this allows a valid estim ate of n ek to n populations p e r square m eter at that tim e. If the total area available of each h ab itat is know n, then an estimate of the total population can also be made, as w as done here. R esident nekton live in expanding and contracting habitats, how ever, which causes the num ber of individuals in a square m eter to change despite assum ed stable total population sizes.

O ther studies have not separately quantified crabs at the edge. Several authors (Kneib 1982, Fitz andW iegert 1991) have suggested that blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, may function to transfer trophic energy from the m arsh surface. In these studies, crab densities were fairly low (40 -50 per hectare in Fitz an d W iegert, less than 0.7 per 100 m '2 in Kneib 1982). In the system I sam pled, the density of crabs is at least tw o orders of m agnitude higher. Therefore, crabs may be expected to play a correspondingly greater role in energy transfer in m y system , particularly from m arsh edge areas. Blue crabs are opportunistic feeders. Trophic patterns in blue crab use of m arsh habitat are sum m arized by Laughlin (1982) w ho exam ined over 4000 guts and concluded that the feeding habit of crabs was m ostly dependent on w hatever foods w ere locally available.

If so, then blu e crabs are gaining energy through a fairly direct p ath w ay to the high prim ary production of the m arsh surface.

In fact, m arsh edge and unvegetated areas may function together to support crab populations at m y site.

In m y study, sm all blue crabs were m ore abundant in unvegetated areas at low tide th a n at high tide (Table 3, C h ap ter 1), but this w as n o t statistically significant (Table 4A, C h ap ter 1). The Low tide Shallow habitat (0 -10 cm deep) w as frequented by very sm all blue crabs; of 104 crabs captured here, only 3 were greater than 35 m m CW. This size distribution also suggests a shallow w ater refuge from predation at low tide here, given the scarcity of larger crabs. The structure p rovided by aquatic vegetation also acts as a refuge to blue crabs (Heck and T hom an 1981). The m arsh edge m ay function as an im portant high-tide refuge for small blue crabs that feed on nereids in the adjacent unvegetated at other stages of tide. I suggest that the adjacent m arsh edge an d unvegetated intertidal habitats p ro v id e a productive com bination of food and structural refuge for sm all blue crabs. This also a p p ears to be true for Lucania parva. I therefore consider that these areas are inextricably linked, a n d do not attem pt to separate the contribution of m arsh edge an d unvegetated areas based on refuge value or feeding opportunity. Consum ption and export from the m arsh edge (discussed below ) is driven by blue crabs feeding on nereids, and this area m ay be thought of functionally as a m arsh ed g e /u n v e g e ta ted complex. Drop ring sam ples taken a t the m arsh edge included half vegetated area a n d half unvegetated area. A lthough the term \"m arsh edge\" is used in the discussion that follows, the unvegetated side of this interface is just as im portant as the vegetated side. In fact, it is the com bination of attributes from both habitats that m ak e edges so valuable.    unvegetated in tertid al d e a rly plays a m ajor role in the trophic su pport of shallow w ater nekton in m y sam pling area. This is d ue in p a rt to the use of this area as a low tide refuge by m arsh residents, in p a rt to the longer tim e perio d for w hich this habitat is inundated and available, a n d in p a rt to the large biom ass of infaunal prey available here (Diaz et al.,  This phenom enon is due in part to the generally larger percentages of anim al prey in guts of anim als cap tu red in the m arsh interior. W hile infauna are m ore abundant in unvegetated areas, their extraction from the sedim ent m ay entail consum ption of substrate a n d detritus. The m arsh surface is relatively clean, a n d prey in guts are generally n o t associated w ith quantities of detritus.

A n area such as the m arsh interior m ay be very im portant as an opportunity to feed rapidly, even if for only a short w hile (W eisberg a n d Lotrich 1982b). M arsh habitats are very complex.

Rozas (1993) concluded that m arsh edge was selected for by estuarine transients, including species of com m ercial value. M y stu d y adds to this body of evidence, and extends the geographic regions in w hich these studies have been conducted. M uch of the previous w ork with salt m arsh edges has been in Gulf and so u th Atlantic m arshes. These m arshes function differently than mid-Atlantic m arshes, in p a rt because of the very different tidal regim es in each area (Rozas 1993, Kneib 1997a. N onetheless, some broad conclusions reg ard in g relationships betw een m arsh surface and m arsh edge ap p ly sim ilarly in different regions. M y study exam ines a m arsh transect in m ore spatial and tem poral detail than have m an y previous works, quantifying nekton an d estim ating consum ption in 5 habitats at high tide a n d 3 habitats at low tide over a 5 m onth period. This consum ption and export analysis lends fu rth er support to the notion that edges are extremely valuable areas for salt m arsh function. In m y m arsh, the im portance of ed g e w as clearly dependent on the adjacent unvegetated area. This may be tru e in other regions as well. Edges by definition include tw o habitat types, a n d it is this com bination of h abitats that m ake edges valuable. Indeed, it is generally in agreem ent that m arshes w ith more edge habitat support higher densities of estuarine nekton, and that created m arshes should attem pt to m axim ize edge by incorporating reticulation into m arsh design Zim m erm an 1992, Peterson andT urner 1994). M y study supports these findings, given especially that the adjacent unvegetated intertidal was very im portant to trophic processes in my sam pling area. If a productive intertid al unvegetated site in m y sam pling area were replaced w ith a featureless high elevation m itigation marsh, the net benefit to the ecosystem m ight not be as planned. H ow ever, since m arsh edge is utilized to a greater extent than is either unvegetated intertidal or m arsh interior, restoration that includes the creation of an extensive m arsh ed g e system m ay well lead to a net im provem ent of ecosystem function as trophic support for deeper ecosystems. In the tidal regim e of this area (and quite possibly in other tidal regim es) it appears that the unvegetated, the m arsh edge, and the m arsh surface function together a Feeding by m um m ichogs w as sim ilar to that rep o rted in Kneib and Stiven (1978) for a N orth Carolina m arsh.

Note that in order to com pare nekton a n d invertebrates within a habitat, the following pairs should be used: Hl_ or H_ (nekton) and H_ (invertebrates) represent the sa m e habitat -m arsh interior HE_ or L_ (nekton) and L_ (invertebrates) represent the sa m e habitat -m arsh ed g e UF_ or U_ (nekton) and U_ (invertebrates) represent the sa m e habitat -unveg etated are a, which is a com posite of habitats HU, LD and LS with time dry for nekton a s tides move over the flat. The model displays predation in two w ays: predation in gram s dry weight removed p e r day (_Pr), and a s an integration of total gram s dry weight removed over tim e. (_TPr). If _TPr is used, the model should be run for the desired length of time using the STARTTIME and STOPTIME p aram eters in the window that ap p e ars on th e first graph pad in the run m enu. After running for this length of time, the end value of _TPr is read. This calculates total predation over the specified length of time for any predator/prey com bination. The ration is specific for a 1 gram (wet weight) animal feeding at 20 deg rees Celsius, with the exception of Palaem onetes, which is for an 0.1 gram (wet weight) animal and for large crabs (_Lcal_), which is for a 10.0 gram (wet weight) animal.) genDRtwClg = 0.12 (mean of all docum ented values below) hetDRtwClg = 0.162 (modified from W eisberg et al 1981 and W eisberg and Lotrich 1982} menDRtwClg = genDRtwClg sciDRtwClg = 0.069 {modified from Brooks 1985 for B. chrysoura} ScalDRtwClg = 0.142 {value for Leal (below) extrapolated to smaller crabs using Laird a n d H aefner 1976} LcalDRtwCIOg = 0.079 {method of Elliott a n d P errson 1978 applied to data from Ryer 1987} palDRtwColg = 0.127 {modified from Morgan 1980 \u2022 P redator Q10 equations, tem perature ran g e of 18 to 32 d eg rees C.

A value of 1.0 indicates eq u al feeding during day and night. The fraction of time during daylight that is available to a daytim e feed er for feeding can be calculated a s (DayLength/24). In practice, since consum ption is calculated a s a daily ration av erag ed over 24 hours, this calculation is of very little co n se q u e n c e to the final results for an individual fish. The diel factor d o es affect habitat-specific daily ration over a 24 hour time period. This is b ec au se th e relative extent to which each habitat is flooded during the peak feeding time might ch ange from day to day given different tide/daylength com binations.
