Different factors explain cotton farmers' participation decision in land retirement programs and working land conservation programs. On one hand, this indicates successful policy implementation; two types of conservation programs can attract different types of farmers thereby allowing a wider spectrum of farmers to engage in conservation efforts. On the other hand, it poses a challenge for policy-makers to accurately identify farmers who are willing to adopt environmentally benign farming practices under different incentive schemes.

This is due to the recognition that agriculture as a business inherently involves more risk and uncertainty than other sectors based on industrial or human actions. The enactment of the Food Security Act in 1985 was a beginning of a new trend in U.S. agricultural policy to address the growing concern for natural resource degradation attributed to agricultural operation. The 1985 Farm Bill launched the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that encourages farmers to retire environmentally sensitive farmland from production by providing land rental rates for the retired lands (Cattaneo, et. al, 2005). The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 authorized the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) that offers financial and technical assistance for farmers to promote agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals (USDA NRCS 2006). The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 expanded conservation funding by 80% and reauthorized the EQIP with greater contract flexibility and increased funding (Cattaneo, 2003). Unlike the CRP that intends to realize long-term environmental benefits by retiring farmlands from production, programs such as the EQIP are termed Working Land Conservation Programs (WLCP) because they support natural resource conservation on working agricultural lands. The advantage of the WLCP compared to land retirement programs is its low opportunity cost of land use, as farmers can continue commodity production while employing conservation practices (Aillery 2006). The CRP has been by far the largest agri-environmental program since its inception, accounting for approximately 90% of the total conservation payment from 1986 through 2005 (Aillery, 2006). However, the recent farm bills shifted preference from the CRP toward the WLCP. Much of the increase in conservation funding under the 2002 Farm Bill was allocated to the EQIP (Claassen, 2003). This trend continued in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which authorized the EQIP with increased funding of $7.25 billion for the fiscal years 2008 to 2012. In summary, there have been two major trends in U.S. agricultural policy since the 1985 Farm Bill. One is the increasing federal spending on conservation programs to address natural resource concerns due to agricultural operation. The other is the increasing federal spending on the WLCP among those conservation programs."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "Despite the growing concern for natural resource conservation on farmland and the abundant empirical evidence on factors affecting adoption of environmentally benign farming practices, there are three important issues that have gathered little attention: factors affecting participation in conservation programs and comparison of such factors across different types of conservation programs and different types of farmers. This study attempts to address these issues by identifying factors affecting participation in the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Programs for cotton farms in the Southeastern region. We also contrast factors affecting participation in the conservation programs for cotton farms and all farms in the region.  \u2022 Larger farms are more likely to enroll in conservation programs. \u2022 Financial ratios have contrasting impacts on EQIP and CRP participation in both models. In Model 1, both current ratio and debt to asset ratio are negatively correlated with CRP participation, while in Model 2, current ratio is positively correlated with CRP participation. \u2022 PIZA has a negative impact on EQIP and CRP participation; farmland with higher opportunity costs is less likely to be enrolled in conservation programs. \u2022 Comparison of the two models reveals that factors affecting cotton farmers' decision to participate in conservation programs are quite different from those for the general farm population in the Southeastern region."}]
