[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "Treatment of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may involve a range of medical interventions. Three distinct invasive interventions that can be readily identified in routinely collected health data and have been used in the treatment of severe COVID-19 are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), tracheostomy, and dialysis. For those patients with refractory hypoxemia, ECMO provides an advanced organ support alternative.1 Tracheostomy gives a means of facilitating long-term mechanical ventilation among critically ill patients.2 Additionally, the wide-ranging effects of COVID-19 are also seen with the need for dialysis to support kidney function among patients with an acute kidney injury.3,4 There remains uncertainty around the optimal use of each of these interventions among patients with COVID-19. For those patients who do undergo them, the use of these interventions can be taken to indicate severe disease and, for survivors, will likely be associated with long-term morbidity.1,5\u20137\nEvidence on the extent of the use of invasive interventions among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 can help improve our understanding of patient outcomes, inform healthcare resource planning, and provide an indication of some of the long-term consequences of the disease. Our objective in this study was therefore to describe the use of ECMO, tracheostomy, and dialysis among patients hospitalized with COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Six large databases containing routinely-collected health care data from the United States (US) provided the basis for the analysis, with each mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). The HealthVerity database contains information on individuals with a test for COVID-19 with linkage to medical claims and pharmacy data. The Premier Healthcare Database (Premier) includes clinical coding, hospital cost, and patient billing data. IQVIA Open Claims captures open, pre-adjudicated medical claims. Optum\u00ae de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset (Optum EHR) Dataset represents Optum\u2019s EHR data, while Optum\u00ae De-Identified Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart Database \u2013 Socio-Economic Status Database (Optum SES) is an adjudicated administrative health claims database. The Department of Veterans Affairs OMOP (VA-OMOP) database reflects the national Department of Veterans Affairs health care system.\nThis study is part of the ongoing Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Characterizing Health Associated Risks, and Your Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2 (CHARYBDIS) project, with the findings presented here based on data submitted as of 1st October 2020.\nPatients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified in the same way as in a previous OHDSI study,8 with COVID-19 hospitalizations running up to March 2020 in OPTUM SES, up to May in IQVIA Open Claims and Premier, and up to June HEALTHVERITY, OPTUM EHR, VA-OMOP. The characteristics of study participants up to and including each individuals\u2019 date of hospitalization (index date) were extracted, including age, sex and comorbidities (asthma, autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease [CKD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity).\nInstances of ECMO, tracheostomy, and dialysis were identified between the index date and up to 30 days following the date. Instances of dialysis were also identified in the interval from 30 days to 1 day prior to index date. The proportion of patients who underwent the interventions was calculated for each database, and stratified by age (65 or younger, and over 65), sex, and comorbidities of interest.\nThe entire list of definitions used to identify patients with a COVID-19 hospitalization, their comorbidities, and interventions of interest can be explored at https://github.com/ohdsistudies/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/blob/master/documents/CharybdisPhenotypeLibrary.csv."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A total of 240,392 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Their baseline characteristics are described in Table 1.\nAcross the six databases, 398 (0.17% [95% CI: 0.15% to 0.18%)] patients underwent ECMO. The proportion of patients who underwent ECMO ranged from 0.10% (0.06% to 0.15%) in HealthVerity to as high as 0.26% (0.20% to 0.32%) in OPTUM EHR. ECMO was more often seen among patients under 65 and males, Figure 1. In IQVIA Open Claims, for example, 0.34% (0.29% to 0.38%) of those under 65 underwent ECMO while only 0.02% (0.01% to 0.03%) of those 65 or older did so, and 0.21% (0.18% to 0.24%) of men received the intervention compared to 0.12% (0.09% to 0.14%) of women. ECMO was generally used less for most of the comorbidities considered, except for obesity (Figure 2).\nIn total, 1,681 (0.70% [0.67% to 0.73%]) had a tracheostomy, with this proportion ranging from 0.28% (0.12% to 0.43%) in OPTUM SES to 1.11% (0.88% to 1.34%) in VA-OMOP. Use of tracheostomy was similar by age and sex, Figure 1, and by comorbidity, Figure 2, across databases.\nA total of 9,703 (4.04% [3.96% to 4.11%]) patients received dialysis over the 30 days following hospitalization across the six databases, ranging from 2.61% (2.13% to 3.08%) in OPTUM SES to 6.37% (5.84% to 6.90%) in VA-OMOP. In comparison, in the 30 days prior to hospitalization, 0.6% of patients in VA-OMOP, 0.7% in OPTUM EHR, and 1.9% in IQVIA Open Claims were seen to have undergone dialysis. Use of dialysis was similar by age but was more common among men, Figure 1. In IQVIA Open Claims, for example, 4.22% (4.08% to 4.37%) of men underwent dialysis while 2.77% (2.64% to 2.89%) of women did so. Dialysis was more common among those with pre-existing CKD, Figure 2. In Premier, 16.43% (15.43% to 17.42%) of those with CKD underwent dialysis after being hospitalized compared to 4.58% (4.35% to 4.81%) for those without. Dialysis was also typically more common for other comorbidities, except asthma (Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Prior to COVID-19, ECMO, tracheostomy, and dialysis for acute renal failure have each been associated with poor long-term health outcomes.1,5\u20137 While continued follow-up is required to observe the long-term outcomes of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and underwent such interventions, it can be expected that those individuals that survived their hospitalization will face long-term morbidity and require ongoing care.\nAround 4% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 identified in this study were seen to have undergone dialysis between the day of their admission and 30 days later. This is broadly in line with the findings of a multi-center study across 12 hospitals in New York City, where around 4% of 5,700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 received kidney replacement therapy.9 Higher use has though been seen for the Mount Sinai hospital system in New York City, where 9% of 3,993 hospitalized patients underwent dialysis,10 and among the first 1,000 patients hospitalized in the NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where 14% received dialysis.11 These higher rates might reflect differences in patient populations, if those admitted in these centers had particularly severe disease, or differences in treatment protocols. Given their rare occurrence, relatively few studies have reported on the use of tracheostomy and ECMO among COVID-19 patients. One of the aforementioned studies showed the use of ECMO to be 0.6%,11 which is slightly higher than seen in this study, which likely reflects both the setting and the severity of the patients seen at this center.\nIn this study we have focused on three invasive interventions which could be readily identified in each of the databases. The consistency of our results across databases is reassuring. However, it is possible that use of interventions may be underestimated if not all interventions used are unambiguously reported. This, for example, may be the concern for dialysis which when performed in intensive care may not have been recorded with a specific code, but rather billed as part of overall intensive care stay. In addition, among the databases with limited prior observation time, comorbidities can also be expected to be underreported, as can be seen with obesity in particular in HEALTHVERITY and Premier. Further interventions are of interest but were beyond the scope of this study. In particular, while we also assessed the feasibility of summarizing the use of mechanical ventilation, this was seen to have heterogeneous reporting across databases.\nThe findings from this study underline the severity of disease among hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. The long-term consequences for individuals who underwent the interventions and were discharged alive are likely to be substantial, both in terms of morbidity for the patients and economic burden for both patients and the health system, with individuals likely to have long-term health care needs."}]
