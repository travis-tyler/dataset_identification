[{"section_title": "HIGHLIGHTS", "text": "The aim of this study was to determine whether student, parent, and peer engagement factors that contributed to at-risk students' success in graduating from high school continued to be important in making the transition from high school to postsecondary education. Only students who were considered at moderate to high risk of dropping out of high school were included in the analysis (about one-quarter of 1992 high school graduates). They were identified as those exhibiting two or more of the following six risk factors: family in the lowest socioeconomic quartile, from a single-parent home, earned grades of C's or lower from 6th to 8th grade, held back a grade, changed schools two or more times outside of the normal progression, or have an older sibling who dropped out of high school. Key findings are as follows. Parent and peer engagement indicators were especially strong influences on postsecondary enrollment. Moderate-to high-risk youth whose parents frequently discussed school-related matters with them in high school had much higher odds of both 4-year college enrollment and enrollment in any postsecondary education, compared with their peers whose parents had no discussions with them. Parents' educational expectations also exerted a strong influence on whether or not moderate-to high-risk teens enrolled in any postsecondary education. Compared to students whose friends did not have college plans, students who reported that most or all of their high school friends had plans for enrolling in a 4-year college were far more likely to enroll in a 4-year college themselves. The importance that friends attributed to learning activities such as studying and getting good grades had a strong positive effect on whether or not students enrolled in any postsecondary education, but not on whether they enrolled in a 4-year college. Participating in college preparation activities increased the odds of enrolling in postsecondary education. Gathering information about financial aid and talking to individuals about aid increased the odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education, while getting help with preparing for entrance exams and the college application process increased the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college. Moderate-to high-risk students who reported participating in college outreach programs increased their odds of enrolling in a 4-year college nearly twofold."}, {"section_title": "iii FOREWORD", "text": "In December 1997, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) published Confronting the Odds: Students at Risk and the Pipeline to Higher Education (NCES 98-094), prepared by Laura Horn of MPR Associates. This study was one in a series known as the Postsecondary Education Descriptive Analysis Reports (PEDAR). The PEDAR reports are based principally on data collected in NCES' longitudinal studies, and have covered such topics as transfer behavior, part-time undergraduates, minority student participation, packaging of financial aid, and others (these and other NCES publications are available for downloading at this website: http://nces.ed.gov). The National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning (PLLI) is housed in the same organizational unit of the U.S. Department of Education as NCES, and its staff interacts frequently with NCES, serving on technical review panels, performing data editing services, and assisting in the development of surveys. In the course of reviewing drafts of Confronting the Odds, PLLI was intrigued by the possibility of taking a more focused look at the \"at-risk\" population in relation to postsecondary enrollment and persistence. Specifically, we wanted to concentrate on moderate-to high-risk high school students who overcame the odds and enrolled in higher education, and to provide some idea of how this population was distributed by raceethnicity. We thus asked MPR Associates to conduct a second analysis of the issue. We were also interested in an alternative statistical methodology, namely, logistic regression and the explanatory power of the \"odds ratios\" produced by this procedure. One might note, for example, that 80 percent of the students who enrolled in a 4-year college reported that all or most of their friends had planned to attend college (see Confronting the Odds, p. 35). That statement, however, is not as persuasive as the observation in this document, that the odds of attending a 4-year college are 6 times as high if all or most of your friends plan to attend college than if none of your friends plans to attend. Odds ratios can be powerful tools for high school counselors, teachers, and college outreach workers."}, {"section_title": "iv FOREWORD", "text": "The data set used in both Confronting the Odds and Toward Resiliency is the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88).

Given these demands, it is encouraging to note that nearly two-thirds of 1988 8th-graders had enrolled in some form of postsecondary education by 1994, two years after most completed high school (Sanderson et al. 1996), and that three-quarters of high school graduates had enrolled (Berkner and Chavez 1997). Nonetheless, there were still great disparities in postsecondary enrollment when socioeconomic status was considered: 36 percent of students from families in the lowest socioeconomic quartile had enrolled in some postsecondary education, while the vast majority (88 percent) of students in the highest quartile had done so. The purpose of this research, however, is not to present evidence concerning well-known and documented disparities, but to explore why certain students identified as at risk of school failure managed to succeed in school and enroll in postsecondary education despite social and educational disadvantages. How are these students different from their less successful at-risk counterparts? The study took advantage of a considerable amount of research that has been conducted by MPR Associates, Inc. for the National Center for Education Statistics in two areas: (1) at-risk secondary school populations, and (2) issues related to postsecondary access and choice. The current study combines these two areas by identifying students at risk according to factors that increase their likelihood of dropping out of high school, and then examines the experiences of atrisk youth who not only managed to graduate from high school, but who also entered postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Chen and Kaufman recently expanded on research first conducted by Kaufman and Bradby (1992), who used the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) to profile 8thgraders at risk of dropping out of school between 8th and 10th grade. Chen and Kaufman's study (1997) extended the time frame through the second follow-up (1992) when most of the cohort graduated from high school, to compare at-risk students who dropped out of high school with their resilient counterparts (at-risk students who graduated). To understand why resilient students INTRODUCTION remained in school despite the odds against their doing so, factors such as family stability, parental involvement in school activities, students' attitudes about learning, and peer associations were examined and compared to the experiences of students who dropped out. The results revealed that resilient students had more positive attitudes about school, had more cohesive families, had parents who were more supportive of their schooling, and had peers more engaged in school than did dropouts. The study concluded that these positive experiences play a protective role in reducing the impact of risk on resilient students. The analysis reported here identifies students at risk according to similar risk factors that were defined in Chen and Kaufman's study and tracks the progress of the resilient at-risk students to see if they continued their education beyond high school. The analysis also builds on the findings from a descriptive study recently published by the National Center for Education Statistics (Horn 1997), which described high school graduates' experiences in the. \"pipeline\" to higher education. The pipeline refers to five junctures or steps necessary to make the successful transition from high school to college. These include having a bachelor's degree goal, being at least minimally prepared academically to attend college, taking entrance exams, applying to college, and enrolling in college. The pipeline study determined how at-risk students differed from their counterparts who were not at-risk in terms of their college pipeline experiences and further compared at-risk students who successfully enrolled in a 4-year college with their at-risk counterparts who did not. The results indicated that even among students who were at least minimally prepared academically to enroll in college, at-risk students were less likely to take entrance exams and apply to college than were their counterparts who were not at risk. The results further suggested that there were certain student, parent, and peer engagement indicators that distinguished \"successful\" at-risk studentsthose who went on to collegefrom their at-risk peers who did not enroll. This analysis expands on the pipeline study by using logistic regression models to determine if the engagement indicators analyzed in previous studies increased the likelihood of moderate-to high-risk students enrolling in postsecondary education, after controlling for risk factors, math coursetaking, and achievement measures, as well as activities presumed to be important for preparing for college."}, {"section_title": "3 RISK, OUTCOMES, AND ENGAGEMENT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Risk Factors", "text": "In earlier studies conducted on the base-year and first follow-up NELS surveys (8th-and 10th-graders), many factors were identified as being associated with an increased probability of school failure and dropping out (Kaufman and Bradby 1992). These factors were often highly correlated with students' demographic characteristics, especially gender, raceethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). However, after controlling for these demographic factors, there were five factors related to family background or early school experiences that still substantially increased the odds of dropping out of high school.' These factors included being from a single parent household, having an older sibling who dropped out of high school, changing schools two or more times other than the normal progression (e.g., from elementary to middle school), having poorer than average grades, and repeating an earlier grade. Therefore, in this analysis, SES and the additional five risk factors (listed below) are used to identify 8th-graders at risk.2"}, {"section_title": "Lowest socioeconomic quartile", "text": "Single-parent family Older sibling dropped out of high school (asked in the 10th grade) Changed schools two or more times from 1st to 8th grade Average grades of C's or lower from 6th to 8th grade Repeated an earlier grade from 1st to 8th grade 11n Chen and Kaufman's study, a sixth factor, having limited English proficiency, was also identified. However, after controlling for all other risk factors, limited English proficiency was a weak predictor of dropping out. In addition, the students identified in the NELS:88 survey who were of limited English proficiency were those who were proficient enough to complete the questionnaire and were thus not necessarily representative of all limited English proficiency 8th-graders in 1988. Thus, language proficiency was not considered a risk factor for this analysis. 2The at-risk population identified in this study differs slightly from Chen and Kaufman's study for two of the risk factors, lower than average grades and changing schools. The current study characterized students according to their risk status in the 8th grade (with the exception of having dropout siblings which was asked in the first follow-up survey). Therefore, having grades of C's or lower was determined from 6th to 8th grades and changing schools was determined from 1st through 8th grades. Chen and Kaufman's study, on the other hand, included high school grades and changing secondary schools."}, {"section_title": "DATA, DEFINITIONS, AND METHODS", "text": "Students were further identified according to their level of risk based on the number of risk factors they had accumulated. One risk factor was considered low risk; two risk factors constituted moderate risk; and students with three or more risk factors were considered to be at high risk of dropping out. In their preliminary analysis, Chen and Kaufman (1997) found that students who showed at least two risk factors had much higher odds of dropping out of school than students who had no risk factors. In terms of odds, compared with students with no risk factors, students who had one risk factor were 4 times more likely to drop out of school, students who had two risk factors were 13 times more likely to drop out, and students who had three or more risk factors were 30 times more likely to drop out. For this study, therefore, we focused on students at moderate or high risk. Table 1 identifies 1992 high school graduates according to their risk status. Approximately one-third were at low risk (one risk factor), 16 percent were at moderate risk (two risk factors), and 9 percent were at high risk (three or more risk factors). The average number of risk factors among all 1992 high school graduates was about 1.7. This analysis includes only students considered at moderate or high risk. They constitute about one-quarter of the cohort of 1992 high school graduates (figure 1).  As shown in table 2, the most common risk factor was changing schools two or more times (27 percent) followed by being in the lowest socioeconomic quartile (18 percent) and having grades of C's or lower from 6th to 8th grade (17 percent). Approximately 15 percent of NELS high school graduates lived in a single parent home as 8th-graders and 11 percent either had been held back a grade or had siblings who dropped out of high school. Those who were held back or who had a sibling who dropped out of school had more risk factors on average than students with other risk factors (see table 1). Table 2 also illustrates how the risk factors are interrelated. For example, among high-risk students, two thirds had changed schools two or more times. The same proportion (66 percent) were in the lowest socioeconomic quartile, and more than half of highrisk students had grades of C's or lower or had single parents. As might be expected, given the inclusion of low SES as a risk factor, students at moderate or high risk were more likely to be African American or Hispanic than were students at lower 16 5 DATA, DEFINITIONS, AND METHODS risk (table 3). In fact, African Americans were about twice as likely to be at high risk (22 percent) than they were to be at low risk (10 percent). Since parents' education is a component of SES, it is also not surprising that moderate-to high-risk students also had less educated parents than their lower risk counterparts (table 4). More than half (58 percent) of high-risk students had parents who had completed no more than a high school education, compared with about one-quarter of low-risk students. "}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Outcome Measures", "text": "We analyzed three outcomes in this study: two enrollment outcomes and one indicator of postsecondary education persistence. All of the outcome measures are dichotomous, meaning that students either achieved the outcome or they did not. The two enrollment outcomes are 4-year college enrollment by 1994 versus all other behaviors (including enrollment in less-than-4year institutions), and enrollment in any postsecondary education (from short-term vocational programs to bachelor's degree programs) within the same time period versus no enrollment. Table 5 shows where students enrolled relative to their risk status. It is clear from this table o n that students at moderate or high risk were far less likely than those at low risk or no risk to enroll in a 4-year college and far less likely to enroll in any postsecondary education. For example, just 14 percent of high-risk students enrolled in a 4-year college, and nearly half did not enroll in any postsecondary education, compared with 45 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of their low-risk counterparts. Furthermore, as the level of risk increased, the likelihood of enrolling decreased. The table also shows that students with each individual risk factor were less likely to enroll in a 4-year college and, with one exception,3 were less likely to enroll in any postsecondary education than students without the risk factor. The third outcome was an indicator of persistence in postsecondary education, a measure that characterizes students according to postsecondary education enrollment patterns known to reduce their chances of attaining a degree (Carroll 1989, Tuma and Geis 1996, Berkner et al. 1996, and Horn 1996. These patterns include delaying postsecondary education by a year or more after high school graduation, beginning postsecondary education on a part-time basis, or not attending continuously from the time of initial enrollment (i.e., stopping for four or more months). If students exhibited none of these enrollment behaviors (they enrolled full time within a year after high school graduation and attended continuously), they were considered to have a better chance at persisting to degree completion. These students were identified as exhibiting strong postsecondary education persistence."}, {"section_title": "Engagement Indicators", "text": "The purpose of this study is to better understand the experiences of moderate-to high-risk youth who not only managed to graduate from high school, but who enrolled in higher education. Thus, we investigated the effect of engagement behaviors of students, their parents, and their peers on the likelihood of enrolling in postsecondary education.

A number of these variables are composites made up of several related items. For example, whether or not students got help in preparing for entrance exams is constructed from student responses to questions about taking a special course in high school or from a commercial test service, getting private tutoring, studying test booklets, or using special videotapes or test-related computer programs to prepare for exams. Whether or not students received help in the college application process was based on students' answers to questions about assistance from their high school in filling out college or financial aid applications, writing their application essay, or getting days off to visit colleges."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE OF AT-RISK STUDENTS", "text": "The sample for this study was drawn from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/94).

Application of these selection criteria resulted in samples ranging from about 1,700 to 2,900 students (depending upon which outcome was used)."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL METHODS", "text": "Because all the outcome measures in the study are dichotomous (0=No, 1=Yes), we used logistic regressions to determine the independent effect of the engagement variables on the outcomes. The results are presented in terms of odds ratios, a measure of the relative odds of achieving a particular outcome (such as enrolling in college) for students with a particular characteristic (such as those whose parents frequently discussed school-related matters with them) compared with a reference group (such as those whose parents had infrequent discussions). It should be noted that odds ratios are not the same as the ratio of percentages. For example, if the odds ratio of a student who participates in extracurricular activities is 2.0 for enrolling in college relative to students who participated in no extracurricular activities, the odds of the former group attending college are twice as high as the latter group. But they are not necessarily twice as likely to attend. While odds ratios and ratios of percentages are often similar, they may not be the same. In this report, reference to greater or lesser likelihood refers only to a change in odds. Two achievement measures were controlled for in all the models: (1) the cumulative score from a NELS 8th-grade battery of tests in mathematics, reading, science, and social science administered to the NELS cohort in grade 8; and (2) the highest level of high school mathematics courses taken by at-risk students as reported on their high school transcripts. The test score is a continuous variable, while the mathematics variable is categorical with eight possible levels ranging from no math to calculus. For more detailed information about variables included in the models, see the glossary in appendix A."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Many of the engagement variables measuring student involvement, parent involvement, parent expectations, and peer association had a significant effect on the enrollment outcome measures. These engagement variables, originally found to be important for reducing at-risk students' odds of dropping out of high school, were also important for increasing the odds of at-risk high school graduates advancing from high school graduation to postsecondary enrollment. To begin the analysis, the effect of each engagement variable on the three outcome measures was determined separately after controlling for the six risk factors and two measures of students' achievement. The results for the individual variables are shown in table 6. Asterisks indicate statistical significance, meaning those behaviors or characteristics with one or two asterisks had a significant effect on the outcome measure. To interpret the results, consider the first odds ratio with asterisks that appears in table 6, column 1. It is the odds ratio for participating in two or more extracurricular activities (2.09). This number means that among moderate-to high-risk students, the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college for students who participated in two or more extracurricular activities were 2.09 times higher than those who participated in no extracurricular activities. This was true even when controlling for the six risk factors and two student achievement measures. Students who participated in only one extracurricular activity, however, did not have significantly higher odds in enrolling in a 4-year college than their counterparts who participated in no activities (i.e., the result was not statistically significant). Similar results were found for the odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education versus not enrolling: two or more extracurricular activities increased the odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education by about 59 percent over not participating in any activities (odds ratio=1.59). The other student engagement indicator (attendance patterns) did not have a significant effect on enrollment outcomes, but did have an effect on whether students exhibited strong persistence patterns once enrolled in postsecondary education. Those who reported either moderate or high secondary school attendance levels were more likely to show indications of strong persistence in postsecondary education than those who reported low levels of high school attendance. The odds ratios were 1.62 and 1.74, respectively. RESULTS Table 6.-Logistic regression for the probability of moderate-to high-risk students: (1) attending a 4-year college versus all others, (2) enrolling in any postsecondary education versus none, and  Table 6.Logistic regression for the probability of moderate-to high-risk students: (1) attending a 4-year college versus all others, (2) enrolling in any postsecondary education versus none, and (3) exhibiting strong postsecondary persistence indicators versus all others'Continued Indicators of parent involvement had some of the strongest effects on increasing the odds of enrolling in postsecondary education. Certainly as a predictor for enrolling in any type of postsecondary education, parents' educational expectations for their children greatly increased the odds of attending. Students whose parents had expectations of even \"some college\" had nearly three times greater odds of attending some form of postsecondary education (odds ratio=2.99) than those whose parents had expectations for no more than high school graduation. Unlike enrollment in any postsecondary education, however, parents' educational expectations did not have a significant effect on the odds of attending a 4-year college once the six risk factors and RESULTS achievement levels were held constant.4 One explanation for this result might be that most highachieving students enroll in a 4-year college, and nearly all their parents expect them to attain at least a bachelor's degree. Therefore, there is little variation for levels of parental expectations relative to college enrollment. The results taken together may also mean that parents have a strong influence in getting their children into some form of postsecondary education, as evidenced by the significant effect for enrollment in any postsecondary education, but they have minimal influence on the level of postsecondary education in which their children enroll. Students whose parents frequently discussed school-related matters with them had more than double the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college (odds ratio=2.17) than students whose parents had little to no discussion with them. Parent discussionseven some discussionalso had a strong effect on increasing the odds of a student attending any postsecondary education (odds ratios 1.57 and 2.45, respectively, for some and much discussion). Students who reported that their peers were strongly involved in school also had higher odds of enrolling in a 4-year college, as well as attending any postsecondary education, compared to those whose peers were less involved. For example, students who reported that their friends considered learning activities highly important had about 70 percent higher odds of enrolling in a 4-year college (odds ratio=1.71) and almost two and a half times the odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education (odds ratio=2.4) than students whose friends considered such activities unimportant. Not surprisingly, students who reported that most or all of their friends intended to enroll in a 4-year college were highly likely do so themselves. In fact, friends' plans for college was the strongest predictor for 4-year college enrollment; students had six times higher odds of attending if most or all of their friends had similar plans (odds ratio=6.01). Likewise, compared with students with no friends planning to attend a 4-year college, if most or all of their friends had college plans, students had nearly three times higher odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education (odds ratio=2.8). Finally, nearly all of the special college preparation activities increased the odds of moderate-to high-risk students attending a 4-year college, as well as attending any postsecondary education. Some were also important for increasing students' chances of exhibiting strong persistence indicators. For example, talking to at least two people about financial aid, getting help preparing for entrance exams, and getting help in the college application process were associated with strong persistence indicators. Participating in a high school outreach program, how-RESULTS ever, appeared to affect only 4-year college enrollment (odds ratio=2.88), but not enrollment in any postsecondary education, nor predicting strong persistence indicators. In summary, once the six risk factors and two achievement measures were held constant, when the engagement variables were analyzed individually, most increased the odds of moderateto high-risk students enrolling in a 4-year college and in any postsecondary education. The results were especially strong and consistent for parent involvement measures and peer plans for college. Whether or not students exhibited strong indicators of postsecondary education persistence, on the other hand, was affected only by levels of high school attendance and some of the special college preparation activities.\nOdds ratio for at-risk students attending 4-year college vs. other' Predicted variable2 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Parent engagement with student's learning  Table 7.Four-step logistic regression for probability of moderate-to high-risk students attending a 4-year college versus all others predicted by parent engagement, student engagement, friends' engagement with learning, and college preparation activities (11=2,878)'Continued\nOdds for Attending Some Postsecondary Education Versus None Table 8 displays the odds ratios for moderate-to high-risk students attending any form of postsecondary education versus those who never enrolled. The variables importance for predicting enrollment in any postsecondary education were slightly different from those for 4-year college enrollment. Controlling for all other engagement variables, both parent engagement variableseducational expectations and school-related discussionswere very strong predictors of enrollment. Likewise, both peer involvement variables had a significant effect on increasing the odds of enrolling in any postsecondary education. Among the college preparation activities, unlike 4-year college enrollment, obtaining financial aid information and talking to people about aid remained significant predictors of enrollment, but participating in high school outreach programs, preparing for entrance exams, and getting help with the application process did not. Table 9 displays the results for whether or not students exhibited strong persistence indicators once they enrolled in postsecondary education. It is clear that once all the student, parent, and peer engagement variables were introduced in the model, none had a net independent effect on persistence indicators. Only the college preparation activity of obtaining help with the application process had an independent effect on increasing the odds of strong persistence. Thus, it appears that although the student, parent, and peer engagement variables examined in this analysis were important for predicting postsecondary and college enrollment, they had minimal effect on increasing the odds of strong persistence in postsecondary education among moderate-to high-risk students.

For example, students whose parents have high educational expectations for them are probably more engaged in school, which in turn increases their chances of postsecondary enrollment. In order to take such associations into account, we expanded the logistic regression models to control for all the engagement variables in addition to controlling for the six risk factors and student achievement. Moreover, we entered the sets of engagement variables hierarchically, beginning with parent engagement (step 1), then student engagement (step 2), then peer association (step 3). Finally, the full model also included the set of college preparation activities (step 4). This procedure allows for the examination of how the effects of one particular engagement variable changes as other engagement variables are introduced into the model. The results for the three outcome measures are presented in tables 7-9. Odds for Attending a 4-Year College Versus Others Table 7 displays the odds ratios for moderate-to high-risk students attending a 4-year college versus those who attended less-than-4-year institutions or who did not enroll in any postsecondary education, as predicted by the engagement variables and college preparation activities. As shown in the \"step 4\" column, even when all other engagement variables are held constant, the positive effect of parents having frequent school-related conversations with their teen remained an important factor for increasing the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college.

In fact, holding all other engagement variables and college preparation variables constant, compared with students who reported that none of their friends had plans for a 4year college, if most or all of their friends had college plans, the odds of moderate-to high-risk students attending were four times higher.5 College preparation activities also remained important in predicting 4-year college enrollment in the full model, especially if students participated in high school outreach programs. After all engagement variables were controlled for, students who reported participating in an outreach program had nearly twice the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college as those who did not. Similarly, getting help with college applications and preparing for entrance exams also remained important predictors of enrollment. 5The significant effect for students who had missing data for peer involvement probably indicates that these students likely had many peers with college plans but there is no way of determining this.\nOdds ratio for at-risk students attending some PSE vs. none 3 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step  : 550.63, 561.36, 621.06, and 750.18.

"}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether student, parent, and peer engagement factors that contributed to at-risk students' success in graduating from high school continued to be important in making the transition from high school to postsecondary education. The answer in large part, is yes for the parent and peer engagement variables, but less conclusive for the student engagement variables. The effect of the engagement variables also differed depending on the outcome. Confirming the importance of parent involvement, both parent engagement measures in this analysisthe frequency of school-related discussions and parents' expectations for their teen's educational attainmentsubstantially increased the odds of moderate-to high-risk students enrolling in some form of postsecondary education. This effect persisted even after controlling for student achievement and taking into account peer and student engagement, as well as college preparation activities. Students' odds of enrolling were increased about two-fold even among those whose parents reported having only \"some school-related discussions\" (versus none) and among those whose parents reported relatively modest educational expectations for their child (e.g., \"some college\" short of a bachelor's degree). The two measures of parent involvement had less of an impact on increasing the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college. Only students whose parents reported frequently discussing schoolrelated matters with their teen exhibited significantly higher odds of enrolling, compared with students who had no such discussions. And unlike enrollment in any postsecondary education, parents' educational expectations did not appear to significantly increase the odds of moderateto high-risk students enrolling in a 4-year college.6 Interpreting the results from both outcomes, the findings suggest that parents play a very influential role in getting their moderate-to high-risk teens to enroll in postsecondary education, but have less influence on whether they enroll in a 4year college or sub-baccalaureate institution. 6This result may be due in part to the fact that parents expectations for their children are generally high, especially for those who are academically prepared to enroll in college (Horn 1997). Therefore, once students' achievement level is controlled for, there is little variation in parents' expectations. Consistent with the considerable research demonstrating peer group effects on educational outcomes (for a review see Hanushek, 1986), there was also evidence of this phenomenon in this study. In fact, the variable that most increased the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college was the number of friends with college plans. Compared to students who reported having no friends with college plans, the odds of enrolling were four times higher for those reporting that most or all of their high school friends planned to enroll in a 4-year college. Having friends with college plans also doubled the odds of students enrolling in any postsecondary education over not enrolling at all. The latter result may indicate that moderate-to high-risk students who are not yet prepared to enroll in a 4-year college, may be more likely than not to enroll some form of postsecondary education when most of their friends have college plans. The importance that friends attributed to learning activities such as studying and getting good grades also increased the odds of enrolling in some form of postsecondary education, but did not significantly affect the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college. Thus, like the result for the parent involvement measures, associating with friends who are highly involved in learning activities is important for enrolling in some form of postsecondary education, but is less predictive of the level at which students enroll. Unlike the strong effects of parent and peer engagement measures, net of the other engagement variables, the student engagement measures (level of secondary school attendance and extracurricular activities) had minimal effect on the enrollment outcomes. One explanation for the lack of effect for student attendance levels may have to do with the correlation between attendance behavior and achievement. Higher achieving students are more likely to report higher levels of attendance. Thus, once achievement is controlled for, there is little variation for attendance. With respect to extracurricular activities, students who participated in two or more activities did have higher odds of enrolling in a 4-year college prior to introducing the peer engagement variables into the model (see table 7). Once the peer engagement variables were introduced, the effect of extracurricular activities involvement was no longer significant. Since participation in extracurricular activities is required or at the very least, encouraged by many 4-year colleges, the number of friends with college plans would be correlated with the likelihood of participating in extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is not particularly surprising to see that once this peer variable is introduced into the model, the effect of extracurricular activity involvement is minimized. Unlike the effects on postsecondary enrollment, none of the engagement variables had a net effect on students' postsecondary persistence once enrolled. That is, for moderate-to high-risk SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS students who enrolled in postsecondary education, none of the student, parent, or peer engagement variables included in the full model increased their odds of enrolling immediately after high school graduation and attending full-time continuously from the time of enrollment. However, the indicator of persistence is based on a 2-year time period and is therefore limited in what it measures. It may also be the case that the factors contributing to persistence in higher education are those associated with students' college experiences rather than measures of high school engagement. This study also demonstrated that, net of student, parent, and peer involvement measures, receiving assistance from teachers or other school staff in the college application process increased the odds of enrollment. For example, students who reported getting help in filling out their college application or preparing for entrance exams had higher odds of enrolling in a 4-year college than students who reported receiving no assistance. These activities tend to be more specific for enrolling in a 4-year college and therefore, only affected this outcome. On the other hand, when students reported obtaining financial aid information from two or more resources, or talked to one or more persons about financial aid, the odds of their enrolling in some postsecondary education also went up. With these data, however, it is not really possible to determine whether receiving assistance in the application process increased moderate-to high-risk students' chances of enrolling or whether those who made the decision to enroll sought out help in the process. Nevertheless, it is still worth noting the positive effect since this type of intervention on the part of the school is not particularly costly nor difficult to implement. School assistance is particularly important for at-risk students whose parents have no more than a high school education. When it comes to navigating their way through the application process, these students have less family guidance and experience to rely on relative to their peers with college-educated parents. Finally, it should be noted that moderate-to high-risk students who participated in high school outreach programs had almost double the odds of enrolling in a 4-year college than their peers who did not participate. Even though relatively few at-risk students reported such participation (about 5 percent), the effect on college enrollment was significant. This finding confirms similar results reported for the High School and Beyond sophomore cohort of 1980 10th-graders (Adelman 1997). It is also consistent with the positive effect of receiving assistance in the college application process. In the end, this study showed that intervention, whether on the part of the parents or the school, played a positive role in helping moderate-to high-risk students make the transition from high school to college."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX A GLOSSARY", "text": "This glossary describes the variables used in this report.
