Suppression of pest species via a native predator is a regulating ecosystem service that has the potential to limit crop damage and produce economic benefits.\nAmerican kestrels Falco sparverius are widespread, highly mobile, generalist predators that hunt in human-dominated habitats and have the potential to provide previously undocumented ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.\n2. We hypothesized that kestrel activity associated with nest boxes and artificial perches acts to increase perceived predation risk that, in combination with direct predation, can reduce fruit-eating bird abundances in orchards. We used counts and observations of fruit-eating birds from fixed-width transect surveys to investigate variation in bird abundances and to estimate sweet cherry loss in cherry orchards with and without active kestrel boxes. We also conducted a benefit-cost analysis of nest box installation and used regional economic modelling to estimate macroeconomic impacts of increased sweet cherry production in Michigan, an important US fruit production region.\n3. Fruit-eating bird counts were significantly lower at orchards with active kestrel boxes. Although kestrels used the perches in young orchard blocks and may benefit from them, the presence of perches did not have a significant effect on bird counts.\n4. Benefit-cost ratios for kestrel nest boxes indicated that for every dollar spent on nest boxes, $84 to $357 of sweet cherries would be saved from fruit-eating birds.\nRegional economic modelling predicted that increased sweet cherry production from reduced bird damage would result in 46-50 jobs created and $2.2 million to $2.4 million in increased income for the state of Michigan over a 5-year period.\nKestrel nest boxes in sweet cherry orchards provide a highly cost-effective ecosystem service with potential reverberating benefits for a regional economy. Box occupancy rates will undoubtedly vary across landscapes and regions. However, costs to install and maintain boxes are small and, even if box occupancy rates are low, boxes can direct kestrel activity to particular places in agricultural landscapes where they can deter pest birds. Thus, the potential benefits for fruit crops greatly outweigh the costs of this pest management strategy.\nThis document is a U.S. government work and is not subject to copyright in the United States.\nSHAVE Et Al.\nIn response to the agricultural expansion and intensification that threatens biodiversity world-wide ( Cresswell, 2008) . Our first hypothesis was that active nest boxes are sites of high kestrel activity that act to increase perceived predation risk for fruit-eating birds.

Thus, we predicted that fruit-eating bird abundances would be lower in orchards with active nest boxes and perches compared to orchards without.\nOur second objective was to quantify the potential economic benefits that result from kestrel effects on the presence on fruiteating birds.

Enhancing the regulating ecosystem services provided by native predators is an appealing management strategy that has the potential to limit crop damage by promoting natural predator-prey relationships in agroecosystems. Avian predators can be particularly effective predators of pest insects (Maas et al., 2015) , rodents (Labuschagne, Swanepoel, Taylor, Belmain, & Keith, 2016) and other birds (e.g. Kross, Tylianakis, & Nelson, 2012) .\nFurthermore, conservation and agricultural goals come together with conservation biological control (CBC), which employs modifications of the environment to protect or enhance native predator populations to reduce the impact of pests (Eilenberg, Hajek, & Lomer, 2001 ). An easily-implemented CBC practice is the installation of artificial nesting and roosting cavities for nest site-limited predators. Nest boxes that attract avian predators can result in increased predation of pest insects (e.g. Jedlicka, Greenberg, & Letourneau, 2011) and rodents (Labuschagne et al., 2016) . In addition, installing artificial perches can enhance hunting habitat for avian predators, particularly raptors (Wid\u00e9n, 1994) , and previous studies have demonstrated negative effects of perches on rodent abundances (Kay, Twigg, Korn, & Nicol, 1994) . However, previous work has not assessed cost-effectiveness of nest boxes (Wenny et al., 2011) or examined effects of nest boxes and artificial perches for predatory birds on abundances of prey birds, which are significant pests in fruit crops . In addition, few studies have examined economic benefits in relation to job creation from species providing ecosystem services (e.g. Butler, Radford, Riddington, & Laughton, 2009 ); none have focused on regional job creation as a function of regulating services provided by native predators.\nThe first objective of our study was to determine whether installation of nest boxes and perches for American kestrels (Falco sparverius; hereafter \"kestrel\"), a declining raptor species (Smallwood et al., 2009) , leads to reduced fruit-eating bird abundances in orchards. Kestrels are widespread, highly mobile, generalist predators that hunt in open habitats, including humandominated landscapes (Smallwood & Bird, 2002) , thus they are potentially important for sustainable biological control at local and landscape scales (Tscharntke et al., 2007) . Kestrels using orchard nest boxes in the fruit-growing region of northwestern Michigan consume insects, mammals and fruit-eating birds (M. Shave, PhD dissertation). Although birds comprise only about 2% of prey delivered to kestrel offspring during the breeding season (M. Shave, PhD dissertation), kestrels may reduce fruit-eating bird abundances in orchards through a combination of lethal and nonlethal effects of predation (Cresswell, 2008; Kross et al., 2012) . Nonlethal effects include antipredator behaviours of prey birds, such as avoiding areas of high predation risk (Cresswell, 2008) . Our first hypothesis was that active nest boxes are sites of high kestrel activity that act to increase perceived predation risk for fruit-eating birds. We also hypothesized that a lack of suitable perches limits orchard use by kestrels, so artificial perches would increase kestrel presence in the orchards. Thus, we predicted that fruit-eating bird abundances would be lower in orchards with active nest boxes and perches compared to orchards without.\nOur second objective was to quantify the potential economic benefits that result from kestrel effects on the presence on fruiteating birds. We focused our economic analyses on sweet cherries (Prunus avium), given their higher sugar content (Serrano, Guill\u00e9n, Mart\u00ednez-Romero, Castillo, & Valero, 2005) and expected greater risk of bird damage compared to tart cherries (Prunus cerasus ; Lindell et al., 2016) . We predicted that kestrel nest boxes have a very low cost of implementation compared to the benefit of decreased sweet cherry loss due to reduced fruit-eating bird abundances.\nFurthermore, we employed regional economic analysis to translate the costs and benefits of kestrel nest boxes into county-and state-level metrics that are important to the general public, such as changes in income (gross domestic product) and employment (Shwiff, Anderson, Cullen, White, & Shwiff, 2013) . Estimates of these regional impacts can reveal how potential reduction of crop damage through enhancement of regulating ecosystem services can affect people in the community not directly involved in agriculture or wildlife conservation."}, {"section_title": "| Fruit-eating bird abundances", "text": "We conducted fruit-eating bird surveys along 200-m-long fixedwidth transects within cherry orchard blocks in 2015 and 2016 (Kross et al., 2012) . We chose a fixed width of six orchard rows (32 m) to minimize variation in bird detectability between transects.\nEach survey lasted 10 min, with 20 m of the transect length travelled each min. We conducted all surveys between 06:30 and 8:30\nEST on days without precipitation or fog to minimize variation in bird detectability due to time of day or weather. We conducted at least six surveys per transect between early June and mid-July.

A list of bird species observed during surveys but excluded from analysis based on these criteria are listed in Appendix S2.\nIn 2015, we conducted surveys at 27 transects in 15 cherry orchards: five orchards with an active kestrel box, five orchards with an active kestrel box and perches and five orchards with no active box within 1.6 km (Figure 1 ). At orchards with active boxes, we placed transects within 150 m of the box. At orchards with boxes and perches, we placed transects within 100 m of a perch and 150 m of the boxes. In orchards comprising both sweet and tart cherry blocks, we placed one transect in a block of each crop type; in large orchards comprising blocks of one crop type only, we placed one transect at the orchard edge and one in the interior (at least six rows in from the edge). We placed the two transects in each orchard at least 150 m apart to reduce the chance of observing the same individuals at both transects during a survey. In 2016, we surveyed 14 transects within sweet cherry blocks in 14 orchards: three orchards with an active box, four orchards with an active box and perches, and seven orchards with no active box within 1.6 km ( Figure 1 ). We focused on sweet cherry blocks in 2016 because the 2015 results and our previous work (Lindell et al., 2012) suggested a substantial preference by birds for sweet cherries, and we wanted to insure sufficient sample sizes for robust economic analyses. Orchard block areas ranged from 1.2 to 38.2 ha, with a mean of 6.3 \u00b1 1.4 (SE) ha.\nWe conducted a total of 268 surveys over both years. In 2016, the kestrel nests failed at two orchards with active kestrel nest boxes; the surveys from transects at these orchards were dropped from analyses because they no longer matched the distance criterion for the active nest box treatment (active nest within 150 m). Also, we discovered a kestrel nest in an abandoned house near an orchard; the surveys from the transect at this orchard were dropped from analyses because they no longer matched the criteria for the no active nest box treatment (no active nest within 1.6 km). Finally, we lost access to two orchards after three surveys each; we kept these surveys in the analyses.\nWe identified 13 fruit-eating species during surveys (Figure 3) .\nWe saw or heard a kestrel during or prior to 64 surveys (35%) at transects in orchards with active kestrel nests; we did not detect any kestrels during or prior to surveys at transects in orchards without active kestrel nests.\nThe best-fitting model for total fruit-eating bird abundance (\u03b2 intercept = 1.50 \u00b1 0.27 SE) included the random effect of orchard ID (see Appendix S4) and the fixed effects of box, crop, year and a quadratic effect of harvest (Table 1) .

Lang, pers. comm.) . We calculated the value of the additional cherries using a 5-year price average (USDA Economic Research Service, 2016) and then multiplied by the number of bearing-age hectares of sweet cherries in Michigan and Leelanau, Antrim, and Grand Traverse Counties (USDA Census of Agriculture, 2012) to provide the total values of cherries saved, if kestrel boxes were installed across all sweet cherry hectarage and experienced a 90% occupancy rate by kestrels (Shave & Lindell, 2017a) ."}, {"section_title": "| Costs of kestrel nest boxes", "text": "Costs for each nest box included a pre-made box as well as lumber and hardware for the tower and installation.

We determined the number of nest boxes needed to cover all sweet cherry hectarage based on kestrel territory size.\nThe average kestrel territory ranges from 500 m to 1 km in diameter, or 19.6-78.5 ha (Bird & Palmer, 1988; Rohrbaugh & Yahner, 1997) .\nWe assumed installation of enough nest boxes to cover the bearingage hectares in the first year; we included only cleaning costs in subsequent years. We calculated costs and benefits for a total of 5 years."}, {"section_title": "| Benefit-cost analysis", "text": "We measured the value of kestrel nest boxes as an enhancement of crop pest reduction via net benefits and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs; Boardman, Greenberg, Vining, & Weimer, 2005) . Net benefits are simply the difference between the total benefits and total costs. We calculated BCRs by dividing the total benefits by the total costs. A BCR of greater than one indicates an efficient use of resources because the benefits outweigh the costs. We applied a discount rate, based on the real interest rate, of 1% to both benefits and costs; a discount rate accounts for people generally placing a higher value on resources in the present that in the future. We performed a sensitivity analysis using the ranges of cherry weights and kestrel territory sizes, through which we obtained a low and high estimate for net benefits and BCRs. Macroeconomic changes arising from increased cherry production due to reduced bird damage were analysed using REMI PI+ software (Regional Economic Models, Inc.). We input into the REMI model the additional tons of sweet cherries expected to be produced in each of the three counties if nest boxes were installed across all sweet cherry hectarage; we estimated the additional tons based on our field data (see Section 3.2.1 and Section 2.4.2 above). REMI is a computer-based simulation model of the US economy that allows modelling at both the national and subnational scales. This structural economic forecasting model uses a nonsurvey based input-output table, which models the linkages among industries and households of a regional economy (Shwiff et al., 2013; Figure 2) . Using the REMI model, we can generate forecasts that detail behavioural responses to changes in price, production and other economic factors (Treyz, Rickman, & Shao, 1991) . In other words, REMI can model the impact that changes in the agricultural sector might have on other sectors of the economy and predict changes in employment and income in those sectors. For example, an increase in cherry production may result in increased spending at local restaurants and retail shops, which F I G U R E 2 Linkages among industries and households of the regional economy included in the REMI model to predict macroeconomic impacts of decreased sweet cherry damage in Michigan in turn generates jobs at those businesses. This increased income among workers then translates into further spending. Capturing these ripple effects, or multiplier effects, is vital to understanding the total impact a change in one sector has on the entire regional economy (Miller & Blair, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "| Macroeconomic impacts", "text": "\nRegional economic modelling predicted that increased production of cherries from reduced bird damage from kestrel activity at nest boxes would result in 46-50 jobs created and $2.2 million to $2.4 million in increased income for the state of Michigan over a 5-year period (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "| RE SULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Benefit-cost analysis for kestrel nest boxes", "text": "Net benefits from installing kestrel next boxes across all sweet cherry hectarage in Michigan were the value of cherries saved "}, {"section_title": "| D ISCUSS I ON", "text": "As predicted, fruit-eating bird abundances were significantly lower at transects in orchards with active nest boxes compared to transects in orchards without. The reduction was greatest in sweet cherry blocks, which had significantly higher bird counts than transects in tart cherry blocks, but tart blocks also showed significantly decreased counts between transects in orchards with and without kestrel boxes. These results, combined with our detections of kestrels only at transects with active nests, support the idea that active kestrel nest boxes act to increase perceived predation risk that, in combination with kestrel consumption of prey birds, reduce fruiteating bird abundances in orchards.\nAlthough kestrels used the perches installed in cherry orchards (see Appendix S1), fruit-eating bird abundances were not significantly lower at transects with perches and active nest boxes compared to those with active nest boxes only. The lack of a perch effect coincides with our finding that kestrel use of the perches was significantly greater in orchard blocks with shorter trees (see Appendix S1).\nKestrels mostly used the perches in the youngest blocks; meanwhile, we conducted the fruit-eating bird surveys in mature blocks where kestrels rarely used the perches. Although the artificial perches were still taller than the trees in mature blocks, the mature trees form a denser canopy cover that limits visibility of the ground, which could reduce the quality of mature orchards as hunting habitat for kestrels compared to young orchards. This conclusion is supported by studies of kestrel habitat use on the wintering grounds, which have found that kestrels are more positively associated with more open land cover types compared to orchards (Pandolfino, Herzog, & Smith, 2011) .\nPrevious work argues that the mere presence of predators can elicit strong antipredator behaviour in birds (Cresswell, 2008) . In our study region, the presence of active kestrel boxes as cues of predation risk should be reinforced by actual predation events. Birds made up a regular, if low, proportion of the prey items delivered by adult kestrels to nestlings in the study region; American robins, European starlings and blue jays were all documented as prey items of kestrels either through video recordings at boxes or through the discovery of remains in boxes at the end of the season (M. Shave, PhD dissertation). These predation events should reduce the likelihood of habituation of fruit-eating birds to kestrel presence in orchards over time.\nAlthough previous studies have estimated yield gains (e.g. Gras et al., 2016) and/or economic benefits to farmers of vertebrate predation of crop-damaging pests (e.g. Karp et al., 2013) , ours is the first study to estimate potential job creation from this ecosystem service.\nAssuming statewide nest box installation, and similar patterns of nest site limitation and high box occupancy rates (90%) as those observed in our study region, the increased fruit production would be substantial enough to result in a roughly $2.3 million increase in the "}, {"section_title": "| CON CLUS IONS", "text": "Our bird survey results, combined with the high kestrel reproductive rates observed for boxes in the study region (Shave & Lindell, 2017a regulating ecosystem services while also sustaining or increasing the local kestrel breeding population (Shave & Lindell, 2017b) . Kestrel presence was particularly valuable in deterring fruit-eating birds in sweet cherry orchards and also significantly reduced fruit-eating bird abundance in tart cherries. Perch presence did not significantly influence fruit-eating bird abundance; however, perches were used as a safe spot by kestrel fledglings and so may enhance fledgling survivorship (see Appendix S1). We conclude that kestrel nest boxes in orchards are an easily-implemented and valuable addition to IPM practices in fruit crops. Finally, our study demonstrates how adopting a CBC IPM strategy in agriculture can provide economic benefits for people beyond those directly involved in agriculture or wildlife conservation.\nAs expected with any IPM strategy, kestrel nest boxes did not eliminate pest birds from the orchards. In addition, some local kestrel populations are not limited by availability of nest sites (McClure, Pauli, & Heath, 2017) . For this and other reasons, box occupancy rates will undoubtedly vary across landscapes and regions (Smallwood et al., 2009 ). However, costs to install and maintain boxes are small and, even if box occupancy rates are low, boxes can direct kestrel activity to particular places in agricultural landscapes (Shave & Lindell, 2017b) where they can reduce pest bird activity.\nThus, the potential benefits in fruit crops greatly outweigh the costs of this pest management strategy."}, {"section_title": "ACK N OWLED G EM ENTS", "text": "We thank L.

Based on these percentages, birds were in the orchards from 11 am to 4 pm about 0.56 times as often as in the other two time periods.\nWe used observations of frugivorous birds foraging in sweet cherry orchards (see manuscript for details) to calculate the mean number of cherries eaten min -1 by fruit-eating birds.\nWe estimated the mean number of fruit-eating birds present in a sweet cherry orchard min Appendix S4.
