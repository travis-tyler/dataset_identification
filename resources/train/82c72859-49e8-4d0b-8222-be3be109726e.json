Introduction", "text": "This report summarizes the latest available national statistics on access and attainment by lowincome and minority community college students. The data come from the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) annual surveys of all postsecondary educational institutions and the NCES Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study 1996-2001 (BPS:96/01). The latter follows for six years a nationally representative sample of all first-time beginning college students from the 1995-96 school year, with follow-up surveys in 1998 and 2001. The IPEDS data reported in Section B provide longitudinal trend statistics of actual enrollments and degrees awarded by institution type and student characteristics for selected years between 1992 and 2002. From this we learn about the overall enrollment rates of minorities and the total number of different types of credentials earned (certificate, associate degree, bachelor's degree) by race/ethnicity. We compare the rates across institution types to assess the relative achievement of students at community colleges. We also estimate the rate of degree attainment relative to the rate of enrollment by race/ethnicity at different types of institutions. While IPEDS contains substantial information on the characteristics of students at U.S. colleges and universities, it does not include data on income. IPEDS does collect information on the amount of student financial aid received by students at each institution, but one cannot infer from that information about the income levels of students since those who receive financial aid are not necessarily low-income and, significantly, low-income students do not necessarily receive financial aid. Because of the difficulties involved in collecting reliable information on student income, many colleges do not collect this information. This presents a challenge to efforts to improve access and attainment for low-income students, since it makes it difficult to measure the enrollment and outcomes by such students. Not only does IPEDS not include data on student income, it also does not indicate the type of programs in which students are enrolled. For national data on patterns of enrollment by student income and program type we need to look at survey datasets such as BPS:96/01. Sections C and D draw on data from BPS:96/01 to describe enrollment patterns and completion rates, respectively, by minority and low-income student characteristics. Since BPS:96/01 is a survey of a sample of students who started in higher education during the 1995-96 school year it gives us insight into a specific cohort of entering students. We present enrollment information for this cohort, which represents a crosssection of all first-time students at community colleges and other types of institutions. They range from students just out of high school to those who may be beginning postsecondary education after having a first career lasting many years. This survey gives us valuable insights into the outcomes of these students. In contrast to IPEDS, BPS:96/01 provides us with achievement rates (degree and certificate attainment and transfer to baccalaureate institutions) for different types of students after six years since beginning their postsecondary enrollment and across all institutions in which they enrolled during that time period. These findings should be compared to those in the companion report, Community college low-income and minority student completion study: descriptive statistics from the 1992 high school cohort, which provides enrollment and eight-year completion rates for the younger cohort of students who were scheduled to graduate high school in 1992. At the beginning of each lettered section of this report is a summary that highlights the important findings from all the tables and figures in that section. The final report summary is a compilation of those section summaries. The tables and charts in the main body of the report are derived from the detailed data tables found in the Appendix. Throughout the report we use the term community colleges to refer to two-year public institutions. Key to institution type abbreviations: 4yr = four-year 2yr = two-year <2yr = less than two-year pub = public p-nfp = private not-for-profit p-fp = private for-profit"}, {"section_title": "B. Trends in Undergraduate Enrollment and Degrees Awarded by Race/Ethnicity", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Minority student undergraduate enrollments grew in absolute numbers and as a proportion of total enrollment between 1992 and 2002, while those for white students declined during the same period. Community colleges, with 42 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in fall 2002, have by far the highest proportion of undergraduate students of any institution type. They enroll more than half of all Hispanic students in undergraduate higher education and also enroll a disproportionate number of African-American undergraduates. The absolute numbers of associate and bachelor's degrees awarded to African-Africans and Hispanics grew substantially between 1992 and 2002, at rates far above the average for all race/ethnicities. The number of certificates awarded to Hispanics also grew during this period despite a drop in the total number of certificates awarded to all students. Nonetheless, both African-Americans and Hispanics remained underrepresented in higher education relative to their rates of high school graduates and underrepresented among those earning credentials relative to their rates of undergraduate enrollment in higher education in 2002. Specifically, African-Americans and Hispanics were underrepresented among associate degree earners at community colleges, although African-Americans did earn certificates from community colleges at higher rates than their enrollment. However, the latter finding may not be positive if a certificate is seen as a \"consolation\" award for students counseled out of associate degree or transfer programs. See Table A1a in Appendix for details.\nThis section reports enrollment rates by institution crossed with race/ethnicity, household income quartile, and parents' highest level of education. Enrollment rates are also broken out by initial degree program and initial major type, as well as participation in remedial courses. The BPS:96/01 data used here provide much more detailed breakdowns than do the IPEDS data. Note that BPS represents only first-time beginning postsecondary students. Although community colleges enrolled the largest proportion of all black and Hispanic postsecondary students of all institution types, the for-profit and less than two-year institutions have higher proportions of minority students within their student bodies. And compared to other types of institutions, community colleges draw students fairly evenly from all four household income quartiles, though their largest representation is among the middle two quartiles. The highest income quartile students are more likely to enroll in four-year public and private nonprofit institutions, while the lowest income quartile students are disproportionately represented in for-profit and less than two-year institutions. Although first-generation students are overrepresented in for-profit and less than two-year institutions, half of all such students enroll in community colleges as their first institution. They also represent half of all community college students. The conclusion of these findings on enrollment by race/ethnicity, household income, and parents' education is that community colleges do not draw disproportionately from any identifiable group, but draw strongly from all types of students. Community colleges represent the primary destination for students seeking associate degrees, enrolling 86 percent of all such students in the country. Similarly, the vast majority of community college students are enrolled in associate degree programs. However, minority students (particularly African-Americans), students from the lowest income quartile, and firstgeneration college students are all disproportionately represented in certificate programs in community colleges. Similarly, these same groups are more highly represented in occupational majors. Also, the majority of students at for-profit and less than two-year colleges are in occupational majors. Community college students have the highest rates of remedial course enrollment when compared to students in other types of institutions. About one quarter of all beginning community college students took remediation. The rate of remedial course-taking at community colleges is relatively even across categories by race/ethnicity, household income quartile, and parents' education. That is, there is little significant difference in the proportion of any particular identity group that enrolls in remediation. This is in sharp contrast to remedial enrollment at public four-year institutions, where minority students, those from the lower income quartiles, and those whose parents have less education take remediation at higher rates than others. The reason for this pattern at community colleges may be that higher proportions of minorities, low income and first-generation students enroll in certificate programs, which often have less rigid or no remedial requirements than associate degree and transfer programs, where white students, those with higher household incomes, and those whose parents have more education are more likely to enroll.\nThis section uses BPS:96/01 to analyze the six-year outcomes of first-time undergraduate students who entered postsecondary education in 1995-96. One half of all students who started at a community college completed some outcome (certificate, associate or bachelor's degree, or transfer to a baccalaureate institution) after six years. This is the lowest rate of completion among all two-year and four-year institution types. At 37 percent, black community college students had a lower six-year completion rate than either Hispanics (42 percent) or whites (52 percent). Black community college students had the highest rate of certificate completion (17 percent) and the lowest rate of bachelor's degree completion (2 percent). Furthermore, the rate of transfer to four-year institutions was lower for both blacks and Hispanics than for whites and the rate of bachelor's degree completion among students who transferred was also lower for these groups. Slightly less than one half (47 percent) of all students starting at community colleges from the lowest income quartile completed an outcome in six years. They had the lowest rates of transfer and bachelor's degree completion, though the highest rate of certificate completion among all income quartiles. Similarly, only 42 percent of first-generation students starting at community colleges had a successful outcome after six years. And they also exhibited the pattern of highest certificate completion rate and lowest transfer and bachelor's completion rate among their peers at community colleges. The outcome pattern by degree program for all two-and four-year institutions is that, the higher the degree program in which students initially enroll, the higher the success rate in attaining a successful outcome. For example, at community colleges, the completion rate for students starting in certificate programs is 41 percent, while that for associate degree program students is 51 percent. Black students who started in certificate programs in community colleges had higher six-year outcome rates than did similar Hispanic students, primarily due to the relatively high rate of black students' completing certificates. However, Hispanic students in community college associate programs complete at higher rates than do their black peers (although both transfer to four-year institutions at about the same rate). White students across both program types in community colleges complete at higher rates than either black or Hispanic students. Students in community college occupational majors generally complete at lower rates than their peers in academic majors or with no initial major declaration. The exception is Hispanic students in occupational majors, more than half of whom complete an outcome in six years (above the overall community college average). Taking remedial coursework reduces ones chance of graduation within six years, regardless of institution type. In particular, the rate of any completion among black and Hispanic students starting in community colleges who took remediation is extremely low (24 percent). This rate is less than half that for Hispanics at community colleges who took no remediation and significantly below that for blacks with no remediation (43 percent). In contrast, white students who took remediation still completed at rates over 50 percent and only slightly below the rate of their white peers who took no remediation. Note: See Table A17 in Appendix for details."}, {"section_title": "Key facts:", "text": "\u2022 Total undergraduate enrollment grew by 11 percent between 1992 and 2002. \u2022 Enrollment in undergraduate programs by African-Americans and Hispanics grew both in absolute terms and as a share of total enrollment during that period. Hispanic enrollment grew by over half (53 percent) during that period. Hispanic students represented 12 percent of undergraduates in 2002, up from 8 percent in 1992. The proportion of African-American undergraduates grew from 10 percent in 1992 to 12 percent in 2002. \u2022 From 1992 to 2002, the percentage of full-time students grew by 17 percent compared to a growth rate of only 2 percent for part-time students. In 2002, 62 percent of students were enrolled full-time. However, Hispanic students represent a higher proportion of part-time students (14 percent) than of full-time students (10 percent). See Table A1b in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 In 2002, community colleges enrolled the largest share (42 percent) of undergraduate students of any postsecondary institution type. \u2022 Community colleges enrolled over half (51 percent) of all Hispanic undergraduate students. Hispanic undergraduates were underrepresented in four-year public and private non-profit institutions. Public four-year institutions enrolled 35 percent of all undergraduate students, but only 25 percent of Hispanic undergraduates. \u2022 African-American undergraduates were somewhat overrepresented in community colleges and somewhat underrepresented in four-year public and private non-profit institutions. See Table A1b in Appendix for numbers from which calculated. Key facts: \u2022 In 2002, community colleges enrolled proportionally more Hispanic students than did four-year institutions. Only eight percent of students in four-year public institutions were Hispanic. \u2022 Two-year private for-profit and the less than two-year institutions had even higher percentages of Hispanic students than did community colleges. \u2022 Two-and four-year private for-profit institutions had the highest percentage of African-American students as a share of their total enrollments (20 percent and 15 percent, respectively). Key facts: \u2022 In 2002, community colleges enrolled by far the lowest proportion of full-time students of any institution type. \"Undiff\" refers to degree completers for whom race/ethnicity was not indicated.\n\u2022 The total number of certificates awarded declined by over 25 percent between 1992 and 2003. Even so, the number of certificates awarded to Hispanics increased by nearly 25 percent during that period. \u2022 The percentage increase in associate and bachelor's degrees awarded to African-Americans and Hispanics from 1992 to 2003 was much larger than that for all students. The increase in associate degrees awarded was 12 percent for all students, but 52 percent for African-Americans and 77 percent for Hispanics. The bachelor's degree increase was 10 percent for all students, 44 percent for African-Americans, and 64 percent for Hispanics. \u2022 In 2003, African-Americans represented percent of associate degree graduates and 9 percent of bachelor's degree graduates. The corresponding figures for Hispanics were 10 percent and 7 percent. Despite the growth in numbers of graduates from both groups, African-Americans and Hispanic graduates were still underrepresented in proportion to their representation in the college-age population overall. In 1999-2000, African-Americans represented 17 percent of public high school students while Hispanics comprised 16 percent (Young, 2002). Using data from the 19 states that report data on high school completions of all types (diplomas, GEDs and other), Mortenson (2002) estimated that 15 percent of high school completers in these states in 2000 were African-American and 11 percent were Hispanic.   Key facts: \u2022 In 2002-03, community colleges awarded more certificates than any other institution. More Hispanics received certificates from less than two-year for-profit institutions than from community colleges, however. \u2022 Community colleges awarded 72 percent of all associate degrees in 2002-03. Two-year for-profit colleges awarded only eight percent of associate degrees overall, but graduated 12 percent of the African Americans and 11 percent of the Hispanics who earned associate degrees in 2002-03. A ratio greater than one means that students of a given race/ethnicity are earning certificates from institutions of the given type in a proportion greater than their representation among students enrolled in those institutions. Calculated using row percents (not shown) from Table 5 above and Table A1b in Appendix. A ratio greater than one means that students of a given race/ethnicity are earning associate degrees from institutions of the given type in a proportion greater than their representation among students enrolled in those institutions. Calculated using row percents (not shown) from Table 6 above and Table A1b in Appendix. Key facts: \u2022 African Americans represented a far higher proportion of certificate-earners at community colleges than of community college enrollments. In contrast, Hispanic and Asian students were underrepresented among certificate-earners at community colleges. \u2022 African Americans, Hispanics and Asians were underrepresented among associate degree graduates from community colleges compared to their representation among students enrolled in these institutions.\n\u2022 In 1995-96, community colleges enrolled 47 percent of all beginning postsecondary male students but only 42 percent of such female students. Females are proportionally more concentrated in the less than two-year for-profit institutions, which enrolled 9 percent of the female students but only 5 percent of male students. \u2022 In 1995-96 among first-time college students, women outnumbered men in all undergraduate institutions types (including the less than two-year institutions) except four-year for-profit institutions, where men accounted for 65 percent of the students. \u2022 Women represented 71 percent of BPS students in less than two-year for-profit institutions.  Table A2 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among all undergraduate institutions (including less than two-year institutions), community colleges enrolled by far the largest proportion of black and Hispanic students Specifically, 43 percent of black and 43 percent Hispanic beginning students attended community colleges in 1995-96.   Table A3 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Eleven percent of community college BPS students were black and 12 percent were Hispanic. In comparison, 10 percent of BPS students in four-year public schools were black and 11 percent were Hispanic. \u2022 Two-and four-year for-profit colleges as well as the less than two-year institutions enrolled higher proportions of blacks and Hispanics than did community colleges. Over one-third (34 percent) of BPS students at four-year for-profit institutions were Hispanic, while over half of all students at such institutions were minority students. In general, minorities were over-represented in for-profit institutions.  Table A4 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 In 1995-96, among undergraduate institutions (including the less than two-year institutions), community colleges enrolled by far the largest number of BPS students from the lowest household income quartile (45 percent of such students). \u2022 In general, students from the lower income quartiles were disproportionately represented in for-profit institutions (including four-years). \u2022 In the four-year institutions other than the for-profits, students from higher income quartiles predominated.  Key facts: \u2022 In 1995-96, community colleges enrolled a higher proportion of beginning low-income students than did four-year public and private non-profit institutions. Over half (55 percent) of community college students are from the lowest two income quartiles compared to 38 percent of four-year public students. However, both two-and four-year for-profits enroll proportionally more low-income BPS students than do community colleges. The less than two-year institutions enroll even higher proportions of students from the lowest income households. Nearly sixty percent (59 percent) of BPS students in the less than two-year privates were from the poorest households. \u2022 There was a fairly even distribution of students by household income quartile at community colleges (with only the highest income quartile being slightly underrepresented). Less than 20 percent of BPS students at community colleges were from the highest household income quartile. For comparison, exactly one-fourth (25 percent) of community college BPS students came from households in the lowest income quartile. \u2022 In general, students from households in the highest income quartile are over-represented in four-year institutions (though not at for-profit institutions) and students from households in the lowest income quartile are over-represented in all for-profit institutions and the less than two-year institutions.  Table A6 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 In 1995-96, community colleges enrolled about half of all BPS students who were firstgeneration college students (those whose parents' highest level of education was high school or less). In comparison, four-year public colleges enrolled 20 percent of such students.   Table A7 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 In 1995-96, community colleges enrolled a much higher proportion of first-generation students (50 percent) than did four-year public and private, non-profit institutions (33 percent and 27 percent respectively). However, two-and four-year for-profits enrolled proportionally more first-generation students than did community colleges (61 percent and 60 percent respectively). The less than two-year institutions enroll even higher proportions of first-generation BPS students. For example, 75 percent of BPS students enrolled in private, less than two-year for-profit institutions were first-generation college students. \u2022 A little more than a quarter (27 percent) of community college BPS students had parents with a bachelor's degree or higher. This compares with 51 percent of BPS students in four-year public institutions and 59 percent of students in four-year private non-profit institutions. In general, students whose parents had at least some college were overrepresented in community colleges and first-generation college students were overrepresented in all for-profit institutions and all two-year (including community colleges) and less than two-year institutions. Key facts:\n\u2022 In 1995-96, 40 percent of beginning postsecondary students at community colleges chose an occupational major, while 31 percent chose an academic major. Twenty-nine percent did not indicate a major. The comparable figures for BPS students at four-year public institutions were 33 percent occupational, 40 percent academic and 27 percent none or undeclared. Not surprisingly, most BPS students at for-profit and less than two-year schools indicated an occupational major, reflecting the focus of these institutions on career education. Also, very few students at these colleges did not indicate a major, reflecting the narrower range of options at such institutions, many of which require students to declare their major from the start. \u2022 African-American community college BPS students were much more likely than whites or Hispanics to indicate an occupational major rather than an academic one (and less likely not to indicate a major). In contrast, African-American students at four-year public institutions were more likely to either indicate an academic major or none at all. Hispanic community college BPS students were somewhat more likely than students in general to indicate no major. \u2022 Low-income BPS students at community colleges were somewhat more likely to indicate an occupational major than were higher-income students, although they were less likely to indicate no major than were students in the highest household income quartile. The differences are not striking, however. \u2022 First-generation BPS students at community colleges were more likely to indicate an occupational major than were those whose parents have a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Interestingly, in four-year public colleges, the distribution of the choice of type of major (occupational, academic or none) is fairly even across household income quartiles. Similarly, the choice of major type does not seem to be correlated with the education level of students' parents. Key facts:\n\u2022 BPS students who started in 1995-96 at a public four-year institution were less likely to earn a bachelor's degree in six years than were students who started at private, non-profit four-year institutions, but nearly twice as likely as students who started at four-year forprofits. Students who started at the four-year for-profits were much more likely to earn a certificate or associate degree (about as likely as students who started at community colleges). Still, the probability of earning any degree by starting at a four-year for-profit was less than that when starting at other types of four-year institutions. \u2022 BPS students who started at a community college were less likely to earn a certificate or an associate degree than students who entered private two-year institutions. However, only 10 percent of students who started at two-year for-profit colleges transferred to a four-year institution and only 2 percent earned a bachelor's degree, while 30 percent of students who started at community colleges transferred and 10 percent earned a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Of the 30 percent of beginning community college students who transferred to a fouryear institution, over 80 percent transferred to public four-year institutions, 18 percent transferred to private non-profit institutions and the remaining fraction went to private for-profit four-year colleges. \u2022 One-third of BPS community college students who did transfer ended up earning a bachelor's degree within six years. Those who transferred to private four-year institutions graduated at a slightly higher rate (38 percent) than did those who transferred to public four-year institutions (32 percent).\n\u2022 African-American students who started at a community college in 1995-96 were less than half as likely to earn an associate degree within six years as were white students. Only two percent of blacks who started at a community college earned a bachelor's degree compared to 12 percent of whites. Only about half as many black students as white students transferred to four-year institutions, which is one cause of the low bachelor's completion rate for blacks. \u2022 Nearly twice as many black students than white students who started at a community college earned a certificate. Among black male BPS students at community colleges, over one-fourth earned a certificate within six years (rates by gender not shown). This high rate of certificate attainment may be another reason for the low bachelor's degree completion among black males, since we know from other research that few certificate recipients go on to earn other degrees (see Bailey et al., in press). However, this doesn't explain the low rate of bachelor's attainment among females, since only nine percent of black females who started at a community college earned a certificate. \u2022 Hispanics who started at a community college achieved higher rates of outcome success than blacks, but not as high as whites at all credential levels. It is noteworthy that a higher percentage of Hispanic females transferred to four-year institutions, but a higher percentage of Hispanic males ended up earning bachelor's degrees. In both cases, the rates are low, however. \u2022 More Asian students who started at a community college earned an associate degree than did whites, although only 4 percent of Asian students earned a bachelor's degree compared to 12 percent of whites. This is the case despite the fact that nearly half (46 percent) of Asians who started at a community college transferred to a four-year institution. This is odd given that Asians who start at four-year public institutions have the highest degree completion rate of any race/ethnic group. A somewhat higher percentage of Asians who started at a community college were still enrolled in some institution after six years, but the difference is not large enough to explain the low bachelor's completion rate among Asians who start at a community college. \u2022 A higher percentage of whites beginning in community colleges (32 percent) transferred to four-year colleges than did blacks (16 percent) or Hispanics (24 percent). Asian students transferred at the highest rate (47 percent). Blacks and Hispanics who did transfer ended up earning bachelor's degrees at lower rates (14 percent and 22 percent respectively) than did whites (37 percent). \u2022 A smaller percentage of female BPS community college students (25 percent) transferred to four-year colleges than did male students (35 percent), although a higher percentage of the women who transferred (38 percent) ended up earning a bachelor's degree than did men who transferred (29 percent). This is also the pattern for whites, blacks and Asians. However, more Hispanic females transferred than did Hispanic men, but Hispanic men who transferred earned bachelor's degrees at a much higher rate (33 percent) than did Hispanic women (14 percent). \u2022 Over 80 percent of blacks who transferred attended public four-year institutions compared to 75 percent of Hispanics and 65 percent of whites.  Key facts: \u2022 Only 35 percent of black men and 43 percent of black women who started at a public four-year institution earned bachelor's degrees within six years. This compares with 43 percent for Hispanic men, 46 percent for Hispanic women, 53 percent for white men, and 59 percent for white women (data not shown). \u2022 Higher percentages of students who started at four-year private institutions earned bachelor's degrees than did students who started at four-year public institutions, though the rate at both types of institutions for black students is lower than for other students (compare Figures 17 and 18b). Interestingly, black men who begin at four-year private colleges are more likely than men of other race/ethnicities to earn certificates or associate degrees. \u2022 Although four-year for-profit institutions enroll more beginning postsecondary men than women, the latter earned bachelor's degrees at a higher rate (data not shown). This seems to be driven by differences in outcomes between black and Hispanic men and women. Black and Hispanic women who started at four-year for-profits were much more likely to earn bachelor's degrees than were black and Hispanic men. Over two-thirds (69 percent) of black men who started at four-year for-profit colleges earned certificates, which may explain why so few earned bachelor's degree. Similarly, 43 percent of Hispanic men who started at four-year for-profits earned associate degrees, but only 14 percent earned bachelor's degrees. \u2022 Black and Hispanic students who started at two-year for-profits had a better chance of earning a certificate or an associate degree than did minority students who started at community colleges. Few such students at the two-year for-profit institutions earned bachelor's degrees, however. \u2022 The majority of students who started at less than two-year for-profit institutions earned certificates. The exception is black males, only 33 percent of whom earned certificates compared to 58 percent of black women and 60 percent of white men. Very few students who started at less than two-year institutions earned associate degrees within six years. Figure 19a.  Table A19a in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among students who started at a community college in 1995-96, students in the lowest income quartile were more likely than students in the highest income quartile to earn certificates and less likely to transfer to a four-year institution or earn a bachelor's degree. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a clear correlation between household income and the rates at which students earn associate degrees. \u2022 Beginning community college students in the second income quartile were least likely to earn any degree, although they are more likely than students in the lowest quartile to transfer or earn a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Among all students who started at a community college, only 19 percent of those in the lowest income quartile transferred to a four-year institution, compared to 47 percent of those in the highest income quartile (data not shown; rates include students who earned certificates and associate degrees prior to transferring). \u2022 A little over a quarter (26 percent) of the lowest income students who transferred earned a bachelor's degree within six years while 37 percent of the highest income quartile students who transferred earned a bachelor's degree (data not shown; rates include students who earned certificates and associate degrees prior to transferring). \u2022 Interestingly, a greater percentage of the lowest income students transferred to private non-profit four-year institutions (26 percent) than did students in the highest income group (14 percent). Neither type of institution seems to graduate low income students at higher rates, since the distribution of bachelor's degree completion rate for both types of schools mirrors that for students overall. Key facts: \u2022 Low-income students who started at community colleges were far less likely to earn a certificate or associate degree than were similar students who started at private two-year colleges. However, those at community colleges were more likely to transfer and earn bachelor's degrees than were students in two-year private for-profit institutions. \u2022 Among students who started in four-year public colleges, 40 percent of students in the lowest income quartile earned bachelor's degrees within six years compared to 64 percent of students in the highest income group. A similar contrast in outcomes by income is evident among students who started at private, non-profit four-year institutions and at forprofit four-year institutions. \u2022 Interestingly, there does not seem to be a similar correlation between household income and certificate or degree completion among students who started at two-year for-profit colleges. Low-income students who started at either two-year for-profit or less than twoyear for-profit institutions were actually more likely to earn certificates than were students from the highest income group. However, it should be noted that few highincome students enroll in either type of institution. Figure 20a.  1996-2001). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Among students who started at a community college, first-generation college students were somewhat less likely to earn an associate degree than were students whose parents have college degrees and far less likely to transfer to a four-year institution or earn a bachelor's degree. Only 19 percent of first-generation college students transferred compared to 48 percent of those whose parents had a bachelor's or higher. \u2022 The bachelor's degree completion rate among students who transferred was actually lowest for students whose parents' have some college but no degree (26 percent), followed by first-generation college students (31 percent) and students whose parents had college degrees (38 percent) (data not shown; rates include students who earned certificates and associate degrees prior to transferring). \u2022 Interestingly, a greater percentage of first-generation college students (19 percent) and students whose parents had some college but no degree transferred to private non-profit institutions than did students whose parents had bachelor's degrees (13 percent). Firstgeneration college students did comparatively well at private non-profit institutions, with 41 percent of those who transferred to such institutions receiving a bachelor's degree within six years compared with 29 percent of such students who transferred to public four-year institutions.  1996-2001).

Note:\n\u2022 First-generation students who started at a community college in 1995-96 were less likely to earn a certificate or associate degree than were first-generation students who started at private two-year colleges. \u2022 Among students who started in four-year public colleges, 40 percent of first-generation college students earned bachelor's degrees within six years compared to 65 percent of students whose parents had at least a bachelor's degree. A similar pattern is evident among students who started at private, non-profit four-year institutions and at for-profit four-year institutions. \u2022 Thirty-one percent of first-generation students who started at four-year for-profit colleges earned a bachelor's degree in six years compared to 21 percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher (see Table A20f). No correlation between parents' education and degree completion rates is evident among students who started at two-year for-profit institutions and less than two-year for-profit institutions.\n\u2022 Of students who started at a community college, less than one third (28 percent) of those initially enrolled in certificate programs actually earned a certificate within six years. Even smaller proportions of those initially enrolled in certificate programs earned an associate degree (7 percent), transferred to a four-year institution (6 percent), or earned a bachelor's degree (1 percent). \u2022 Less than one fifth (17 percent) of those who initially enrolled in an associate degree program at a community college ended up earning an associate degree within six years. However, over one quarter (28 percent) of associate degree program students transferred to a four-year institution, while only 12 percent earned a bachelor's degree in six years. \u2022 Black students who started in community college certificate programs had higher rates of success than did Hispanics who started in such programs. The pattern is reversed for those students who started in associate degree programs at community colleges (Hispanics had higher rates of success than did blacks).  1996-2001). Authors' calculations.\n\u2022 Among students who started at a community college in 1995-96, the rate of success in earning a degree or transferring was only slightly higher among students who initially declared an academic major (52 percent) than among those who initially declared an occupational major (48 percent) or none at all (49 percent). \u2022 Community college students who initially indicated an occupational major were more than twice as likely as those who indicated an academic major to earn a certificate (13 percent versus 5 percent) and somewhat more likely to earn an associate degree. However, occupational major students were not as likely to transfer to a four-year institution and less than half as likely to earn a bachelor's degree (data not shown).   1996-2001). Authors' calculations. Note: See Table A23 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Students who started at four-year public institutions and declared an academic major earned bachelor's degrees at a rate of 57 percent, higher than that for occupational majors (56 percent) and those who did not initially declare a major (47 percent). \u2022 White and Hispanic students who declared an occupational major were more likely to earn a bachelor's degree within six years than were their white or Hispanic peers who declared an academic major or had no major. \u2022 Black students who did not declare a major were about as likely to earn a bachelor's degree as were those who declared a major. Note: See Table A24 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Students who took at least one remedial course graduated at a lower rate than did students who took no remedial courses, regardless of institution type. \u2022 BPS students who took remedial courses at four-year public institutions had the lowest rates of success. Only 35 percent of such students earned a bachelor's degree in six years compared to 58 percent of students who started at four-year public institutions and did not take any remedial courses. \u2022 Among students who started at community colleges and other two-year institutions, those who took at least one remedial course were less likely to earn certificates than students who took no remediation. Nonetheless, such students were equally as likely as those who didn't take remediation to earn an associate degree. Recall that students in certificate programs are less likely to enroll in remediation than are students in associate degree programs. Note: See Table A25 in Appendix for details.\n\u2022 Among students who started at community colleges, those who took at least one remedial course in their first year were less likely to earn a certificate or bachelor's degree than those who took no remediation. Students who took remedial courses were twice as likely to still be enrolled in higher education six years following their initial enrollment, indicating that it may take longer for remedial students to graduate compared to those who do not take remedial courses. \u2022 Overall, white beginning community college students who took remedial courses were over twice as likely to earn a credential or transfer (51 percent) than were black or Hispanic students (24 percent each). The rates of remedial enrollment at community colleges across racial and ethnic groups are fairly similar. Even though blacks and Hispanics generally have higher need for remediation, they enroll disproportionately in certificate programs, where remedial requirements are fewer. Therefore, these substantial differences between remedial student achievement reflect differences in attainment rates of academically weaker students in associate degree programs."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Undergraduate Degrees Awarded by Race/Ethnicity", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C.

The comparable figures at the two-year, for-profit colleges were 60 percent and 40 percent. \u2022 Over one quarter (27 percent) of African-American BPS students at community colleges were enrolled in certificate programs compared to 14 percent of Hispanics and 15 percent of whites. \u2022 BPS community college students in the lower income quartiles were more likely to enroll in certificate programs than were those in higher income quartiles.

Twenty percent of community college BPS students who were first-generation college students were in certificate programs compared to five percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher.

Relatively few students at less than two-year institutions took remedial courses. \u2022 African-American BPS community college students were only slightly more likely to take remedial courses than were white students. Hispanic students were somewhat more likely than either group to take remedial courses. This is in contrast to the experience at four-year public institutions where 29 percent of black and 28 percent of Hispanic BPS students took remedial courses compared to 14 percent of whites. One possible explanation for the relatively similar rate of participation in remediation among community college students is that African Americans, Hispanics, low-income and firstgeneration students at community colleges are more likely to enroll in certificate programs, which have lower rates of remedial enrollment and fewer remedial requirements than associate degree programs. Thus, students in these programs have less need to enroll in remediation. In contrast, at four-year institutions, all programs have substantial academic requirements, so all students are tested for remedial needs and required to take such classes as necessary. \u2022 The distribution of community college BPS students who took remedial courses was surprisingly even across household income quartiles (about one quarter of students in each quartile took remedial courses). At four-year public institutions, 22 percent of BPS students in the lowest income quartile took remedial courses compared to 12 percent of students in the highest income quartile. \u2022 Surprisingly, a slightly higher proportion of beginning community college students whose parents went to college or earned a bachelor's degree took remediation (27 percent) than did BPS students who were first-generation college students (23 percent). This may be due to the fact that first-generation college students were more likely to be enrolled in occupational programs at the certificate level, which often do not require students to take remedial courses. Another possible explanation is that students from families of higher socio-economic standing tend to participate in postsecondary education regardless of their academic capabilities, whereas academically unprepared students from low-income families are unlikely to enroll at all, and those who do and are more academically capable may choose for financial or other reasons to enroll in community colleges and other non-selective institutions. At four-year public institutions, 21 percent of BPS students who were first-generation college students took remedial courses compared to 12 percent of students whose parents earned at least a bachelor's degree. \u2022 The vast majority (91 percent) of community college BPS students who took at least one remedial course in their first year were in associate degree programs (data not shown). Only nine percent were in certificate programs, reflecting the fact that many such programs do not require students to take remedial programs because they do not require academic math or English. Slightly more students who took at least one remedial course were in occupational majors (43 percent) as opposed to academic ones (39 percent), although 18 percent had not declared a major. For comparison, examine the following data on participation in remedial education by institution type from a national survey by NCES of remedial education at degree-granting institutions.  Key facts: \u2022 Over forty percent (42 percent) of community college students take at least one remedial course, most often in mathematics. This is more than twice the percentage of students at four-year public institutions who take remedial courses. \u2022 Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of community college students who take remedial courses spend a year or more in such courses, compared to 38 percent of students in four-year public colleges and universities."}, {"section_title": "D.

Summary of Findings", "text": "Enrollment and outcome distributions in American postsecondary education are stratified by race/ethnicity, household income, and parents level of education. The analyses in this report reveal the patterns of this stratification between different types of institutions, within community colleges, and by student outcome. Despite recent gains in postsecondary enrollment and degree attainment, African-Americans and Hispanics remain underrepresented in American undergraduate education and among undergraduate credential recipients. When these students do earn credentials, they are more likely to be lower awards (certificates and associate degrees rather than bachelor's degrees). This is both a function of the institutions through which minority students are entering higher education (disproportionately for-profit, two-year and less than two-year institutions) and their representation within programs at those institutions. In particular, at community colleges minority students are overrepresented in certificate programs and occupational majors. Investigating other categories of students, by household income quartile and by parents highest level of education, we find similar patterns of enrollment and outcome as with African-Americans and Hispanics. That is, students in the lowest quartile and those whose parents did not attend college (i.e. first-generation college students), are disproportionately represented in for-profit, two-year and less than two-year institutions and in certificate programs and occupational majors. They are also less likely to earn degrees or transfer to four-year institutions, and are more likely to earn certificates. We expect that there is significant overlap between income, parents education, and minority status, which may explain the symmetry across groups. We noted that community colleges are unique among postsecondary institutions in that they draw relatively representative proportions of students from all race/ethnic categories, across all quartiles, and among all students by parents' level of education. Thus, community colleges, to their credit, are most representative of a cross-section of the American population. However, looking within community colleges, the mixture may be less pluralistic. Program and major variations reflect differences in student characteristic, according to the patterns discussed above. And minority, low income, and first-generation students earn credentials at lower rates and have disproportionately lower degree attainments as their outcomes. One apparently unstratified pattern in community colleges is enrollment in remedial coursework. However, this pattern is likely more representative of the programs in which students enroll (associate degree students are more likely to take remediation than are certificate program students) than the relative preparedness for college-level work of various identity groups. Most disconcerting among the remediation findings is that African-American and Hispanic community college students who take remediation are far less likely to complete a degree or transfer within six years than their peers who take no remediation. 1 This is in marked contrast to white community college students, for whom remedial course enrollment does not significantly decrease ones likelihood of completing an outcome within six years.
