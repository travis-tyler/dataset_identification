While international assessment data are frequently used to compare performance cross-culturally, the analysis of these data often lacks adequate contextualization for country-by-country comparisons. To ensure maximum utility of the assessments, an examination of each participating country's curriculum content and standards in relation to those on the international assessment is critical. Only then can one make cross-cultural comparisons effectively. The current study investigates the alignment between AP Physics and AP Calculus frameworks as compared to the TIMSS Advanced Physics and Mathematics frameworks. Due to the rigor of AP course work and the performance of AP students versus non-AP students on college course work, we expect AP student performance on TIMSS Advanced may exceed the performance of the general population. Moreover, meaningful comparisons of country achievement rankings are not possible without a study that considers alignment, and thus, there may also be additional compelling findings from the future performance report that can make a potentially significant contribution to the literature, and to policy discussions. The methodology applied in this alignment study is modeled after Norman Webb (Webb, 1997). External alignment and curriculum specialists in mathematics and physics were engaged to evaluate the alignment of AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based and AP Physics 2: Algebra-Based Curriculum framework and AP Calculus framework to the TIMSS Advanced Frameworks according to three criteria: (1) Categorical concurrence, (2) Depth of knowledge, (3) Balance of representation. The mathematics and science groups approached the alignment criteria commensurate with their respective frameworks. For categorical concurrence in physics, degree of alignment between the AP learning objectives and each of the TIMSS Advanced topics were rated as: \u2022 Complete alignment -The learning objective aligns with the full description of the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Partial alignment -The learning objective aligns to a part of the TIMSS topic description. \u2022 Extended alignment -The learning objective aligns to all or part of the TIMSS topic description but also includes knowledge and/or uses of that knowledge that extend beyond what is described in the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Not covered -The learning objective does not align with any of the 23 TIMSS topics. Of the 250 AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives, 180 (72%) are covered within one or more of the 23 TIMSS Advanced Physics topics, while 70 (28%) of the learning objectives are not covered in the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework. After aligning the AP learning objectives to the TIMSS topic, a holistic judgment was made as to whether the collection of AP learning objectives represents partial, complete, or extended alignment of the TIMSS topic as a whole. None of the 23 TIMSS Advanced Physics topics had \"no alignment\" with the AP Physics 1 and 2 curriculum frameworks, as each physics topic was represented in at least one AP learning objective, two (9%) had partial alignment, 14 (61%) had complete alignment, and seven (30%) had extended alignment. The depth of knowledge alignment for physics was measured by considering the three cognitive domains (knowing, applying, and reasoning) outlined in the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework and the science practices outlined in the AP Physics learning objectives. The least aligned cognitive domain was knowing, containing only 11.6% of the total AP learning objectives. Applying was the domain with the strongest alignment with the AP learning objectives, with reasoning also being strongly aligned. For balance of representation in physics, the percentages of AP Physics 1 and 2 items aligned with each of the seven TIMSS Advanced Physics topic areas were determined. Important differences were found between the TIMSS Advanced Physics assessment and the AP Physics Exams in the proportional emphasis on certain topic areas. Most notably, AP students who have completed only AP Physics 1 and then take the TIMSS Advanced Physics assessment will encounter numerous items in Magnetism and Electromagnetic Induction and Atomic and Nuclear Physics (comprising 34% of the TIMSS assessment) that are not included in AP Physics 1. For categorical concurrence in calculus, degree of alignment methodology between the AP content topics and each of the TIMSS Advanced topics followed the same strategy used by the physics team, defined as follows: \u2022 Complete alignment -The content topic aligns with the full description of the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Partial alignment -The content topic aligns to a part of the TIMSS topic description. \u2022 Extended alignment -The content topic aligns to all or part of the TIMSS topic description but also includes knowledge and/or uses of that knowledge that extends beyond what is described in the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Not covered -The content topic does not align with any of the 22 TIMSS topics. Of the 46 AP Calculus AB content topics, all are at least partially covered or extend beyond one or more of the 22 TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics, and 44 (96%) of the AP Calculus AB content topics are completely covered. Of the 67 AP Calculus BC content topics, all are at least partially covered or extend beyond one or more of the 22 TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics, and 56 (84%) of the AP Calculus BC content topics are completely covered. When the AP Calculus AB framework was compared to the 22 TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics, three TIMSS topics (14%) had no alignment, seven (32%) had partial alignment, 10 (45%) had complete alignment, and two (9%) had extended alignment. The comparison of the AP Calculus BC framework to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics resulted in two TIMSS topics (9%) had no alignment, five (23%) had partial alignment, nine (41%) had complete alignment, and six (27%) had extended alignment. To assess depth of knowledge in calculus, each of the 80 AP Calculus AB and BC items was assigned a TIMSS Advanced cognitive domain. AP Calculus content topics were categorized according to the TIMSS topics separately for AP Calculus AB and BC to assess balance of representation across frameworks. Of the AP Calculus AB content topics, 4.5% did not match any of the TIMSS topics. When focusing on the balance of representation for the three calculus topics, the derivatives representation (43.2%) is almost double compared to the representation of limits and integrals (20.5%). The AP Calculus BC balance of representation ranges from 1.5% to 28.4% across seven of the eight topics, with no representation for trigonometry. Compared to the AP Calculus AB content topics, a much greater proportion of AP Calculus BC content topics (19.4%) did not match any of the TIMSS topics. Similar to the AP Calculus AB, when focusing on just the three calculus topics the derivatives representation is almost double (28.4%) compared to the representation of limits and integrals (14.9%). With achievement scores being used to support reform efforts, policymakers must be aware of the degree to which international assessments and curricula are aligned. This study will allow for a comparison of TIMSS results as it relates to AP Calculus and AP Physics."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The results from the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011 showed that U.S. fourth-and eighth-grade students underperformed their peers academically, particularly those in Asian countries (Martin, Mullis, Foy, & Arora, 2012;Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Stanco, 2012). Results from TIMSS Advanced 1995, the last administration of TIMSS Advanced in which the U.S. participated prior to 2015, showed advanced U.S. 12th grade students performing among the bottom two countries (Mullis et al., 1998). Some media channels and education policymakers have called for education reform based on the scores from international assessments. However, we must first challenge the alignment of international assessments to our curriculum and standards, as well as explore whether possible solutions may already exist. For example, research has shown that AP students outperform their non-AP peers in later college course work and exams (Patterson & Ewing, 2013;Patterson, Packman, & Kobrin, 2011). Moreover, the AP Program offers a variety of courses for advanced high school students to engage in college-level course work. Possibly, the rigor of AP courses elicit higher performance on the TIMSS Advanced assessment, as we will explore in the future performance report using 2015 TIMSS Advanced data. International assessment data often lack adequate contextualization for analysis and comparison of performance cross-nationally. One of the reasons is that frameworks of international assessments are not written to be aligned to any single country's standards. Thus, it is paramount to examine country curriculum content before making country by-country comparisons on performance data, and certainly before making meaningful inferences or policy decisions. This report will determine to what degree the AP Physics 1 and 2 and AP Calculus AB and BC frameworks are aligned with the TIMSS Advanced Physics and Mathematics frameworks. This will enable an exploration of any differences in content coverage and levels of complexity will set the stage for a future performance report that will evaluate AP student performance on TIMSS Advanced. The current report will expose meaningful differences in frameworks that may speak to performance outcomes. In 2015, the U.S. as well as several cooperating countries will participate in TIMSS Advanced, providing the optimal opportunity to recognize AP and non-AP students within the TIMSS Advanced sample and investigate the differences in performance. The field trial determined that the established sampling plan ensured adequate AP Physics 1 and 2, and AP Calculus representation, as well as non-AP students to which they can be compared for the final country-to-country performance report."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Examination of the current literature on alignment and linking studies guided the determination of methodology chosen for this study.

The goal of this NCES project was to allow for useful interpretation and comparison of the results from each assessment. By engaging a panel of experts, NCES approached this project by cross-classifying items and framework dimensions across the three assessments.

From a high-level perspective, the unit of focus on TIMSS assessments is the participating country. Student incentives are not provided for taking part in TIMSS. By comparison, the unit of focus for AP Exams is the individual student. Typically, AP students who are motivated to receive college credit or stand out in a competitive college admission process self-select into AP's rigorous course work.

By conducting this alignment study first, we will be able to explore how AP students could be meaningfully compared internationally and to ensure U.S. overall performance on TIMSS Advanced is not conflated with the performance of AP students, and AP Physics and AP Calculus students, in particular.

These two courses comprise a two-year sequence equivalent to the first and second semesters of a typical introductory, algebra-based, college physics course. The 2014-2015 school year was the first year that the redesigned AP Physics 1 and Physics 2 courses and exams were offered by the College Board. The purpose of redesigning the AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 science courses was to: 1. Emphasize a deep understanding rather than comprehensive content coverage (addressing the \"mile-wide and inch-deep\" approach). 2. Reflect current understanding of how students learn in a discipline. 3. Reflect current research directions within the disciplines."}, {"section_title": "Emphasize the development of inquiry and reasoning skills.", "text": "The redesigned courses differ from the traditional content coverage model of instruction in that they focus on the \"big ideas\" of an introductory college-level physics sequence. These \"big ideas\" outline the core disciplinary knowledge and conceptual understandings of foundational physics principles. The principal difference in this model of instruction is that it requires students to spend less time on mathematical routines and more time engaged in inquiry-based learning of essential concepts. These differences focus students on the critical thinking and reasoning skills necessary to engage in an AP Physics course or subsequent course work in science disciplines."}, {"section_title": "Structure and Organization", "text": "Big Ideas. The redesigned AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 concepts are articulated together in the curriculum framework. This framework provides the full scope of conceptual understandings a student should acquire by the end of an introductory sequence in collegelevel algebra-based physics course. The key concepts and related content that define the AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 courses and exams are organized around seven \"big ideas, \" which encompass the core scientific principles, theories, and processes of physics that cut across traditional content boundaries and provide students with a broad way of thinking about the physical world. Big Idea 2: Fields existing in space can be used to explain interactions. Big Idea 3: The interactions of an object with other objects can be described by forces. Big Idea 4: Interactions between systems can result in changes in those systems. Big Idea 5: Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws. Big Idea 6: Waves can transfer energy and momentum from one location to another without the permanent transfer of mass and serve as a mathematical model for the description of other phenomena. Big Idea 7: The mathematics of probability can be used to describe the behavior of complex systems and to interpret the behavior of quantum mechanical systems. 1 Enduring Understandings and Essential Knowledge. For each of the seven big ideas, enduring understandings, which incorporate the core concepts that students should retain from the learning experience, are also identified. Statements of the essential knowledge follow each enduring understanding. The essential knowledge statements support the corresponding enduring understanding and delineate the conceptual targets for student learning. These statements provide a more detailed description of the broader knowledge outlined in the enduring understanding. An example of two enduring understandings and several associated essential knowledge statements for Big Idea 1 is provided below in Table 2. 1   Table 2. Big Idea 1: Objects and systems have properties such as mass and charge. Systems may have internal structure Enduring Understanding 1.A: The internal structure of a system determines many properties of the system.\nUsing the unifying themes of derivatives, integrals, limits, approximation, and applications and modeling, the AP Calculus courses are intended to be a cohesive whole rather than a collection of unrelated topics. These themes are developed using a variety of functions from previous mathematics courses including linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, and piecewise-defined functions. Each theme is addressed using a set of related topics that highlight the content topics used to guide planning, instruction, and assessment. The topics that address the unifying themes are organized into content categories and sub-categories. However, the sequence of topics presented in the AP Calculus framework is not necessarily the order in which the content needs to be taught; the sequence of instruction is at the discretion of the teacher. Each unifying theme includes topics that can be assessed using knowledge, application, and reasoning. As an example, the unifying theme of derivatives, which is addressed in both the AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC courses, includes the following content categories and subcategories (College Board, 2012a, pp. 7-8):"}, {"section_title": "Essential Knowledge 1.A.1:", "text": "A system is an object or a collection of objects.

Essential Knowledge 1.B.1: Electric charge is conserved. The net charge of a system is equal to the sum of the charges of all the objects in the system.

In most countries that participate in TIMSS Advanced, these students are typically those who are planning further study in mathematics or physics at a university or other institute of higher education (Mullis, Martin, & Foy, 2014). TIMSS Advanced is a companion assessment to TIMSS, the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study, which assesses the mathematics and science achievement of fourth-and eighth-grade students in participating countries across the world. Both TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced are projects of IEA (the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement), which is headquartered in Amsterdam. IEA has conducted an array of international comparative studies of student educational achievement since 1959. The results of TIMSS Advanced provide information about the comparative achievement of students from the various participating countries for each of the three administrations of TIMSS Advanced, and trend information about the achievement of students from countries that participated in two or more administrations over the 20 years from 1995 to 2015. In each administration, TIMSS Advanced also collects contextual data about curriculum, instruction, school resources, and student characteristics from curriculum specialists, school principals, science teachers, and the students themselves in each participating country (Hooper, Mullis, & Martin, 2014).

The TIMSS Advanced 2015 Mathematics Framework consists of a content dimension that specifies the mathematics content domains to be assessed and a cognitive dimension specifying the cognitive domains to be assessed. As described in the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Mathematics Framework, the cognitive domains define \"the thinking processes students are expected to use when confronting the mathematics items developed for the TIMSS Advanced 2015 assessment\" (Gronmo, Lindquist, & Arora, 2014).

A strong example of this overlap in language between the AP Physics 1 and 2 science practices and the TIMSS Advanced Physics cognitive domains appears in the science practice related to students' use of representations and models. In this practice AP Physics 1 and 2 outlines the following: The student can use representations and models to communicate scientific phenomena and solve scientific problems. The student can create representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in the domain. The student can describe representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in the domain. The student can refine representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in the domain. The student can use representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively and quantitatively.

This 2015 Physics Assessment Framework was updated from the framework for the 2008 assessment, using recommendations from participating countries that were based on changes in the content and instructional emphases of pre-university physics curricula, standards, and frameworks in their countries since 2008.

Thus, the AP learning objectives and the TIMSS topic provided logical units of analyses for undertaking the categorical concurrence analysis of the frameworks. The categorical concurrence analysis of the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework and the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework occurred in two steps: Step 1) Each of the 250 AP Physics learning objectives was evaluated by the group of science specialists to determine if the content of the learning objective is covered within one or more of the 23 TIMSS Advanced Physics topics. (It is important to note here that the TIMSS topics typically, but not always, tend to be more general and encompass a broader range of content than does each individual AP learning objective). Each AP learning objective was assigned one of four ratings: \u2022 Complete alignment -The learning objective aligns with the full description of the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Partial alignment -The learning objective aligns to a part of the TIMSS topic description. \u2022 Extended alignment -The learning objective aligns to all or part of the TIMSS topic description but also includes knowledge and/or uses of that knowledge that extend beyond what is described in the TIMSS topic. \u2022 Not covered -The learning objective does not align with any of the 23 TIMSS topics.

If the overall rating for a TIMSS topic is extended alignment, then all of the TIMSS topic is covered in the AP Physics 1 and 2 curriculum framework, and the AP Physics 1 and 2 curriculum framework also requires students to demonstrate additional knowledge that is closely connected to the TIMSS topic but requires additional conceptual knowledge and/or additional applications of that knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Calculus", "text": "The TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework, by design, addresses a broader range of mathematical content than the AP Calculus AB and BC frameworks. The TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework includes calculus as just one of three primary content domains. The TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework includes algebra and geometry as the other two domains. Due to this difference in content domains in these two frameworks, we should expect to observe categorical concurrence between only the calculus portion of the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework and the AP Calculus framework. However, to identify any partial alignment of the AP Calculus framework to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics algebra and geometry domains, we completed an analysis of all content domains in both frameworks. Both the content topics specified in the AP Calculus framework and the topics specified in the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework provide descriptions of the mathematics knowledge expected of students. Thus, the AP content topics and the TIMSS topics provided logical units of analyses for undertaking the categorical concurrence analysis of the frameworks. The categorical concurrence analysis of the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework and the AP Calculus AB and BC Framework occurred in two steps: Step 1) Each of the 67 AP Calculus content topics was evaluated by a group of mathematics specialists to determine if the content of the content topic was covered within one or more of the 22 TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics. (As with the TIMSS Physics Framework, the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics tend to be more general and encompass a broader range of content than does each individual AP content topic.) To interpret statements in each of the frameworks the specialists drew from experience with instructional materials and/or instruction commonly used to address the topics described. Any differences in the initial evaluation of the alignment of AP Calculus content topics and TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics were discussed to determine a final alignment rating. Each AP content topic was assigned one of four ratings: Complete alignment -The content topic aligns with the full description of the TIMSS topic. Partial alignment -The content topic aligns to a part of the TIMSS topic description. Extended alignment -The content topic aligns to all or part of the TIMSS topic description but also includes knowledge and/or uses of that knowledge that extends beyond what is described in the TIMSS topic. Not covered -The content topic does not align with any of the 22 TIMSS topics. Step 2) The alignment ratings of each of the AP Calculus content topics to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics were identified. As a next step, all of the AP content topics that aligned to a given TIMSS topic (either partial, complete, or extended alignment) were reviewed again by the group of mathematics specialists and a decision was made as to whether this collection of AP content topics represented partial, complete, or extended alignment with the TIMSS topics as a whole. This review and decision was completed for each of the 22 TIMSS topics. If the overall rating for a TIMSS topic is Partial Alignment, then only part of the TIMSS topic is covered in the AP Calculus framework. If the overall rating for a TIMSS topic is Complete Alignment, then all of the TIMSS topic is covered in the AP Calculus Framework. If the overall rating for a TIMSS topic is Extended Alignment, then all of the TIMSS topic is covered in the AP frameworks, and the AP frameworks also requires students to demonstrate additional knowledge that is closely connected to the TIMSS topic but requires additional conceptual knowledge and/or additional applications of that knowledge.\nTo determine the distribution of levels of cognitive demand as described by the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework, each of the 80 unique tasks from the released 2008 AP Calculus AB and BC Exams (College Board, 2012a) was examined by a group of mathematics experts according to the TIMSS descriptions of thinking skills and behaviors for knowing, applying, and reasoning. The thinking processes for these three cognitive domains are identified in the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework according to the definitions in Table 7.  According to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework, tasks are categorized into three cognitive domains: knowing, applying, and reasoning, based on the thinking processes involved. A task classified as knowing relies on student knowledge of mathematical facts, concepts, and procedures. It often involves student recall or computation as its primary goal. A task classified as applying involves students incorporating mathematical knowledge of facts, skills, and procedures or understanding to mathematical concepts to create representations and solve problems. While this is certainly relevant to problems set in real-life situations, it does also include problems purely mathematical in nature. Finally, a task classified as reasoning involves formulating conjectures, making logical deductions, and justifying results. The primary purpose of these problems is to have students analyze, evaluate, or justify their solutions. Table 8 illustrates a task from AB Calculus for each domain. Table 8.\nThe balance of representation of content for the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics and AP Calculus frameworks were organized according to the eight TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topics: These eight topics are often identified in courses organized as advanced algebra 2 , pre-calculus and calculus courses. Similar to the approach used with the physics analysis of balance of representation, data were obtained from two sources. Data regarding the number of items from the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics assessment that were categorized in each of the eight TIMSS Advanced Mathematics topic areas were obtained from the TIMSS International Study Center at Boston College, which develops, administers, and directs TIMSS for the IEA. Data regarding the distribution of items in the AP Calculus AB and BC Exams across these same eight topic areas were determined using the content topics described in Calculus AB and BC Course Description (College Board, 2012a). In contrast to the physics analysis, the AP Calculus content topics were compared to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework to determine the best match of the AP Calculus content topic to one of eight TIMSS topics. Each content topic was, therefore, matched to only one TIMSS topic. Some AP Calculus content topics were found to have no match to any of the TIMSS topics. The percentage of items from the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework categorized in each of the eight topic areas was compared to the percentage of content topics in the AP Calculus AB and BC framework aligned to the same topic areas. College Board Research in Review The categorical concurrence analysis comparing the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework with the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework showed that the large majority of physics content described in the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework is also described in the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework. However, in some portions of each of the three TIMSS Advanced Physics content domains, the content coverage of the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework extended beyond the content coverage of the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework to include additional conceptual knowledge and applications of that knowledge. This section of the report presents a detailed description of the results of the categorical concurrence analysis, and delineates the similarities and differences in physics content coverage between the The results of the evaluation of the degree of alignment between the AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives and science practices and each of the TIMSS Advanced Physics topics is presented in Figures 2, 3, and 4. For each TIMSS Advanced Physics topic, this figure shows whether there is partial alignment, complete alignment, extended alignment, or not covered between the TIMSS Advanced Physics topic and the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework (as described in the Methodology section of this report, extended alignment indicates that the TIMSS Advanced Physics topic is completely covered within the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, but also that some AP learning objectives aligned to the topic require additional conceptual knowledge and/or additional applications of that knowledge than are included in the topic description.) None of the 23 TIMSS Advanced Physics topics had no alignment with the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, two (9%) had partial alignment, 14 (61%) had complete alignment, and seven (30%) had extended alignment.

The TIMSS assessment contains items specifically developed to address all three of the cognitive in each of the content domains. Also, as the TIMSS framework notes on page 22, \"while there is some hierarchy across the three domains (from knowing to applying to reasoning), each domain contains items representing a full range of difficulty. \" Given this element, the science specialists determined that the appropriate level of analysis should focus on the three TIMSS cognitive domains, not the subdomain level. To conduct the depth of knowledge alignment, each of the 250 AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives was evaluated by the science specialists to determine if the science practice of the learning objective was covered within one or more of the 23 TIMSS Advanced Physics cognitive domain subtopics. Each AP learning objective was either considered \"aligned\" or \"aligned to multiple subtopics. \" If the AP learning objective was considered \"aligned, \" it was fully aligned to only one of the TIMSS Advanced Physics cognitive domain subtopics. If it was considered \"aligned to multiple subtopics, \" then the AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objective was aligned to more than one TIMSS Advanced Physics cognitive domain subtopics. While there were several instances of AP learning objectives aligned to multiple subtopics, when these data were analyzed at the TIMSS cognitive domain topic level, each AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objective only aligns once to a TIMSS cognitive domain topic level. The analysis of the depth of knowledge is reported as the overall percentages of AP learning objectives that are aligned to each TIMSS cognitive domain topic level. The reported percentage is not weighted even though an uneven number of subtopics for each TIMSS cognitive domain exist. This unevenness would be problematic if there were equal chances that the data could align across any of the TIMSS subtopic areas, but this is not the case. The alignment of the AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives illustrates where AP places emphasis within the TIMSS cognitive domain."}, {"section_title": "Examples of AP Calculus Tasks Within TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework", "text": "Experts reviewed the tasks at the thinking process level and identified the primary or secondary reasoning goals for each task. To be identified by as a primary reasoning goal, the main purpose of the task had to align with the descriptors for this thinking process. To be identified as a secondary reasoning goal, the range of possible responses could include features of the described thinking process, but it was not the main purpose of the task. A task could have multiple primary and secondary goals. For example, on the 2008 AP Calculus AB Exam, Problem 6 from Section I states, \"if f (x) = sin 2 (3x), then f \u00a2(x) =\" (College Board, 2012a, page 19). Even though students are expected to recall the derivative of sin(x) and the chain rule, the primary goals for this task are to: (a) determine the appropriate method needed to solve this problem (in this case, use of the chain rule), and (b) to compute the derivative. Recall of related mathematical facts and procedures were determined to be secondary goals. In contrast, Problem 24 from Section I requires students to analyze the given trigonometric function and determine an alternative method to find its integral. It is worth noting that even though the framework of AP Calculus BC consists of all topics covered in AP Calculus AB, plus some topics not covered in AP Calculus AB (e.g., different coordinate systems and series), Section I of the AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC Exams share no common tasks. However, in Section II, there are three shared questions (12 tasks), two of which are in the calculator section (8 tasks). The three questions (10 tasks) that are different for AP Calculus BC are topics that are unique to the course. Both exams consist of the same number of tasks in each section. While the two examples provided for Applying and Reasoning appear to be straightforward computational problems, note that both tasks are in the calculator active portion of Section I of the AP Calculus AB Exam.

This requirement is not explicitly stated in the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, although the concepts described in AP Learning Objective 5.B.8.1 3 and Science Practices 1.2 and 7.2 build on much of the same knowledge that is required for the understanding of this TIMSS topic."}, {"section_title": "Atomic and Nuclear Physics (4 Topics)", "text": "The TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework and the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework delineate coverage of similar core content from this TIMSS Advanced Physics topic area, including, for example: light emission and absorption by electrons, wave-particle duality, the photoelectric effect, nuclear reactions, radioactive decay and solving half-life problems, and mass-energy equivalence. All four TIMSS Advanced Physics topics in this topic area were evaluated to be completely aligned with the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, but there are modest differences between the frameworks that are worth noting: \u2022 The TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework requires students to \"apply knowledge of the structure of atoms and isotopes, atomic number and atomic mass to solve problems. \" This requirement is not stated in the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework although it logically can be implied to be prerequisite for other knowledge and skills that are included in the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework. \u2022 The AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework explicitly requires students to \"construct or interpret representations of transitions between atomic energy states involving the emission and absorption of photons, \" which likely extends beyond the intention of the TIMSS framework's requirement that students \"relate light emission and absorption in the spectrum to the behavior of electrons. \""}, {"section_title": "AP Physics 1 and 2 Content Not Covered in the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework", "text": "The categorical concurrence analysis presented in this section supports the conclusion that nearly all of the physics content described in the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework is covered in the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, but that for some TIMSS Advanced Physics topics, the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework extends beyond the TIMSS topic descriptions to include additional conceptual knowledge and additional applications of that understanding.

Overall, this section highlights how the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework places a significant amount of emphasis on the applying and reasoning categories of the TIMSS cognitive domains, but less of an emphasis on the knowing cognitive domain. Table 10 highlights the differences between the cognitive emphasis between the TIMSS Advanced Physics Framework and AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework using the construct that has been defined by TIMSS Advanced, which is the outline of the cognitive domains. This research aligns the AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives to those appropriate areas. Because this is the same construct, it is possible to determine the emphasis that the AP Physics learning objectives placed on the TIMSS cognitive domains. Overall, the domain of knowing only contains 11.6% of the total cognitive alignments. This is by far the least aligned domain among the three TIMSS cognitive domains. One possible explanation for this difference in focus might be that the AP Physics 1 and 2 Curriculum Framework, and more specifically the AP Physics 1 and 2 redesign, heavily focuses on engaging students in the practices of science. Also, while students in AP Physics 1 and 2 are not expected to have specific physics content knowledge prior to entering the course, the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses do expect students to have considerable knowledge within the domain of science. Rather than memorizing a lot of facts and examples, the focus of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses stress applying and reasoning as students engage with the content of the courses. The observed differences in focus around knowing may be a result of TIMSS Advanced Physics assessing a broader array of knowledge within physics, some of which is procedural and based on core disciplinary facts within the discipline. Another notable aspect in the domain of knowing is that the alignment is not well distributed across the subtopics. TIMSS outlines three subtopics in the domain of knowing, Recall/ Recognize, Describe, and Provide Examples. Of all of the subtopics in the three cognitive domains, Provide Examples is the only subtopic that does not contain any alignment with the AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives. Recall/Recognize is only represented by two AP Physics 1 and 2 learning objectives, with the other learning objectives aligned to Describe within the domain of knowing. This is the most uneven distribution among the three cognitive domains. \nPhysics. Applying was the domain with the most evenly distributed alignments. Subtopics such as Find Solutions, Explain, and Use Models fit well with many of the AP learning objectives, and there was quite a bit of overlap in the language used by TIMSS and AP to describe these components of the frameworks.

Again, as with the previous cognitive domain, the precision in language of the AP Science Practices illustrates a clear alignment between AP and TIMSS. Most notable was the language in the subtopic formulate questions/hypothesize/predict: The student can engage in scientific questioning to extend thinking or to guide investigations within the context of the AP course.

Figure 16 compares the distribution of AP Calculus BC content topics to the distribution of TIMSS Advanced Mathematics tasks. The AP Calculus BC balance of representation ranges from 1.5% to 28.4% across seven of the eight topics, with no representation for trigonometry. Given the greater proportion of advanced topics that extended beyond the TIMSS framework, it is not surprising that a much greater proportion of AP Calculus BC content topics (19.4%) did not match any of the TIMSS topics. Similar to the AP Calculus AB, when focusing on just the three calculus topics the derivatives representation is almost double (28.4%) compared to the representation of limits and integrals (14.9%). \nPhysics.

AP Calculus AB: \u2022 Basic properties of definite integrals (examples include additivity and linearity)."}, {"section_title": "AP Calculus BC:", "text": "\u2022 Terms of series as areas of rectangles and their relationship to improper integrals, including the integral test and its use in testing the convergence of p-series. \u2022 The ratio test for convergence and divergence. \u2022 Comparing series to test for convergence or divergence. \u2022 Taylor polynomial approximation with graphical demonstration of convergence (for example, viewing graphs of various Taylor polynomials of the sine functions approximating the sine curve). \u2022 Maclaurin series and the general Taylor series centered at x = a. \u2022 Functions defined by power series. \u2022 Lagrange error bound for Taylor polynomials. The large number of topics listed here from AP Calculus BC shows that while some of the added topics are aligned well with TIMSS Advanced Mathematics (e.g., functions in polar form, parametric form, or vector form), there are a number of AP Calculus BC content topics not addressed in TIMSS Advanced Mathematics. An element of the list is the AP Calculus AB content topic of basic properties of definite integrals. Even though this is a very specific topic that has little to do with most of the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework, especially those not related to calculus directly, the TIMSS framework explicitly addresses integrals. However, upon further evaluation, it was determined that TIMSS Advanced Mathematics expects integration of polynomial, exponential, trigonometric, and simple rational functions, along with evaluating the definite integrals and computing areas and volumes. These two TIMSS topics are only partially aligned with the AP Calculus content topic, basic properties of definite integrals -the former is only concerned with integrating specific types of functions and applying them to area and volume, while the latter includes integration of algebraic manipulations of various types of functions."}, {"section_title": "Depths of Knowledge", "text": "As described in the methodology section, the tasks from the released 2008 AP Calculus AB and BC Exams were compared to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework, particularly focusing on the cognitive domains of knowing, applying, and reasoning. Table 11 shows the number of tasks for each section of each exam: Note the subtle differences in the categorization of tasks between the TIMSS Advanced cognitive domains and the AP Calculus AB and BC Exams. While the number of tasks is precisely the same, the distribution of the tasks is slightly different. The AP Calculus AB Exam has three more tasks in the applying cognitive domain than AP Calculus BC. Table 12 below illustrates the proportion of knowing, applying, and reasoning tasks for each section:  AB, Section II, Part A BC, Section II, Part A AB, Section II, Part B BC, Section II, Part B 3 (27%) 5 (45%) 6 (55%) 5 (45%) 7 (64%) 5 (45%) 1 (9%) 0 (0%) 1 (9%) 1 (9%) 4 (36%) 6 (55%)"}, {"section_title": "TIMSS Distribution", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "35% 35% 30%", "text": "Recall that in both AP Calculus Exams, Section I Part A is multiple choice, no calculators and Part B is multiple choice, with calculators; Section II Part A is free response, with calculators and Part B is free response, no calculators. Reviewing how the tasks are distributed throughout the entire exams tells a much different story. The small differences within each section are exemplified through differences when looking between calculator active and non-calculator parts. For example, the two tasks related to the applying cognitive domain in Section I of the AP Calculus BC Exam are both found in the calculator-active part. In fact, almost all tasks in the AP Calculus AB and BC Exams that are classified as applying according to the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics Framework are in the calculator-active component of each section (Section I, Part B and Section II, Part A). Similarly, almost all of the tasks classified as reasoning in Section II of the AB and BC Calculus Exams do not allow students to use calculators. Even though Section I of each exam consists of different tasks, Section II shared 12 tasks out of 22 between the AB and BC Calculus Exams. Of the 10 tasks in Section II that were different between the two exams, the tasks in BC Calculus were unique to the BC Calculus content topics. It was observed that all five tasks aligned with the applying domain in Section II of the AP Calculus BC Exam were among the shared tasks. That is, no free-response Figure 11. Example of an application task from AP Calculus Exam. questions unique to the AP Calculus BC curriculum were aligned with the applying domain. Moreover, no additional tasks were aligned with the reasoning cognitive domain in Section II of the AP Calculus AB Exam were unique to that exam (i.e., all five reasoning tasks in Section II of the AP Calculus AB Exam were shared with the AP Calculus BC Exam). The AP Calculus BC Exam, however, has two additional reasoning tasks."}, {"section_title": "Representation of Thinking Processes", "text": "The most-used thinking processes identified in the AP Calculus tasks were Recall and Compute, as many of the non-calculator tasks required a combination of the two. Since a majority of the tasks in Section I in each of the AP Calculus Exams involve solving problems, often by finding derivatives, the result is a preponderance of item representation in the knowing domain. Similarly, the sizable number of tasks within the applying domain are attributed to two problems in the free-response section (Section II) that rely heavily on the Represent/Model thinking process (generate an equation or diagram that models problem situations and generate equivalent representations for a given mathematical entity). For example, all four tasks of question one of Section II in the AB and BC Calculus Exams were determined to be aligned with the Application cognitive domain (see Figure 11 below). Even though it was determined that Analysis (i.e., identify the elements of a problem and determine the information, procedures, and strategies necessary to solve the problem) from the reasoning domain and retrieval (i.e., retrieve information from graphs, tables, texts, or other sources) from the knowledge domain was involved in completing this problem, the Figure 12. Example of a reasoning task from AP Calculus Exam. Graph of v 4 5 6 t primary goal of each task in the question above is to generate equations that model the given information (i.e., Represent/Model from the applying cognitive domain). Lastly, the tasks attributed to reasoning are due to a relatively equal distribution between Analyze (see description above), Integrate/Synthesize (link different elements of knowledge, related representations, and procedures), Draw Conclusions (make valid inferences on the basis of information and evidence), and Justify (provide mathematical arguments or proofs to support a strategy, solution, or statement). For example, all four tasks in question four of Section II in the AB and BC exams were determined to be aligned with the reasoning cognitive domain, but for different reasons (see Figure 12 below): The primary goal of tasks 4A and 4B is to Analyze; the primary goal in task 4C is to Draw Conclusions; and the primary goal in task 4D is to Integrate/Synthesize. Even though secondary goals were found, they had no impact on determining the cognitive domain for each task. The following problem from Section II (Part B) of the AP Calculus BC Exam gives an example of Justification as the primary thinking process (5A). Tasks 5A and 5B involve a combination of Justification, Analysis, and Drawing Conclusions. Since 5C involves rather straightforward integration by parts it is a basic Computation problem and was categorized in the Knowledge cognitive domain. Figure 13. Example of a justification task from AP Calculus Exam."}, {"section_title": "Lack of Representation of Thinking Processes", "text": "Also worth noting is the lack of representation of some of the thinking processes described in the TIMSS Advanced Mathematics framework within the AP Calculus tasks. The following thinking processes were not identified as primary reasoning goals in all of the tasks reviewed: \u2022 Recognize (recognize entities that are mathematically equivalent, from the knowing cognitive domain). \u2022 Implement (implement strategies to solve problems in familiar concepts and procedures, from the applying cognitive domain). \u2022 Evaluate (determine appropriateness of alternative strategies and solutions, from the reasoning cognitive domain). \u2022 Generalize (make statements that represent relationships in more general terms, from the reasoning cognitive domain). While the first three thinking processes incorporate many secondary reasoning goals within the set of AP Calculus tasks, there were no AP Calculus tasks that featured Generalize as either a primary or secondary reasoning goal. The most common usage of the thinking process, Recognize, is in the multiple-choice sections of the AB and BC Calculus Exams, where students are relate their solutions to the given choices. Finally, Question 23 from Section I, Part B of the AP Calculus AB Exam is an example of Recognize as a secondary goal (the primary goal is Retrieve): Calculus  Example of a recognize task from AP Calculus Exam."}, {"section_title": "Findings and Conclusion Overall Summary", "text": "This alignment report compares the AP Physics 1 and 2 and the AP Calculus curriculum frameworks with the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Frameworks to show alignment in both the content and cognitive domains for each subject area.

Further, AP students should also be familiar with the context of the assessment items and the way in which the assessment items are presented to the students on the exam. Knowing that AP students are prepared for the TIMSS 2015 Exam will allow for deeper claims to be made in the subsequent performance report, as it will not be necessary to speculate whether or not the material on the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Exam is relevant to AP students. In addition, the level of detail this alignment report provides will allow researchers writing the performance report to deconstruct different sections of the TIMSS 2015 performance report to identify sections of the exam where we would expect AP students to excel and where AP students are less prepared for the content being assessed. 4 Appendixes available upon request.
