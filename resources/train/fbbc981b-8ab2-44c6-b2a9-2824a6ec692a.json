[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 1,2 is the third coronavirus to cross from an animal reservoir to infect humans in the 21 st century, after SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) 3, 4 and MERS (Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). 5 Isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in January 2020, and the virus was found to be highly related to SARS and share a probable origin in bats. 2, 6 Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has infected over 10.5 million people and caused more than 500,000 deaths as of July 1, 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the worldwide spread of this ongoing outbreak highlight the urgent need for public health measures and therapeutics to limit new infections. Moreover, the severity of the atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019), often requiring multi-week hospital stays and the use of invasive ventilators, [7] [8] [9] highlights the need for therapeutics to lessen the severity of individual infections.\nCurrent therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 target major points in the life-cycle of the virus. The antiviral Remdesivir, first developed against Ebola virus, 10, 11 inhibits the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases of a range of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 [12] [13] [14] and has shown promise against SARS-CoV-2 in small-scale trials in both primates and humans. 15, 16 Another target is the viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro), which is required to process viral polyproteins into their active forms. 17 Finally, the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein mediates binding to host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and\nThis article is protected by copyright.

[18] [19] [20] [21] As the most prominent surface component of the virus, the spike protein is the major target of antibodies in patients, and is the focus of several current efforts at SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. Initial trials using antibody-containing plasma of convalescent COVID-19 patients has also shown promise in lessening the severity of the disease. 22 While the above efforts target viral entry, RNA synthesis, and protein processing, there has so far been less emphasis on other steps in the viral life cycle. One critical step in coronavirus replication is the assembly of the viral genomic RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which interacts with the membrane (M) protein and is packaged into virions. Electron microscopy analysis of related betacoronaviruses has suggested that the RNP complex adopts a helical filament structure, 23-28 but recent cryo-electron tomography analysis of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions has revealed a beads-on-a-string like arrangement of globular RNP complexes that sometimes assemble into stacks resembling helical filaments. 29 Despite its location within the viral particle rather than on its surface, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show higher and earlier antibody responses to the nucleocapsid protein than to the surface spike protein. 30, 31 As such, a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein's structure, and structural differences between it and N proteins of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, may aid the development of sensitive and specific immunological tests.\nCoronavirus N proteins possess a shared domain structure with an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal domain responsible for dimerization. The assembly of the N protein into higher-order RNP complexes is not well understood, but likely involves cooperative interactions between the dimerization domain and other regions of the protein, plus the bound RNA. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Here, we present a high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N dimerization domain, revealing an intertwined dimer similar to that of related betacoronaviruses. We also analyze the self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and show that higher-order assembly requires both the dimerization domain and the extended, disordered C-terminus of the protein. Together with other work revealing the structure and RNA-binding properties of the nucleocapsid N-terminal domain, these results lay the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid assembly and architecture."}, {"section_title": "Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid dimerization domain", "text": "Betacoronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins share a common overall domain structure, with ordered RNA-binding (N1b or N-terminal domain/NTD) and dimerization (N2b or C-terminal This article is protected by copyright.

Self-association of the full-length SARS-CoV N protein and the isolated C-terminal region (domains N2b plus spacer B/N3; residues 210-422) was first demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis, 32 and the purified full-length protein was shown to self-associate into predominantly dimers in solution. 33 The structures of the N2b domain of SARS-CoV and several related coronaviruses confirmed the obligate homodimeric structure of this domain, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] and other work showed that the region C-terminal to this domain mediates further self-association into tetramer, hexamer, and potentially higher oligomeric forms. [41] [42] [43] Other studies have suggested that the protein's N-terminal region, including the RNA-binding N1b domain, can also self-associate, 44, 45 highlighting the possibility that assembly of full-length N into helical filaments is mediated by cooperative interactions among several interfaces. To characterize the structure and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, we first cloned and purified the protein's N2b dimerization domain (N2b; residues 247-364). 46, 47 We crystallized and determined two high-resolution crystal structures of N2b; a 1.45 \u00c5 resolution structure of His6-tagged N2b at pH 8.5, and a 1.42 \u00c5 resolution structure of N2b after His6-tag cleavage, at pH 4.5 (see Materials and Methods and Table S1 ). These structures reveal a compact, tightly intertwined dimer with a central four-stranded \u03b2-sheet comprising the bulk of the dimer interface [ Fig. 1 (B) ]. This interface is composed of two \u03b2-strands and a short \u03b1-helix from each protomer that extend toward the opposite protomer and pack against its This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. The structure of N2b closely resembles that of related coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The structure is particularly similar to that of SARS-CoV, with which the N2b domain shares 96% sequence identity; only five residues differ between these proteins' N2b domains (SARS-CoV Gln268 \uf0e0 SARS-CoV-2 A267, D291\uf0e0E290, H335\uf0e0Thr334, Gln346\uf0e0Asn345, and Asn350\uf0e0Gln349), and the structures are correspondingly similar with an overall C\u03b1 r.m.s.d of 0.314 \u00c5 across the N2b dimer [ Fig. 1 \nA crystal structure of the SARS-CoV N protein revealed a helical assembly of N2b domain dimers that was proposed as a possible structure for the observed helical nucleocapsid filaments in This article is protected by copyright.

We identified two dimer-dimer packing modes that appear in multiple crystal forms, with packing mode 1 appearing in five structures, and packing mode 2 appearing in four [ Fig. S1 (B) ]. Neither of these packing modes would result in the assembly of a helical filament if repeated, nor do the dimerdimer interfaces strongly correlate with conserved surfaces on the N2b domain. This evidence, combined with our finding that N2b forms solely dimers in solution (see below), suggests that packing of N2b domain dimers does not underlie higher-order assembly of SARS-CoV-2 N protein filaments."}, {"section_title": "N protein variation in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples", "text": "Since the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in January 2020, 2 Table S2 ]. While many of these substitutions arise only once in our dataset and may therefore reflect errors in sequencing or sequence assembly, most likely reflect true variation among circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. As a whole, the reported substitutions are enriched in the three intrinsically disordered domains (N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3), with a particularly high density of substitutions in the serine/arginine-rich subdomain of N2a [SR in Fig. 2 "}, {"section_title": "Self-association of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein", "text": "Our structures of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein N2b domain reveal that, as in related coronaviruses, this domain mediates homodimer formation. We next systematically investigated the molecular basis for higher-order self-assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. We first purified the full-length N protein (NFL) for analysis of its oligomeric state. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nTo determine the molecular basis for homotetramer assembly, we purified a series of truncation constructs encompassing the ordered N1b and N2b domains and their associated linker domains [N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3; Fig. 1 Finally, we analyzed the contribution of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 region to N protein selfassembly. Prior work with the Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) N protein showed that this region can, on its own, incorporate into nucleocapsid structures that lack the associated Membrane (M) protein, suggesting that the region mediates a homotypic interaction between N proteins. 47 Other work with SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E N proteins also found that the C-terminal spacer B/N3 region is required for higher-order assembly of tetramers and larger oligomers. [41] [42] [43] We purified a construct encoding N2b and the spacer B/N3 region (N2b3, residues 247-419) and\nfound that it forms a homotetramer [ Fig. 3 (E) ]. We also analyzed self-assembly of the spacer B/N3 region on its own by performing SEC-MALS analysis on this isolated region (N3, residues 365-419) fused to a His6-maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. Initial purification of His6-MBP-N3 yielded two peaks on the final size exclusion column, which we separated pooled and analyzed by SEC-MALS. We found that these two peaks correspond to a monomer and a dimer, respectively [ Fig. 3(F) ]. The pooled dimer population also showed a small population of potentially higher-order oligomers [ Fig. 3(F) ]. Together, these data suggest that assembly of betacoronavirus N protein filaments likely proceeds through at least three steps, each mediated by different oligomerization interfaces: (1) Compared to N2b, N2b3 contains an additional 56 amino acids (residues 365-419). While residues 360-394 were not detected in our HDX-MS analysis, we detected spectra for seven overlapping peptides spanning residues 395-419 at the protein's extreme C-terminus [ Fig. 4 "}, {"section_title": "(B)]. While all of", "text": "This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. these peptides exhibited higher levels of exchange than the ordered N2b domain, peptides spanning the N-terminal part of this region (particularly residues 395-402) showed a degree of protection compared to those at the extreme C-terminus [residues 404-419; Fig. 4 (E) ]. This finding suggests that at least part of the spacer B/N3 domain possesses secondary structure and may mediate N2b3 tetramer formation. Indeed, a recent molecular dynamics simulation of the N3 domain suggests the existence of an \u03b1-helix spanning residues 400-411 in this domain, 50 and our own analysis using the PSI-PRED server 51 suggests an \u03b1-helix spanning residues 400-416 [ Fig. 1(A) ].\nWe next compared HDX-MS exchange rates of N2b versus N2b3 for peptides within the N2b domain. We reasoned that if the C-terminus of N2b3 mediates tetramer formation, it may do so by docking against a surface in the N2b domain, which may be detectable by reduced deuterium uptake in the involved region. Contrary to this expectation, we found that the H-D exchange rates within the N2b domain were nearly identical between the two constructs, varying at most 2% in fractional deuterium uptake in individual peptides ([ Fig. 4 (B) , 4 (D) ]. While these data do not rule out the possibility that the spacer B/N3 region docks against N2b, they nonetheless support our SEC-MALS data showing that spacer B/N3 independently selfassociates to mediate N protein tetramer formation. We attempted to test this idea by measuring the association of His6-MBP-N3 with N2b, N2b3, and NFL in a pulldown assay [ Fig.   S4 (B) ]. We were unable to detect binding of His6-MBP-N3 to any of these three constructs. As both N2b3 and NFL likely exist as pre-formed tetramers, their failure to interact with additional His6-MBP-N3 is not surprising. The inability of N2b to interact with His6-MBP-N3, however, is consistent with the idea that the spacer B/N3 domain self-interacts rather than binding the N2b domain.

The high resolution of our crystal structures will enable their use in virtual screening efforts to identify such nucleocapsid assembly modulators. Given the high conservation of the N2b domain in betacoronaviruses, these assembly modulators may also be effective at countering related viruses including SARS-CoV. As SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the last betacoronavirus to jump from an animal reservoir to humans, the availability of such treatments could drastically alter the course of future epidemics.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genome has been subject to unprecedented scrutiny, with over 38,000 individual genome sequences deposited in public databases as of early June, 2020. We used this set of genome sequences to identify over 10,000 instances of amino acid substitutions in the N protein, and showed that these variants are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain. The ~650 substitutions we identified in the N1b and N2b domains were clustered away from these domains' RNA binding and dimerization interfaces, reflecting the functional importance of these surfaces.
