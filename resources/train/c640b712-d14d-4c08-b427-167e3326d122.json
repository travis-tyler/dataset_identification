This is the premise of the Academic Research Organization (ARO) Council, which was initiated in Japan in 2013. The volume of data is growing exponentially, providing not only challenges but also the clear opportunity to understand and treat diseases in ways not previously considered.\nHarnessing the knowledge within the data in a successful way can provide researchers and clinicians with new ideas for therapies while avoiding repeats of failed experiments. In addition to data sharing, the transformation of clinical research processes through disruptive innovation, while ensuring integrity and ethics, will be key to achieving the ARO Council goal to overcome intractable diseases such that people not only live longer but also are healthier and happier as they age.\nOver the past 5 years, the ARO Council has been expanding from Japan into Asia (adding Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea) and now includes leaders from academic institutions in Europe and the United "}, {"section_title": "| US NIH NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES-CATALYZING TRANSLATIONAL INNOVATION", "text": "Dr Christopher Austin stated, in response to an opening comment about music being \"the orderly placement of silence between the notes,\" that we currently have noise and dissonance rather than silence, in the United States. \"We pay people to be dissonant and inharmonious\" through incentives that are inadvertently in the wrong places. He commented that Japan has a different approach in that they tie data sharing and budgets together; data sharing is required for funding to be awarded.\nThe NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has a mission to enhance the development, testing, and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. Collaboration with other government agencies, academia industry, and nonprofit organizations is essential for NCATS.\nOne of the NCATS initiatives is the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), which Dr Austin described. The NCATS CTSA Program Hubs innovate locally and collaborate regionally and nationally in projects such as informatics, training, streamlining processes, community engagement, and understudied populations. Data sharing is essential to CTSA success. Cross-CTSA initiatives, such as the Trial Innovation Network (TIN), solve systematic problems that limit the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical translational science.\nThe TIN leverages the expertise and experience across CTSA centers to develop resources and capabilities that can benefit all centers, such as an institutional review board (IRB) reliance platform, electronic health record (EHR)-based patient recruitment methods, standard master agreements, and contracts. These are intended to reduce time spent on these activities such that more science can be performed.\nFocus has been on encouraging innovative scientific hypotheses and models, novel study designs, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) endpoints, and a \"learning clinical research system.\" Outcomes Research Network (PCORNet). These involve common data center and patient advocacy groups. He also referenced the All of Us program, which is in the process of recruiting one million patients, has an extensible data platform, and is an example of personalized medicine. Dr Austin stated that it seems there is agreement that standards are important, but not on which standards to adopt.\nA recent cross-CTSA NCATS grant award that deserves special mention is for the creation of a Center for Data to Health (CD2H), which is led by Dr Melissa Haendel. Dr Haendel reported specifically on her work in this area in a presentation that is summarized later in this article.\nDr Rob Califf (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Commissioner in 2016 and well-respected academic researcher from Duke) has been quoted as saying \"Clinical trials in this country take too long, cost too much, and too often don't give us the answers we need to take care of our patients. Other than that, the system works great.\" Even the time from funding approval to study start can take 2 years, and a study can take over 10 years. The inability to recruit patients actually affects a large percentage of trials, while the length of time to recruit can make the trial eventually irrelevant because the underlying basic science may move more quickly. This results in unnecessary loss of patient lives, along with investigator careers and information that could improve health, thus delaying the advancement of medicine and LHSs."}, {"section_title": "| US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION", "text": "Dr Eileen Navarro spoke about the value of harmonization and standards for FDA. Global clinical research studies are important, and harmonization can reduce timelines and costs for such trials. a ship, and/or a plane and moved readily around the globe using these different forms of transportation. This is a lesson for data sharing.\nA sharing environment can streamline global research. Examples provided are the common protocol template (CPT \"Content/metadata sharing\" complements data sharing and facilitates interpretation of the data.\nDr Navarro listed five core reasons on why standards matter:\nStandards (1) bridge the evidence spectrum, (2) facilitate transparent research, (3) facilitate efficient reviews, (4) facilitate data reuse, and Concurrently, ARO Council is focusing to form disease-specific consortia in global countries (Figure 2 ). For each specific disease, a registry has been constructed, often in each country, or sometimes collaboratively. Registries should be combined, which is believed not to be a difficult task. An initial step will be catalog creation of the registry to enable sharing of the greatest common measures of those data that have been collected across the registries. For such data sharing, a good leading example, which has already taken a concrete approach towards standardization and harmonization, is the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, for which there has been excellent cooperation among research groups."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "The next milestone will be to initiate clinical trials concurrently and to obtain regulatory approvals simultaneously for academia- System. \"We seek the development of a learning health system that is designed to generate and apply the best evidence for the collaborative healthcare choices of each patient and provider; to drive the process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care; and to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care\" (US National Academies of Medicine/Institute of Medicine). 16 Dr Silverstein went further to discuss service-oriented science 17 and data science as a service, which led to requirements for a Data This challenge, summarized as collecting data consistently and completely, is at the core of being able to more efficiently use information/data to support LHSs.\nDr Ida Sim of the University of California, San Francisco, has experience in creating tools to search publications using structured data.\nDuring this workshop, she described Vivli, a new nonprofit with a mis- To address the need to bridge resources and activities such as what Monarch provides and achieves with clinical care and health data, NIH/NCATS has awarded a grant to Dr Haendel as the lead investigator of a collaborative opportunity to create a new CD2H as a cross-CTSA initiative. 25 The priorities for the new CD2H will to support a \"vibrant and evolving informatics ecosystem,\" including\n\u2022 support and enhancement of a collaborative informatics community;\n\u2022 development of Good Data Practices (GDP);\n\u2022 promotion of software standards for interoperability;\n\u2022 growth of collaborative innovation across informatics tools, methods, and processes;\n\u2022 advancement of cutting edge biomedical research informatics;\n\u2022 data science education for CTSA Program researchers; and\n\u2022 novel methods and tools for the evaluation of the impact of these activities to enhance health care through data and informatics.\nDr Haendel also spoke about a number of ongoing projects and initiatives that will be leveraged to achieve the goals of the CD2H. Emerging themes and recommendations emanating from this specific research-focused ARO Network Workshop that could improve research processes and serve to better connect research with practice could be summarized as follows.\n\u2022 Plan research with the end in mind and have a robust infrastructure, potentially preceding global clinical research studies with disease-specific registries for sharing data. in planning the study before it starts. Having an infrastructure that supports this planning will facilitate implementation. An initial step that is proving to be very important for the Asia ARO Network, prior to initiating global clinical trials, is to create a registry and begin sharing data in this manner. Harmonization and standards can emerge when registries are combined and/or data are shared through such means; these can then be applied to the design and data collection for clinical research studies.\n\u2022 Globally harmonize and encourage adoption of common standards.\nThe more broadly adopted standards (for data, metadata, models, and terminology), the easier the sharing of data and communication of meaning along with that data. Starting a new standard (especially if it is a one-off or proprietary standard) exacerbates the issues we currently face, creating inefficiencies and increasing costs and resource needs. New standards should be extensions of existing foundational standards and not redundant standards that have already been developed.\n\u2022 Integrate from beginning to end-from basic science to clinical research to health care. This is the premise behind translational medicine, from \"bench to bedside,\" precision medicine, the CD2H initiative, and a number of CTSA initiatives. A number of areas still need to be addressed for this to become a global reality, but acknowledging its value and funding initiatives in this area is an important step.\n\u2022 Address privacy, confidentiality, legal, and other issues around data sharing.\nRecommendations in the CORBEL Consensus Document have paved the way for such issues to be addressed; however, they (especially legal issues) still use excessive time, energy, and resources that could be dedicated to research.\n\u2022 Implement new technologies that are innovative and standardsbased.\nThere is no shortage of new technologies available that could be applied to research. FDA is encouraging their use. However, many still need validation and a way to readily share data in standard formats before they can be widely adopted and applied.\n\u2022 Accommodate RWD to accumulate RWE.\nAs with new technologies, the use of RWD for research remains a challenge. FDA has issued Guidance on this topic, and the 21st\nCentury Cures Act calls for its use. However, the variation and implementation specificity of EHRs and moving target of health care standards around the world have been a significant barrier to obtaining high-quality RWD for research purposes.\n\u2022 Improve and accelerate the sharing process from research to improve clinical care decisions.\nPatients who participate in research studies do so not only for their own benefit but also for the greater good. They expect their data to be used wisely and for learnings to be shared as quickly as possible, not to be trapped in a research silo or lost due to lack of quality or standards. Computable knowledge is essential as is data sharing.\nAccelerating learning health cycles forms the basis for LHSs."}]
