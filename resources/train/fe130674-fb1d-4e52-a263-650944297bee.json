The database includes a system of technology classification and extensive information on patent assignee ownership history-especially important in light of the large number of industry mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs in the last decade. The database was assembled to help science policy researchers understand the dynamic effects of intellectual property protection in emerging areas of technology, but also to provide a useful picture of \"who is doing what\" in agbiotech.

The workshop was hosted by The Food Industry Center of the University of Minnesota. About 50 participants from the food industry, government, the media, and academia shared information on the effects of current consumer trends and nutrition issues on demand for grainbased foods. Participants also discussed how different data sources can contribute to the assessment and monitoring of consumption trends. Presentations by ERS economists addressed U.S. per capita food availability and intake and how intake estimates vary by demographic categories.

A pioneer in the field of agricultural economics, Taylor helped to create the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the predecessor of ERS, and served as its first director. Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, noted international trade economist at Columbia University, delivered the first Taylor Lecture. In his talk, \"In Defense of Globalization,\" Bhagwati shared observations on the outcomes of World Trade Organization negotiations and insights on outsourcing and other related current economic issues. Recognizing that Taylor was also the first leader of the Farm Foundation, the event concluded with a presentation of the Taylor Commemorative Plaque to Bhagwati by current Farm Foundation President Walt Armbruster. A reception followed honoring former leaders of ERS, including Ken Farrell, John Lee, and J.B. Penn. This annual lecture series is designed to promote discourse on contemporary economic issues of interest to agricultural economists within and outside ERS and USDA.

Current research shows that baby boomers are shifting toward rural and small town destinations, but they seem to be attracted to a more diverse set of destinations, compared with older cohorts. Researchers from ERS and Vermont's Middlebury College are conducting a study to gauge the impacts of baby boomer retirement migration on rural and small town America. The study will examine how demographic, natural amenity, housing market, urban proximity, and economic factors affected the migration flows of baby boomers into rural areas during the 1990s. Findings will also help researchers to better predict the future migration patterns of baby boomers over the next 20 years.
