[{"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Farm commodity programs may have encouraged crop production on environmentally sensitive land in the 1970s and early 1980s. Although unintended, farm program incentives to expand production may have increased environmental damage associated with agricultural production and undercut the effectiveness of conservation programs designed to mitigate that damage. Compliance provisions, introduced in the Food Security Act (1985 Farm Act), aim to counteract that influence. In essence, compliance provisions leverage farm program payments for the environment; farmers who want to remain eligible for benefits from selected Federal agricultural programs, including price support loans and income support payments, must implement soil conservation systems on highly erodible land (HEL) and refrain from draining wetlands. The question addressed by this report is to what extent compliance provisions created sufficient incentives to motivate the types of behavioral shifts they were designed to address. In fact, the annual rate of soil erosion on U.S. cropland declined by nearly 40 percent between 1982 and 1997. About a fourth of that decline can be directly attributed to compliance. But that is only part of the story. A large share of cropland erosion reduction occurred on land that was not subject to compliance requirements. Non-HEL cropland accounted for 38 percent of all cropland erosion reduction. This begs the question: How much erosion reduction would have been realized without compliance requirements? Reduced soil erosion on land not subject to compliance suggests that other factors, such as technology, information, and markets, played an important role in triggering large-scale erosion reduction. Conversely, compliance may have acted as a catalyst for change, accelerating the adoption of farming practices-such as conservation tillage-that can conserve soil and save farmers money. Compliance mechanisms have clearly increased consistency between income support and environmental programs. While consistency is an important goal, this report focuses on the broader potential of the compliance mechanism as an agri-environmental policy instrument. Compliance mechanisms may provide the best bang for the buck as a deterrent to environmentally damaging actions such as draining wetlands or bringing new HEL into crop production. Compliance sanctions are triggered only when a violation occurs. In contrast, using conservation payments to achieve these same ends is likely to be difficult or expensive. The difficulty is in deciding which wetlands or noncropped HEL are vulnerable enough to warrant conservation payments. If that is too difficult, policymakers could opt to subsidize protection of a significant share of these environmentally sensitive lands-an expensive alternative, indeed. Compliance incentives have motivated farmers to reduce soil erosion on highly erodible cropland. Between 1982 and1987, excess erosion (any erosion in excess of the maximum level consistent with maintaining soil productivity) on highly erodible cropland fell by 331 million tons annually. Nearly"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The 1985 Food Security Act (FSA) ushered in a new era of U.S. agrienvironmental policy. Although much attention has been focused on largescale, long-term land retirement through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the adoption of compliance mechanisms was an important agrienvironmental policy innovation. In general, compliance mechanisms require farmers to meet some minimum standard of environmental protection on environmentally sensitive land as a condition of eligibility for Federal farm program benefits-principally farm commodity program payments. Coupled with changes in the 1985 FSA that made commodity program participation more attractive to producers, compliance mechanisms have come to play a significant role in U.S. agri-environmental policy. The most recent farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, retained compliance mechanisms with only minor technical revisions. At present, compliance mechanisms address soil conservation on highly erodible land-provisions widely known as \"Conservation Compliance\" and \"Sodbuster\"-and wetland conservation-a provision widely known as \"Swampbuster.\" Conservation Compliance requires producers already cropping highly erodible land (HEL) to implement soil conservation plans or risk losing their Federal farm program benefits (see box, \"Soil Erodibility and Soil Erosion\"). Sodbuster places similar, albeit more stringent, requirements on producers who bring previously uncropped HEL into crop production. Under Swampbuster, producers who convert wetland for crop production can lose Federal farm program benefits. Compliance mechanisms are part of broader strategies for soil conservation and wetland protection. CRP and Conservation Compliance/Sodbuster were enacted in 1985 as part of an overall strategy to conserve soil. Farmers who already cropped HEL could adopt required conservation systems or retire land by enrolling it in the CRP, while Sodbuster was designed to deter farmers from bringing more HEL into crop production. Swampbuster was also one of a number of policy changes designed to stem wetland loss in agriculture. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated tax breaks that encouraged conversion of land to crop production, reducing the incentive to convert both HEL and wetland to crop production, complementing the Sodbuster and Swampbuster provisions of the 1985 FSA. The Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), enacted in 1990, restores and protects previously drained wetlands on agricultural land. Since compliance mechanisms have taken effect, soil erosion on HEL cropland and wetland conversions for agricultural production have declined sharply (Heimlich et al., 1998;Claassen et al., 2000;. Nonetheless, questions about the effectiveness of compliance mechanisms remain: What proportion of overall cropland erosion reduction is actually due to Conservation Compliance? Is Swampbuster actually constraining wetland conversion for agricultural production? Will environmental benefits increase if compliance is extended to address additional environmental problems? In this report, we define compliance mechanisms, discuss their general characteristics, analyze the effectiveness of compliance mechanisms (with particular focus on the role of Conservation Compliance in reducing soil erosion on highly erodible cropland), and discuss the potential for expanding compliance to address nutrient runoff and leaching from land in crop production."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Compliance in U.S. Agricultural Policy/AER-832", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA 15 For filter strips, minimum area depends on two factors. First, the ratio of drainage area to filter strip size depends on the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) Rfactor. For R-factors of 0-35, a fieldto-filter strip area ratio of 70:1 is appropriate, 60:1 is required for R-factors of 35-175, and 50:1 is needed for R-factors greater than 175. Second, filter strips must have a minimum flow length (width) of 30 feet. Depending on the size and shape of the field, this requirement may result in a larger field-to-filter strip area ratio than otherwise required. For more information, see USDA-NRCS, 2002c.  Average annual  95th percentile  average annual  95th percentile   contour grass strips, and other buffer practices. Nationally, continuous signup acres receive an average payment of $92 per acre per year, more than double the average payment for land in general CRP signup ($43 per acre per year) (Barbarika, 2001). Up to 50 percent cost sharing is also provided for practice installation. Cost-share amounts for some common buffer practices include $59 per acre for contour grass strips, $69 for grass filter strips, and $209 for riparian buffers. Because buffer practices generally involve only a small proportion of cropland acres, the overall cost per cropland acre is modest. As an example, consider installation of a grass filter strip. Assume that $92 per acre represents foregone annual returns, per acre establishment costs are twice the average cost share listed above (50 percent of cost is shared in CRP), and 2.5 percent of cropland is needed. Capitalizing forgone revenue at 4 percent, a grass filter strip would cost roughly $2.50 per cropland acre per year. This is well below the average program payment of $15-20 per acre (or more in recent years) on farms with the most serious nutrient loss potential. Wetland restoration could also be used to intercept nitrogen runoff before it contaminates surface water. Ribaudo et al. (2001) compare nitrogen use reduction to wetland restoration strategies for reducing nitrogen flows from the Mississippi Basin to the Gulf of Mexico. For nitrogen runoff reductions of up to 26 percent, they found that reducing nitrogen use was the less expensive strategy, while wetland restoration would be more cost-effective in achieving larger runoff reductions. Wetland restoration can be more expensive than other buffer practices ($50-$800 per wetland acre in the Ribaudo study), in addition to the opportunity cost of ending crop production, and will not be appropriate for all locations. Nonetheless, wetland restoration could play a role in reducing nitrogen runoff to water. Assuming payments will continue indefinitely, compliance could provide sufficient leverage for widespread adoption of either nutrient management to reduce the potential for nutrient loss or conservation buffers to intercept nutrient runoff. While this new compliance requirement could be leveraged with existing program payments, some producers who would be subject to the new requirement are already bearing the cost of existing compliance requirements. Figure 18 shows the potential for overlap between existing compliance requirements and a potential nutrient-related requirement. Map colors indicate land subject to existing compliance requirements-noncropped wetland and highly erodible land (HEL) near existing cropland and HEL cropland-as a proportion of total cropland. The darker the color, the larger the potential impact of existing compliance mechanisms. The dots represent land with high or very high potential for nutrient runoff and leaching-those acres most likely to be affected by a nutrient requirement. The greatest potential for overlap between the potential nutrient requirement and existing compliance requirements appears to be in the Heartland and the Mississippi Portal, particularly northern portions in Arkansas and Tennessee. Significant overlap may also occur in Eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland. In the Corn Belt and Mississippi River Delta, crop production is a predominant agricultural enterprise and related farm program payments are relatively large. In 1997, farm program payments in most counties in these areas averaged more than $23 per acre (represented by the darkest shaded areas in fig. 1). Over the 6-year life of the farm bill, the net present value of a $23 stream of annual payments would be $109.63 per acre. Keep in mind that commodity program payments were relatively low in 1997 and that farm commodity programs are likely to continue past the end of the current farm bill. Meanwhile, regional average costs for soil conservation and nutrient management practices are at or near national averages (see tables 5, 6, and 7). In areas where the overlap is most likely, moreover, nutrient management costs may be lower than the cost of addressing soil erosion. Because the cost of erosion reduction is modest, the combined cost of erosion reduction and nutrient management is unlikely to exceed (or even come close to) the value of farm program payments. In the Mississippi Portal region, the total cost for making a transition to the use of soil conservation practices is larger for each of the most commonly used practices. Potential for overlap between existing compliance requirements and nutrient requirement $19.60. Nonetheless, a new nutrient-related compliance requirement could cause financial stress for some producers. Specific cases of hardship could be addressed through variances (as under existing policy). In Pennsylvania and Maryland, crop production is significant but nutrient problems are more likely to be driven by livestock waste. In most counties in these areas, nitrogen and phosphorus in livestock waste already exceed the assimilative capacity of cropland and pasture land (Kellogg et al., 2000). Farm program payments are not as uniformly high as they are in the Heartland and the Mississippi Portal, so the compliance requirement may be less effective overall. However, recently promulgated Clean Water Act regulations require comprehensive nutrient management on large livestock operations. Also, changes in EQIP eligibility requirements and funding levels will assist livestock producers in reducing environmental damage from excess nutrients. In this context, the compliance requirement may be a useful part of the overall mix of policies designed to reduce nutrient loss to the environment.\n"}, {"section_title": "Soil Erodibility and Soil Erosion", "text": "Largely through compliance mechanisms, U.S. soil conservation policy targets highly erodible land (HEL). HEL is defined as land with an erodibility index (EI) of 8 or larger. The erodibility index is, in turn, defined by the ratio of inherent erodibility to the soil loss tolerance. Inherent erodibility for a given soil is the rate of erosion (tons per acre per year) that would occur on land that was continuously clean-tilled throughout the year. The soil loss tolerance is an estimate of the rate of soil erosion that can occur on a given soil without significant long-term productivity loss. Thus, the erodibility index captures both the propensity of a soil to erode and the potential for damage from erosion. Actual soil erosion, however, reflects a complex interaction of climate, topography, soil characteristics, land use, and land management practices. Actual erosion is typically far less than a soil's inherent erodibility due to ground cover (grass, trees, crops, crop residue) and conservation practices (e.g., terraces or windbreaks) installed by farmers and landowners. While soil erosion is difficult to measure under field conditions, physical process models can be used to predict both inherent erodibility and the average annual rate of soil erosion, given climate, topography, soils, land use, and land management. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE; Wischmeier and Smith, 1978) and, more recently, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE; see http://www.sedlab.olemiss.edu/rusle/overview.html), and the Wind Erosion Equation (WEE; Skidmore and Woodruff, 1968) have been used widely in conservation planning and program implementation. Because average annual erosion rates can be estimated with and without various conservation practices, the models have greatly facilitated policy implementation. Farmers, working with conservation planners, can use physical process models to develop cost-effective conservation systems. These models are used to implement conservation compliance and other USDA conservation programs. Compliance mechanisms can be viewed in two ways. As a method of policy coordination, they can reduce unintended adverse environmental consequences of farm programs. As an agri-environmental policy tool, compliance can be used to further agri-environmental objectives. In this latter role, compliance mechanisms have properties that set them apart from other agrienvironmental policy instruments-especially subsidies designed to encourage good environmental performance-making them useful in situations where subsidies would be difficult or especially costly to use. Program coordination was a key motivation for adoption of compliance provisions in the 1985 Food Security Act (FSA). In the 1970s and early 1980s, evidence suggested that farm commodity programs encouraged production of relatively erosive crops on erosion-prone land, even as conservation programs attempted to mitigate these damages (Reichelderfer, 1985). High commodity prices of the mid-1970s probably spurred the conversion of highly erodible land from pasture or native grass to crop production-a process commonly referred to as sodbusting-although evidence linking this practice with farm commodity programs is limited (Watts et al., 1983;Heimlich, 1986). Likewise, evidence showing that government payments were an important incentive to swampbusting is quite limited (see Heimlich et al., 1998, for a survey), even though the purpose of most wetland drainage has, historically, been to allow or improve crop production (Dahl, 1990). Even if government payments are not a critical underlying motivation for agricultural production on HEL or wetland, linking payments with compliance requirements can encourage improved environmental performance and deter producers from expanding crop production onto environmentally sensitive land. Withholding payments on the entire farm, rather than only on acres in violation of a compliance requirement, makes the potential sanction quite serious for many farms. Compliance is a unique policy tool that is not easily placed in traditional categories of subsidy, tax, or regulation (Heimlich and Claassen, 1998a). Compliance mechanisms are similar in some ways to both environmental regulation and environmental taxes, but bear little resemblance to environmental subsidies. Like regulation, compliance mechanisms prescribe limits on producer actions and provide for penalties (loss of farm program benefits in the case of noncompliance). Like taxes and fees, however, violation does not imply illegal activity and maximum penalties are limited and known in advance. Unlike an environmental subsidy program (e.g., EQIP 1 ), producers do not receive a benefit in exchange for taking an action that enhances (or is designed to enhance) environmental performance. Instead, they are penalized, through withholding of benefits from otherwise unrelated programs, when an environmental standard is not achieved. One could argue that programs with a compliance requirement actually seek a \"bundle\" of benefits including environmental protection. However, there is no evidence to suggest that commodity program design is influenced by the potential for environmental benefits through compliance. Thus, the economic properties of compliance mechanisms are quite different from those of a classic environmental subsidy program. In general, compliance mechanisms are not subject to some of the problems that can arise with the use of environmental subsidies. For example, poorly designed subsidies for environmental improvement can encourage producers to continue or expand crop production where it would not otherwise be profitable, sometimes undercutting environmental gains (see Claassen et al., 2001, for a full discussion). Moreover, compliance mechanisms do not require subsidy payments in addition to those already in place through price and income support or other programs. 2 Note, however, that the effective level of income support provided to complying producers is reduced by the cost of complying with soil and wetland conservation requirements. These farm commodity programs provide much of the underlying incentive for producers to comply. Compliance mechanisms may be particularly well suited to deter certain environmentally damaging actions. For example, a hypothetical subsidy program designed to prevent wetland drainage would require policymakers to pay for protection of all wetlands on agricultural land-a potentially expensive proposition-or decide which wetlands are sufficiently vulnerable to agricultural conversion as to warrant protection-a potentially difficult task (Heimlich and Claassen, 1998b). In contrast, Swampbuster penalties are assessed when a violation occurs, eliminating the need for broad-based subsidies or the need to anticipate the potential for a violation to occur on any given wetland. No direct costs are imposed on producers, although there may be an opportunity cost associated with production forgone on wetlands that would otherwise have been converted to crop production. The success of compliance mechanisms depends on the commodity programs that provide most of the compliance incentive. Farm commodity programs have been in place for more than 65 years and their benefits have been largely capitalized into the value of farmland (Goodwin et al., 2003;Ryan et al., 2001;Barnard et al., 1997;Duffy et al., 1994). 3 For many producers, the ability to purchase land or pay cash rent depends significantly on government payments. In addition to introducing compliance mechanisms, the 1985 FSA shifted the emphasis of commodity programs from price support to income support. With a market price support program, farmers could benefit from farm programs without direct participation (sometimes referred to as \"free riding\"). With income support payments, producers must participate to receive benefits. Consequently, many producers may feel that they 1 Through EQIP, the Federal Government shares the cost of installing or adopting conservation practices that address key resource concerns. 2 The Government does bear some cost for existing compliance programs. USDA provides conservation planning and technical assistance to producers without charge. Effective monitoring and enforcement by USDA can also be costly. These costs, however, are not specific to compliance mechanisms. They would generally be incurred with the implementation of other types of agri-environmental programs as well. have little choice but to accept compliance requirements, even though, strictly speaking, participation in these programs is voluntary and producers could opt out to avoid compliance requirements. The 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act ended annual acreage setaside programs, reducing the cost of program participation and increasing the compliance incentive. Although working within the context of existing programs has some advantages over a subsidy mechanism, it also limits the potential effectiveness of compliance mechanisms. Unlike an environmental subsidy program or regulation, the design of compliance mechanisms is, by definition, constrained by the existence and design of other farm programs. In other words, the scope and features of other farm programs largely determine how effective a compliance mechanism can be. In designing a compliance mechanism, policymakers can determine: \u2022 the environmental objective(s); \u2022 minimum standards of environmental performance or practice implementation; \u2022 the programs and payments that are subject to the compliance sanction. But the effectiveness of compliance mechanisms will also depend on other factors related to commodity programs and the agri-environmental problems targeted by compliance. These include: \u2022 whether targeted environmental problems occur largely on farms that participate in Federal farm programs subject to compliance; \u2022 the producer's net benefit from farm program participation before the compliance requirement; \u2022 the producer's cost of meeting the compliance standard or requirement. In other words, the effectiveness of compliance mechanisms-relative to other agri-environmental policy tools-depends largely on the size and spatial distribution of government payments relative to the spatial distribution of targeted agri-environmental problems and the costs involved in mitigating those problems. Given the configuration of current farm programs, compliance mechanisms have the potential to address many cropland-based conservation and environmental problems. Data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) show that farms receiving some type of government payment accounted for 86 percent of U.S. cropland. Other environmental issues, such as livestock waste management and disposal problems, occur more frequently on farms that do not participate in current farm programs and, thus, are less likely candidates for compliance mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "Compliance Objectives and Standards", "text": "The objectives of the Highly Erodible Land Conservation provision are to maintain soil productivity by maintaining soil depth and to reduce offsite damages due to sediment loads, e.g., to reduce sediment delivered to water bodies. After the 1985 FSA, compliance implementation efforts focused on reducing erosion to the soil loss tolerance (\"T\") level. Developed largely in the 1940s and 1950s, T values were designed to represent the maximum rate of soil erosion consistent with maintaining a given level of soil productivity indefinitely. Before Conservation Compliance plans were devised and implemented on farms, however, several factors prompted movement away from the T standard. First, there were unresolved questions about the scientific validity of the T value. By the 1970s, the scientific basis for T values was widely recognized as weak, yet efforts to adjust T values to reflect higher erosion loss tolerance in some soils were unsuccessful (Cook, 1982). Alternate methods of assessing the potential for erosion productivity damage had been developed (see Pierce et al.) but were not used by USDA in establishing compliance requirements. Second, it became apparent that reducing soil erosion to the T level would be costly on some soils. By 1987, USDA had determined that reducing erosion to T or even 2T might be so costly that crop production would no longer be profitable on a great deal of highly erodible land (Canning, 1994). Finally, policymakers increasingly recognized the offsite damage associated with sediment (which is unrelated to T). Offsite damages can be substantial and are often larger than onsite damages (see Ribaudo, 1989;Ribaudo et al., 1990;Feather et al., 1999). Ultimately, Conservation Compliance was implemented to consider both soil erosion and the cost of erosion reduction, without a fixed erosion standard. Where erosion could be reduced to the T level without making crop production unprofitable, producers were required to develop \"basic\" conservation plans (which reduce erosion to T). Where reducing erosion to T was more costly, producers were allowed to develop \"alternative\" conservation systems. Alternative conservation systems require the application of soil conservation practices that are technically and economically feasible in a given local area and achieve \"significant\" erosion reduction. However, producers are not required to reduce erosion to T or any other specific level. Some alternative systems allowed erosion to remain at 2T or even higher levels. This focus on local conditions and site-by-site development of conservation plans allowed conservation systems to be tailored to climate, soils, cropping patterns, and the producer's management skills, leading to a broad array of approved conservation systems. USDA data show that more than 1,600 distinct conservation systems have been approved. Although 51 percent use only conservation cropping sequences, conservation tillage, crop residue use, or some combination of these three practices (table 1), this flexibility probably resulted in more erosion reduction per dollar of cost than could have been achieved using a more prescriptive approach that relied on a few standard practices. The use of alternative conservation systems is limited to HEL that was cropped during 1981-85. On HEL not previously cropped-i.e., sodbusted land-producers must use conservation systems that hold erosion to T, regardless of cost. In 1996, USDA tightened standards for alternative conservation systems developed after July 3, 1996. First, alternative systems must reduce erosion by at least 75 percent of potential erosion 4 and planned erosion cannot exceed 2T (USDA-NRCS, 1996). An exception is made for land returning to crop production from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), where compliance requirements cannot exceed those in force when the land entered the CRP. Second, for HEL not cropped during 1981-85, conservation systems must hold soil erosion to no more than the soil loss tolerance level (T) and prevent a \"substantial increase\" in erosion, defined as 25 percent of potential erosion (USDA-NRCS, 1996). Wetland Conservation provisions, widely known as Swampbuster, are designed to protect wetland functions and values by preserving existing wetlands. 5 Wetland values and functions include wildlife habitat, water purification, groundwater recharge, and mitigation of flood peaks. To comply with Swampbuster, producers must refrain from altering wetlands to make agricultural production possible. In keeping with the focus on wetland functions and values, however, the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act allows some flexibility to alter some small areas of wetland if certain conditions are met. Producers are exempted from the sanction if: \u2022 wetland conversion will have a minimal effect on overall wetland functions and values;   Compliance requirements are continued in the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment (FSRI) Act with only minor, technical changes. Changes in commodity and conservation programs, however, may affect producers' incentives to participate in Federal farm programs and, therefore, meet compliance requirements. Spending on commodity and conservation programs is projected to increase by 80 percent (compared with continuing current programs), according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates. However, much of the increase in commodity program spending will replace ad hoc \"market loss assistance\" payments provided to producers annually by Congress for the 1998-2001 seasons. Thus, a majority of new funds authorized directly in the FSRI Act will go to producers of traditional program crops: corn, wheat, cotton, rice, sorghum, oats, and barley. Ad hoc disaster assistance, which has been authorized by Congress frequently in recent years, may be distributed somewhat differently, but is likely to augment commodity program spending mandated by the 2002 FSRI Act. A modest amount of new spending will be used to extend commodity program payments to crops not previously eligible for these subsidies. For the first time, producers of soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts will be eligible for direct payments. Soybean and other oilseed producers were already eligible for price support loans. Price support loans will also be extended to producers of peanuts, wool, mohair, honey, small chickpeas, lentils, and dry peas. Whether these program extensions will expand the reach of compliance depends on (1) the acreage devoted to these crops and (2) whether farms producing them are already subject to compliance through production of other program crops. Analysis of Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data in conjunction with the National Resources Inventory (NRI) indicates that peanuts, wool, mohair, honey, small chickpeas, lentils, and dry peas are produced by more than 35,000 farms that encompass more than 8 million acres of highly erodible cropland. Nearly all of these farms, however, already receive Federal farm program payments based on other crops. We estimate that fewer than 5,000 farms encompassing less than 500,000 highly erodible cropland acres could come under compliance requirements for the first time. Thus, program expansion can be expected to have little, if any, effect on the reach or overall effectiveness of conservation compliance (or other compliance mechanisms). Conservation program spending is also projected to increase by 80 percent. Over the 6-year life of the 2002 FSRI Act, the CBO projects conservation spending of $20.9 billion. The largest increases are for \"working land\" conservation programs, i.e., programs that support good conservation practices on land in agricultural production. Key working land programs include the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the newly formulated Conservation Security Program (CSP). Authorized funding was also increased for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), and a range of other conservation and environmental programs. Because these programs are open to all producers-not just producers of certain crops-and can address a wide range of agri-environmental problems, the extent to which expansion of these programs could extend compliance requirements is unknown. subject to compliance in the 1996 Act and is not currently subject to compliance requirements. Eligibility for Federal agriculture-related loans or loan guarantees (e.g., price support loans and farm credit loans) can also be denied (table 3). Unlike direct payments, the actual benefit received by producers is less than that indicated by the program level. While the program level is the total amount available for direct loans or loan guarantees, most direct loans and loans covered by a guarantee are, in fact, repaid. Producer subsidies come in the form of lower interest rates than would otherwise be available. For example, direct government loans (e.g., price support loans) are often provided at rates lower than are commercially available. Other loan and loan guarantee programs provide credit or assistance in obtaining credit for farmers who cannot afford commercially available credit. The effectiveness of compliance depends critically on the spatial distribution of payments relative to the environmental problems addressed through compliance mechanisms. Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of key commodity program payments for the 1998 crop year: Production Flexibility Contract (PFC) payments, Market Loss Assistance (MLA) payments, and Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs). 7 These payments are concentrated in the Corn Belt, the Plains States, and the Mississippi Deltaareas that account for roughly two-thirds of U.S. cropland. Although the total amount of these payments has varied from year to year, we assume that the spatial distribution of these payments does not change significantly from year to year because it depends largely on the spatial distribution of base acres. 8 Our assumption is consistent with the USDA baseline, which assumes ongoing funding for income support tied to base acreage. Ad hoc disaster payments, approved by Congress on an annual basis, could shift the distribution of overall payments if a significant share of ad hoc payments goes to farmers who are not clients of the traditional farm commodity programs. Recent history suggests, however, that these payments will augment, not replace, more traditional farm income support payments.  "}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Conservation Compliance", "text": "According to USDA's annual Conservation Compliance Status Review (CSR), overall compliance with Conservation Compliance provisions is high. Based on the 1997 CSR data (the year matching the most recent National Resources Inventory, which we use extensively in the analysis that follows), 95.9 percent of producers subject to compliance were actively applying approved conservation systems. In more recent years, the CSR has shown compliance rates of roughly 98 percent. The 1997 data also indicate that the distribution of HEL cropland by erosion rate has shifted dramatically to lower erosion rates ( fig. 2). In other words, the rate of soil erosion has declined significantly on most HEL cropland acres subject to compliance. A recent General Accounting Office (GAO) study, however, identifies deficiencies in the CSR that cast some doubt on NRCS compliance estimates (see box, \"Enforcement: The Compliance Status Review\"). GAO criticized the CSR on the selection of the review sample, a lack of consistency and clarity in the guidance provided to local offices, data handling and analysis, failure to cite producers for significant deficiencies, and inadequate justification for waiver of penalties. We take an alternate approach, using existing datasets not created for the express purpose of evaluating compliance mechanisms in an attempt to determine the overall effectiveness of compliance in reducing erosion on HEL cropland. It is clear that erosion has been reduced on land subject to compliance-even if the magnitude of those reductions is somewhat in doubt. Even so, a broader look at soil erosion reduction provides context for evaluating the overall role of Conservation Compliance in achieving those reductions. Specifically, what is the extent of erosion reduction that can be directly attributed to Conservation Compliance? Has soil erosion been reduced more on land subject to compliance than on land not subject to compliance? We analyze these questions using a two-step process. First, we analyze overall erosion reduction using data from the 1997 and previous National Resources Inventories (NRI). (See box, \"Conservation Compliance and NRI Point Data\"). The NRI contains data on HEL cropland and changes in annual erosion over time but, with the exception of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), do not specify whether a specific tract is enrolled in a government program. We use NRI data to estimate the amount of erosion reduction that could be directly attributed to compliance, if it occurred on land in a farm receiving payments subject to compliance. In other words, we believe that reduction in \"excess\" erosion (erosion exceeding T) on HEL that was cropped in both 1982 and 1997, if it occurred on a farm receiving payments subject to compliance, is the best estimate of erosion reduction that could be directly attributed to Conservation Compliance. We exclude erosion reduction below the T level on HEL cropland because it was not required by Conservation Compliance. We note, however, that the discrete nature of conservation practices may have resulted in the development of Conservation Compliance systems with erosion rates of less than T. Moreover, because compliance requirements were designed to allow HEL cropland to remain in crop production, we exclude erosion reduction due to land-use change. No erosion reduction would have been required on HEL cropland with a pre-compliance erosion rate equal to or less than T. Erosion reduction on non-HEL cropland is clearly not subject to compliance. In 2001, a total of 17,723 tracts were reviewed, including about 4.9 million acres (from NRI we estimate that there are about 330 million acres of cropland and 104 million acres of HEL cropland). Of the total tracts, 13,552 were identified through random sampling of the national database, while 4,171 were added by States. The CSR summary prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) shows 98 percent of reviewed tracts and 98.9 percent of reviewed acres in compliance with HELC requirements. Of that total, roughly 3 percent were in compliance, but were complying with a variance, condition, or exception. For example, variances can be granted for personal hardship or unusual weather-related factors that made it impossible to carry out the plan. Potential WC violations were found in 0.7 percent of tracts reviewed. These results are consistent with previous compliance reviews that showed HELC compliance of 97-98 percent. A recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report, Agricultural Conservation: USDA Needs to Better Ensure Protection of Highly Erodible Croplands and Wetlands, identified a variety of deficiencies in the CSR that \"make questionable USDA's claim that 98 percent of the Nation's cropland tracts subject to the conservation provisions are in compliance\" (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2003). GAO criticized USDA's CSR on a variety of issues, including methods used to select the review sample, consistency and clarity of guidance provided to local offices, data handling and analysis, failure to cite producers for significant deficiencies, and inadequate justification for waiver of penalties. For example, one issue raised by the GAO report is the inclusion in the CSR of many tracts that do not require a compliance plan. In the 2001 CSR, 33 percent of the tracts reviewed did not require conservation plans. Often, these tracts were permanent pasture or rangeland, yet these tracts are included as in compliance with HELC and WC provisions. If these tracts are removed from the CSR data, the overall compliance rate drops to 92.8 percent. Deficiencies in the CSR identified by GAO do not necessarily imply that HELC provisions have been ineffective in reducing soil erosion on highly erodible cropland. Even if better enforcement could increase erosion reductions and associated environmental benefits, erosion reductions due to compliance may have been significant. The uncertainty suggests the importance of improved evaluation of conservation compliance. Second, we combine NRI data with data on farms whose operators responded to the 1997 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Combining these data sets allows us to: \u2022 gauge the proportion of HEL cropland located on farms that receive payments subject to compliance; \u2022 estimate the distribution of payments over HEL cropland acres; and \u2022 calculate the reduction in excess erosion (erosion exceeding T) on HEL that was cropped in both 1982 and 1997 on farms with and without government payments. "}, {"section_title": "Compliance Requirements and NRI Point Data", "text": "The National Resources Inventory (NRI) is a sample of roughly 1.3 million points of land throughout the United States. For each point, NRI provides a wealth of data on land use and land condition. Typically, the NRI contains data for three points of land within each primary sampling unit (PSU), which is usually a 40-acre tract. Because the characteristics of land vary continuously, sampling at discrete points allows single-valued measures of land use, soil type, topography, etc. When appropriately weighted, the point data can be aggregated to produce estimates of land use, soil erosion, etc. Compliance requirements, however, are determined on a field-by-field basis. To be subject to compliance, a field must be made up predominately of highly erodible soils. If a field is designated as highly erodible land (HEL), conservation requirements apply to the entire field, not just the highly erodible portion of the field. Field boundaries are carefully defined to make it difficult for producers to redefine fields to avoid compliance requirements. Using point-based data from NRI to analyze a field-based program like Conservation Compliance may lead to some estimation errors. Some NRI points of HEL may fall in fields that are not predominately HEL and, therefore, not subject to compliance requirements. Any reduction in excess erosion at these points could be incorrectly included in our estimate of soil erosion reduction that could be attributed to Conservation Compliance. Likewise, NRI points of non-HEL land may be located in fields that are predominately HEL and, therefore, could be incorrectly excluded from our estimate of soil erosion that can be attributed to Conservation Compliance. Because the spatial relationship between field boundaries and NRI points is unknown, it is impossible to accurately assess the level of error introduced by this difference in program implementation and data collection. The errors may, to some extent, offset one another because some points that should be included are excluded and vice versa. conservation tillage may have reduced costs for some producers, prompting its use on non-HEL cropland as well. Even though compliance requirements were designed to keep compliance costs low, some producers may have opted to convert land to grass or forest to avoid these costs. The extent to which these erosion reductions can be attributed to compliance is unknown. There is also evidence to suggest Sodbuster sanctions may have deterred some producers from initiating crop production on HEL not previously cropped. Unlike Conservation Compliance, Sodbuster requires that producers apply basic conservation systems-which achieve the T standard-on previously uncropped land, regardless of cost. Claassen et al. (2000) show that, depending on the level of commodity price expectations, between 7 and 14 million HEL acres that were not cropped in 1992 are located near existing cropland and have inherent soil productivity high enough to make crop production profitable in the absence of Sodbuster."}, {"section_title": "Erosion Reduction and Farm Program Participation", "text": "Soil erosion reduction that could be directly attributed to Conservation Compliance is the reduction in excess erosion on HEL that was cropped in both 1982 and 1997 (331 million tons) and is located on farms that receive government payments. A simple overlay of HEL cropland data with data on government payments suggests that most HEL cropland is located in areas with at least a moderate level of government payments ( fig. 4). In this section, we go beyond the simple overlay to estimate the number of HEL acres on farms with and without government payments, as well as the reduction in excess erosion on farms with and without payments. To provide an estimate of the overlap between farms receiving government payments and HEL cropland, we combined environmental and resource data    "}, {"section_title": "Type of erosion reduction", "text": "Source: ERS analysis of 1997 NRI and 1997 ARMS data. from the NRI with production and financial data (including data on government payments received) from ARMS (see Appendix 1). This analysis defines government payments as farm commodity program payments, disaster payments, and conservation payments from the CRP, WRP, and EQIP. These payments account for roughly 98 percent of direct payments potentially subject to compliance mechanisms. We use 1997 payments to match available environmental data from the 1997 NRI. Although total payments subject to compliance have been much higher in years since 1997, their spatial distribution has remained relatively constant over these years. We estimate that more than 83 percent of HEL cropland is located on farms that receive farm commodity program, disaster, or conservation payments ( fig. 5). Of cropland that is highly erodible due to wind, 92 percent is located on farms receiving payments, while about 75 percent of cropland that is highly erodible due to water is located on farms receiving payments. Results vary across regions 10 ( fig. 6) and farm types ( fig. 7). HEL cropland on farms not receiving payments is estimated to account for more than 50 percent of HEL acreage in only two regions-the Eastern Uplands and Southern Seaboard-regions with a high proportion of livestock-oriented farms. In other regions, 65-95 percent of HEL cropland is estimated to be located on farms that receive payments.  Distribution of commodity program payments and highly erodible cropland, 1998 Highly erodible cropland on farms receiving and not receiving payments, by ERS Farm Resource Region, 1997 Highly erodible cropland acres on farms receiving and not receiving payments, by commodity specialization, 1997 payments go to farms that have little or no HEL cropland, while many farms with large acreage of HEL cropland receive relatively modest government payments. We estimate that roughly 28 percent of HEL cropland is located on farms that received total government payments of less than $15 per HEL acre in 1997, and nearly 50 percent is on farms that received less than $30 per HEL acre ( fig. 9). Note, once again, that payments have been higher in more recent years (table 2). Low violation rates imply that most producers who received only modest payments are fulfilling Compliance requirements. If true, the net benefit of program participation to these producers exceeds the cost of compliance, whatever the level of payments per HEL acre. We estimate that reduction in excess wind and water erosion on land cropped in both 1982 and 1997 has been larger on farms receiving payments than on farms not receiving payments ( fig. 10). For wind erosion, the difference is large. Excess wind erosion declined by 30.7 percent on farms receiving payments while declining only 14.2 percent on farms not receiving payments. For water erosion, the difference is somewhat smaller. Excess water erosion dropped by 46.7 percent on HEL cropland on farms receiving payments while the decrease was 40.5 percent on farms not receiving payments. Overall, an erosion reduction of 294.6 million tons per year could be directly attributed to Conservation Compliance-about 89 percent of the 331 million tons of excess erosion reduction on HEL cropland cropped in 1982 and 1997 and 25 percent of all erosion reduction ( fig. 3). In summary, cropland erosion reduction between 1982 and 1997 was widespread. Erosion was reduced on land that is clearly not subject to compliance (e.g., non-HEL cropland) as well as land that probably is. About 89 percent of the reduction in excess erosion on HEL cropped in both 1982 and 1997-land subject to compliance-occurred on farms receiving payments, which accounted for roughly 83 percent of all HEL cropland. The difference was much greater for wind-erodible soils than for water-erodible soils. Substantial water quality, air quality, and soil productivity benefits are likely to have resulted from these erosion reductions (Canning, 1994;Hyberg, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Compliance Costs", "text": "The above analysis suggests that many producers are in compliance even though program benefits per acre of HEL cropland are modest for some farms. This result is not surprising, because a flexible standard helped to keep costs low. The result also suggests that practices that are widely used in compliance systems are inexpensive. More than half of all conservation systems are some combination of conservation tillage, conservation cropping, and seasonal crop residue management. Conservation tillage systems leave at least 30 percent of the soil surface covered with crop residue at planting time. While conservation tillage systems have the potential to reduce production costs, the evidence is mixed-labor, fuel, and capital costs may decline while herbicide or fertilizer costs may increase in many situations (Sandretto, 1997). Climate and soil conditions also play a role. Soils that are not tilled or tilled less may warm up and dry out more slowly than with conventional tillage. McBride (1999) notes that perbushel cost advantages to conservation tillage in corn may be greatest in the Environmental Compliance in U.S. Agricultural Policy/AER-832 Economic Research Service/USDA    Plains States where reduced tillage can conserve moisture and help boost yields. Wet, cold conditions can lead to emergence problems and slow earlyseason plant growth, which can reduce yields (Griffith et al., 1988). Seasonal crop residue management differs from conservation tillage in that the seedbed is clean-tilled, but the previous year's crop residue is allowed to remain on the surface longer to protect the soil. Tillage costs are not reduced, but the period available for tillage is decreased, increasing the potential for delayed planting due to weather. Conservation cropping may include production of less profitable crops or the cost of establishing cover crops for a portion of the season. One source of national data on the potential cost of conservation practices is the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) database. EQIP payments do not directly represent estimates of cost. Payments indicate what some producers were willing to accept to implement land management conservation practices. Since EQIP is a voluntary program, we assume that payments cover at least the producer's cost, less any potential benefit that the producer can capture (e.g., lower fertilizer costs under nutrient management). For structural practices, such as filter strips, the payment is a costshare (up to 75 percent in EQIP). For land management practices typical in Conservation Compliance systems, the EQIP payment could exceed producer costs. Incentive payments are provided for up to 3 years to smooth the transition to new production practices. Nationally, the average incentive payment for producers adopting conservation cropping is $6.82 per acre annually for 3 years, and 95 percent of enrolled producers received $10.00 or less per acre annually for 3 years. Because incentive payments last only 3 years, we assume that the net present value of the payments covers the cost of practice adoption. Using a 4percent rate of discount, the net present value (NPV) of 3 years worth of the average conservation cropping payment would be $18.92, while 95 percent of producers would receive payments with a NPV of less than $27.75 ( per-acre annual payment, made over a 6-year period, would be $78.75. Moreover, producers may expect that income support payments will be extended indefinitely. The NPV of a $15-per-acre annual payment over 20 years would be $204-more than enough to leverage the adoption of one or more conservation practices. As expected, the cost of complying (as measured by willingness to accept EQIP payments) is generally lower than the benefits of farm program participation (the value of program payments). Actual costs are unlikely to be higher than producer willingness to accept but can be lower. These findings are consistent with a high rate of compliance. Low costs may also help explain the fact that, for the period analyzed, erosion reduction was widespread, occurring on land that is not subject to compliance, as well as land that is."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Swampbuster", "text": "Unlike highly erodible land conservation, wetland conservation provisions interact significantly with both Federal and State regulatory requirements and apply largely to land that is not currently in crop production. We focus our analysis on the potential for wetland conversion without Swampbuster sanctions and on the implication of changing Federal wetland regulations. Roughly 92 million acres of wetland are potentially subject to Swampbuster (Claassen et al., 1998). Between 1986 and 1997, a total of 26,597 acres of wetland were drained in violation of Swampbuster by 1,136 producers     resulting in the loss of $12.3 million in Federal farm program benefits (Claassen et al., 2000). In recent decades, wetland conversion for agricultural production has decreased steadily, a trend older than Swampbuster (1985) or the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Conversion of wetland for crop production averaged 593,000 acres per year in 1954-74 (Frayer et al., 1983), dropping to 235,000 acres for 1974-84 (Dahl and Johnson, 1991), 31,000 acres per year between 1982 and 1992, and 26,000 acres per year between 1992 and 1997 (USDA-NRCS, 2002a). Evidence on the role of policy change in reducing wetland conversion for agriculture is mixed (see Heimlich et al.,1998, for a full survey). Swampbuster penalties will constrain wetland conversion only when: (1) wetlands are located on farms that participate in Federal programs subject to Swampbuster; (2) those wetlands could be profitably converted to crop production in the absence of Swampbuster; and (3) other policies (e.g., Section 404 of the Clean Water Act) are not applicable or not effective in deterring wetland conversion. First, Swampbuster will constrain wetland conversion only if wetlands are located on farms that receive government payments. The spatial distribution of government payments and wetland acreage subject to Swampbuster, shown in figure 11, suggests that many wetlands are located in areas that receive only modest payments per cropland acre. Many of these wetlands, however, are located in remote areas and are unlikely to be converted to cropland because they cannot be easily incorporated into an existing farm-  ing operation. We estimate that only 12.9 million wetland acres are directly adjacent to existing cropland 11 ( fig. 12). As might be expected, these wetlands are much more likely to be located in areas that receive larger government payments, increasing the likelihood that these wetlands are, in fact, located on or near farms that receive government payments."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of commodity program payments and wetlands, 1998", "text": "Of course, the fact that wetlands are adjacent to cropland does not imply that they can be profitably converted to crop production. Some researchers have questioned whether wetland conversion for crop production is profitable even without Swampbuster (Tolman, 1997;Kramer and Shabman, 1993). Profitability depends on a variety of factors, including crop prices and production costs, soil productivity, and the feasibility and cost of land clearing and drainage. Roughly half of all wetlands in the conterminous United States in 1780 have already been drained (Dahl, 1990), and remaining wetlands may be more difficult or expensive to convert or may be less productive once converted. Using more detailed data on the potential productivity of wetland soils, other research suggests that there are wetlands that could be profitably converted to crops in the absence of policy constraints. Assuming that only those wetlands that are adjacent to cropland are vulnerable to conversion, Claassen et al. (2000) estimate that between 1.5 and 3.3 million acres of wetlands have sufficiently high productivity to be converted to crop production, depending on producer price expectations. Also, profitability of crop  production on the converted land is not the only consideration in the decision to drain wetland. Wetlands are sometimes drained to increase the efficiency of field operations on existing cropland by eliminating wetland areas that producers must farm around. Roughly 5 million acres of wetland are dry enough in some years for crop production. Although producers may continue to farm these wetlands in their current condition without violating Swampbuster, these wetlands may be particularly vulnerable to additional drainage that would improve production and make field operation more efficient."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of commodity program payments and wetlands adjacent to existing cropland, 1998", "text": "Even if wetland conversion potential is, in fact, quite modest, these conversions could significantly undercut wetland restoration efforts. By the end of fiscal year 2002, about 1.275 million acres had been restored through the Wetlands Reserve Program (USDA-NRCS, 2002b). Another 1.6 million wetland acres have been restored through the Conservation Reserve Program (USDA-FSA, 2003). Thus, the total USDA wetland restoration effort since 1990 is less than 3 million acres.  (National Wetlands Newsletter, 2001). Known as the migratory bird rule, this rationale has often been used to assert CWA jurisdiction over isolated wetlands. The exact extent of wetlands thus excluded from CWA regulation is yet to be determined and will probably be decided by the courts. A patchwork of State and local regulations continues, but provides little or no wetland protection in many States (Kusler, 2001 "}, {"section_title": "Potential for Extending Compliance: Nutrient Management in Crop Production", "text": "At present, compliance mechanisms are used only to encourage soil and wetland conservation, although agricultural production can result in a wider range of environmental damages (Claassen et al., 2001). In this section, we look at the potential for extending compliance to a third agrienvironmental issue: reducing nutrient runoff and leaching from land in crop production. Runoff and leaching from fertilizer application and animal manure are major sources of remaining U.S. water quality problems (USEPA and USDA, 1998). Nitrogen leaching into groundwater used for drinking can be a health hazard to infants and may pose a cancer risk for adults. Excess nutrients in surface water can lead to eutrophication, reducing the quality of water for recreation and habitat. Eutrophication results from excess algae growth which leads to high concentrations of bacteria (to break down dead algae), which, in turn, leads to accumulation of bacterial waste and oxygen depletion. Water becomes murky and develops an odor. In severe cases, aquatic plants and fish are damaged by the lack of sunlight and oxygen. Nitrate nitrogen is highly soluble and is transported in both ground and surface water. In surface waters, nitrogen can be transported long distances, polluting estuaries throughout the Nation (Bricker et al., 1999). Nitrogen flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, largely from the Mississippi River, is the suspected cause of a large zone of oxygen-depleted (hypoxic) waters (Goolsby, 1999), creating a \"dead zone\" largely devoid of marine life. Phosphorus is far less soluble and is most often transported to water along with sediment (USGS, 1999). Excess phosphorus runoff from agriculture may have contributed to outbreaks of waterborne pathogens, including pfiesteria piscicida (Mlot, 1997). To determine the potential of a compliance mechanism to mitigate runoff and leaching of agricultural nutrients, we consider three key questions: \u2022 To what extent is nutrient application-either commercial fertilizer or manure-to land in crop production a source of nutrient runoff or leaching? \u2022 To what extent do crop producers who have the greatest potential for reducing nutrient runoff and leaching also participate in farm programs? \u2022 Are government payments large enough to encourage broad adoption of practices that could reduce nutrient runoff and leaching?"}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Loss and Crop Producers", "text": "While a comprehensive solution to agricultural nutrient runoff and leaching must involve crop and livestock producers, compliance incentives are largest for farms with a significant area of land in program crop production. Crop producers-regardless of whether they are also livestock producers-will play a central role in managing nutrients and reducing nutrient runoff from agriculture. Available evidence suggests that the application of commercial fertilizer has, in the past, accounted for a significant share of agricultural nutrient runoff and leaching. Thus, crop producers can play a significant role in reducing nutrient runoff and leaching, independent of livestock producers. Moreover, as livestock production becomes increasingly concentrated on large, specialized farms, an increasing proportion of livestock is raised on farms with too little land to spread nutrients at agronomically sound rates (Kellogg et al., 2000), indicating that management of livestock waste will necessarily involve crop producers who do not raise livestock (Ribaudo et al., 2003). In the past, commercial fertilizer has accounted for roughly 90 percent of nitrogen applied in agricultural production. Just over 12 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer was applied in 1997 (Daberkow et al., 2000). Only 1.2 million tons of nitrogen is recoverable from manure nutrients produced on U.S. farms with confined livestock (Gollehon et al., 2001), although not all of these manure nutrients are actually used in crop production. 12 Evidence also suggests that fertilizers are routinely applied in amounts that exceed crop needs. Roughly 70 percent of corn acres and 60 percent of winter wheat and cotton acres had high 13 excess nitrogen balances in 1995, while high excess phosphorus balances were estimated to exist on roughly 40 percent of corn, cotton, and wheat acres (Daberkow et al., 2000). Nutrients applied in excess of or well in advance of crop needs are particularly vulnerable to runoff and leaching. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates also indicate that, in the past, commercial fertilizer has accounted for a significant share of nitrogen runoff to surface water. Fertilizer application accounts, on average, for more than 48 percent of all nitrogen loads to surface water in areas where nitrogen runoff per unit of land area is high (greater than 1,000 kg/km 2 annually) and more than 20 percent, on average, where runoff is low (less than 500 kg/km 2 annually) (Smith et al., 1997). Livestock waste production is estimated to account for 15 and 12 percent of nitrogen reaching surface water in high-and low-runoff areas, respectively. Where nitrogen loads are low, runoff from nonagricultural land is a relatively important source of nitrogen loading (Smith et al., 1997). Phosphorus runoff to surface water is much more likely to be the result of livestock waste or nonagricultural, nonpoint sources. In areas where USGS researchers estimate that phosphorus surface-water concentrations exceed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggested water quality goal of 0.1 mg/L, fertilizer is estimated to account, on average, for 21 percent of phosphorus loading while livestock waste and nonagricultural land are estimated to account for 38 and 33 percent, respectively (Smith et al., 1997). As noted above, however, many cropland acres carry excess phosphorus balances. Thus, non-waste phosphorus management on cropland may still be important to reducing phosphorus damage to surface water, particularly in areas where livestock production is less prevalent and commercial phosphorus fertilizer is applied."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Runoff and Farm Program Participation", "text": "While nutrient application in crop production contributes significantly to the runoff and leaching of nutrients to water, the potential for nutrient loss may vary across producers. 12 While almost all manure is eventually disposed of through landspreading, it is not clear that all recoverable manure nutrients are applied to agricultural land as fertilizer. Increasing concentration in livestock production has resulted in concentrations of animal waste that often exceed the nutrient needs of crops grown on the farm. Manure may be stockpiled for extended periods, in which case much of the recoverable nutrient is lost to the environment. In some cases, transportation costs preclude full utilization of livestock manure as fertilizer (Gollehon et al., 2001;Ribaudo et al., 2003). 13 A \"high\" excess nutrient balance is defined as available nutrients exceeding crop nutrient use by 25 percent or more. runoff potential, we use indices for potential nitrogen runoff, phosphorus runoff, and nitrogen leaching to groundwater developed by Lemunyon and Gilbert (1993), Sharpley et al., (1994) and Gburek et al. (2000). The indices are calculated for each NRI data point using NRI and other data and account for soil factors, climate, and production management decisions that affect runoff and leaching (see Appendix 2). Using these indices, we divided cropland acres into five equal (by land area) categories by overall potential for nitrogen runoff, phosphorus runoff, and nitrogen leaching (we label these very low, low, medium, high, very high). We overlaid data on the 20 percent of cropland acres with very high potential for nitrogen and phosphorus runoff or nitrogen leaching with data on government payments (figs. 13, 14, and 15). Results suggest that acres with the highest potential for nutrient runoff and leaching are located mostly in areas with relatively high government payments. Unlike highly erodible cropland acres, which often occur in more (economically) marginal agricultural areas, nutrient runoff and leaching appear to be most problematic where crop production is the principal agricultural land use and soils are highly productive. Using methods detailed in Appendix 1, we estimate that 75 percent or more of cropland acres with medium, high, or very high potential for phosphorus runoff, nitrogen leaching, or nitrogen runoff are located on farms that receive government payments ( fig. 16) Distribution of commodity program payments and very high nitrogen runoff potential, 1998 Distribution of commodity program payments and very high phosphorus runoff potential, 1998 Distribution of commodity program payments and very high nitrogen leaching potential, 1998 1 dot = 25,000 acres of cropland with very high nitrogen leaching potential exceeds $15 per cropland acre on farms with medium to very high nutrient loss potential for all three nutrient loss indicators, exceeding $20 per acre in several cases ( fig. 17). Thus, farms with the highest nutrient loss potential tend to participate heavily in farm programs and receive larger-than-average per-acre payments. Note, again, that the payment data used in this study are   from 1997, a year of low payments relative to spending in more recent years and projected spending under the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment (FSRI) Act. Whether these payments are large enough to leverage actions that would produce significant reductions in nutrient runoff and leaching depends on the techniques available to reduce nutrient runoff and the cost of implementing them."}, {"section_title": "Reducing Nutrient Runoff: Nutrient Management and Buffer Practices", "text": "Our results to this point suggest that (1) nutrient application by crop producers is a large source of agricultural nutrient runoff and leaching, and (2) producers with medium to very high potential for nutrient loss also participate heavily in farm programs. Next, we consider practices for reducing nutrient runoff and leaching. Are these practices effective and enforceable? Are government payments large enough to encourage widespread adoption if program eligibility was contingent on the application of these practices? One way to reduce nutrient loss from cropland is to encourage crop producers to manage nutrients more carefully. The objective of nutrient management is to match nutrient application rates, timing, and placement to plant needs (accounting for nutrients already available in the soil), thereby minimizing the level of \"excess\" nutrient (nutrient in excess of crop uptake) in the soil at any given time. Excess nutrients are most vulnerable to loss. Nutrient management is actually a collection of practices designed to help farmers match nutrient applications to nutrient needs (e.g., soil testing, split fertilizer application, legume crediting, reasonable yield goals, etc.). Because it is a collection of practices that can be combined in many ways, nutrient management is flexible and can be tailored to each farm's unique circumstances, making it a potentially cost-effective way to reduce excess nutrients in the soil. However, because nutrient application rates, methods, and timing are very difficult to observe, enforcement could be difficult and expensive (Malik, 1993;Malik, 1996, 1998;Johansson, 2002). Nor is it guaranteed that nutrient management will reduce runoff and leaching to levels consistent with significantly improved water quality. If heavy rains fall just after fertilizer application, significant runoff and leaching can still occur, even if application is timed to better coincide with plant needs. A second way to address nutrient runoff is through the use of buffer practices, such as filter strips, grassed waterways, or restored wetlands to intercept nutrients before they leave the field or farm. Buffer practices can remove a substantial proportion of the sediment and nutrients from field runoff. A recent survey article (Dosskey, 2001) shows that, on average, filter strips remove 50-90 percent of nitrogen and phosphorus from runoff. Unlike nutrient management, buffer practices are easily enforceable because their existence and effectiveness are readily observed. Buffers can be more expensive to implement because some cropland is taken out of production, and will be ineffective where nitrogen leaches to ground water or reaches water bodies through subsurface flow."}, {"section_title": "Cost of Nutrient Management 14", "text": "If nutrient management became a condition of eligibility for farm programs, use of nutrient management would increase only if nutrient management costs were lower than the net benefits of farm program participation (prior to the addition of the nutrient management requirement), and if the requirements were effectively enforced. As with soil conservation practices, the cost of nutrient management is likely to vary significantly among producers, and may depend on cropping patterns, soils, climate, management skill, and producers' risk preferences. Nutrient management plans typically include a variety of practices or management decisions that affect the overall amount of nutrient applied, the timing of fertilizer applications, and the method of application. For some producers, nutrient management could lower fertilizer bills. For others, lower fertilizer bills might be more than offset by the cost of soil and plant tissue testing, increased cost of fertilizer application, or increased risk of delayed application that can decrease crop yields. Determining the appropriate level of nutrient application involves testing the soil to determine available nutrients, and, in cases where nutrients are applied to a growing crop (side dressing), other tests (such as plant tissue testing) to determine plant needs. Sample collection and testing can be timeconsuming and costly. Even with soil and plant tissue tests, uncertainty about the relationship between nutrient application and crop yields can expose producers to the risk of low yields as they attempt to match nutrient application to plant needs. Research shows that assumptions about the relationship between nutrient uptake and crop yields can significantly affect calculation of an optimal fertilizer application rate (Grimm et al., 1987;Larsen et al., 1996), possibly leading to overfertilization or lower-than-expected crop yields. Year-to-year variation in growing conditions may also encourage overapplication of nutrients. Because crop nutrient needs are higher in years with good growing conditions, it may be profitable to use more fertilizer in anticipation of getting peak yields in particularly good years (Babcock, 1992;Dai et al., 1993). Timing fertilizer applications to coincide with plant nutrient demand can also expose producers to higher cost and risk. Fertilizer prices tend to be lower in the fall, well in advance of planting (Huang et al., 1994), possibly making fall or early spring application less costly, even if more fertilizer is needed to make up for the runoff and leaching losses. Higher application costs are incurred in the use of \"split\" application, where fertilizer is applied at planting and during the growing season when plant needs are high. Moreover, delaying fertilizer application exposes producers to the risk of weather-related delays when plant needs are high. Some producers may rely on early application to reduce this risk (Huang et al., 1994;Feinerman et al., 1990). Better fertilizer placement can also reduce fertilizer use, but may increase application costs. For example, planter-mounted application attachments allow fertilizer to be placed directly in the root zone, increasing plant uptake. Fertilizer savings, however, must be considered against the cost of additional equipment. Again, we use the EQIP database to provide a sense of the range of potential costs for nutrient management. Bear in mind that EQIP data represent the level of payments some producers were willing to accept (WTA) for undertaking nutrient management-not necessarily the actual out-of-pocket cost of the practices. For some practices, producer WTA may be higher than out-of-pocket costs. For example, the cost of soil sample testing may be small compared with the opportunity cost of the time required to collect soil samples. On the other hand, fertilizer cost savings could offset some portion of these costs. Nationally, EQIP participants adopting nutrient management in crop production received an average of $7.30 per acre, while 95 percent of these producers received $15 or less. Given a 3-year payment period and a 4-percent rate of discount, the net present value (NPV) of the average payment is $19.20 with 95 percent of producers receiving $39.45 or less. By region, the NPV of average incentive payments ranges from $12.82 in the Mississippi Portal, where 95 percent of participants received $14.03 or less, up to an average of $26.80 in the Fruitful Rim, where 95 percent of participants received $55.50 or less (table 7). A $20-per-acre annual commodity program payment would translate into $95 over 6 years and $212 over 20 yearssubstantially more than EQIP participants in any region of the country are willing to accept for undertaking nutrient management."}, {"section_title": "Cost of Buffer Practices", "text": "The term \"buffer practices\" refers to a range of practices that are designed to intercept sediment and nutrients at the edge of the field or farm. For example, practices eligible for continuous signup in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that are particularly relevant for nutrient runoff include riparian buffers, filter strips, grassed waterways, and contour grass strips. The cost of buffer practices may include the establishment of vegetative cover, land shaping, and the retirement of productive cropland, although only a small amount of land is required. In the case of filter strips, for example, only 1-3 percent of the area drained through a filter strip is needed in the filter. 15 One source of information on producers' willingness to accept payment for installing buffer practices is the CRP continuous signup for high-priority practices. High-priority practices include filter strips, grassed waterways,"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Compliance mechanisms were enacted primarily as a method of removing inconsistencies between farm income support and conservation programs.

Because compliance mechanisms depend on other programs, however, their effectiveness is limited. Problems associated largely with program crop production, such as soil erosion and nutrient runoff from fertilizer application, are good candidates for a compliance requirement. The design of the compliance requirement (i.e., environmental standards or practice requirements) will determine the cost and enforceability of the compliance requirement. While USDA's Compliance Status Review process appears to have flaws, it is also likely that compliance rates are high and that significant erosion reduction has been achieved on land subject to Conservation Compliance. Our analysis shows that most highly erodible cropland (HEL), particularly wind-erodible cropland, is located on farms that receive government payments. More important, reduction in excess erosion on HEL cropland-the erosion specifically targeted by Conservation Compliance-has been larger on farms receiving payments (farms subject to compliance) than on farms not receiving payments, particularly for wind-erodible soils. Placing compliance in a larger context, however, we find that soil erosion rates have declined on both HEL and non-HEL cropland, in all regions of the country, and on farms receiving program payments as well as those not receiving program payments. These results could be consistent with more than one hypothesis about the role of Conservation Compliance in reducing soil erosion. Compliance could be viewed as prompting the adoption of soil conservation practices. On the other hand, one could argue that practices like conservation tillage would eventually have been adopted where they are cost-effective, regardless of Conservation Compliance. In other words, the compliance requirement happened to coincide with a period of technical change favorable to soil erosion reduction. Finally, Conservation Compliance may have accelerated the adoption of low-or no-cost practices. For example, conservation tillage may have spread more rapidly in areas where it was shown to be cost-effective by producers who adopted it in response to compliance. Likewise, evidence suggests that Swampbuster was only one factor among several that could have explained the rapid drop in wetland conversion for agricultural production. A dwindling number of easily convertible wetland acres and long-term declines in real prices for agricultural commodities may also be contributing to reductions in wetland drainage for crop production. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, however, Swampbuster may be a more important component of U.S. wetland conservation policy. Extending compliance to address nutrient runoff and leaching from land in crop production, whether through management of nutrient application or interception of nutrients with buffer practices (or both), could provide some additional environmental benefits. Farms where nutrient runoff to water is high are quite likely to receive substantial government payments. Moreover, our analysis shows that the value of government payments will generally exceed the cost of addressing nutrient loss through either nutrient management or buffer practices, suggesting that a compliance mechanism could be effective in leveraging the adoption of practices designed to reduce nutrient runoff. It is important to note that some producers who are already bearing the cost of HEL or wetland conservation requirements are also located in areas where nutrient-related compliance requirements would likely be most significant. Where crop production is predominant (the Heartland and Mississippi Portal regions), farm program payments are also large and would likely provide ample incentive for the additional requirement. Where much of the excess nutrient is generated by livestock production (Pennsylvania and Maryland), compliance alone might be less effective, but could complement other policies designed to reduce nutrient loss to the environment. Regional or national estimates of acreage with specific environmental characteristics (e.g., the number of HEL cropland acres) on farm with payments are calculated as: where \u03b3 k is a zero-one indicator of whether farm k receives farm program payments that would make it subject to conservation compliance; \u0391 k ARMS is the cropland acreage in farm k in Phase III of ARMS; and \u03c1 ik is the value per acre of indicator i in the area where farm k is located. The variable \u03c1 ik is constructed using the surfacing techniques described above. Because farms surveyed in Phase III of ARMS are located only at the county level, values for \u03c1 ik are assigned at the center of the county (the county centroid). This procedure provides estimates that are often quite close to the original NRI estimates. Appendix table 1 provides estimates reported in the text (derived using the procedure detailed above) and estimates derived directly from NRI. National estimates of the extent of land that is highly erodible due to the potential for water (sheet and rill) erosion are extremely close to NRI estimates. Using the ARMS-NRI merged data, we estimate that 55.19 million acres are highly erodible due to water, less than 1 percent higher than the 54.69-million-acre estimate obtained directly from NRI. For wind erosion, the ARMS-NRI merged data indicate 55.54 million acres are highly erodible, about 7 percent higher than the 51.61-million-acre estimate obtained directly from NRI. *T is the soil loss tolerance, the maximum rate of soil loss that can be sustained indefinitely without productivity damage.

On non-highly erodible land, conservation management was considered good if erosion was less than T. The soil hydrologic group was taken from the Soil Interpretive Record (SIR) database associated with the NRI. The runoff estimates were used to classify cropland into five categories of roughly equal size, by acreage. Each of the five groups was then given a score, from lowest to highest, of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0, respectively. The contributing distance or distance to water index score is based on distance to water available in the 1997 NRI database. The values for distance to water were placed into the five groups as described in Heathwaite et al., 2000."}, {"section_title": "Source Factors", "text": "Commercial nitrogen and phosphorus application rates are computed at the county level.
