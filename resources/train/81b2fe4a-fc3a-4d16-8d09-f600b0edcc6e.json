Data sets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Chesapeake Bay Program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources were gathered and assessed. A land cover database was developed and analyzed using geospatial techniques, such as cross tabulation matrices and hot spot density analyses, in order to quantify and locate land cover change between 1984 and 2010. The results highlighted that anthropogenic drivers such as urbanization and agriculture were associated with the loss of wetlands in coastal areas as well as in upland, forested, suburban areas that were at low risk to flooding, but required deforestation in order to expand residential and commercial development. The greatest quantity and percentage of loss occurred between 1992 and 2001, and it was likely the result of increases in tourism and suburban sprawl (e.g., the Housing Boom and roadway expansion). The majority of wetland loss tapered off in 2000, except on coastal areas suffering from sea level rise and shoreline erosion. The results also reinforced the need to address the negative impacts from certain activities related to agriculture and silviculture, which are exempt from Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, have on wetlands. Physical drivers and processes like inundation from sea level rise and soil erosion from surface runoff force communities to simultaneously adapt to multiple drivers of wetland loss and alteration. This study supports the hypothesis that an increase in development and wetland permitting indicates an increased a risk of wetland loss. In the end, the study demonstrates that geostatistical modelling techniques can be used to predict wetland loss, and that model performance and accuracy can be improved by reducing the multicollinearity of independent variables. Planners and policymakers can use these models to better understand the wetland locations that are at greatest risk to loss, as well as the drivers and landscape conditions that have the greatest influence on the probability of wetland loss.

According the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study of historical wetlands between the 1780's and the 1980's, the conterminous U.S. experienced a 53% loss of wetlands and each state that intersected the Chesapeake Bay Watershed experienced an average of loss of 50% wetland coverage (Dahl, 1990;NOAA, 2013). Today, wetlands represent approximately 28% of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (NOAA, 2012;Tiner, 1987). Tidal and non-tidal wetlands fill a crucial role. According to the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI), Delmarva's inland wetlands intercept, and filter sediments and nutrient loads, detain and store flood water, serve as groundwater discharge areas, and provide food and habitat for endangered species like the Delmarva fox squirrel (Chase et al., 2003;Hartmann & Goldstein 1994;Tablante et al., 2002;Wilson et al., 2007). Over the past 200 years, the Peninsula has lost over 2.1 million acres of wetlands (open water and inland) due to dredging, channelization, draining and filling, and ponding (Dahl, 1990(Dahl, , 2000Tiner & Finn, 1986). The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines wetlands as \"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas (Clean Water Act of 1972, 40 CFR 232.2(r)). Wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula consist of tidal and non-tidal wetlands. Tidal wetlands sit on the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Chesapeake Bay, and have been shown to be responsive to changes in inundation frequency and magnitude (Baldwin et al., 2012;Boesch, 2006;Sharpe & Baldwin, 2009). Non-tidal wetlands generally include those that sit on the floodplains of rivers and streams, geographically isolated depressions, and other low-lying inlands and are susceptible to draining, filling, nutrient runoff, groundwater interception, and soil saturation (Bachman et al., 1998;Rogers & McCarty, 2000). Historically, wetlands in the United States have been viewed as a natural resource that is resilient to changes in climate, land use, and land cover. Until the mid-20 th century, wetlands in the U.S. were viewed as having a negative, derogatory connotation. Thus wetlands were overtly drained, filled, and dredged to complement demands for agriculture, nautical transportation, and commercialization, without joint, regional, comprehensive plans from federal, state, and local governments to prevent and mitigate wetland loss with the implementation of policies related to wetland preservation and restoration (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). Over time, intense urbanization agricultural cultivation, intensification in the magnitude of hurricane/storm events, sea level rise, and subsequent pollution and sediment discharges have greatly decreased the area and functionality of wetlands in the Bay watershed. Because of wetland loss, federal and state agencies collaborated to create methods of evaluating wetland health and functionality, tracking the anthropogenic activities that alter wetlands, and forecasting areas (on multiple spatial scales) that are vulnerable to wetland loss (Boesch, 2006;Daniels et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Physical Processes Linked to Wetland Loss", "text": "Physical drivers of wetland loss, like climate change, pose an imminent threat to wetlands (Klemas, 2007;Makkeasorn et al., 2009). Sea level rise and hurricanes have led to long term inundation and extended exposure of non-adapted wetland vegetation to saline conditions, which have resulted in wetland loss (Carlisle et al., 2006;Najjar et al., 2000). One mechanism by which wetlands become vulnerable and eventually converted to open water is inundation, which results from a net loss of surface elevation and rates of sediment deposition relative to rates of sea level rise (Morris, 2002;Cahoon et al., 2011). Tidal inundation levels and storm surge levels have been monitored to diagnose the impact of sea level rise and storms on the distribution of wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula. Dieback of estuarine, palustrine and riverine wetland vegetation and subsequent wetland loss have been linked to increases in tidal inundation, increases in anaerobic conditions, and increases in soil salinity from droughts and long periods of high temperatures (Crowell et al., 2011;Hicks et al., 1983;Kearney et al., 2002;Kearney & Stevenson, 1991;Pilkey, 2002;Stevenson et al., 2002). Nontidal and inland wetland losses have occurred primarily due to agricultural cultivation, deforestation, human-induced freshwater pond and lake construction, channelization, and urban development (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Tiner, 1987). The quality and sustainability of inland forested and shrub wetlands has been degraded due to discharge of nutrients, herbicides and pesticides, chemicals from industries, and domestic and animal waste from sewage and septic systems (Tiner, 1987;NRC, 2001; Stanhope et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic Drivers of Wetland Loss", "text": "A consensus exists among the scientific community, academia, and policymakers that there is a clear linkage between human-induced land use and land cover change and wetland loss in the Chesapeake Bay region (Tiner, 1995;Weller et al., 2007). Stressors in the Delmarva Peninsula have included agriculture, urbanization, and transportation infrastructure. Numerous studies support the concept that land cover/land use change directly affect wetland loss in the Chesapeake Bay as well as on the Delmarva Peninsula (Brooks et al., 2004;Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Kearney & Rogers, 2010;Mayer & Lopez, 2011;Weller et al., 2007). The Delmarva Peninsula economy thrives on agriculture, poultry, the pulp industry, and tourism. Primary crops include corn and soy beans. Research has shown that the majority of wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula are adjacent to riparian buffers, croplands, poultry farms, or pine plantations (Allen, 2009;Denver, 2004;Tablante, 2002). Conversion of hardwood forests to loblolly pine plantations as well as row crops led to a decrease in forested wetland cover and an increase in nutrient runoff, subsequently negatively impacting water quality and storm water retention (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Stanhope et al., 2009;Whigham et al., 2007). Population growth has increased the demand for housing throughout the Peninsula, especially on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and on uplands of major riverine systems like the Choptank and Chincoteague watersheds (CBP, 2004;Grant et al., 2011). As a result, wetlands have been fragmented by residential construction and the insertion of impervious surfaces (e.g., roadways and bridges). Urban development has also increased recreational activities and has resulted in alteration of wetland connectivity and landscapes to cater to activities requiring pathways, ponds, and golf courses. With increases in population and the usage of land cover for residential and commercial purposes, wetlands have also become more vulnerable to pollution in the form of waste dumping, nutrient runoff, and sediments from dredging and filling, storm water runoff and waste discharges. Impacts of wetland loss include degradation in water quality, the alteration of surface water flows, loss of habitat for wetland dependent plant and animal species, and the introduction of invasive species (Baldwin et al., 2012;Rogers & McCarty, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Landscape Indicators of Wetland Loss", "text": "In addition to anthropogenic drivers of wetland conversion, natural landscape characteristics and processes play on important role in wetland functionality and resilience. These concepts have also been referred to as landscape position, landform, water flow path, and water body types (LLWW indicators) (Dvorett et al., 2012;Tiner, 2005). Topography, soil types, hydro-patterns (e.g., tidal inundation and soil moisture), and vegetation cover directly influence spatial and temporal wetland extent and distribution (Lang & Kasischke, 2008;Tiner, 1995Tiner, , 1999. Flat topography and shallow shorelines reinforce the sustainability of estuarine wetlands in the tidal saline regions, while palustrine wetlands dominate the non-tidal freshwater communities of the Delmarva Peninsula (Baldwin et al., 2012). Wetland soils, also referred to as hydric soils, are defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS, 2007) as \"soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.\" Alteration in the hydric soil horizon or removal of hydric soils can kill native plant species as well as alter the drainage and flow of storm water and agricultural runoff (Stammermann & Piasecki, 2012). Hydropatterns, a depiction of the spatial and temporal patterns of flooding (e.g., tidal inundation and soil moisture) are the primary determinant of the extent and distribution of wetlands (Lang & Kasischke, 2008). Changes in biogeochemistry/water quality (e.g., salinity, pathogens, metals, and pH) can also influence wetland function (Tiner, 1999;Baldwin et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Management and Policies", "text": "In an attempt to improve the management of wetlands on an international level, policymakers have composed an international treaty called the Ramsar Convention (Gulnihal, 2012). On a domestic level, the federal government has implemented legislation and programs like the PL-566 agricultural program, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) wetland delineation manual, and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Executive Order 13508 for Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). In order to prevent, minimize and mitigate wetland loss on a nationwide scale, in 1975 the US Congress created Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which authorizes the US Army Corps of Engineers to design, manage, review, administer and enforce permits activities that involve the discharge of dredged or fill material. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, residential development projects that require filling materials, the revitalizing of transportation infrastructure, and the construction of water resources like levees. In 1990, an Executive Order introduced a national goal of \"No Net Wetland Loss\" (Copeland, 2010). While planners and policymakers have implemented these policies on national, local and state scales, multi-jurisdictional, regional impacts of land use change and permitting on wetland change have varied. Despite governmental intervention, the Delmarva Peninsula has continued to experience agricultural conversion of wetlands, the expansion of impervious surfaces, and channelization of streams (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). Tiner and Finn (1986) examined the impacts of anthropogenic drivers of wetland loss by calculating statewide percentages of wetland loss between the 1950s and the 1970s. Agricultural cultivation accounted for 21% in DE, 38% in MD, and 45% in VA. Channelization accounted for losses of 54% in DE, 33% in MD, and 27% in VA. Ponding due to the implementation of stormwater treatment projects, the creation of reservoirs for livestock, or peat removal altered the natural hydrologic processes (e.g., the frequency of inundation) and accounted for approximately 20% of wetland loss in MD and VA, and urbanization led to an estimated 12% loss in DE. Wetland permitting on the Delmarva Peninsula is a complex process that would benefit from more cohesive information management between the municipalities, state environmental agencies and the US Army Corps of Engineers. A clear gap of knowledge exists between the geo-statistical relationship between the existing wetland permitting programs and changes in wetland cover identified by national land cover datasets (Brody et al., 2008;Brody et al., 2007). The majority of studies on wetland change and permitting in the United States have focused on wetland permitting and the compensatory mitigation component of Section 404, rather than the relationships between the geographic distribution of permits, locations and trends of wetland loss, and the drivers of wetland loss (Brody et al., 2008;Cole & Shafer, 2002;Robb, 2002;Sifneos et al., 1992). According to the National Research Council, there is a need for time series research on wetland change in order to establish a baseline to calculate mitigation ratios and the spatial and biochemical efficiency of wetland restoration (NRC, 2001). Geographically, the majority of studies have focused on wetlands in Gulf of Mexico, the West Coast, and the Chesapeake Bay (Brody et al., 2008;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994)."}, {"section_title": "Methods for Assessing Drivers of Wetland Change and Permitting", "text": "The scientific, economic, and political communities are in need of targeted research that can quantify changes in wetland permitting and impacts on wetland spatial location, geochemical characteristics, functionality, and vulnerability (Tiner, 2005;Weller et al., 2007;Whigham et al., 2007). During the 1980s and 1990s, wetland researchers primarily performed wetland conditional and to some degree functional assessments using one or more of the following methods: The Wetland Evaluation Technique (WET) created by the Federal Highway Administration, The Environmental Monitoring Assessment Program (EMAP) created by the EPA, and the Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) approach created by the US Army Corps of Engineers (Daniels et al., 2010;Dvorett et al., 2012;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Stein et al., 2009). These models focused on evaluating the ecological conditions and functions of a specific wetland site in a given region. Though beneficial to ecologists and biologists, there is still a demand for a comprehensive method that can locate and quantify wetland loss on a regional level, and can explore the statistical relationship between physical and social drivers of wetland loss (Smith & Tran, 2003). Historically, scientists have used active and passive remote sensing instruments to classify and quantify land cover and land use change, to diagnose wetland health, and identify areas of concern and vulnerability (Kearney et al., 1998(Kearney et al., , 2002(Kearney et al., , 2009Klemas 2007. Established scientists like Ralph Tiner, Don Cahoon, and John Day have stressed the importance of ground work to validate inferences on physical and biogeochemical processes made by remote sensing imagery classification and analysis (Cahoon & Turner, 1989;Day et al., 2008;Tiner, 2005;Turner & Rao, 1990). Current initiatives that are relevant to the assessment of wetland change include time series analyses of aerial and satellite imagery, landscape and rapid assessment methods, and probability based sample surveys (Huang et al., 2009;Klemas, 2007;Stevens et al., 2007;Thomas et al., 2011;Wardrop et al., 2007). Remote sensing products have been combined with finer resolution datasets (e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) National Wetland Inventory) to improve the accuracy of wetland classes within land cover datasets (e.g., the National Land Cover Dataset and the NOAA -Coastal Change Analysis Program). For example, Elijah Ramsey of the USGS utilizes remote sensing to classify and analyze changes in land cover to help track trends of wetland loss and recovery in the Gulf of Mexico Ramsey et al., 2009. Land use and land cover change models (e.g., the Chesapeake Bay Land Change Model) have helped predict population growth and subsequent land cover change trends (e.g., wetland loss) in the Chesapeake Bay (Jantz et al., 2010(Jantz et al., , 2011Neilsen & Prince, 2008). Time series analyses, in situ groundwork, and GIS data regarding socioeconomic conditions can be powerful tools to assess wetland loss, if they are maintained and applicable to policies and regulations (Klemas, 2007). The applicability of wetland time series analyses and vulnerability assessments can be improved by integrating landscape context descriptors (e.g., the spatial patterns of habitat, water levels, and buffers) with land use and land cover change datasets and socioeconomic indicators (Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2011;Hollister et al., 2004;Phillips, 2004). However, most existing studies on the status of wetlands on Delmarva Peninsula either focus solely on local (micro scale) non-tidal systems, generic landscape indicators, geological properties, hydrogeomorphic functions, or agricultural development Nagler et al., 2009;Rabenhorst et al., 2001;Tiner, 2005;Whigham et al., 2007). On the other hand, policymakers have primarily relied on the FWS, state agencies, and think-tanks for research on the status and trends of wetlands on regional to national scales (USACE, 2010;USFWS, 2011;Mayer & Lopez, 2011;Tiner et al., 2011), whereas the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) have led research on wetland law and policies (Connolly et al., 2005;Connolly, 2006;ELI, 2008ELI, , 2010ELI, , 2015. There has been a recent increase in research on how wetland change and policies relate to one another on a variety of spatial (local and regional) and temporal (annual versus decadal) scales (Thomas & Lamb, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Proposed Research", "text": "1.2"}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "Despite existing policies and regulations addressing wetlands, net wetland loss on the Delmarva Peninsula continues (Brody et al., 2008).

This research is important because it provides policymakers and planners geospatial data and analyses that can be used to identify physical and anthropogenic drivers of wetland loss.

My objectives are (1) to locate and quantify wetland loss, (2) to investigate the relationship between wetland loss and the trends and pattern in wetland permitting, (3) to explore the statistical relationship between wetland loss, physical and anthropogenic drivers of wetland loss, and landscape indicators, and (4) to test the predictability of wetland change using predictor variables derived from principal component analysis. The overall schematic for my proposed research design is laid out in Figure 1.1. Schematics for each objective will be included in each respective section of the methodology. My ultimate goals are to create a geo-statistical tool and recommendations that will: 1) Identify key drivers of wetland change; 2) Identify physical and political areas that are most vulnerable to wetland loss; 3) Provide information that can be used to improve wetland conservation, restoration and permitting strategies. Objective 1: I will use existing land cover datasets to analyze how land use and land cover on the Delmarva Peninsula have changed over the last 30 years (Refer to Figure   1.2). My hypotheses are (1) that wetland change trends in the coverage and location of wetlands can be quantified using existing land cover maps, and (2) there has been a net loss of wetland acreage on the Delmarva Peninsula from 1980 to 2010.   Objective 2: I will locate and quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland permits in relation to wetland loss patterns (Refer to Figure 1.3). My hypotheses are as follows: (1) Wetland loss is positively correlated with wetland permit density, (2) Permit density is positively correlated with the acreage of roadways and urban/suburban land cover, (3) Permit density is negatively correlated with the acreage of undeveloped land cover, and (4) Temporally, permit density is positively correlated with increases in the acreage of developed land cover. Objective 3: I will explore the statistical relationship between the physical and anthropogenic drivers of land use and land cover change with wetland loss on the Delmarva Peninsula (Refer to Figure 1.3). My hypothesis is that wetland loss is positively correlated with the acreage of impervious surfaces (roadways), agriculture, urban and suburban residential and commercial land cover, and human population, and housing density. I also identify the socioeconomic, political, and land scape context variables that have the strongest associations with wetland loss and wetland permitting (Refer to Figure 1.3). My hypothesis is that areas with the highest steepest slopes, highest soil erosion factors, densities of impervious surfaces, housing growth, agricultural expansion, wetland cover, and the shortest distance from the urban centers, roadways, and floodplains will have the highest associations with wetland loss and permitting. My analysis will integrate physical and anthropogenic indicators, landscape characteristics, and proximity measurements (within a given buffer) to create a logistic model to test the predictability of wetland change. The project will combine Kentula et al., (2004), Nosakhare et al., (2012), Gutzwiller and Flather (2011), and Daniels and Cumming (2008) research interdependencies between wetland habitat loss landscape characteristics, land cover change, and climate change with studies like that of Brody et al., (2008) that explore the spatial-temporal distribution of wetland permits."}, {"section_title": "Outline of Dissertation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1.3", "text": "This dissertation is organized into five chapters (including this introduction).

Wetlands mitigate sediment and nutrient loads, regulate stormwater, recharge groundwater, and provide food and habitat for coastal and migratory species (Chase, Musser, & Gardner, 2003;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Tablante et al., 2002;Wilson, Watts, & Brinker, 2007). Wetland functions and services are often influenced by their location within the greater landscape (Strayer et al., 2003;Wu, 2004;Wu, Li, & Chen, 2011). For example, hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and upstream land cover directly impacts wetland function, and vulnerability. Natural and anthropogenic drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) change, like urbanization and climate change have been linked to the loss and fragmentation of wetlands. Drivers of wetland change operate on different temporal and spatial scales, which increases the need for cumulative assessments of LULC change, more specifically wetland change."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Wetland change continues to threaten water quality and ecosystems in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) and the Delaware Bay (DB). The Delmarva Peninsula located in the Coastal Plain portion of CB has the highest concentration of wetlands in the CB watershed. According to the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD), approximately 36% of wetlands in the CB watershed are located on the Delmarva Peninsula (Homer et al., 2015). Over the past 200 years, the Delmarva Peninsula has lost over 2.1 million acres of wetlands (including coastal and inland wetlands) due to dredging, channelization, draining and filling, and ponding (Dahl, 1990;Dahl 2000;Tiner & Finn, 1986;Tiner & Finn, 2012). Population growth has increased the demand for housing throughout the peninsula, especially on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and on uplands (e.g., terrestrial lands that are commonly dry) of major riverine systems like the Choptank and Chincoteague watersheds (Moglen et al., 2011;Nosakhare et al., 2012; Chesapeake Bay Office, 2012). As a result, wetlands have been lost or fragmented by residential and recreational construction and related infrastructure (e.g., roadways and bridges). Wetland loss on the peninsula is correlated with degradation in water quality, the alteration of surface water flows, loss of habitat for wetland dependent plant and animal species, and the proliferation of invasive species (Batzer & Baldwin, 2012;Denver et al, 2004;Rogers & McCarty, 2000). Despite governmental intervention, the Delmarva Peninsula has continued to experience agricultural conversion of wetlands, the expansion of impervious surfaces, and channelization (Dahl, 1990;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). Since the late 1700's, over 50% of wetlands in DE, approximately 60% of wetlands in MD, and 40% of wetlands in VA have been converted to nonwetlands (Dahl, 1990;Fretwell, Williams, & Redman, 1996). Between 1950 and1970, agricultural cultivation accounted for 21% of wetland loss in DE, 38% in MD, and 45% in VA. Channelization that make streams more navigable for larger ships or diverted water away from agricultural land accounted for wetland losses of 54% in DE, 33% in MD, and 27% in VA. Ponding that resulted in permanently inundated wetlands due to peat removal or from the creation reservoirs for livestock accounted for approximately 20% of wetland loss in MD and VA, and urbanization led to an estimated 12% loss in DE (Tiner & Finn, 1986). There is a need for further research on wetland change, the drivers of wetland conversion, and the impacts of wetland change and policies on the biogeographical composition and function of wetlands on larger scales. Previous studies have demonstrated that stressors like agriculture, urbanization, and sea level rise directly impact wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula (Brooks, Wardrop, & Bishop, 2004;Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Kearney and Rogers, 2010;Mayer & Lopez, 2011;Weller et al., 2007). Although local studies can reveal important information regarding wetland change drivers and impacts, they have the potential to be too fine scale (e.g., tax parcel and site specific) to accurately support [be the base of] public policies on issues that cross multiple spatial scales (e.g., floodplain regions or transportation corridors). In-situ or short term research can be exclusive of socioeconomic (e.g., migration) or landscape characteristics (e.g., topography and streamflow) that may cross local boundaries or geophysical conditions, which can lead to the implementation of policies like infrastructure management that fail due to being unsustainable or inconsiderate of episodic drivers like hurricanes or continuous disturbances like sea level rise. In order to create and implement efficient economic and environmental policies, policy and decision makers need a clearer understanding of: 1) where wetlands are located, 2) how wetlands respond to disturbances and 3) how the conversion of wetlands to other land cover types can impact ecosystem habitats and services (Boesch, 2006;Daniels et al., 2010). According to the National Research Council (NRC), there is also a need for time series research on wetland change in order to establish baseline indicators to target areas for mitigation and to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of wetland restoration projects (NRC, 2001). Natural resource managers use wetland maps to identify critical areas in need of sustainable conservation and restoration policies. In order to identify priority areas, scientists and policymakers must first understand the health, functionality, and connectivity of wetlands. Wetland mapping enables managers to aggregate/integrate and analyze multiple conditional and function-based wetlands assessment in order to understand how wetlands are responding to disturbances in a variety of hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes(e.g., upland, isolated, headwater, non-tidal, and estuarine). The integration of wetland maps with other GIS tools like floodplain mapping are used to inform the management of nutrient and sediment loading rates by comparing the spatial distribution of wetlands with recorded nutrient and sediment levels. The wetland maps help scientists understand how and where wetlands effect nutrient levels, which helps policymakers reduce negative impacts like algal blooms and eutrophication. Wetland maps are also vital in building scenarios and forecasting the impacts of climate change like sea level rise and increases in the size and duration of storm surges."}, {"section_title": "Existing Research", "text": "Historically, scientists have used passive (e.g., Landsat and aerial photography) remote sensing instruments to classify, locate, and quantify land use and land cover change and to identify critical areas of concern and vulnerability (Barras, Bernier, and Morton, 2008;Couvillion et al., 2011;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Klemas, 2004; to 1989 on the Lower Eastern Shore of the peninsula found that agriculture, ditching, and the timber industry (e.g., loblolly pine) were the primary drivers of palustrine forested wetland loss. Wetland stressors are often related to not only wetland loss but also degradation (Nielsen, Prince, & Koeln, 2008).\nThe applicability of geographic assessments of wetland change and vulnerability can be improved by integrating landscape context variables with land use and land cover change databases and socioeconomic indicators (Hollister et al., 2004;Phillips, 2004). However, most existing studies on the status of wetlands on Delmarva Peninsula either focus solely on local (micro scale) non-tidal systems, generic landscape indicators (e.g., elevation and slope), geological properties, hydrogeomorphic functions; or agricultural development Nagler et al., 2009;Rabenhorst et al., 2001;Tiner, 2005;Whigham et al., 2007). On the other hand, policymakers have primarily relied on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, State Agencies, and think-tanks for research on the status and trends of wetlands on regional to national scales (Dahl, 1990(Dahl, , 2000Mayer, 2011;Tiner et al., 2011;USACE, 2010;USFWS, 2011). Studies are either oversimplified with no local, contextual value, too site specific for regional scale application and repetition, exclusive of socioeconomic or landscape characteristics, or too coarse in spatial resolution to identify and track local patterns and trends. There has been a recent increase in research on how wetland change and policies relate are correlated with one another on a variety of spatial (local and regional) and temporal (annual versus decadal) scales (Thomas & Lamb, 2005). The backbone of this study was based on previous studies that discuss the use of integration methods to analyze the drivers of wetland change, the risk of wetland loss, and regional vulnerability in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. (Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2011;Ji, 2007;Locantore et al., 2004;Smith & Tran, 2003). Various studies have analyzed the relationships between wetland change and drivers like urbanization, sea level rise, flooding and topography to create models that forecast wetland habitats most vulnerable to conversion (Brody et al., 2015;Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2011). For example, Daniels and Cumming (2008) identified topography, distance to roadways and urbanized areas, and topography as a few of the primary drivers and predictors of wetland loss in a basin in Costa Rica (Daniels & Cumming, 2008). However, most studies do not analyze the drivers of wetland conversion on regional, long term scales. Gutzwiller and Flather (2011) utilized a regional approach to identify the key anthropogenic and landscape predictor variables as well as a target spatial scale to incorporate into a model that predicted the risk for wetland habitat loss in the southern U.S. Their results identified the surrounding land cover as the dominant predictor variable followed by urbanization, patch size, propriety variables at the micro scale (within a 570m buffer). Landscape and local conditions are two components that must be geospatially monitored and assessed in order to track wetland change and design legislation to protect and restore wetlands. When selecting locations for restoration projects and choosing BMPs to achieve water quality standard goals, policymakers have also had to consider the trends, patterns, drivers and impacts of wetland permit parameters and activities. For example, Brody et al. (2015) found that the magnitudes of flood risks in Florida and Texas were directly related to wetland permit type (Brody et al., 2015). Larger scale projects with a larger footprint in wetland habitats posed the greatest risk to increasing impervious surfaces, which could increase the frequency and intensity of flood events. However, permitted activities for smaller projects increased the potential for alterations to hydrologic conditions (e.g., wetland connectivity, surface runoff patterns, and streamflow). Clusters of small projects (e.g., cookie-cutter neighborhoods) were prone to have larger cumulative impacts than isolated, sporadic large projects (Connolly et al., 2005;Connolly, 2006). Planners and scientists now have the ability to selectively incorporate predictor variables like population growth, residential development, and land cover change into geospatial models, which can improve the predictability and accuracy of the wetland change models."}, {"section_title": "Objective", "text": "The objective of this study was to: 1) quantify historical wetland change trends and patterns at multiple spatial scales between 1984 and 2010 using regional LCDs, 2) identify differences in wetland related land cover change as determined using multiple LCDs and discuss the source of and implications for these differences, and 3) investigate the extent to which drivers of wetland change can be identified using existing LCDs.\nThis study contributed to the knowledge gap that exists in understanding the hierarchical relationships between wetland change, and the physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the change. The specific objectives were as follows: 1) to develop a predictive statistical model for the risk of wetland loss for a case study, Sussex County, DE that can be applied to wetland management and policies, 2) to test the model with different combinations of independent variables, and 3) to explain how the model's indicators can be used to understand the drivers and prioritize policies to reduce wetland loss. The hypotheses are as follows: 1) the likelihood of wetland loss can be understood through a quantitative analysis of landscape context on a county scale, 2) the likelihood of wetland loss will have a strong relationship with a series of variables related to the distance of a wetland to development, agriculture, and water, 3) the likelihood of wetland loss will have a strong relationship with slope and elevation, and 4) agriculture and development will be the independent variables with the highest influence on wetland loss in the principal component analysis. This study's contribution to the body of knowledge about the indicators of wetland loss included examining the risk of wetland change in relation to the characteristics of wetlands, areas adjacent to wetlands, and the landscape surrounding the wetlands, and the density of Section 404 permits within a specified buffer around a wetland(s). \"Risk\" was defined as the probability for wetland change (from a wetland to a non-wetland land cover) given that a particular geographic location (e.g., a pixel) was classified as a wetland. This distinction was made to reiterate that the model was not created to predict the spatial area or location of wetland loss, but rather the predictability that a wetland or a portion of a wetland will change or be converted into a non-wetland.

Located in the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province, the northwestern edge of the peninsula sits on a fall line that serves as a transitional zone between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). The peninsula falls between three major water bodies: the Delaware Bay to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Chesapeake Bay to the south and west. The Delmarva Peninsula economy thrives on agriculture, poultry, the pulp industry, and tourism. The Delmarva Peninsula was used for this study because of its variation in land cover types,    Fry et al., 2011Wickham et al., 2010Fry et al., 2009Homer et al., 2007Hollister et al., 2004 The   : 1975-1989MD: 1977-1989VA: 1980-1989 23Medium Intensity Developed (3) Developed, Low Intensity 22Low Intensity Developed (4) Developed, Open Space 21Open Space Developed (5) Agricultural Land 2Cultivated Crops (82) Cultivated Land (6) Pasture/Hay 81Pasture/Hay (7) Rangeland 3Grassland / Herbaceous (71) Grassland (8) Scrub / Shrub 52Scrub Shrub (12) Forest 4Deciduous Forest (41) Deciduous Forest (9) Evergreen Forest 42Evergreen Forest (10) Mixed Forest 43Mixed Forest 11 Table 2.3 A land cover of classification scheme for the regional land cover data sets from 1984 to 2010. This matrix was used to normalize the NLCD, CBLCD, and C-CAP data sets to two basic scales: 1) Wetlands and 2) forested versus emergent herbaceous wetlands. The National Land Cover Database (NLCD). With respect to the time period of this study, the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) has produced NLCD datasets (NLCD) for 1992(Fry et al., 2011Homer et al., 2007;Vogelmann et al., 2001) (See Table 2.1), but the 1992 dataset was not used as part of this study due to an unacceptable error level (Fry et al., 2011;MDA, 2009). As shown in  (Fry et al., 2011;Homer et al., 2007;Vogelmann et al., 2001). In order to perform the most accurate classification of wetland and impervious surface cover, analysts gathered Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 images (3 for 2001 and 2 for 2006) from leaf on and leaf off seasons for each path/row (Fry et al., 2011;C. Homer et al., 2007;Vogelmann et al., 2001). The seasonal variation of imagery improved the accuracy of classifications of land covers that may be located under foliage (e.g., forested wetlands) or under temporary hydrologic conditions (e.g., ponding or episodic flooding) (Lunetta & Balogh, 1999;1991;Vogelmann et al., 2001 substantial ancillary data in the mapping of urban land cover classes, which increases the accuracy of urban land cover, and the classification of road networks and infrastructure as urban land cover. The texture of the NLCD is smoothed through the application of a minimum mapping unit, which aggregates clusters of pixels of the same class (Fry et al., 2011;Homer et al., 2007). The NWI served as the primary ancillary source data, while, GAP analyses, USGS land use/land cover, hydrography, and digital elevation models were also used to increase wetland classification accuracy as well as to serve as baseline data for locations without NWI data (Vogelmann et al., 1998a;Vogelmann et al., 1998b).\nAs illustrated in Figure 3.1, the Delmarva Peninsula covers portions of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the majority of Delaware and two counties of northeastern Virginia. Located in the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province, the northwestern edge of the peninsula sits on a fall line that serves as a transitional zone between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions (Goldstein & Hartman, 1994). The Peninsula sits between three primary waterbodies, the Atlantic Ocean to the East, the Delaware Bay to the northeast, and the Chesapeake Bay to the west. The Delmarva Peninsula will be used for this study because of its variation in land cover types, heavy concentration of wetland cover, trends of population growth, active participation in the Clean Water Act -Section 404 wetland permitting system, and its unique position on the Mid-Atlantic seaboard that is susceptible to sea level rise and hurricanes. The Delmarva Peninsula economy depends on tourism, shipping and agricultural activities like poultry farming and the pulp industry (American Farmland Trust, 2005;BEACON, 2010;Southwick Associates, 2012). The peninsula hydrogeomorphic complex consists of a high percentage of undisturbed barrier islands, shorelines, and sub-watersheds that continue to experience disturbances and ecological stress from urbanization, seasonal tourism, and sea level rise. Since the late 1700's, the Delmarva Peninsula has lost an estimated 2 million acres of wetlands due to activities like ditching and ponding to improve hydrological conditions for farming, draining and filling to develop impervious surfaces, and channelization and dredging to improve waterway navigation (Dahl, 1990(Dahl, , 2000Tiner & Finn, 1986). Over the past 200 years, each state on the Delmarva has over 40% of wetlands converted to non-wetlands (Dahl, 1990;Fretwell et al., 1996). Between the 1950 and 1970, agricultural cultivation accounted for est. 20% of wetland loss in DE, almost 40% in MD, and almost 50% in VA. Channelization accounted for wetland losses of est. 50% in DE, 30% in MD, and 25% in VA. DE suffered an est. 12% loss due to urban development, while 20% of the wetland loss in MD and VA were attributed to ponding (Tiner & Finn, 1986). The peninsula has experienced population growth due to sprawling communities from the metropolitan hubs like especially on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and on uplands (e.g., terrestrial lands that are commonly dry) of major riverine systems like the Choptank, Nanticoke, and Pocomoke watersheds (Moglen et al., 2011;Nosakhare et al., 2012). As a result, wetlands have been fragmented or converted into developed land uses like roadways and neighborhoods (Dahl, 1990;Hartmann and Goldstein, 1984). Wetland Inventory (NWI) data set was used to assign the following wetland types to the Section 404 wetland permits: emergent, lacustrine, marine, palustrine, and riverine."}, {"section_title": "The Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP).", "text": "The C-CAP is produced for coastal regions and adjacent uplands, which encapsulates the entire study area (i.e. the Delmarva Peninsula). The C-CAP data series used for this analysis came from 1992, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2010 (See Table 2.1).  were completed using a CART analysis, ad-hoc interpretations of aerial imagery, and field data collection to correct land cover classifications in locations with known errors of classification (Burkhalter, Herold, & Robinson, 2005;NOAA, 2015a,b). The 2006 C-CAP data was created by applying the existing classification methodology along with the CCA technique, which assisted in accounting for land cover changes between (MDA, 2009. CCA identifies spectral signatures for each land cover class by comparing spectral values between the 2006 image and the 2001 base layer (Irani and Claggett, 2010). The C-CAP incorporates six wetland classes (See Table 2.3) unlike NLCD and the CBLCD, which use the Anderson-Level I classification system (Burkhalter et al., 2005;Dobson et al., 1995). The Chesapeake Bay Land Cover Dataset (CBLCD). The CBLCD datasets of 1984, and 2011 were based on an integration of the C-CAP and NLCD (Irani & Claggett, 2010). For 2001, the C-CAP and NLCD were amalgamated to create a baseline map. The map was then updated for 2006, and retroactively for 1992 and 1984 using CCA and a CART (Irani & Claggett, 2010). An algorithm was also applied to the classification model to reduce over-classification of coastal emergent wetlands (MDA, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Ancillary Data for Comparison of Spatial and Temporal Agreement", "text": "In addition, the change patterns and trends from each regional land cover data set (e.g. C-CAP, CBLCD, and NLCD) were compared with NWI classifications and state land use and land cover datasets produced by reference data from aerial photography and other GIS layers. These data sets were chosen because they possessed a higher level of spatial resolution, accuracy percentages in wetland classification, and pre-existing wetland delineation and validation. National Wetland Inventory (NWI). The U.S. FWS produces the NWI, the most comprehensive national wetland mapping initiative. The NWI produces wetland maps using moderate to fine resolution aerial photographs and satellite imagery along with a primarily non-automated photointerpretation mapping technique (See Table 2.2) (FGDC, 1998;FGDC, 2009). The NWI maps tend to have lower errors of commission than omission, meaning that pixels classified as wetlands on NWI maps have a high probability of being a wetland at the time that the aerial imagery was gathered (Nichols, 1994;Stolt & Baker, 1995). When incorporating the NWI's aerial imagery approach, forested wetlands tend to be more difficult to map than emergent wetlands, and have a wide variation in errors of omission (Kudray & Gale, 2000;Rolband, 1995;Tiner, 1990;Tiner, 2012 Table 2.4) (Dobson et al., 1995;Homer et al., 2007). For 2001, the NLCD was accurate for 85% for Anderson Level-I classes and approximately 79% accurate for Anderson Level-II classes (Dobson et al., 1995;Homer et al., 2007). No specific accuracy assessment was conducted for detecting wetlands in the 1992 or 2001 NLCD that fell in the study area. For C-CAP, accuracy assessments were completed on the 2001 C-CAP Zone 60, which includes parts of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. The overall accuracy for land cover in Zone 60 is approximately 71% (Dobson et al., 1995;Homer et al., 2007). The spatial accuracy assessment of the 2010 C-CAP classifications in the Mid-Atlantic region found an average producer's accuracy (by wetland type) of approximately 82% for palustrine woody/shrub-scrub, 83% for palustrine emergent, 50% for estuarine shrub-scrub, and 100% for estuarine emergent. Percentages of user's accuracy by wetland type were all similar to producer's accuracy, except for estuarine emergent wetlands, which had a 10% reduction in accuracy (90%). It is important to note that the producer's and user's accuracy percentages for estuarine shrub-scrub wetlands may be skewed due to the assessment only including two sites for validation, while the other wetland classes had between 27 and 57 validation sites (NOAA, 2015a,b). The CBLCD is a product of two national LCDs (e.g., C-CAP and NLCD) that have already undergone official accuracy assessments. Existing accuracy assessments of NWI mapping have focused on comparison with field data (Kudray and Gale, 2000). For example NWI maps of wetlands in rural Massachusetts communities had a 95% accuracy of the quantity of wetlands correctly classified and delineated (Swartout, MacConnell, & Finn, 1982). The study incorporated extensive fieldwork to validate the delineation and classification of emergent, shrub/scrub palustrine, emergent and shrub/scrub estuarine wetlands. Other research has found that at least 91% of wetlands classified as palustrine wetlands on Virginia NWI maps met the field validation criteria as jurisdictional wetlands (Stolt & Baker, 1995). No other accuracy assessments of wetland classifications in regional land cover data sets have been conducted on wetland detections on the Delmarva Peninsula."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The methodology consisted of five major steps: 1) pre-processing, 2) spatial matching of the regional and ancillary GIS data, 3) calculating the quantity, percentage and frequency of wetland change, 4) identifying hot spot locations of wetland change, and 5) analyzing the types of wetland conversion (e.g., loss and gain) to explore potential natural and anthropogenic drivers of wetland change (See Figure 2.2)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.2 Flow Diagram of the Methodology", "text": "Each LCD and ancillary vector data set was converted into a 30-m resolution raster at the Albers conical equal area projection in ArcMap. A crosswalk was used to normalize the NLCD, CBLCD, and C-CAP data sets to two basic classifications: 1) wetlands versus non-wetlands and 2) forested versus emergent herbaceous wetlands. (See Table 2.3). Datasets were aggregated to the following spatial scales: Hydrological Unit Code 12 (HUC-12; n = 246), Minor Civil Division (MCD; n = 135), county (n = 14), and state (n = 3). The HUC-12 scale was selected as the physical scale because it is the finest hydrological unit code that still preserves the boundaries of the respective surface drainage basins and the topographical gradients of adjacent units. The MCD scale was selected as the socioeconomic scale because of its medium resolution and its agreement with the political and Census boundaries most likely to stay constant during the period of study. Temporally, the study stretches from 1984, the year of the earliest LCD, to 2010, the year of the most recent LCD (NOAA, 2015a,b) (See Table 2.1). Second, the LCDs were compared for spatial and temporal agreement, by spatial matching of data sets with corresponding years (e.g., overlaying the 2001 NLCD on top of 2001 C-CAP). The same process was repeated using state level LCDs and the NWI. Percentages of agreement were calculated by dividing the count of the number pixels classified as wetlands (1) in LCD 1 also classified as wetlands (1) in LCD 0 by the total number of pixels classified as wetlands (1) in LCD 0 . Third, the magnitude, frequency and hot spots of wetland change (including loss and gain) were identified by calculating the quantity (total area in hectares) and percentage (of total area of wetlands) of wetland change at each spatial scale (e.g., HUC-12 and MCD), complementary time periods (e.g., 2001 to 2006), and class (e.g., Anderson Level-I and II). Finally, a time series analysis of wetland conversion was conducted to identify the potential drivers of wetland change. In order to compare the agreement of the different land cover data sets, the locations and quantities of wetland loss and gain from each land cover dataset from 2001 to 2006 were compared, as this was the only time period that was constant across all three regional land datasets. The absolute quantity (Equation 1) and the relative quantity (Equation 2) of wetland changes were calculated. ( The percentage of wetland coverage (area) converted from wetland to another land cover type and vice-versa for each time period was calculated for each HUC-12 and MCD using the CBLCD and C-CAP LCDs. The difference of wetland changes for each time period was statistically tested using the Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test. The Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test is a non-parametric statistical test to assess the difference between two conditions where the samples, in this case wetland change, are correlated. The data sets can be compared repeatedly over consistent periods of time (e.g., between Year 0 and Year 1 ), with a null hypothesis of the medians of the two samples being equal to 0. Next, multiple data sources were aggregated to create a new, multi-source LCD time series to mirror the time series used in the CBLCD/-C-CAP analysis. As shown in Table 2.4, the state LCDs and an archived NWI data set for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed were matched to the closest CBLCD/C-CAP time period. For example, the 2007 DE LCD was placed under the 2006 time period. With the earliest CBLCD layer (1984) not having a woody wetland class, the 1992 C-CAP layer was burned into the 1984 layer along with the archived NWI data set, which was primarily based on aerial imagery collected between the mid 1970's to the early 1990's. Due to incorporating multiple sources with differing methodologies, the percentage of wetland coverage (area) converted from wetland to non-wetland cover types and vice-versa for each time period was calculated for each HUC-12 at a binary Anderson-I level (e.g., wetland versus nonwetland). For the remaining portion of the study, which focused on identifying hot spot locations and drivers of wetland change, only the CBLCD/C-CAP time series was used in order to provide results based on source data with a constant methodology, Table 2.4 A breakdown of the multi-source time series by benchmark years and the respective years of the national and state LCDs along with the archived NWI data set. After quantifying wetland change and testing for statistical significance, hotspots of wetland change (loss and gain) for each LCD were identified. Hotspots were identified by comparing the distribution of the percentages of wetland loss and gain at HUC-12 and MCD scales. Hot spots were visually defined as geographic units (e.g., HUC-12, MCD, river system, city, transportation corridor, and park reserve) with the highest quantities or percentages of wetland change. The frequency of wetland change was analyzed by identifying pixels in the study area which experienced no change, permanent change, or temporary changes over the study period of 1984-2010. Permanent change was defined as a wetland conversion from wetland to non-wetland or vice versa that occurred in only one phase of the study period. Temporary change referred to wetlands that experienced multiple conversions (i.e., back and forth from a wetland to a different land cover. The potential drivers of wetland change were identified by interpreting the conversion of pixel classifications from and to wetlands in acreage and percentage. The end goal was to see if the regional LCDs can be used to identify what land cover types wetlands were being converted into to help identify the drivers of wetland loss and the land cover types that were being converted into wetlands to help identify the drivers of wetland gain. For example, a HUC-12 that experience high percentages of wetland loss to water may be experiencing impacts related to sea level rise, while MCDs that experience increases in wetland acreage from agriculture could be benefiting from wetland restoration policies."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "2.3", "text": "The results section consists of a summary of the spatial agreement of the regional LCDS compared to the NWI, and state level land cover datasets at Anderson Level-I and Anderson Level-II classification schemes.

NLCD showed the largest quantity and percentage of wetland gain between 2001 and 2006, at almost 2,500 hectares more than C-CAP and CBLCD.

During this period, wetland cover decreased by 2% (9.353 ha) (  "}, {"section_title": "Loss -Woody", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gain -Woody", "text": "Loss -Emergent Gain -Emergent 2.3.3 Frequency of Wetland Change Table 2.9 illustrates the breakdown of the amount of hectares in the entire study area that either experienced: a) only one phase of land type conversion from wetland to non-wetland or vice versa (e.g., permanent change), b) multiple conversions (e.g., temporary change) , or c) no change. Permanent wetland loss accounted for a little over 2.5% (12,576 ha) of the area of wetland change according C-CAP and 2% (9,091 ha) of wetland change in CBLCD. Most of these wetlands were classified as emergent wetlands or were adjacent to emergent wetlands, open water, or urbanized areas, especially areas in the largest patches of wetland coverage. Only 0.01% (48 ha) of wetland areas in C-CAP and 0.01% (33 ha) in CBLCD experienced temporary loss. Wetland areas that experienced temporary/fluctuating change (loss or gain) were either poorly classified wetlands or were located on or adjacent to areas of cultivation (e.g., cultivated land cover), properties ripe for development, or coastal conditions vulnerable to tidal variation, inundation, and sea level rise. With respect to wetland gain, roughly 0.5% (199 ha) of the wetland coverage in C-CAP and 0.3% (119 ha) in CBLCD experienced permanent wetland gain. Further investigation is needed to determine whether sites of wetland gain were the result of specific wetland restoration and conservation projects.

Permanent loss represents pixels that changed in classification from wetland to a non-wetland land cover, and remained a non-wetland cover for the remaining portion of the study period, and permanent gain vice versa.

Although the NLCD map of wetland loss from 2001 to 2006 agreed with the CBLCD and C-CAP maps at both scales, it still overestimates the percentages of wetland loss. The two spatial scales of the wetland change analysis also had similar hotspots (e.g., locations) of wetland change (from 6% to 75%) occurring in the following regions (labeled in the center and western DE. NLCD has 4 of the top 10 from C-CAP and CBLCD, but has two to three times higher percentages of loss than C-CAP and CBLCD. Second tier MCDs had experienced an average 3% loss and were either located slightly northwest of the Blackwater National Wildlife Reserve, adjacent to the Nanticoke River, or on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (see Figure 2.5).\nThe primary hotspots of wetland change occurred in the following regions (labeled in Figure 3 (Figure 3."}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Wetland Change", "text": "The non-wetland land cover classes in the national and state LCDs represent indicators of wetland change that can be linked to physical and/or anthropogenic drivers of wetland change. For example, the change in classification of a pixel from wetland to water can be used to track the spatial and temporal trends of wetland loss. However, the change in classification to water did not the drive the change. Potential drivers of the wetland loss to water include sea level rise, coastal erosion, and channelization. Overall, C-CAP and CBLCD agreed regarding the ratios of the indicators of wetland change and the spatial hotspots of wetland change. In both data sets, agriculture accounted for 50% of wetland loss followed by water at 15%. The greatest disagreement between the two data sets was (net) wetland loss attributed to forest cover, with C-CAP loosing 384 more hectares of wetlands than CBLCD. Water accounted for almost twothirds of wetland loss, whereas forest and grass/scrub cover accounted for almost threefourths of wetland gain. When comparing temporal patterns of wetland change, the data sets showed agreement in the percentage of pixels that did not change in classification from 1992 to 2006 (est. 98%). The NLCD did not agree as well with the other two data sets in wetland accuracy and wetland change. When looking at wetland change from 2001 to 2006, NLCD had approximately 50% (est. 1,300 ha) less wetland loss attributed to agriculture and almost 3 times (est. 1300 ha) more loss attributed to forest cover than C-CAP and CBLCD (See Table 2.6). With respect to wetland gain, NLCD had an average of 31% gain attributed to agriculture and an average of 30% less gain attributed to forest cover in C-CAP and CBLCD. When ha), and barren land (10%, 371 ha). It is important to note that barren land cover is often considered a land cover that represents a \"transition\" or \"clearing\" of a natural land cover to an anthropogenic land cover, which can indirectly increase wetland loss driven by development. Unlike C-CAP and the CBLCD, NLCD showed that the highest quantity of wetland loss was attributable to forest cover (31%, 1,739 ha) followed by grass/shrub cover (23%, 1,278 ha), and agriculture (19%, 1,059 ha). According to the C-CAP 2001-2006 data, the top three land covers associated with wetland gain were forest cover (57%, 218 ha), grass/shrub (16%, 62 ha), and open water (9%, 34 ha) (see Table 2.7). According to the CBLCD, the top three land covers associated with wetland gain were agriculture/cultivation (61%), open water (15%), and barren land (10%). Out of the three national LCDs, the NLCD indicated the largest total area (2,805 ha) of wetland gain. Its primary indicators of wetland loss differed slightly from those of C-CAP and the CBLCD, with agriculture accounting for 40% (1,129 ha), forest cover 27% (747 ha), and grass/shrub 17% (483 ha) of wetland gain."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2.4", "text": "The discussion section will begin with a comparison of the results of wetland change according to the regional LCDs. Second, the discussion will shift to compare and contrast the quantities and hot spots of wetland change at the two spatial scales: HUC-12 and MCD. Third, the limitations and challenges of the study will be examined. Finally, the discussion will end with discourse on how time series analyses of wetland change can be applied to future research and policies as well as to practices that can strengthen the accuracy and applicability of future wetland change assessments."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Change Agreement by regional Land Cover Dataset", "text": "Overall, C-CAP and CBLCD had the highest statistical agreement in percentages and quantities of wetland change due to LCDs having similar methods, and the CBLCD incorporating C-CAP as source data. As previously stated, the most wetland loss occurred between 1992 and 2001 compared with 2001 and 2010. The NLCD did not agree as well with the other two data sets in wetland accuracy and wetland change. The NLCD's minimum mapping unit aggregation methods contributed to the smoothing of pixels with similar land cover classifications (Homer et al., 2007). These methods resulted in the removal of isolated or small clusters of wetland pixels that were adjacent to or surrounded by large patches of non-wetlands, as well as isolated or small clusters of non-wetland pixels that were adjacent to or surrounded by large patches of wetlands. The classification of impervious surfaces (e.g., roads) was also a major reason for classification differences. The NLCD used high-resolution ancillary data to increase the accuracy of mapping roads as developed areas (including rural/low-density areas), whereas in CBLCD and C-CAP collector and local roads often appear fragmented, and can be difficult to decipher. As a result, developed pixels from roads passing through forests/tree-cover and wetlands are often vulnerable to errors of omission and commission."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Change Agreement by Spatial Scale", "text": "When comparing the LCDs, the spatial scales and methodologies impacted the spatial agreement of wetland change and hotspots. C-CAP and CBLCD had the strongest agreement, because C-CAP focused on mapping land cover in coastal regions around the United States, which includes sub-watersheds in the Chesapeake Bay. On the other hand, NLCD was produced as part a national \"wall to wall\" mapping initiative to illustrate land-cover dynamics of the conterminous United State. Subsequently, different data acquisition, geo-processing, and classification methods were instituted, causing NLCD to disagree with the other two data sets. <Elaborate on limitations of NLCD."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Challenges", "text": "The primary limitations to these regional LCD sets include, but are not limited to, seasonal variations of source imagery, the moderate spatial scales of the source imagery and LCD products, the coarse temporal distribution of the LCD products, and contrasts in methodologies. Seasonal variation of data collection directly influences the accuracy of the land cover classification. For example, data sets based on imagery that is collected strictly during leaf-on seasons are more likely inaccurately classify wetlands with deciduous plant canopy as well as other land cover classes that may be obscured by a leaf-on plant canopy (e.g.,, wetlands, impervious surfaces, waterways). This moderate scale study is based on GIS layers created from Landsat imagery, which is considered by the scientific community to be medium resolution imagery at 30m. The imagery does not drilldown to a local, site-specific level that allows for consideration of landscape conditions that can vary at high spatial resolutions (e.g., resolutions greater than 10m) (e.g., topography, soil types, and hydrology). The medium resolution imagery also increases the potential for mixing of the spectral signatures of wetlands with those of hydric soils, shrub/scrub vegetation, and waterbodies containing sediments. Any localized wetland change captured in aerial photography has the potential to be immediately lost or diluted when the raster of the aerial photography has to be converted into a raster that is at the same scale of the regional LCD (e.g., 30-meter resolution). It is also important to note that the 1 -2% loss of wetland coverage represents the net change for the entire study area. Examining the results on HUC-12 and MCD scales on a period to period interval revealed a variation in percentage change from 36% loss to 17% gain. These percentages are also influenced by the baseline area of wetland cover in Period0. For example, a highly developed, upland HUC-12 or MCD near Wilmington, DE may have a lower quantity of wetland cover than an undisturbed, estuarine HUC-12 or MCD near Ocean City, MD. Subsequently, an equal area of wetland loss will result in different percentages of wetland loss (e.g., the urban area having a higher percentage of loss than the estuarine area). Temporal limitations include land cover datasets that are normally distributed on a 4 to 8 year basis. Although regional natural processes can occur on temporal scales ranging from instantaneous to centurial scales, episodic events can alter land use and land cover on a substantially shorter temporal scale (e.g., months and days). Examples Analyzing wetland change on one study area at two different spatial scales or boundary systems (e.g., HUC-12 for physical and MCD for socioeconomic) also magnified how much visual ability to interpret wetland change detection depends on the lenses chosen by the user. The analysis must also take into account the spatial dimension of natural processes (e.g., fluvial geomorphology). For example, hotspots of wetland change that appeared at the HUC-12 scale were diluted and harder to identify at the MCD scale. Often, only hotspots in areas with higher populations, development, or exposure to open water appeared at both HUC-12 and MCD scales.\nThe primary limitations of the permitting data sets used are as follows: limited attributes in the permitting databases with respect to permitted activities, the lack of, or coarse resolution of, attributes to the georeferenced permits, a lack of variables that quantified the area of wetland cover impacted by the wetland permit, and the challenge of accounting for wetland loss caused by activities exempt from the Clean Water Act and state and local regulations. First, the permitting GIS data set from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not include a complete attribute field with information on the area of wetland cover impacted by each project. It is important to note that the area of wetland change may not have always directly reflected the area of impact from each project Due to the moderate resolution of the 30 meter land cover datasets used in this study, the calculated area and percentage of wetland change could have been the result of one or more of the permitted projects. Second, a challenge came with standardizing and georeferencing the permitting data set from the state of DE. The state's permitting data set did not have specific location information (i.e., latitude or longitude) to georeference or plot the data. It may have impacted the spatial and temporal analysis of hot spots of permitting that may or may not have occurred in the minor civil divisions throughout the Delmarva Peninsula. However, the data set did contain information in select fields (e.g., project name, applicant, and waterway), that allowed the data to be incorporated into the temporal analysis of the annual total number and density of permits on the following spatial scales: the entire study area, state, and county. Third, the data set also lacked attributes regarding the spatial area impacted by the permitted activity. This, reinforces the need for the updating of the attributes of the digital records of the permits, as well as further research on how to assign weights (e.g., magnitude or intensity) to the impacts of specific activities according to variables like the area of the project site, the time span of the project, or the distance of the project to a wetland. Finally, annual time series maps of the hot spots at the MCD were created from 1980 to 2010. Finally, this analysis did not drill down to examine the spatial and temporal relationship between specific permit types and the calculated area of impact or conversion from wetland to non-wetland. Challenges included: 1) the complexity and continuous evolution of the legal definition of wetlands and \"Waters of the U.S.,\" and 2) the existence of activities exempt from the permit review procedure between 1980 and 2010."}, {"section_title": "Application of Wetland Change Analyses and Best management practices for future wetland assessments", "text": "A combination of techniques that integrate the use of remote sensing imagery with various landscape indicators are being used to map wetlands and track trends and patterns of wetland change (Tiner, 2004;Weller et al., 2007). Overall, these regional LCDs can be utilized as a guide for wetland managers and planners to create wetland change or vulnerability indicators applicable to nationally recommended water quality criteria and wetland permitting regulations. However, a clear gap in knowledge exists between the geo-statistical relationship between the existing wetland permitting programs and changes in wetland cover identified by national land cover datasets (Brody et al., 2007;Brody et al., 2008). research is needed on the relationships between the geographic distribution of permits, locations and trends of wetland loss, and the drivers of wetland loss on a regional level (Brody et al., 2008;Cole and Shafer, 2002;Robb, 2002;Sifneos, Cake, and Kentula, 1992). To enhance the utility of regional LCDs to natural resource managers, a few best management practices should be incorporated into the creation, quality control, and analysis of the LCDs. First, wetland classification accuracy will be increased if the source imagery (e.g., aerial photography) is acquired more frequently during leaf-off season and on cloud-free days. This will decrease errors of omission and commission climate conditions, changes in land uses (e.g., ditching), isolated topographical conditions (Tiner et al., 2003), and plant phenology (e.g., transitions from dominant upland to lowland species or woody to emergent species). Fieldwork or analyses of high-resolution imagery should also be conducted to verify wetland edges and boundaries with other land covers (e.g., forest cover, riparian buffers, and water with subaquatic vegetation). Scientists have stressed the importance of ground work to validate inferences on physical and biogeochemical processes made by remote sensing imagery classification and analysis (Cahoon and Turner, 1989;Day et al., 2008;Tiner, 2005;Turner and Rao, 1990) Corps mostly issued nationwide permits (56%) followed by state program permits (19%). Even though the majority of permits were issued for estuarine wetland projects (76%), the majority of wetland loss occurred in palustrine emergent and forested wetlands  (Brooks, Wardrop, and Bishop, 2004;Costanza et al., 1997;Ingram and Foster 2008;Moglen et al., 2011;Nichols and Strobel, 1991;Phillips et al., 2007;Weller et al., 2007). All of these services are vulnerable to diminishing returns when wetlands are lost, degraded, or impaired (e.g., altering of landscape position and nutrient absorption due to inundation). Due in part to their substantial value to society, scientists and policymakers need a better understanding of the long term impacts of anthropogenic development and climate change on wetland conversion. Even with federal and state policies (e.g., Section 404 of the Clean Water Act) to decrease wetland disturbance and loss, not much is known about how these policies impact wetland change on regional spatial and decadal temporal scales (Brody et al., 2008). The primary goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA) are: 1) to reduce the release of pollutants into waters of the U.S., and 2) to regulate surface water quality. Section 404 of the CWA outlines the permitting program for activities that could result in the release of dredged and fill materials into waters of the U.S., which includes wetlands. Unlike most existing research on wetland permitting that focuses on federal permits, this research aggregates state with federal permitting records to identify spatial and temporal trends, patterns, indicators, and impacts of wetland permitting on the tristate Delmarva Peninsula between 1980 and 2010."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Change in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed", "text": "Over time, the health and functions of wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay watersheds have been stressed, degraded, or permanently altered due to anthropogenic and natural causes. Scientists and policymakers agree that there is a clear linkage between human-induced land uses, land cover change and wetland loss in the Chesapeake Bay region (Tiner 1995;Weller et al., 2007). The primary stressors in the Delmarva Peninsula are agriculture, silviculture, urbanization, and transportation. Numerous studies support the concept that land cover/land use change directly affects wetland loss in the Chesapeake Bay as well as on the Delmarva Peninsula (Brooks et al., 2004;Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Kearney & Rogers, 2010;Mayer & Lopez, 2011;Weller et al., 2007). For centuries, wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula have been drained, filled, and dredged without sufficient governmental regulations to overcome wetland loss due to the increasing demands for agriculture, residential development, recreation and tourism, shipping, and transportation (Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Phillips et al., 2007). Coastal development has magnified the negative impacts of natural hazards like storm events and sea level rise on wetland habitats, agricultural soils, and coastal cities. Intense agriculture along with rising household density in coastal areas has increased the demand for transportation infrastructure (e.g., roadways and railroads). Subsequent increases in impervious surfaces have required the alteration and removal of wetland, which has weakened the ability of wetlands to absorb surface-water runoff, resulting in an increase in vulnerability to flooding. Continuing to intensify agriculture activities like the poultry industry without maintaining a healthy, connected wetland ecosystem to compensate for the effects of nutrient runoff will likely lead to decreases in water quality."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Management Policies", "text": "While federal policies like Swampbuster, a provision of the Food Security Act of 1985 that discourages farmers from converting wetlands to croplands, have succeeded in reducing the conversion of wetlands to agriculture, wetlands continue to be converted into developed land covers through urbanization. Subsequently, federal, state, and local agencies collaborated to design and implement policies like Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to protect, preserve, and restore wetlands nationwide, especially in regions experiencing heavy residential and commercial development like the Gulf Coast and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (Taylor, 2014). The CWA authorizes the US Army Corps of Engineers as well as state and local agencies to design, manage, review, administer and enforce permits for development. In 1990, an Executive Order introduced a national goal of \"No Net Wetland Loss\" in order to help states and counties control the alteration, fragmentation, and degradation of their wetland habitats on national, regional, and local scales (Connolly et al., 2005;Copeland, 2010). Temporally and spatially intact databases of national and state wetland permitting records as well as restoration programs exist that can be monitored, processed, and analyzed. However, there is still a limited understanding of how these policies have impacted wetlands on a regional spatial scale and decadal temporal scale (Brody et al., 2008;Peyre et al., 2001). There is a demand for research that crosses political and physical boundaries, and that uses time series data to identify trends, patterns, and drivers of wetland change, because trends, patters, drivers, and impacts of wetland change are not always short term, and site specific. Geographic assessments of wetland change and permitting assessments on multiple spatial scales (e.g., national, regional, state, and (sub)watershed) are important because they aid policymakers in identifying: 1) locations that need to be zoned as critical areas or banking areas in order to prevent wetland loss or degradation, 2) wetland ecosystems that have experienced so much loss that total destruction is eminent, even if policies or regulations will be implemented, and 3) locations that are suitable for compensatory mitigation (e.g., highway cloverleaf interchanges). A clearer picture of the cumulative impacts of wetland change drivers will help decision makers identify the most vulnerable wetland areas. Policymakers also need interdisciplinary mapping techniques that examine physical and socioeconomic dimensions of wetland change in order to determine the benefits of compensatory measures, restoration efforts, and best management practices (BMPs).\nIn order to address negative impacts of wetland loss on water quality and stormwater management, scientists and policymakers have had to implement legislation like the Food Security Act of 1985 (\"Swampbuster\") and a series of \"U.S. Farm Bills\". These legislations promoted wetland restoration and conservation by discouraging wetland conversion through financial penalties, introducing wetland mitigation banking options, and creating long term easements to limit wetland alteration (Connolly et al., 2005;ELI 2015). Federal and state agencies continue to seek improvements in enforcing compensatory mitigation to counter wetland loss and implementing a formal wetland mapping procedures and standards to improve the spatial and temporal monitoring of \"No Net Loss\" goals. However, the nation still lacks a common wetland management, monitoring, and protection law that defines universal regulations, jurisdictional definitions, delineation and mapping methods, and data management standards (Connolly et al., 2005;ASWM, 2016). Policies like the Section 404 -Wetland Permitting Program of the Clean Water Act (CWA) were created to reduce wetland loss from the discharge of fill materials and to increase wetland restoration (Connolly et al., 2005). However, these policies and regulations have not been able to meet \"No Net Loss\" goals due to unintentional complications like evolving definitions of the \"Waters of the U.S.\" as well as intentionally exempted activities like agriculture and silviculture. Also, the regulatory powers in wetland permitting programs often falls in the hands of state and local government agencies. These entities are often limited in capacity to effectively monitor the processes and impacts of the permitted activities and to enforce compensatory mitigation. The impact of a permitted activity often depends on the project scope, the area of influence, the surrounding landscape conditions, the permit type, and the nature of the permitted activity. For example, Section 404 general permits are designed to have minimal adverse impacts to wetlands, while individual permits tend to be more complex with negative impacts on wetlands requiring compensatory mitigation measures (Brody et al., 2005;Taylor, 2014). The impacts of permitted activities also reflect the relationship between socioeconomic priorities as well as physical conditions (e.g., landscape) at spatial scales larger than the project site and temporal scales longer than the length of the project. For example, estuarine wetlands have often fallen outside of the scope of the agricultural conservation initiatives.. Plus, these initiatives focused on the management and efficiency of human efforts, not natural processes like climate change and habitat. Communities located in areas that are challenged by human and non-human drivers as well as ongoing impacts (e.g., urbanization, water quality degradation, silviculture sea level rise, salinization, and recession) continue to struggle to design and maintain sustainable wetland management plans. Despite federal, state, and local legislation, wetland loss has increased in some locations due to exemptions in the permitting system and limited resources to monitor and enforce wetland regulations. Urbanization has replaced agriculture as the primary threat to wetland conversion on the peninsula due to commuters and retirees sprawling from urban centers like Washington, DC, Philadelphia, PA, and Norfolk, VA into suburban and rural areas filled with palustrine, forested wetlands. The introduction, expansion, and revitalization of impervious surface roadways and building structures has been linked to increases in surface runoff, increases in pollutants in waste and stormwater runoff, and decreases in ground water recharge (Brody et al., 2015). Subsequently, numerous species of vegetation have suffered from eutrophication, which comes from nutrient loading and from deoxidized runoff from heated impervious surfaces (Kaller et al., 2013;Kirwan & Megonigal, 2013). In order for \"No Net Loss\" goals to be achieved across multiple state and hydrological boundaries more research is needed forecasting wetland change as a function of landscape conditions, wetland permitting, climate, and socioeconomic variables.."}, {"section_title": "Review of the dimensions of Section 404 Wetland Permitting of the CWA", "text": "Wetland Permitting Data Sets. The goals of federal and state wetland permitting programs and regulations are generally: 1) to maintain a no net loss of wetland coverage nationwide and in each state, 2) to require mitigation of degraded or lost wetlands, and 3) to minimize the impacts of permitted activities on wetland health and ecosystem services (Connolly et al., 2005;Copeland 2010). This section explains the types, purposes, duration and jurisdiction of each permit under Section 404. Federal -General and Individual Permits. The goal of general permits is to reduce the complexity, time span, and cost of redundant individual permit processes. General permits can be issued on nationwide or regional scales, and reissued every five years. The majority of these permits address projects involving discharge of dredged or filled materials and have specific conditions to minimize negative environmental impacts (Brody et al., 2007;Brody et al., 2008; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2015). Nationwide general permits are issued by USACE, and generally apply to activities that commonly occur across the nation like residential development, utilities, and wetland restoration projects (Brody et al., 2008;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2015). In order to ensure minimal impacts, they also include regulatory conditions like compensatory mitigation measures for the wetlands altered or removed and adherence to the Coastal Zone Management Act (ELI, 2008;ELI, 2010). Each specified state agency, like the MDE, has the authority to review and enforce additional conditions on permits for tidal and/or non-tidal wetlands (MDE, 2008;MDE, 2009). In accordance with Section 401 to protect water quality, each permit must pass Section 401 Water Quality Certification regulations. In cooperation with reviewers like the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USACE has the authority to suspend, modify, revoke, or authorize nationwide or regional permits on a case-by-case basis. Regional general permits are also designed, reviewed, and enforced by the USACE, but can be issued for a larger area (e.g., region) like a full state or watershed (e.g., the Chesapeake Act (Copeland, 2010). The permits must also adhere to state and local permitting, environmental, water quality, and zoning regulations. All approved general permits must also address activities related to issues like soil erosion, aquatic life movement, water quality, natural resources, waterfowl breeding, resource waters, and wild/scenic rivers (ELI, 2008;ELI, 2010). As previously mentioned, a permit can be denied due to the violation of any of the statutory regulations, adverse environmental effects, or site specific conditions. If so, the applicant will be directed towards a revision process, an individual permit application, or letter of permission. Individual permits tend to have work plans that are more complex and outside of the scope of general permit, thus requiring a formal agency and public review (Copeland, 2010;ELI, 2008;ELI, 2010). Two types of individual permits can be obtained through the USACE or voluntarily by an individual state: standard permits or letters of permission. If the permit application is submitted to the state, the USACE and the state often offer a joint application and review process that follows the Corps application procedures (ASWM, 2016;Copeland, 2010;ELI, 2008;ELI, 2015). Each permit can be issued, denied, amended, suspended, or revoked through cooperative work between the USACE and state agencies. Letters of permission are created to streamline and abbreviate the individual permit application process. In order to gain approval of a letter of permission, the project must have minimal impacts on ecosystems and habitats (ELI, 2008). Through state legislation and local regulations, officials can wetland management policies according to certain activities (e.g., excavation for building a residential structure) and/or wetland type (e.g., tidal or non-tidal) (ELI, 2008). Individual permits with activities that could have significant environmental impacts often avoid denial by containing compensatory mitigation measures to prevent environmental degradation (e.g., wetland banking, 1 to 1 acre replacement, the purchase of existing wetland cover for preservation, etc.), subsequent revisions to address concerns noted by reviewers, the addition of specific conditions to the application (e.g., long term monitoring requirements by the reviewer, or pre-application meetings with the Corps, federal, state, or local agencies (ELI, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Existing Research on Wetland Change and Permitting", "text": "The majority of research on wetland change and permitting in the North America has focused on wetland permitting and the compensatory mitigation component of Section 404, rather than the relationships between the geographic distribution of permits, locations and trends of wetland loss, and the drivers of wetland loss (Brody et al,. 2008;Cole & Shafer, 2002;Robb, 2002;Sifneos et al., 1992). The research targets mitigation measures and restoration efforts after a wetland or its ecosystem has been altered (Bendor, 2009;Cole & Shafer, 2002;Gardner et al., 2009;Kentula et al., 1992, Sifneos et al., 1992. Compensatory measures include activities like the creation of new wetlands to complement the number of acres lost from a specific activity or the insertion of depleted vegetation in degraded wetlands (Doyle et al., 2012;Goldman et al., 2015;Perry et al., 2001). With the majority of wetland permits being approved, compensatory mitigation stands as one of the primary application requirements regulators can use to force the applicants to reduce the short and long term impacts of wetland loss or degradation. The effectiveness and sustainability of compensatory measures can be tracked, and this increases the ability of regulators to enforce codes and penalties. The majority of pre and post permit research focuses on the performance of wetlands, impacts to landscape conditions, cumulative impacts, and potential drivers of wetland loss (Kelly, 2001;Stein & Ambrose, 1998). Most existing research on wetland change or permitting on the study region has only focused on wetland change on short term, local scales, or on the functionality of specific wetland types in watersheds like the Nanticoke and Chincoteague (Cohen et al., 2016;Moglen et al., 2011;NOAA, 2012;Nosakhare et al., 2012;Tiner, 2004;Tiner, 2005). The closest approach to capturing trends of wetland change has come from a series of reports from the FWS (Dahl, 1990(Dahl, , 2000Tiner et al., 1986;Tiner et al., 2011;Tiner et al., 2012). Studies that have focused on spatial and temporal trends and patterns of wetland permitting have targeted wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico, the West Coast, the Mid-Atlantic, and Canada (Brody et al., 2008;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994). For example, Brody et al., (2008) examined the Section 404 permitting program in the Gulf Coast region. Results for the Florida study area found that 57% of permits were distributed inside urban areas and 51% outside of 100-year floodplains between 1993 and 2003 (Brody et al., 2008). For the Texas portion of the study area, 78% fell inside urban areas and 61% outside the 100 year floodplain. The wetland types most impacted by permits in Texas were estuarine and palustrine in Florida. Clare and Creed (2014) examined the relationship between wetland management policies and change in a watershed in Alberta, Canada from 1999 to 2009They found that 80% of the area of wetland loss occurred in wetlands that were not being managed under a permitting system. The study also highlighted challenges in the government's information management and data sharing strategies, which has led to regulatory oversight. Their wetlands inventory and land use analysis discovered that the majority of the wetlands in the study area were being converted in to agriculture or urban/industrial land uses. "}, {"section_title": "National Wetland Inventory (NWI).", "text": "The NWI is the finest spatial resolution and most comprehensive national wetland mapping initiative. Furthermore, it also produces more accurate data than other national mapping programs. The NWI is a comprehensive database of wetland maps and GIS layers produced using moderate to fine resolution aerial photographs and satellite imagery combined with field verification and ancillary data (FGDC, 1998;Nichols, 1994 1992 to 1996, 1996 to 2001, 2001 to 2006, and 2006 to 2010 using C-CAP. The same analysis was repeated for developed land cover classes (e.g., urban and built-up lands), natural/undeveloped classes (e.g., forest and rangeland), and agricultural/cultivated land cover. A time series of maps illustrating the \"hot spots\" of wetland change at the MCD scale was created for each category (e.g., developed, undeveloped, and agricultural/cultivated) by visually defining MCDs with the highest percentages of wetland change (e.g., loss and gain). Hot spots were also defined as clusters of MCD's with similar high (or low) densities of wetland permitting. Descriptive Analysis of Wetland Permits. For the descriptive analysis of the permit records, permits were first assigned one of the following wetland system classifications by overlaying each dataset onto an NWI layer: estuarine, lacustrine, marine, palustrine, and riverine wetland (Cowardin et al. 1979). Due to variations in the positional accuracy and projection and coordinate systems of NWI polygons and permit records, permit location points did not always fall inside a NWI polygon. In this case, the nearest NWI polygon attributes were transferred to permit locations within a 400 meter radius. This radius was calculated using the ArcGIS Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation tool, which used z-scores to identify the 400 meter distance as the statistically significant peak z-score that reflected the radius at which clustering of permits was most pronounced. Permits with distances to the nearest NWI polygon greater than 400 meters were excluded from this part of the analysis. Of the 26,968 permits received from the USACE and respective state agencies, about13% (n = 3,451) were excluded because of insufficient geographic information or duplication. ArcGIS was used to measure the quantity and percentage of permits in each state, county, MCD, and wetland system. The quantities and percentages of permits as well as the quantities and percentages of change in the number of permits from one time period to another were calculated at approximately 5 year intervals from 1980 to 2010. These time periods were intentionally staggered to complement the time periods used to analyze wetland change using the C-CAP and CBLCD regional data sets: 1984, 1992, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2010. Because the results from analyzing of the quantity of permits alone may be potentially spatially biased due to highly developed areas also being located on coastal landscapes, two variables analyzing the density of permits were normalized by dividing the quantity of permits in each MCD by 1) the area of the respective MCD, and 2) the area of wetland cover in the respective MCD. The density of the change in the quantity of permits was also calculated for each of the previously mentioned time periods. Hot Spot Analysis of Wetland Change and Permitting. First, I identified the locations (e.g., MCDs) and wetland systems with the highest densities of wetland permitting. Second, spatial and temporal trends of permitting were analyzed from 1980 to 2010 using the selected time periods. In order to identify the locations of statistically significant hot and cold spots of wetland permits by year. Third, the ArcGIS Optimized Hot Spot Analysis tool was used to examine the z-scores (e.g., the intensity of spatial clustering) and p-values (e.g., the statistical significance) of the spatial distribution of the permit densities, normalized by the area of each MCD, for each year (Chainey, 2011;ESRI, 2016). This method was chosen because it identifies statistically significant clusters of high (hot) and low (cold) values of permit density. All permit types were given the same weight, because there were no attributes (e.g., area of impact) that could be confidently used to differentiate the magnitude of impacts of each permit. For example, an MCD with a low density of permits could contain one large institution (e.g., industrial or academic institution) that acquired a permit that lasted for 5 years and negatively impacted the nearest wetland as well as wetlands downstream from the institution."}, {"section_title": "Geo-statistical Analysis of the Correlation between Wetland Permitting and", "text": "Change. The end goal was to determine if the locations and time periods of high permit density were randomly distributed and to relate it to different land covers using correlation variables. It could also be used to verify that activities that may have been exempt from permitting (e.g., agriculture) still had a strong, positive correlation with wetland loss. Inversely, it would support the concept that lower levels of wetland permitting would occur in locations that maintained undisturbed, natural land cover (e.g., forests). First, I calculated the following variables at the MCD scale for each time period: 1) the acreage and density of wetland coverage converted from wetland to another land cover type and vice-versa, 2) the acreage and density of developed, natural, and agricultural coverages, and 3) the density of wetland permits.  1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Suburban sprawl has led to series of residential developments along with the creation and expansion of roadways throughout the Delmarva Peninsula resulting in wetland alteration and removal. The density of impervious roads (Den_IMPRD) was calculated using a 30 meter resolution LCD provided by the Chesapeake Bay Program Office (CBPO, 2016). Next, the number and percentage permits within a floodplain defined by the FEMA 100-year flood hazard layer was calculated. For counties without a FEMA-defined layer, attributes from the SSURGO database were queried to create a floodplain layer that was appended to the FEMA layer (Sangwan, 2013). Existing research has shown that development and wetland disturbances within floodplains magnify the impacts of flooding events (Brody et al., 2008). Lastly, the correlations between the density of wetland loss (Den_WLOSS), the density of total permits (Den_TPERM), the percentage of total permits issued in the floodplain (Prct_PERM_FLD), and the percentage of wetland loss that occurred within the floodplain (Prct_WLOSS_FLD) at the MCD scale were calculated in R using the Kendall Tau rank correlation test.

The periods of increase and decrease in the number of permits of all permits in all states) followed by estuarine wetlands (n = 402; 1.7%) (See Figure   3.4 and Table 3.1). The number of permits issued in palustrine wetlands appeared low, because of the omission of numerous DE permitting records due to insufficient geographic information (e.g. latitude and longitude) needed to map the permits. Nationwide permits accounted for 70% of the permits in DE, while standard (individual) permits accounted for 25% of the permits in the state. In Maryland, almost 78% of permits were directed towards projects that fell near estuarine systems, while almost 20% of the permits had the potential to impact palustrine wetlands (See Figure 3.4, Table 3.1, and   Table 3.2 Study Area's Section 404 permits by nearest wetland system type: 1980 -2010. Within the study area, 3,675 permits lacked digital NWI data and/or fell outside of the 400m buffer and subsequently were not included. The percentage of wetland permits granted outside of urban areas in 1980 (e.g., the beginning of the study period) was 80% greater than the percentage granted inside urban areas (See Figure 3.5). From 1980 to 1994 the majority of wetland permits were issued outside of urban areas, with the peak occurring during the late 1980s (almost 100%). This trend reinforced patterns of suburban sprawl and coastal development. The continuous gap was not diminished until 1994. The disparity between urban and nonurban permits leveled off until 2004, when the gap began to increase again between 2004 and 2010 (e.g., 60% outside versus 40% inside. The urban areas with the highest concentrations of (overall) permits were all located in Delaware.     "}, {"section_title": "Wetland Types influenced by Permitting", "text": "Though the majority of permits were issued for estuarine wetlands, the majority of wetland loss occurred in palustrine forested and emergent wetlands. Two potential reasons for these results are: 1) more Section 404 regulations are applied to estuarine wetlands, and 2) a greater abundance of small projects on homes (e.g., the building of docks) that result in the loss of small patches of estuarine wetlands. With hot spots of wetland permitting located in suburban areas along transportation corridors between coastal and upland communities, these results also imply that residential development from suburban sprawl and subsequent roadway expansion will continue to disturb, disconnect, and replace palustrine wetlands. In order to maintain \"No Net Loss\" and to prevent increased flooding from increasing the impervious surfaces, entities like the MD State Highway Administration will need to focus compensatory mitigation efforts on transportation corridors that connect urban centers. For example, the proposed railway system for commuters and shipping along Highway 113 in the portion of the Peninsula would require nationwide and general permits along with extensive compensatory mitigation due to the large scope and impacted area of wetlands. Cutting edge wetland mapping programs combined with cooperative wetland banking and BMPs will help states and localities monitor and identify wetland ecosystems that are appropriate for restoration and preservation. The results also show that wetlands are affected by other anthropogenic drivers like agriculture, which are exempt from the Section 404 program. This finding has significant policy implications because it reinforces the need for the expansion and funding of wetland preservation and restoration programs like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wetland Easement Program, which has concluded. Programs like these that support BMPs have become vital towards not infringing on the agricultural industry and simultaneously maintaining the hydrological functions and landscape conditions of wetlands."}, {"section_title": "Challenges with Existing Permitting Processes", "text": "Ecologists and wetland scientists have voiced concerns of potential problems related to the permitting process that negatively impact wetlands, habitats, and water quality (Connolly, 2006;Copeland, 2010). First, officials have no systematic method of reporting and tracking wetland change on an annual scale. The closest mechanisms that are used to track the spatial distribution of wetlands and temporal trends and patterns of change are the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) geospatial datasetwhen the dataset is updated, NWI Wetlands the Status and Trends project which is conducted every 5-10 years, and the Natural Resource Inventory (NRI), all of which have spatial and temporal limitations. For example, the frequency of each state's source imagery for the NWI geospatial dataset and NWI Wetlands Status and Trends project varies (e.g., leaf on/off, season, tidal period), which limits the feasibility and accuracy of time series analysis of wetland change on regional scales (Taylor, 2014). Similar to the NWI Wetlands Status and Trends project, the NRI is also based on sampling, wetland classes, but it the excludes wetlands on federal lands (Brooks et al., 2004;Stein et al., 2012;Taylor, 2014). Researchers should continue to enhance mapping techniques that can be used to systematically analyze or identify critical areas of wetland change. Second, legal and political issues complicate the effective regulation, enforcement, and evaluation of Section 404 permits. Issues that might lead to less effective wetland regulation include the ambiguity of regulatory definitions/terminologies like \"fill material\" and \"waters of United States\", the exemption of select activities, and the omission of wetland functionality and water quality variables from the formal review process. For example, activities related to wetland farming, ranching, forestry, and wetland draining activities are often exempt from review, despite their direct impacts on wetland coverage, functionality, and sustainability. Third, policymakers and permit applicant have aimed to decrease the complexity and amount of time required to review and approve permits. However, it wasn't until the late 1980s that officials and scientists began to redirect their basis of decision making to include spatial and temporal trends of wetland loss (Connolly et al., 2005, The White House, 1993Tiner & Finn, 1986;Tiner et al., 2011;Tiner et al., 2012). Despite the implementation of \"No Net Loss\" policy, the additional research is still needed to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the permitting system in reducing wetland loss on a regional scale. In order to evaluate the status of \"no net loss\" benchmarks, federal and state agencies must track the acreage of net wetland loss on state and nationwide scales (ELI, 2010;MDE, 2016). Maryland and Virginia's \"no net loss\" initiatives are tied to their non-tidal regulation programs. Maryland's strategy requires mitigation measures for any wetland loss and a monitoring of wetland change on the watershed scale. Virginia's strategy also has compensatory measures and incentive programs to reduce wetland loss and promote gain. Finally, the indicators used to evaluate the impacts and efficiency of the permit distribution are limited in scale, breadth, and frequency (Peyre et al., 2001). None of the states in this study utilize a tool that goes beyond sampling techniques to track permitting patterns and their potential impacts on the acreage of wetland cover. For example, when evaluating the impacts of permit applications, the evaluator may not be required or equipped with the resources to consider the cumulative impacts that a high concentration of permits or the historical impacts of permitted activities around the project site may have had on the subwatershed(s) wetland coverage, water quality, or habitat. Currently, federal and state agencies have pioneered the development of geospatial tools (e.g., the Wetlands Resource Registry) that integrate socioeconomic and environmental indicators to improve the design and implementation of policies dealing with wetland restoration, water quality, and smart growth (Moglen et al., 2011). However, inclusion of wetland change and permitting indicators could strengthen the efficiency of these tools."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "3.5", "text": "This study was conducted to identify spatial and temporal trends and patterns of wetland change and permitting on the Delmarva Peninsula between 1980 and 2010. Spatially, palustrine wetland loss was concentrated around urban centers and expanded into suburbs. Estuarine wetland loss was concentrated on the Atlantic Coast, on the south western corner, and northeastern corner of the peninsula. Temporally, wetland loss and permitting increased until 2006, except in VA where permitting continues to increase, likely to counter drivers of wetland loss that are not directly human mediated such as sea level rise. The majority of permits were distributed in MD (91%) for urban development in the tourist center of Worcester County. Permits were mainly distributed outside of urban areas in suburbia until the early 1990's, and did not begin targeting the suburbs again until 2004. The Corps mostly issued nationwide permits (56%), followed by state program permits (19%). Even though the majority of permits were issued for estuarine wetland projects (76%), the majority of wetland loss occurred in palustrine emergent and forested wetlands (78%). This finding highlighted the issue that permits are being issued in part to respond to hazards, such as shoreline erosion. The results supported the hypothesis that wetland permitting and loss had statistically significant correlations with residential development, impervious roads, and floodplain characteristics. General permits dominated the permit types issued on the Peninsula. As indicated in the results, general permits likely signaled urban and suburban sprawl. Unlike individual permits, general permits are designed to expedite the application process for projects that have minimal impacts on wetlands. However, each permit is reviewed independently, meaning that the continual issuance of permits for residential neighborhoods in a suburban corridor could have major long term, cumulative impacts on hydrological conditions (e.g., connectivity, stormwater retention, and streamflow) surrounding the developed areas. As shown in past research, individual (standard) permits are often issued for development projects with larger footprints into wetlands (Brody et al 2007). Examples of these projects include the conversion of forests and wetlands into impervious roads and non-roads (e.g., buildings and rooftops), both of which reduce the ability of wetlands to absorb stormwater and nutrient loads.  Wetlands play a critical role in maintaining balances in a variety of ecosystem conditions like hydrological conditions, biodiversity, and water quality (Chase et al., 2003;Tablante et al,. 2002). Wetlands reduce flooding, mitigate nutrient loads, restore groundwater, and provide habitat for migratory species (Moglen et al., 2007;Neilson et al., 2007;Rogers & McCarty, 2000). Numerous plant and animal species depend on wetland ecosystems for vegetation and refuge (Bachman et al., 1998;Rogers & McCarty, 2000). The environmental and economic value of these ecological services has been magnified by continuous wetland degradation and loss. Scientists and policymakers need geostatistical models of wetland change and its drivers in order to construct policies that will reduce the negative impacts of activities permitted by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The purposes of this paper were to test the hypothesis that wetland change is predictable from landscape conditions and context, and to develop a statistical model to predict wetland loss as a function of the landscape, wetland permitting, climate, and socioeconomic variables using the case study from Sussex County, DE."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Wetland Change", "text": "Wetland functions and resilience are often influenced by their landscape position, regional climate patterns, and impacts from human development (Brooks et al., 2004;Hartmann & Goldstein, 1994;Weller et al., 2007). With the Delmarva Peninsula possessing over one third of the wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, wetland loss continues to increase the risks of flooding in coastal communities as well as water quality degradation from unregulated agriculture and the poultry industry. Historically, agriculture was the primary land use that degraded and prompted the removal of freshwater and tidal wetlands. Agricultural activities like drainage and stream diversion have permanently altered hydrologic conditions, fragmented habitats, and interrupted surface and groundwater flow/tables. Hydrologic alterations of wetland landscape conditions have also weakened the ability of wetlands to absorb and drain the nutrients and sediments from agriculture and silviculture. Since the late 1700's, the states that comprise the Delmarva Peninsula have seen an average of 50% of wetlands converted into non-wetlands like agriculture and impervious surfaces (Dahl, 1990;Fretwell, Williams, & Redman, 1996). Between the 1950 and 1970, the primary drivers of wetland loss on the peninsula consisted of agricultural cultivation, dredging/channelization, ponding, and urbanization (Tiner & Finn, 1986). The Mid-Atlantic Region continues to experience surges in population growth and residential development, which has increases the demand for policies and comprehensive plans that address the impacts of increasing impervious surfaces as well as sea level rise (Jantz et al., 2010;Jantz et al., 2011;Klemas, 2007). For example, the expansion of infrastructure like sea walls to protect residential and commercial structures from stormwater runoff and flash flooding has been linked to wetland loss and fragmentation (Dahl & Stedman, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Differences in Wetland Permitting", "text": "When addressing wetland change and permitting on a long term, regional scale, it is challenging to account for numerous differences in federal, state, and local wetland policies, regulations, definition, and mapping methods (ELI, 2008;ASWM, 2016). For example, federal wetland delineation methods can be applied to federal and state wetlands. However, states have created delineation methods that can be applied to nonfederal wetlands. Contrasts in wetland definitions and delineations methods complicate the ability to assess trends, patterns, drivers, and impacts wetland change. These contrasts have the potential to lead to inconsistencies in regulations and permitting, like underestimating riparian buffers or exempting activities that could pose a threat to downstream wetland habitats. Currently, each state on the Delmarva Peninsula possesses a different role and responsibility in evaluating permit applications, monitoring wetland change, and enforcing compensatory mitigation regulations. Often states must base their conservation plans on different economic circumstances, transportation systems, and development plans (ELI, 2008). There are also contrasts in \"No Net Loss\" policies and incentives to encourage wetland preservation. One commonality between all states is the need for accurate time series analyses and geospatial models that accurately identify and predict spatial and temporal trends and patterns of wetland change."}, {"section_title": "4.2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Source Data", "text": "In a regional descriptive analysis of wetland trends and patterns, Tiner et al. (2011) found that major drivers of wetland change in the state of Delaware were related to the cultivation of land for agriculture, urbanization, and alterations in hydrogeomorphic conditions (e.g., hydro periods, and limitations in wetland management policies). In order to define the binary, dependent variable of wetland loss wetland loss, the land use and land cover data from the NOAA -C-CAP were used to identify pixels (Table 4.1) that were classified as wetland cover in 1992, 2001, and/or 2010, to determine if they either maintained wetland cover classification, or were converted into a nonwetland cover (e.g., agriculture, developed space, forest, open space, or water). These time periods were selected because C-CAP land cover data was available in 4 to 5 year increments from 1992 to 2010, and also maintained a constant methodology and classification scheme. This made it possible to explore the statistical relationships between wetland loss and anthropogenic and landscape drivers/stressors. Wetland loss (WLOSS), the binary response variable, served as the dependent variable, and was an indicator of wetland loss between 1992, 2001, and 2010. If wetland loss occurred, the pixel was reclassified 1; if the pixel classification did not change from wetland, the pixel was reclassified 0. The WLOSS pixels were then converted from a rasterized pixel to a vector point layer, and were also spatially joined with NWI polygons to identify NWI polygons that experienced wetland loss between 1992 and 2010. In addition to direct extraction or alteration, wetlands respond to changes in landscape conditions and processes. In order to assess the drivers of wetland change, a number of landscape condition and local (proximity) variables were combined into a multi-layer, raster geodatabase. Similar to studies by Daniels and Cumming (2008) and Gutzwiller and Flather (2011), the independent variables were divided into two categories (local and landscape) of wetland drivers in order to account for the wetland conversion conditions and process that cross multiple spatial scales. Local variables (polygon-based variables) were derived with respect to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service NWI geospatial dataset(s) ( Table 4.1). The suite of local variables included elevation (USGS) (Wetlands at lower elevations were expected to be more prone to conversion to water, and wetlands at higher elevations to be more prone to conversion to developed land covers) and slope (Wetlands at higher slopes were expected to be more prone to conversion). Elevation and slope (10 meter) for the WLOSS points was from the U.S. Landscape variables were derived primarily from a hybrid 30-m land cover data set that comprised of NOAA's C-CAP (circa 1992 -2010) (Table 4.1). As discussed in Daniels and Cumming (2008)  open water (C-CAP; CBP). Impervious road and non-road (e.g., buildings) data (10 meter) were obtained from the Chesapeake Bay Program.

First, for each raster cell in the WLOSS geodatabase, the dependent variable (WLOSS) and its corresponding values for each of the proposed independent variables were extracted from the database Third, VIFs were calculated in order to distinguish the multicollinearities between the independent variables and to assess the independent influence of each variable on the risk of wetland loss. A common rule of thumb that values of VIF that are greater than 10 could represent serious multicollinearity (Neter, 1996). However, variables with higher values do not always nullify the regression analysis results and are not required to be removed from the model (O'Brien, 2007;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2010). For this study, independent variables with an \"infinite\" VIF goodness of fit, were deemed to have high multicollinearity (e.g., with one or more of the other variables) and were removed from the pool of independent variables. The VIF was recalculated until all of the independent variables had a goodness of fit less than was not infinite, or was deemed necessary. VIF was chosen over methods like stepwise regression, because it allowed the user to assess multicollinearity and to control the order of selection and removal of the independent variables. Fourth, a PCA was performed to: 1) identify linear groupings of the independent variables that are uncorrelated with one another and 2) determine which groupings variables had the strongest relationships and influence of the variance of the probability of wetland loss. The set of landscape (driver) variables were rotated along orthogonal axes via the principal components analysis (PCA) and varimax rotation functions in R, which decreased multicollinearity and increased the ability to differentiate the independent variables that had the highest loadings in each grouping (Gutzwiller & Flather, 2010). VIF and PCA methods have been used together in numerous ecological modelling studies on predicting wetland vulnerability (McCauley et al., 2013), the drivers of wetland conversion (Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2010;Sanneke et al., 2013). In order to address the limited ability to interpret PCA results, the VIF analysis was performed prior to the PCA. The end goals were to identify the groupings of the predictor variables and to rank each grouping by its proportion of loadings. After running the PCA with the varimax function, the similarities between variables high loadings (e.g., infinite) in each of the four to five resulting PCA groupings were examined.

When evaluating the overall quality of model, the AIC estimates the loss of information associated with the model's parameters (Anderson, 2010). AIC is statistical metric that has been used in numerous analyses related to ecological, climate change, land cover change modelling (Overmars et al., 2003;Rutherford et al., 2008;Ghazoul, 2010;Warren & Seifert, 2011). Fourth, the Area under the curve (AUC) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots (See Figures 4.2) were generated to evaluate the accuracy and strength of the model's predictions. The ROC curve illustrates a model's probability of successfully predicting wetland loss (sensitivity; the x-axis) versus the probability of successfully predicting no change (specificity; the y-axis). With AUC ranging from 0 to 1, a model with a strong discriminative ability would have an out-bowed curve with a peak closer to the upper left corner of the plot (1,1), and would have an AUC closer to 1. On the other hand, a model with a random relationship, virtually no discriminative ability, between the predictor and the outcome would display a curve closer to a 45-degree angle, and would have an AUC closer to 0.5 (Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Steyerbery et al., 2010) Finally, I analyzed the model coefficients used in the logistic regression equation, based on the orthogonally rotated variables, in order to decipher the strength and importance of the independent variables in predicting wetland loss."}, {"section_title": "4.3", "text": "The results section consisted of summaries of the rotated principal component (PCA) analyses, the variance inflation factor (VIF) analyses, the logistic regression models (GLM), and the validation of each model's performance and accuracy. Overall, the results provided support for the hypothesis that wetland loss in Sussex County, DE is predictable from landscape setting and conditions. The importance of landscape conditions in this instance provided beneficial insights into the trends, patterns, and processes of wetland loss. The landscape variables chosen for the model were moderately strong and statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlates of changes in wetland coverage. When interpreting principle components based on their coefficients, the relative order of influence of the drivers of wetland loss from highest to lowest was: residential development and wetland permits (RC1), landscape conditions with respect to water (RC2), impervious surfaces and urban areas (RC3), and precipitation and soil erosion (RC3). This order suggests a hierarchical structure of drivers in which the physical landscape (hydrogeomorphic conditions and processes) may provide the greatest explanation for landscape process that are more regional in nature, subsequently driving wetland loss at a larger (regional and non-political) and temporal (decadal) scales. The results support the hypotheses that models founded on landscape conditions and characteristics can be used to predict wetland loss. Residential development, urbanization, and permitting have driven wetland loss in urban, suburban, coastal, and upland areas throughout the county and Delmarva Peninsula. It also supports the hypotheses that wetlands at lower elevations and tidal conditions are at risk to loss to inundation due to factors and processes like sea level rise and erosion. The results also reiterate the importance of decreasing multicollinearity (e.g., minimizing the number of independent variables prior to a PCA) in order to decrease prediction errors and to increase accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Predictor Variable Selection -Variance Inflation Factor", "text": "The independent variables for the tested models included RC1, RC2, RC3, and RC4 (See Table 4.2).

The final PCA varimax rotation was run with the factors identified by the original distribution of PCA eigenvalues. This section summarizes the results of final PCA varimax rotation by illustrating the rotated structure matrices. The final composite predictor variables were comprised of 49 variables (See Table 4.4). With respect to the binary dependent variable of wetland change, communalities were relatively high (greater than or equal to 0.50) except for variables related to distance to agriculture, tidal classification, average slope, the ranges of elevation and slope, and the acreages of Census block groups, which supports the concept that VIF and PCA reduce dimensionality while explaining the majority of the variance in the original variables (Table 4.2) (Daniels & Cumming, 2008). The rotated matrix (Table   4.3) had a factor of four components.  Table 4.3 Loadings and percentage of variance accounted for by each of the four principal components extracted through principal component analysis Components with an asterisks (*) were considered statistically significant (p < 0.05). One PCA with varimax rotation decreased the dimensionality of the 49 variables into four components with statistically significant eigenvalues greater than one, which explained 100% of the original variance (Table 4.2). Communalities were relatively high (above 0.50), except for the tidal classification (0.51), the distance to agriculture (3000m: 0.50; 3500m: 0.53), the majority of topographic elements (e.g., elevation and slope), and the acreage of Census block groups (3000m: 0.49; 3500m: 0.52). This confirmed that PCA reduces the dimensionality of multicollinear variables. It also suggested that the VIF analyses should be repeated to further reduces the dimensionality. The rotated structure matrix (Table 4. . On the second component (RC2), the following variables loaded highly with loadings greater than or equal to 0.75: the distance to the floodplain at both scales (an average of -0.81), the average elevation (-0.82), the distance to the shoreline at both scales (an average of -0.82), and the distance to water at both scales (an average of -0.77). This component represented the hydrological and agricultural gradients of the county (RC2). These results reinforce the relationship with lower elevations and shorter distances to floodplains and shorelines, suggesting that wetlands became more frequently inundated or exposed to saline conditions, which could be correlated with wetland loss. On the third component (RC3), the following variables loaded had moderate to high loadings that were greater than or equal to 0.66: the area of impervious surfaces at both scales (an average of 0.85) and the change in the developed urban areas at both scales with an average of 0.67. This component represented the urbanization gradient of the county (RC3). This result reinforces the relationship of the excavation and filling of wetlands to expand roadways and construct buildings. The fourth component (RC4) was called the precipitation and erosion gradient, because the average soil erosion facts and average quantities of precipitation loaded highly at both scales with precipitation averaging 0.87 and the soil erosion factor averaging 0.84."}, {"section_title": "Model performance and coefficients", "text": "With respect to the model, all four predictor variables were statistically significant at p < 0.05. The order of influence of the drivers of wetland loss revealed that the residential development and permitting gradient (RC1) was the most important correlate of wetland loss, followed by the landscape conditions and hydrology gradient (RC2), urbanization gradient (RC3), and the precipitation and soil erosion gradient (RC4). The exponentiation of the logarithmic model coefficients (e B ) was calcuated. The magnitude of the model coefficients for RC1 was 1.07 (Table 4.2). As RC1 loading scores increased, the quantities of total housing units, the densities of total housing units, and quantities of wetland permits increased. The positive sign on the RC1 coefficient suggested that the likelihood of wetland loss increased as RC1 scores increased. For every unit increase of the residential development and permitting gradient (e.g., increased construction of homes or alteration of the property), the likelihood of wetland loss was approximately equal (e B = 1.07). Results also revealed that landscape condition and hydrology affected the     wetland change and modeling have also concluded that statistically significant relationships exist between wetland loss distances to urban areas, roadways, and agriculture (Daniels & Cumming, 2008;Gutzwiller & Flather, 2011). The results also support the hypothesis that permitted activities like development and excavation for infrastructure also represent significant drivers of wetland loss in uplands as well as lowlands. It also reinforces how roadways like the US-13 corridor from northern DE to southern DE and US-9 that connects tourists to Rehobeth Beach continued to experience increases in impervious cover, and continue to stress wetland conservation. During the 30 year time period, planners and developers had to adapt to drivers of growth as well as changes in landscape conditions due to development as well as natural processes and climate change (e.g. increases in sea levels and surface runoff). Adaptations often resulted in the alteration or removal of wetlands in order to expand infrastructure (e.g., storm walls, dredging, drainage) to reduce the negative impacts of the physical processes on residential and commercial structures. Overall, the results suggest a need for future monitoring and assessments of wetland change due to agriculture, silviculture, and urban growth. Time series and regional land cover change analyses as well as incentivized reporting from farmers and county officials. Despite improvements in tracking trends and patterns of wetland loss, policymakers and planners need a clearer understanding of the importance, variance, and magnitudes of the drivers of wetland loss at different scales."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of the model", "text": "The high quantity of multicollinear variables made it challenging to: 1) decipher the commonalities of the variables in each principal 2) determine the appropriate variables to remove after analyzing the VIFs, and 3) accurately predict wetlands that would experience loss as well as wetlands that would not experience loss.

Wetland management plans must be founded on with regional geospatial data and analyses rather than solely localized, site specific projects that may indirectly miss regional temporal and spatial trends and patterns.

What seemed like straight forward tasks, to determine the quantities, primary locations, and predictors of wetland loss, proved to very complex as spatial and temporal trends, patterns, and impacts of land cover change and wetland permitting records on the Delmarva Peninsula have rarely been examined together. The Delmarva Peninsula was used for this study because of its variation in land cover types, heavy concentrations of freshwater and tidal wetland cover, trends of population growth, active participation in the Clean Water Act -Section 404 wetland permitting program, and its unique position between the Chesapeake Bay, the Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. Wetland inventories and permitting databases on the Delmarva Peninsula were not historically structured to be used as tools to measure impacts from physical and anthropogenic processes, plus estimates of regional wetland change were often assessed by episodic, localized field studies, which limited systematic and regional wetland change analyses. The acquisition of Section 404 permit records from federal and local agencies provided an opportunity to provide descriptive analyses and maps on wetland change and permitting, and a geostatistical model on the predictability of wetland change. These deliverables could improve the understanding of wetland change and the efficiency of federal, state, and local wetland permitting policies on a regional scale. As literature on historic and future wetland change was explore, the following questions were developed: 1. What were the spatial areas and locations of wetland change from 1984 to 2010 on the Delmarva Peninsula measured by existing geospatial data sets? 2. What physical and anthropogenic drivers of land use and land cover change were correlated with wetland loss on the Delmarva Peninsula? 3. What information did the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland permits and wetland loss patterns provide regarding the influence of wetland change drivers and the impacts of the wetland permitting system? 4. What wetlands, watersheds, and counties were most vulnerable to wetland loss due to physical, socioeconomic and policies that drive wetland change? This research took a tiered approach to quantifying the spatial and temporal Chapter 2, focused on analyzing moderate resolution (30 meter) regional land cover data sets analyzed to: 1) examine the spatial agreement of national and state land cover data sets along with the National Wetland Inventory (NWI), 2) to quantify historical wetland changes on the Delmarva Peninsula at multiple spatial scales between 1984 and 2010, 3) to identify differences in the spatial area of wetland change and discuss the source of and implications for these differences, and 4) to investigate the extent to which drivers of wetland change can be identified using existing land cover data sets (LCDs). In the past, the monitoring of wetland change on long term temporal and larger spatial scales has been limited due to the high cost of systematically acquiring high resolution imagery and wetland feature data from site studies. In the past, the high cost of obtaining and contextualizing multi-jurisdictional wetland permitting databases over large scales has been a restricting factor in expanding the study of the relationship between wetland change and permitting in regions that cross major watersheds and socio-political boundaries. Studies in this area have mainly occurred on a national level, in the Gulf Coast region, or in select subwatersheds of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, and have focused primarily on compensatory mitigation measures rather than linking permitting trends and patterns with impacts on the spatial distribution of wetlands. This study quantified the number, percentage, and density of wetland permits on an annual and 4 to 8 year intervals in accordance to LCD, which was compared to similar calculations regarding wetland change, and tested for correlations with indicators representing potential drivers of wetland change permitting at cumulative, state, county, minor civil division, and hydrological unit scales. Findings showed how permitting and loss followed trends and patterns of development were directly related to development trends with respect to with statistically significant correlations between the densities of housing units, the area of impervious roadways, the area of wetland loss. However, looking at the patterns from drivers outside of urbanization may provide insight into the driving forces behind permitting and subsequent loss of wetlands. For example, wetland permitting in the 2 counties in VA continued to experience wetland loss from 2006 to 2010, while the other counties in MD and DE saw a decrease in wetland loss. These 2 counties were dominated by coastal communities and experienced percentages of wetland loss 3 to 4 times higher than other counties on the peninsula. These characteristics may be linked to the landscape conditions (e.g., floodplain) of the counties, which introduced the notion that permitted activities were not only the driving forces behind loss, but that climate change (e.g., sea level rise) and landscape conditions were also the driving forces behind wetland permitting. The spatial area of the impact of permitted activities and subsequent compensatory mitigation measures were not considered in relating wetland permitting to loss in this study, further, previous studies have shown that states have been unable to meet \"No Net Loss\" goals despite level rise and topography as the primary drivers of wetland loss. These results also coincide with previous studies that have shown how the accuracy and area under the curve calculations have been improved by reducing the quantity of multicollinear predictor variables (Daniels & Cummings, 2008). Future research could use the model developed in this study as a template to expand future analysis to include more predictor variables related to the socioeconomics (e.g., income and property value), agriculture (e.g., crop type), and climate (e.g., drought and temperature) context surrounding the wetlands.  (Brody et al., 2008;Daniels & Cummings, 2008). Future NWI-plus coupled with higher resolution LCD series will be key in expanding analyses of wetland change to larger regions like the Chesapeake Bay watersheds and understanding how subregions with different wetland management, smart growth, and climate change policies across a variation of physiographic and climate regions can be cooperatively reshaped so that more states and counties can set, meet, and sustain \"No Net Loss\" goals, while creating comprehensive plans that consider critical wetland areas that are vital to flood control, nutrient reduction, and biodiversity.
