The findings reveal that the position of the foredune crestline is a chief ecomorphodynamic feature resulting from the two-way interaction between vegetation and topography. In the second part of my work, I focus on the vertical depositional dynamics of salt marshes in response to sea level rise. I investigate the hypothesis that competing effects between biomass production and aeration/decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of soil organic matter (SOM) to total accretion. I use concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. The results are coherent with the notion that SOM does not significantly vary in space and suggest that this may be the result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass productivity and decomposed organic matter. The analyses show that deeper soil layers are characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in inundation duration. However, overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be buried and stabilized. The finding point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column. Finally, in the last part of my work, I focus on estuarine scale modelling and develop a process-based model to evaluate the relative role of watershed, estuarine, and oceanic controls on salt marsh depositional/erosional dynamics and define how these vi factors interact to determine salt marsh resilience to environmental change at the estuary scale. The results show that under some circumstances, vertical depositional dynamics can lead to transitions between salt marsh and tidal flat equilibrium states that occur much more rapidly than marsh/tidal flat boundary erosion or accretion could. x Tables   Table C. 1: Model Parameters ..................................................................................................... 91 xi                xii Figure 3.8: The relation between decomposition rate and stabilization factor along transects T1 ...................................................................................................................................

They also play an important role in protecting the mainland by mitigating ocean swells and reducing the destructive effects of wind and waves during storms. However, the stability of these landforms is threatened by these forcings and also by environmental change. For example, sea level rise and changing storm patterns have deep and destructive effects on coastal zones. In addition, human activities such as dam construction and flow diversion can also greatly impact the stability of these zones.\nBarrier islands play a key role in the stability of lagoons and estuaries, and in protecting the mainland from the destructive effects of storms. In turn, the stability of barrier islands is governed by coupled biotic and abiotic processes responding to environmental change and anthropogenic interference. Among other factors, sea level rise and more frequent intense storms are projected to have important effects on the geomorphological and ecological processes regulating barrier island dynamics [e.g., Moore et al., 2010;Zinnert et al., 2011;Duran Vinent and Moore, 2015]. In particular, vegetation plays a central role in engineering dune topography by trapping and stabilizing the sand, and thus exerts a first-order control on barrier island dynamics [e.g., Short and Hesp, 1982;Hesp, 1988;Hesp, 2002;Psuty, 2008;Duran and Moore, 2013;Walker et al., 2013]. Burial-tolerant species, such as Ammophila breviligulata, are known to increase sediment accumulation in dune areas [Godfrey, 1977;Disraeli, 1984], whereas species less tolerant to burial, such as Spartina patens, are considered to be important in stabilizing low-elevation areas, and in promoting dune recovery after overwash events [Godfrey, 1977;Ritchie and Penland, 1988;Wolner et al., 2013]. The influence of topography-mediated factors on vegetation development has also been established and quite extensively studied. Elevation, slope, and distance from the shoreline have been identified as main habitat determinants for different dune vegetation species [e.g., Young et al., 2011;Brantley et al., 2014;Tobias, 2015]. It is thus understood that, on one hand, vegetation distribution and biomass depend on a number of different factors, such as salinity, wind exposure, flooding [e.g., see Hayden et al., 1995;Parker and Bendix, 1996;Molina et al., 2003], and that, on the other hand, vegetation characteristics exert a major control on the development of the topographic features mediating these same abiotic governing factors. Hence, much like what is observed in other landscape systems [Corenblit et al., 2011;Marani et al., 2013], vegetation and geomorphological processes jointly determine the evolution of barrier landforms [e.g., Duran Vinent and Moore, 2015;Goldstein and Moore, 2016], a concept now quite generally known in land-surface science as ecomorphodynamics [Murray et al., 2008;Marani et al., 2010;Corenblit et al., 2011;Pelletier et al., 2015]. However, only relatively recent work has begun addressing vegetation dynamics and dune dynamics as mutually interacting processes [e.g., Stallins and Parker, 2003;Hacker et al., 2012;Zarnetske et al., 2012;Duran and Moore, 2013;Seabloom et al., 2013]. The concurrent characterization of vegetation distribution and dune topography at the whole-dune or larger scales, is currently tackled using time-intensive longitudinal observations that require decades to acquire [Vandermaarel et al., 1985;Frederiksen et al., 2006]. More recently yet, remote sensing approaches are being explored to expand the simultaneous study of dune vegetation and dune dynamics and to provide rapid, cost-effective, and repeatable data collection across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales [Kempeneers et al., 2009;Malavasi et al., 2013]. However, vegetation characterization (e.g., species identification and biomass density) can be challenging in the presence of short and sparse canopies or of highly mixed populations [Silvestri et al., 2003], as is usually the case in coastal dunes. In this part of my work, I develop and apply new remote sensing analytical techniques to quantitatively characterize barrier island eco-topographic patterns from the plot to the barrier island scale. To this end, I first compare vegetation/topographic characterizations obtained from satellite optical remote sensing (such as hyperspectralderived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI), airborne laser altimetry (such as Lidar-derived Leaf Area Index, LAI), and field observations. Although the simultaneous computation of NDVI and LAI, and their comparison, have been explored in other ecosystems [e.g., Bernasconi et al., 2003;Jin and Eklundh, 2014], this comparison had not yet been performed for short vegetation species typical of coastal systems. Next, I use the resulting spatial distributions of ecological and topographic properties to identify and study the outcome of coupled ecological and sediment transport processes. The foredune crestline, i.e. the dune ridge closest to the shoreline, is a significant geomorphic feature, and its elevation is known to exert an important control on dune dynamics [e.g. Long et al., 2014]. Here I characterize its ecomorphodynamic significance. On one hand, it marks the transition between two zones where environmental conditions are very different (in terms of wind velocity, temperature, salinity, exposure to storm surges), on the other, the crestline position is the result of the mutual interaction between vegetation and sand transport. Here I use remote sensing observations to test the hypothesis that the distribution of vegetation biomass is closely related to the position of the crestline, and that this is as strong a control of vegetation biomass as the distance from the shoreline and ground elevation, commonly assumed to be the sole determinants of vegetation habitat suitability in coastal dunes [Young et al, 2011].\nSalt marshes play a key role in preventing coastal erosion, creating and maintaining morphological and biological diversity, and providing refuge and nesting for wildlife [Barbier et al., 2011]. Salt marshes sequester carbon as they respond to the  Kirwan and Mudd, 2012;2010;Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007;Morris et al., 2002;Mudd et al., 2009]. Some estimates indicate that the rate of carbon burial per unit area in salt marshes is the highest of any biome, and up to 30 to 50 times larger than forest biomes [Mcleod et al., 2011]. For example, Roner et al. [2016] estimated an average carbon accumulation rate of 132 g m \u22122 yr \u22121 for Venice marshes in Italy, and DeLaune and Pezeshki [2003] found a value of 183 g m \u22122 yr \u22121 for coastal marshes in the Gulf of Mexico. Chmura et al. [2003] examined data collected from different marshes along coasts of Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico, and determined an average carbon burial rate of 210 g m \u22122 yr \u22121 at the global scale. Later, Duarte et al. [2005] revised the estimate of the global average carbon burial rate to 151 g m \u22122 yr \u22121 , by combining observations in Woodwell et al. [1973] and Chmura et al. [2003]. Salt marshes are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea level rise and more frequent intense storms [Howarth and Hobbie, 1981], as well as to anthropogenic pressures, including the reduction of sediment supply to coastal landscapes Syvitski et al., 2009]. Hence, marsh global extent may significantly decline in the future, and predicting the associated changes in the global carbon cycle requires a better understanding of the processes regulating carbon burial at the marsh scale Marani et al., 2007;Ratliff et al., 2015]. Two main processes contribute to a marsh accretion toward a possible equilibrium with mean RRSLR: inorganic deposition of exogenous sediments and organic soil production by plants. Suspended sediment from rivers or the ocean is deposited over the marsh platform by tidal flooding and leads to inorganic soil accretion, also mediated by vegetation that captures suspended particles Da Lio et al., 2013;Danielsen et al., 2005;Feagin et al., 2009;Marani et al., 2013;Mudd et al., 2010;Mudd et al., 2004]. Aboveground and belowground biomass as well as the organic matter imported by tidal currents are important sources of soil organic matter (SOM), however, belowground biomass accounts for a significant contribution to SOM production and overall marsh vertical accretion [Blum, 1993;McCaffrey and Thomson, 1980;Nyman et al., 2006;Turner et al., 2006]. The importance of the SOM contribution to accretion is mediated by the interplay of belowground biomass production and decomposition processes, the latter determining the fraction of the biomass produced that effectively contributes to soil formation and carbon burial [Kirwan and Mudd, 2012;Mudd et al., 2009;Nyman et al., 1993;Rybczyk et al., 1998;Turner et al., 2000]. Field observations and modelling results suggest biomass production and decomposition rates to vary widely across marshes and across different sites. Soil aeration, fractional time of flooding (hydroperiod) and soil drainage are influenced by local topography and elevation, and are first-order controls of both biomass production and SOM decomposition rates [Armstrong et al., 1985;Chen et al., 2016;Chmura and Hung, 2004;Hazelden and Boorman, 1999;Lemay, 2007;Morris et al., 2016;Morris et al., 2002;Nyman and Delaune, 1991;Nyman et al., 1995]. In addition to elevation, salt marsh halophytic plants are also capable of modulating soil oxidation by producing a persistently aerated layer below the flooded surface which can alter decomposition processes [e.g., Boaga et al., 2014;Li et al., 2005;Marani et al., 2006;Ursino et al., 2004;Xin et al., 2013]. Observations from the Venice Lagoon (Italy) show that, even though plant productivity decreases in the lower areas of a marsh located farther away from channel edges, the relative contribution of organic soil production to the overall vertical soil accretion tends to remain constant as the distance from the channel increases [Roner et al., 2016]. This observation suggests that the competing effects between biomass production and aeration/decomposition, modulated by soil elevation, approximately compensate each other in the lower portions of these marshes. Testing this idea, and its possible more general applicability, requires simultaneous observations of decomposition rates and SOM content at the marsh scale. Such observations will also likely yield more, realistic quantitative representations of SOM dynamics, to improve currently simplistic model parameterizations [e.g., D'Alpaos et al., 2012; Kirwan and Murray, 2007;Marani et al., 2013;Morris et al., 2016;Schile et al., 2014]. Towards these goals, here I perform simultaneous observations of biomass productivity, decomposition, and SOM in coastal marshes located in North Carolina (USA).\nEstuaries provide a wide range of ecosystem services including protection of coastal areas, nutrient cycling, water filtration, nurseries for fish and crustaceans, and carbon sequestration [Barbier et al., 2011;Mcleod et al., 2011;Zedler and Kercher, 2005]. These coastal wetlands are threatened by climate change through sea level rise (SLR) with a projected increase of up to 16 mm/yr for the last two decades of the 21 st century [Church et al., 2013;Craft et al., 2009;Morris et al., 2002]. Rivers feeding estuaries can also be highly impacted by human activities within watersheds and coastal environments such as dam construction and flow diversion, altering river discharge and restricting the sediment supply delivered to salt marshes [Kennish, 2001;Lotze et al., 2006]. Studies show that salt marshes are resilient to environmental change due to a positive feedback between vegetation and deposition dynamics, maintaining their elevations and preventing drowning [Fagherazzi et al., 2012;French and Stoddart, 1992;Kirwan and Murray, 2007;Marani et al., 2007]. However, environmental changes can lead to marsh collapse, retreat or migration under some circumstances such as elevated rates of SLR and sudden reductions in sediment supply [D'Alpaos, 2011;Kirwan et al., 2016;Marani et al., 2010;Morris et al., 2002]. Marani et al. [2007] find that three equilibrium states exist for tidal platforms (subtidal zones, tidal flats and salt marshes) by solving the sediment mass conservation at equilibrium regulated by sediment dynamics, biotic processes and SLR. The study of the coupled evolution of tidal flat and marsh platforms has been recently expanding, suggesting that tidal flats can regulate marsh erosional and depositional dynamics [Allen, 1990;D'Alpaos et al., 2005;Fagherazzi et al., 2006;Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013]. The sediment eroded from tidal flats due to wind wave dynamics can be transported to marshes by tides and deposited on the surface [Carniello et al., 2005;Tambroni and Seminara, 2006]. In addition, wind waves formed in tidal flats can also govern the migration of the margin between tidal flats and marshes by determining the relative significance of margin erosion compared to margin accretion [Lawson et al., 2007;Leonardi and Fagherazzi, 2015]. The erosion of tidal flat beds and marsh margins is indeed dictated by the morphology of the estuary through fetch and water depth, which control the wave power needed for erosion [Defina et al., 2007;Marani et al., 2011]. Mariotti and Fagherazzi [2013] suggest that a critical width exists for tidal flats above which irreversible marsh retreat occurs. In addition, the geometric properties of the tidal flat and estuary depend on both river discharge and tidal dynamics [Gisen and Savenije, 2015;Savenije, 2015]. Noting that the morphology of tidal flats is subject to change due to environmental disturbances on the local scale and watershed and estuarine scales (such as variations in river discharge or sediment concentration, storm surges, and changes in SLR rates), it is essential to understand the full range of mechanisms that control salt marsh evolution [FitzGerald et al., 2008]. Despite numerous field and modeling studies on morphodynamic processes of coastal platforms, only few studies (and those only qualitatively) discuss the upland and estuarine controls of marsh existence [Allen, 2000;Gunnell et al., 2013;Redfield, 1965;Braswell & Heffernan, in review]. Consequently, we lack an understanding of how these large-scale controls affect the tidal flat and marsh erosional and depositional dynamics.

Therefore, it is important to understand the dynamics that shape coastal landforms, to carefully predict their response to environmental change. Here, I use different tools to study some of these dynamics. In chapter two, I focus on barrier island's dunes and use remote sensing to study the coupled vegetation and sediment transport dynamics. In chapter three, I focus on salt marshes behind barrier islands to understand what processes contribute to marsh accretion dynamics as a response to sea level rise.

NDVI has been widely shown to be a representative proxy for green biomass [Tucker, 1979;Manso et al., 1998;Lo and Quattrochi, 2003;Bermudez and Retuerto, 2013]. In a large number of applications to different biomes, NDVI has also been successfully related to the LAI, the total one-sided leaf area within the canopy per unit of horizontally-projected ground area, a parameter that mediates photosynthetic, gas exchange, and rain interception processes [e.g., see Soegaard, 1999;Duchemin et al., 2006]. Some studies have used NDVI to infer dune vegetation biomass using satellite imagery [Alphan, 2011;Castanho et al., 2015], but they have been limited by the coarse resolution of the data available (30 m in the case of Landsat data), particularly in consideration of the small-scale variability and sparseness of vegetation typical of dune areas. Here I use 1 m resolution hyperspectral data and, in order to obtain NDVI values which can be compared to widely studied Landsat-derived values, I average reflectances over appropriate sets of hyperspectral bands to obtain broadband reflectances corresponding to the red (630-690 nm) and infrared (770-900 nm) bands of the ETM+ sensor on Landsat 7. I obtained the averages by applying appropriate weights to each hyperspectral band to account for the known ETM+ response function [Chander et al., 2009]."}, {"section_title": "Construction of the Digital Terrain Model", "text": "I first processed the Lidar data by removing outliers, defined as unrealistically low values (negative values, which would lie well below local sea level) and unrealistically high values (greater than a value L = M + 5 m, where M is the median elevation calculated for the entire data set, and assuming that the characteristic height of the highest shrubs present in the area is lower than 5 m). To generate the Digital Terrain Model (DTM), i.e., the digital representation of the topographic surface, the Lidar returns reflected by canopy elements must first be identified and removed. I do this by dividing the area into square cells with side 0.5 m and by identifying the lowest elevation value in each cell as most likely being a ground return (i.e., not reflected by a canopy element). These \"lowest points\" are then used to construct a Delaunay Triangulation to define a continuous soil surface throughout the domain. Notice that this construction does not yield a regularly spaced DTM, as the positions of the irregularly spaced \"lowest points\" induce a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) representation of the soil surface, which is more flexible in describing local slope and elevation than a grid DTM (where, by definition, elevation is constant within each grid cell). I have extensively tested the effect of the choice of the grid cell size on the resulting DTM. Larger cells contain a greater number of Lidar returns, such that the probability that a Lidar beam can penetrate the canopy all the way to the ground increases. On the other hand, using a large cell size may cause genuine ground returns, generated by relatively high local elevation maxima, to be interpreted as canopy elements and induces a \"smoothing\" of small-scale topographic features. I thus compared the DTMs obtained using 6 different grid sizes, 0.25 m, 0. 5 m, 0.75 m, 1 m, 1.25 m, and 1.5 m with the available reference GPS observations. The DTM obtained using a 0.5 m grid size generated the smallest root-mean-square deviation from GPS-determined elevation values and was thus, selected as the optimal grid cell size. The DTM derived through this procedure agrees well with ground elevation measurements (R 2 = 0.95, see Figure   2.3). The regression of GPS observations on Lidar estimates indicates the presence of a slight underestimation. This may be due to a mismatch between the datums used in the GPS and Lidar acquisitions, and to the fact that the minimum elevation return from a cell is likely to be smaller than a GPS observation collected randomly within the same cell. These two sources of error (the bias offset between the datums and the use of the minimum elevation within a neighborhood of fixed size for the estimation of ground elevation) cannot be separated and therefore need to be corrected using ancillary field surveys if absolute elevation with respect to a specified datum is required. The GPS vs. Lidar regression, however, makes it possible to correct for this limited bias, and the final DTM elevation is thus obtained by applying the regression/correction relation ZGPS= 0.96 \uf0d7 Zlidar + 0.20 m. "}, {"section_title": "Shoreline and Dune Crestline Identification", "text": "I use a combination of Lidar and hyperspectral data to define the position of the shoreline. Water is highly absorptive in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. I thus set a threshold reflectance in the hyperspectral band centered around the 801 nm wavelength. The threshold is based on the maximum value of visually identified water and wet areas along the coast. A \"water mask\" is defined by all the pixels in the study area with reflectance smaller than the threshold. The instantaneous boundary between land and water areas (which is subject to spatially heterogeneous factors related to nearshore circulation and waves) does not define an equal-elevation shoreline. Thus, from the Lidar data, I determine the maximum elevation of this boundary and use this elevation value to define a reference, equal-elevation shoreline position (similar to extraction of a mean high water shoreline but using an elevation derived from my data set, for internal consistency, rather than a tide gauge). Note that because the relative position from the shoreline, rather than the absolute distance from it, is the relevant factor in the analysis, other definitions of shoreline could be used with no consequences for the results. This is consistent with conventional definitions of the shoreline, the actual shoreline being variable over time due to tidal fluctuations (mean tidal range 1.19 m), waves, and storm surges. I experimented with different choices of the water elevation used to define the shoreline and found that the corresponding modest, and rather spatially uniform, shifts in shoreline position do not appreciably affect my subsequent analyses. As previously discussed, the dune crestline likely represents an ecotone separating environments where stressors such as sediment and salt deposition rates are very different. I use the DTM to identify the position of the foredune crestline by tracking the value of the local topographic gradient systematically along transects connecting the ocean and the backdune area. The crestline is identified as the set of points where the topographic slope changes sign in an ocean-backdune direction. To find the foredune crestline, I first determine the elevation of the center of each 1 m pixel where the NDVI was previously computed, and subsequently identify the position of local topographic maxima where the derivative of ground elevation changes sign along transects in the ocean-land direction. I manually removed randomly occurring local maxima related to micro-topographic features not belonging to the continuous foredune crestline"}, {"section_title": "Estimation of the LAI", "text": "The cloud of Lidar returns has been shown to convey information on the canopy structure, and on the LAI in particular, in a variety of environments [Kempeneers et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2009;Fieber et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015].

At site 1 only the first dune line (i.e., closest to the shoreline) is uninterrupted, whereas the second dune line is highly discontinuous.  Since NDVI and LAI are different and independently-derived proxies for vegetation amount, the coherence of the patterns in the two distributions is highly supportive of their significance. The differences visible in the detailed NDVI and LAI patterns ( Figure 2.4) can likely be attributed to two main causes. First, NDVI and LAI represent different vegetation properties and in different ways: The NDVI is an optical property whose relation to biomass is empirical and species-specific, while Lidarderived LAI comes from probing the canopy with narrow laser beams. Second, and possibly more important, co-registration uncertainties between NDVI and LAI can be quite significant, because of the absence of identifiable reference targets. The direct comparison of LAI and NDVI values in the whole study area (site 3) shows an increasing pattern for LAI as NDVI increases despite the uncertainties in the data as described above (Figure 2.5). Therefore, while the general correspondence of NDVI and LAI spatial features supports the idea that dune biomass distribution can be mapped by remote sensing, I note that LAI estimates are by definition spatially coherent with DTM information, having been obtained from the same Lidar data. Here given the importance of establishing firm relations between topographic and biomass distributions, I focus the following analyses on LAI information. The foredune crestline at site 1 is both lower and closer to the shoreline than at site 2 ( Figure 2.4 a and d). This is consistent with the notion that lower dunes arise when dune-building vegetation becomes established closer to the shoreline and thus in association with a narrower beach providing a lower sediment supply. This sediment supply effect arises from the upward steering of wind by dune topography, which is greater for wider beaches because the effect of the dune on the wind occurs over a broader distance compared to narrow beaches [Duran and Moore, 2013]. The locally high vegetation density near the first crestline ( Figure 2.4 b, c, e, and f) is highly suggestive of a tight relation between density and topography. This finding is best appreciated if one plots LAI values against the distance from the most seaward crestline point ( Figure 2.6, also see Figure A.1 in appendix A for the analogous analysis involving NDVI). Both distributions indicate that vegetation is sparser in the seaward side of the foredune area and that it is densest near the crestline and in the landward side of the dune. At site 2 ( Figure 2.6 b), LAI seems to exhibit some symmetry about the crestline. However, when LAI distribution is averaged over the whole study area (site 3, which is about 8 times larger than site 2) symmetry disappears, suggesting it is not a characteristic feature of the biomass distribution. In fact, vegetation density is quite high in a whole area near the crest, whereas it decreases very quickly away from the crestline in the direction of the shoreline. This finding, which quantifies the important ecomorphodynamic role of the foredune crestline, is in agreement with previous qualitative observations in other parts of the world [Keijsers et al., 2015].  Figure   2.7 also show that vegetation density remains extremely low (LAI less than about 0.5) on the seaward side of the first crestline, suggesting that little or no vegetation can develop at distances from the shoreline shorter than a critical value. This value is considered as one of the chief factors constraining dune building as it determines the position where vegetation can first colonize the beach, i.e. where stressors are low enough for vegetation to develop, and is analogous to threshold parameters used in ecomorphodynamic modelling [e.g., see Duran and Moore, 2013]. I quantify here this critical distance to be between 20 m and 35 m. Interestingly, the minimum distance for vegetation development also corresponds to the distance from the shoreline where the first sharp increase in topographic slope is observed, about 20-30 m in Figure 2.7. This coincidence of geomorphic and vegetation thresholds is a highly suggestive signature of the feedbacks between sediment transport and vegetation biomass.  The ecomorphodynamic patterns inferred from biomass distributions are consistent with vegetation density distributions measured in the field (Figure 2.9). This general correspondence holds even though field observations and remote sensing acquisitions were performed in different years and at nearby but different locations. Consistent with the pattern observed in the remotely-sensed biomass distribution (see  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The comparison of remotely-sensed NDVI and LAI distributions from Hog Island dunes (VA) shows coherent spatial vegetation patterns. The general features of biomass distribution along transects perpendicular to dune lines are also confirmed by in-situ observations of vegetation cover. This coherence among optical-derived, Lidarderived, and field-derived vegetation biomass distributions lends support to dune vegetation biomass mapping from airborne remote sensing at the whole-system scale. In particular, I have shown that Lidar remote sensing allows the quantitative evaluation of LAI for sparse dune vegetation. Importantly, the Lidar-based analyses and processing methods developed here eliminate the difficulties and uncertainties related to coregistering different information sources and the need to perform cumbersome field observations of biomass (e.g., using a large number of small-scale photographs and their digital analysis, or destructive biomass sampling) and of topography (e.g., through necessarily sparse and cumbersome to update GPS measurements). Multiple-return and full waveform Lidar data have been thus far applied to the characterization of tall vegetation only (height ~10 m) [Armston et al., 2013], and currently do not allow the discrimination of the parts of the beam that have been reflected by the ground and by the canopy when vegetation is very short and sparse, such as in the case of coastal dune vegetation. The approach proposed here successfully performs this separation and can be applied to a large set of existing single-return Lidar data opening the door to the full exploration of the space-time evolution of coastal eco-geomorphic patterns. The spatially-explicit ecomorphodynamic patterns inferred here highlight the signatures of geomorphic controls on the spatial vegetation distribution and the role of the foredune crestline as a chief determinant of vegetation development. Vegetation cover gradients are radically different on the two sides of the crestline, consistent with a strong discontinuity between the conditions in the seaward side of the foredune area, exposed to flooding and high salinity, and in the landward side of the dune area, significantly more sheltered from environmental stressors. However, vegetation does not just passively adapt to topographic conditions, but significantly contributes to dune building, from the seaward position where a dune begins to the location of the crestline. The joint ecomorphodynamic patterns identified and analyzed here through remote sensing are, in fact, the result of a two-way interaction between ecological and morphological dynamics: while the foredune crestline defines the space where the maximum biomass production occurs, vegetation growth controls sand deposition, builds the dune, and localizes the crestline. In this respect, the ecomorphodynamic patterns identified by my analyses bear significant implications for modelling. This is where the spatially-explicit characterizations of vegetation and topographic distributions inferred from Lidar remote sensing can contribute, e.g., by quantifying vegetation-airflow-sediment transport interactions [Raupach et al., 1993;Okin, 2008], to pave the way for physically-based dune ecomorphodynamic modelling.\nThe results suggest that soil dry BD, SOM and biomass productivity, here represented through vegetation cover, vary with distance from the marsh edge and elevation at the marsh scale. As soil elevation increases, SOM exhibits large fluctuations beclouding possible trends, but OMD is significantly reduced. This finding may be ascribed to the greater aeration at higher soils, where the inundation time is shorter. I find that plant biomass production does not seem to define the eventual (after burial and decay) SOM content and OMD. Both parameters, in fact, show greater covariation with elevation and hydroperiod than with vegetation cover. The quantification of the spatial dependence of decomposition processes overall corroborates the idea that this covariation is the sign that soil oxidation tends to overwhelm initial difference in biomass productivity and to largely determine the spatial distribution of SOM. The results also suggest that decomposition rate and stabilization of the labile part of belowground biomass vary with position within a marsh and depth below the soil surface. Decomposition rate is greater in the upper soil layers and stabilization is greater deeper away from the surface, highlighting the role of elevation and flooding duration on decomposition rate and stabilization factor within a marsh. Even though decomposition rates vary significantly at the marsh scale, observed values are sufficiently large that the labile component of the standardized root material (rooibos) is fully decomposed over the course of 2-3 years within the root zone. This result suggests that only the refractory part of the belowground biomass contributes to soil accretion and emphasizes the role of the stabilization factor in modulating marsh vertical accretion: a higher stabilization factor increases the effectively refractory fraction, thereby contributing to increase SOM accumulation. Overall, the findings provide the\nThe approach proposed here as a simultaneous use of lidar and hyperspectral data successfully characterizes the vegetation patterns in relation to topographic features in coastal dunes and opens the door to the full exploration of the space-time evolution of coastal eco-geomorphic patterns.

However, both parameters, in fact, show greater covariation with elevation and hydroperiod than with vegetation cover. My results also suggest that only the refractory part of the belowground biomass contributes to soil accretion and emphasizes the role of the stabilization factor in modulating marsh vertical accretion: a higher stabilization factor increases the effectively refractory fraction, thereby contributing to increase SOM accumulation. Overall, these findings provide the basis for refining representations of the SOM accumulation process to inform the next generation of spatially-explicit bio-morphological models of salt marsh evolution. These new models will be a key tool to evaluate impending rates of marsh loss and the associated carbon release. The findings of marsh modelling study reveal that different mechanisms regulate the transitions from tidal flat-to marsh-dominance: lateral erosion and accretion dynamics at the margin, and vertical accretion dynamics on tidal flat surface that can happen much more rapidly than lateral dynamics. I suggest that considering both lateral and vertical dynamics is critical and otherwise it is not possible to address the full range of mechanisms regulating marsh extent. In addition, the results show that rivers can affect the extent of marshes in two ways: 1) by fluvial sediment delivery to tidal platforms, and 2) by regulating exchange with the ocean through riverine discharge. Among various environmental forcings and geometric properties controlling tidal flatvs. marsh-dominance, river concentration is found to be a key factor influencing the marsh vs. tidal flat extent for basins with similar widths. Considering that different parts of the estuary may have different sizes and orientations, the same wind regime can represent a very different forcing in different parts of the system (due to the potential variations in the fetch length and the angle between direction of wind and marsh margin in different locations).  where is the gravitational acceleration, is wind velocity, and is the fetch length. is wave group velocity and is computed as:"}, {"section_title": "The Spatial Variability of Organic Matter and Decomposition Processes at the Marsh Scale", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Marsh halophytic vegetation species include Spartina alterniflora, Limonium carolinianum", "text": "and Salicornia perennis.

Sample spacing was m for distances between 10 m and 20 m, and 10 m between 20 m and 40 m from the channel. In total, I collected nine cores within each transect. The cores were stored in a cooler/fridge until they were analyzed, to minimize decomposition (freezing was avoided to prevent possible volume/porosity changes). I determined the elevation of coring sites using a theodolite with an accuracy of \u00b13 mm. To express the elevations relative to local mean sea level (MSL, with respect to the National Tidal Datum Epoch defined by NOAA), I recorded the maximum elevation reached by water at each study site at high water slack on the same day. I assumed that the attenuation of the tidal wave crest is negligible as it is a very long wave travelling through well-incised channels over a short distance from the ocean to the study sites. Hence, the maximum elevation reached by water levels, not simultaneous at different sites due to finite propagation celerity, is approximately the same across study sites, and at the nearest NOAA tide gauge station in Wrightsville Beach (station ID: 8658163, latitude: 34\u00b0 12.8' N, and longitude: 77\u00b0 47.2' W).

After homogenizing the samples, I dried them at 60\u00b0C for 36 hours, such that all the pore water was removed. After salt mass correction, assuming a nominal salinity of 35 ppm (see Dadey et al.

[2013] to estimate 'nominal' decomposition rates and organic matter stabilization that can be compared across different sites along the transects. The use of a standard organic material makes the derived 'nominal' decomposition rates independent of the type of organic material used, such that they may be considered to only be a function of local edaphic and environmental conditions. In the method used, standard green tea bags (EAN 87 22700 05552 5) and rooibos bags (EAN 87 22700 18843 8) are buried in the soil together, and are retrieved after 90 days. The fractional weight, ( ), of a bag content is assumed to change as a result of decomposition processes according to [Keuskamp et al., 2013]: where a is the labile fraction, k is the decomposition rate (in 1/days), and t is the time (in days). The use of two different tea types of known properties makes it possible to estimate a and k without recourse to long data time series [Keuskamp et al., 2013]. According to Keuskamp et al. [2013], stabilization by which a labile material becomes recalcitrant [Prescott, 2010], is quantified through a stabilization factor, S: where H is the hydrolysable fraction, a known parameter for the standard tea materials. The authors found a value of 0.842 \u00b1 0.023 for hydrolysable fraction of green tea, Hg, and a value of 0.552 \u00b1 0.050 for hydrolysable fraction of rooibos tea, Hr, by experimenting in the laboratory. Keuskamp et al. [2013] also found that after 90 days, the labile fraction in green tea, mainly composed of leaves, is almost completely decomposed. Hence, the labile fraction ag of green tea can be found and consequently, using equation (23), the stabilization factor Sg for green tea can be determined. The authors argued that because stabilization is controlled by environmental conditions and is independent of the hydrolysable fraction, the value of Sg can be assumed to be equal to the stabilization factor Sr for rooibos (i.e., Sg = Sr). Finally, ar and kr for rooibos tea can be estimated using  Keuskamp et al. [2013]. The material remaining after combustion includes inorganic sediments and salt that entered the bags after burial, as well as tea material that is not easily burned. This latter term was estimated by performing an LOI analysis on the contents of 10 green tea and 10 rooibos unused bags. The average weight of uncombusted material was subtracted from the weights of the material remaining after combustion of the retrieved bags, to estimate the weight of inorganic sediment/salt that had entered each bag after burial.

Dividing the flooding time by the total duration of the experiments yields the value of the hydroperiod. This approach neglects the tidal level variations from the NOAA gauge due to the delay in flow and ebb currents through marsh vegetated surface, the delay required for the water table to adjust to changes in the tidal level forcing it, and possible effects related with plant evapotranspiration [Boaga et al., 2014;Ursino et al., 2004].

Soil elevation increases with distance from the channel along transect T1 (Figure 3.3 a), whereas an opposite trend is found along transects T2 and T3 (Figure 3.3 b and c), where elevation is highest near the channel. Soil dry bulk density (BD) tends to increase with distance from the channel in T1, however, changes of BD in space do not exhibit marked trends in T2 and T3 ( Figure 3.3 d, e, and f). BD values in transect T1 (in the range of 0.6-1.2 g/cm 3 ) are also significantly larger than those in transects T2 and T3 (in the range of 0.2-0.7 g/cm 3 ).

Similarly, the stabilization factor increases with elevation at both depths in transect T1 (   \nThe numerical investigations of the morphodynamic evolution of marsh and tidal flat show that the equilibrium solution for the position of the tidal flat/marsh margin is unstable; any perturbation leads to either a tidal flat-dominated estuary or to a marsh-dominated one. This confirms the previous finding by Mariotti and Fagherazzi [2013] that marsh and tidal flat cannot coexist at a stable state of \"horizontal\" erosional/depositional processes. Even though I consider both riverine and ocean sediment input in this work, no stable solution is found. This is due to a positive feedback between the erosive wave energy and margin erosional/depositional dynamics [Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013]. In the case of a small amount of net erosion at the margin, tidal flat width and thus the fetch increase which result in a larger wave energy, leading to more margin erosion until the marsh ultimately disappears. The opposite happens for the case of a small amount of net deposition at the margin, where the erosive energy decreases due to a reduction in fetch, leading to expansion of the marsh, ultimately filling the basin. Estuarine geometry is dictated by large-scale morphology (e.g., the origin of the area that is now a coastal area, fluvial inputs, tidal regime). This morphology sets constraints to the size of different parts of the estuary, which constitute the initial conditions for the system and thus determine the subsequent dynamics. The sets of initial conditions of the system dynamics that lead to estuaries filled with either marsh, or tidal flat define the \"basins of attractions\". Therefore, two regions in the multidimensional space of morphodynamic forcings can exist: basin of attraction of the marsh-dominated estuaries, and basin of attraction of the tidal flat-dominated estuaries. I consider a reference set of forcings to illustrate the possible dynamical mechanisms controlling the basins of attractions. Different forcings may have different impacts on the critical fetch, dividing the tidal flat-and marsh-dominance (Figure 4.2). The critical fetch lines correspond to the unstable equilibrium solutions of the dynamical system as a result of lateral erosional and depositional dynamics on the margin. Basins with a fetch smaller than the critical fetch value (lying in the grey area) will be eventually filled with marsh due to marsh margin progradation whereas basins with a larger fetch than critical fetch (lying in the white area) will be eventually filled with tidal flats due to margin erosion (Figure 4.2). Such behavior, for instance, exists for marshes of Virginia Coast Reserve where the data analyzed from aerial photographs show that marshes with a fetch smaller than 1 km expand whereas they retreat with a larger fetch [Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013]. The basin of attraction of a marsh-dominated system grows with increasing river and ocean concentrations, and hence, the chances that initial conditions lead to estuaries filled with marsh increase (Figure 4.2 a, c). With larger external sediment input to the system and the corresponding increase in accretion at the margin, a larger fetch is needed to produce the greater wave energy necessary to maintain a balance between margin accretion and erosion. Therefore, the unstable equilibrium is marked by a larger critical length for increased sediment concentrations. A similar behavior exists when river discharge is increased (Figure 4.2 b) because with increasing river discharge (which has a higher sediment concentration than the ocean in the reference conditions: = 50 mg/l whereas = 10 mg/l), less ocean water enters the system, resulting in a higher amount of total external sediment input. Here, I highlight the importance of the ocean to river discharge ratio, , which is the ratio of the ocean tidal prism entering the control volume during one tidal period to river discharge: on dynamics of the system. The sediment mass import to the system depends on both ocean and river inputs of water and sediment concentrations. , in fact, determines the relative amount of water entering the system from ocean and river and consequently, the relative significance of their concentrations that contribute to the average concentration of the system. Therefore, can regulate the final yield of sediment import to the system rather than ocean and river inputs alone. Different mechanisms and forcings regulate the migration rate of the margin and lead to different slopes of the critical fetch lines (Figure 4.2 a, b and c). For instance, the fetch equal to the critical fetch for systems with river concentrations larger than 50 mg/l and the associated tidal flat depth are sufficiently large to cause erosion on tidal flat bed ( > under such initial conditions of the system; Figure 4.2 a). Thus, the eroded sediment from the tidal flat can contribute to the concentration of the system, altering the dynamics of the system. However, the shear stress becomes too weak to cause any erosion on the tidal flat for fetch equal to the critical fetch and the associated tidal flat depth corresponding to river concentrations less than 50 mg/l ( \u2264 ). Surprisingly, I find that tidal range does not seem to change the erosional and depositional dynamics of the margin (Figure 4.2 d). The behavior of the critical fetch tends to remain constant as the tidal range increases. This behavior can be explained by considering that the equilibrium depths of tidal flat and marsh platforms are almost constant for any tidal range, and depths quickly adjust to the equilibrium values [Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013]. Increasing the tidal range only moves the platforms to higher elevations, without changing the margin dynamics, thus, the critical fetch line stays quite constant. In addition to the lateral erosion and progradation of the margin, the results show that the vertical dynamics on the tidal flat can also affect the transition from tidal flat-to marsh-dominance (Figure 4.3). Vertical dynamics become the controlling process when accretion on the tidal flat surface occurs sufficiently rapidly for the surface to emerge above MSL, making it favorable for vegetation to establish [Silvestri et al., 2005], and consequently, tidal flat conversion to a new marsh occurs. Therefore, the results suggest that the basin of attraction for the marsh-dominated equilibrium (hatched area in Figure 4.3) is larger than that implied by existing theories (grey area in Figure 4.3), which only consider horizontal erosion/deposition dynamics. The effect of vertical dynamics on the size of the basins of attraction in the tidal range and fetch plane is particularly large (Figure 4.3 d). The reason for the large addition to the marsh-dominance basin across tidal ranges is that with increasing tidal range, the tidal flat platform accretes in order to maintain the equilibrium depth and is more likely to pass MSL. This promotes tidal flat conversion to marsh and significantly increases marsh-dominance. The equilibrium depth of tidal flats lying in the tidal flatdominated basin is dictated by the fetch length (the tidal flat accretes/erodes until it reaches an elevation where erosion balances deposition) and increases with increasing fetch (Figure 4.3 d). In order to lie in these basins, the initial conditions of the system should be such that the fetch is sufficiently large to create a large bed shear stress. This large shear stress is needed to prevent tidal flat conversion to marsh due to vertical dynamics. However, for tidal ranges greater than a threshold value (about 3.3 m in the setup of the model examined here), the associated depth of tidal flat becomes too large to produce a bed shear stress exceeding and causing erosion. In fact, a fetch larger than what the basin can sustain is needed to compensate for the depth and cause erosion. Therefore, there is a sudden jump of the critical fetch to its highest possible value limited by the basin size (10 km). In other words, no tidal flat-dominated systems can exist for tidal ranges larger than this threshold value, hence, leading to full expansion of the marsh-dominance basin. The increase in the extent of marsh-dominance due to vertical dynamics can be small or even negligible if the river concentration and discharge are small, due to the lack of sufficient sediment for vertical dynamics to happen (e.g., = 5 mg/l and = 5 m 3 /s, Figure 4.4). It is also important to note that when the river concentration is lower than the ocean concentration (here = 5 mg/l and = 10 mg/l), an increase in river discharge reduces the basin of attraction of marsh-dominance by changing the because the tidal prism entering the bay during a tidal cycle decreases, resulting in a reduction in the average sediment concentration of the system (Figure 4.4 b). Similarly, SLR can also affect the basins of attractions by altering the dynamics of the intertidal platforms (Figure 4.5; for the effects of SLR rate on a system with a smaller river see Figure C.1 in appendix C). The critical fetch value is here associated with both lateral and vertical dynamics. An elevated SLR rate results in a larger reduction in the marsh-dominance basin. This is because with higher SLR rates, more sediment is needed to fill the space created by SLR in order to prevent drowning, which results in a reduction in the average concentration of the system. For example, in the reference conditions when = 50 m 3 /s, = 50 mg/l, and = 10 mg/l, the average concentration of the system is halved ( = 7 mg/l) if SLR rate increases from 2 mm/yr to 8 mm/yr and tidal platforms deepen. Therefore, with a reduction in , the critical fetch decreases and marsh-dominance basin shrinks until sufficiently large SLR rates (e.g., larger than 10 mm/yr, Figure 4.5 a) can lead to marsh drowning for some system conditions, indicating that the accretion is not sufficient for the marsh to keep up with SLR. The volume of the system is limited by the tidal range and the size of the basin. In the reference conditions, if the tidal range is smaller than 1.3 m and the SLR rate is less than 2 mm/yr, a river with a discharge of 50 m 3 /s can dominate the systems with a fetch equal to the critical fetch and with the associated platform depths, during one tidal period. In other words, under these circumstances the volume of water entering the system from the river is greater than that of ocean ( < 1), and hence, there is a net sediment export from the system with increasing tidal range up to 1.3 m ( Figure 4.5 d). Such behavior occurs because the sediment concentration of ocean water is 10 mg/l but the ebb current has a higher concentration due to mixing with river water which has a concentration of = 50 mg/l. For example, in the reference conditions, if the tidal range is equal to 1 m and = 10 mg/l, the ebb current has a concertation of 18 mg/l. While increasing the tidal range results in an increase in the amount of sediment mass imported by the ocean, the amount of sediment mass exported from the system (due to the excess of the tidal range) is higher because the ebb has a higher concentration. This net sediment export from the system results in a reduction in critical fetch, which explains the existence of the minimum point for critical fetch at tidal range of 1.3 m ( Figure 4.5 d). This behavior reflects the importance of in governing the marshand tidal flat-dominance basins. The geometric properties of the estuary also affect the critical fetch length ( Figure   4.6), however these properties have much smaller effects on systems with small river input (e.g., = 5 mg/l and = 5 m 3 /s). In fact, these effects can be almost negligible for estuary lengths larger than about 2 km and basin widths larger than about 5 km (the change in critical fetch per unit length of the size will be smaller than 0.001 m/m; Figure   4.6 c and d). Interestingly, the results show that estuary length and width influence the system differently. Changes in basin width are directly linked to changes in marsh area, which is a sink for sediment (under the assumption that all sediment in the water column above marsh surface deposits on the marsh). However, changes in estuary length alter both marsh and tidal flat area, thus controlling both sediment sink and sediment export (sediment export occurs through ebb currents and depends on the tidal flat size). Hence, changing the width and length of the estuary can have different impacts on the dynamics of the system. Inspection of the sensitivity of the model results to various environmental factors and geometric properties for basins with similar widths reveals that the river concentration has the largest effect (Figure 4.7; see appendix C for more detailed description). Tidal range, wind velocity and river discharge are also important parameters, whereas estuary length and SLR rate are the least important. These physical properties also contribute to model output variations through interactions with each other, and suggest that the interactions between river concentration, river discharge and tidal range are more significant than other interactions (Figure 4.8; see appendix C for more detailed description).  "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The difference in elevation profiles observed at site 1 and site 2 can be due to different inorganic sediment amounts received through the channels. The increasing trend for soil elevation along T1 at site 1 can be a result of limited inorganic sediment being transported to the marsh through the creek (Figure 3.3 a). The opposite trend along T2 and T3 at site 2 can be explained by noting that the relatively larger channel feeding the marsh likely carries a greater amount of inorganic sediment, sufficient to induce a levee-like morphology near the channel itself (Figure 3.3 b and c). In other words, the portion of T1 closest to the creek, and the areas in T2 and T3 furthest from the creek, are all characterized by low equilibrium elevations likely due to a lower availability of inorganic sediment in the water column [Marani et al., 2013]. On the contrary, the other ends of transects are characterized by higher elevations where smaller SOM fractional values tend to occur [Roner et al., 2016]. I interpret this reduction in SOM with elevation as the result of a greater decomposition rate caused by more microbial activities due to shorter inundation duration [Hazelden and Boorman, 1999;Howarth and Hobbie, 1982]. The OCD values estimated are relatively lower than the ranges of OCD observed by Roner et al. [2016] (between 0.03 g/cm 3 and 0.06 g/cm 3 ) which have been measured for shallower core samples (3 cm deep vs. 8 cm in this study). This can be due to a decrease in belowground biomass with depth and thus, the shallower soil layers may encounter higher OCD than deeper layers [Keller et al., 2015;Saunders et al., 2006]. Several other studies have found OCD values similar to my results [e.g., Hinson et al., 2017;Kelleway et al., 2016]. The distribution of fractional SOM (being the ratio of the weight of organic material to the total weight of a soil sample) depends on both the amount of organic material generated yearly in the soil and on the amount of inorganic sediment deposited yearly. Thus, analyzing soil OMD (which I recall to be the weight of organic matter divided by the sample volume) should clarify the distribution of the amount of organic material alone. OMD measures represent smallest values at lower elevations close to the channel along T1 and highest elevations in the inner marsh area along T2 and T3 ( Figure   3.3 j, k and l). This behavior is similar to what is found in Venice Lagoon marshes (Italy), where OMD is minimum in more elevated areas close to the channel, but remains approximately constant elsewhere [Roner et al., 2016]. My observations are compatible with the expected dependence resulting from elevation controls on flooding duration, soil aeration, and decomposition rate. The analysis of vegetation cover shows that it does not significantly vary with elevation (R 2 = 0.17) at T1 (Figure 3.4 j). Additionally, the levees found close to the channel at T2 and T3 are covered by the highest amounts of vegetation density (Figure 3.4 k and l). This behavior is observed in several tidal environments [Marani et al., 2013] and is due to a reduced water logging stress [Ursino et al., 2004]. Overall, soil OMD shows a significant decrease with elevation, which cannot be explained in terms of observed vegetation cover trends. These observations support the hypothesis that at lower locations, where inundation is more prolonged, and the soil is less oxidized, a greater proportion of the fresh organic matter produced may be buried as SOM and results in a greater OMD [Hansen et al., 2017]. This hypothesis is further supported by the analysis of OMD as a function of flooding duration, a more direct proxy of soil aeration. In other words, the significant increase of OMD with flooding duration (Figure 3.5) is in agreement with the observed decreasing OMD values with elevation ( Figure 3.4 g, h and i) and confirms once more the hypothesis that the oxygen availability is the driving factor in the accumulation of organic matter in marsh soils. The value of hydrolysable fraction of dry mass of Spartina alterniflora, the dominant species in my study sites, containing 10 g leaves and 5-7 g fine roots is 0.604 [Harmon et al., 2009] which is within the ranges of hydrolysable fractions of green and rooibos tea (Hg = 0.842 \u00b1 0.023 and Hr = 0.552 \u00b1 0.050) used for litter decomposition experiments. In fact, the hydrolysable fraction of a dry mixture containing 10 g green tea and 6 g rooibos tea will be around 0.660 which is comparable to the hydrolysable fraction of Spartina. Thus, green tea and rooibos tea can be considered as adequate representatives of marsh vegetation. Here, the increasing trend for decomposition rate values of rooibos tea with elevation along T1 for both depths (Figure 3.6 a), consistent with the hypothesis that elevation, by increasing soil aeration, is a primary control of decomposition rate and a main determinant of SOM. However, such inference is not conclusively corroborated by data from transect T2 and T3 (Figure 3.6 b and c). In these transects, decomposition rates do not represent systematic trends in space or with respect to elevation. Hence, decomposition rates from T2 and T3 do not offer an explanation as to how the higher vegetation cover at higher elevation may be compensated for to yield relatively flat SOM profiles. Various studies suggested that the relation between decomposition rate and elevation can be highly varied [Hackney, 1987;Halupa and Howes, 1995;Janousek et al., 2017;White and Trapani, 1982]. The findings show that elevation can be positively linked to decomposition rate at site 1 but it does not affect the decomposition rate at site 2. The variations in decomposition rate can be partially due to grain size distribution which can consequently affect organic matter content [Gibeault et al., 2016]. In addition, other factors can alter decomposition rate such as vegetation composition, microbial community composition, and the physical and chemical micro-environment conditions [Janousek et al., 2017]. The stabilization factors also represent large variations at different transects ( Figure 3.6 d, e and f). While elevation and flooding duration seem not to offer any reasonable explanation for the variations seen in decomposition rates and stabilization factors across all sites, the deeper soil layers at most of the sample locations along each transects are characterized by smaller decomposition rates and larger stabilization factors rather than the shallower layers (Figure 3.8). This finding reinforces the notion that soil aeration is the main determinant of decompositions processes and, hence, of SOM. Elevation in T2 and T3 is generally lower than in T1, and flooding duration is correspondingly about 10-15% longer. Despite these differences, the observed ranges of decomposition rate and stabilization factor are quite similar. This observation is suggestive of a possible saturation of the effect of increased flooding duration on decomposition processes, such that decomposition rate and stabilization factor, everything else being equal, become stabilized if elevation is sufficiently low. The average value of the decomposition rate at 8 cm depth across all transects is about 0.010 d -1 . This is equivalent to a decay of 95% of the labile organic matter in about surface accretion in equilibrium with a nominal RRSLR of 2 mm yr -1 requires 40 years before the surface sediment is buried to a depth of 8 cm. Hence, a comparison between the time scale needed for decomposition (order of months) and for sediment burial (order of tens of years) suggests that the labile fraction of SOM is completely decomposed before it can reach deep soil layers and become stabilized. With variations of accretion rate in space or with time, the age of soil layers can vary spatially which leads to changes in decomposition properties. My analysis supports that, for the purpose of marsh accretion and morphodynamic evolution, the key role in determining SOM content is played by the initial refractory fraction of the fresh organic material, and by the stabilization factor. Stabilization, in fact, reduces the amount of organic matter subject to decomposition processes, thereby potentially increasing the eventual SOM amounts. The values observed for decomposition rate and stabilization factor for marshes in my study are comparable with data from other environments (Figure 3.8) [Keuskamp et al., 2013]. Differences are also notable. In deserts, for example, where moisture is very low, organic matter decays at about the same rate found for marshes, while the stabilization factor is increased. Overall, a visual inspection of Figure 3.8 suggests that marshes exhibit some of the lowest decomposition rates among all biomes (e.g., unlike fringe mangroves in tropical and subtropical areas where high temperatures favor decomposition processes). The labile fraction of SOM in marshes tends to be less stabilized by local edaphic conditions compared to other ecosystems, including peat [Currey et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2015].

The model incorporates vegetation dynamics, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. I assume that the marsh has a fixed landward boundary, but the seaward margin of the marsh can erode or accrete. My approach determines the conditions under which the marsh platform expands (in case of accretion on the margin between marsh and tidal flat exceeding the erosion), or contracts (in case of margin erosion exceeding deposition). These conditions are controlled by the fetch length which regulates the fetch-limited wave energy and the erosional dynamics on the margin. In my simulations, I assume that the intertidal surfaces consist of fine sediments which can be transported throughout the system resulting in a well-mixed and constant suspended sediment concentration in the water column within the whole system [Allen, 1994;D'Alpaos et al., 2006]. Here, I describe the state of the system by the average suspended sediment concentration, , and three geomorphic variables: tidal flat width, , tidal flat depth, , and marsh depth, . Accordingly, the mass conservation equation incorporating all sediment inputs and outputs to/from the control volume: The left-hand side of equation (3.1) is the rate of change of sediment mass, , in the control volume: where is the marsh width and is the length of estuary. The rate of sediment input from the river is computed as: where and are river sediment concentration and river discharge respectively. The rate of sediment input from the ocean is controlled by ocean tidal prism, , and ocean sediment concentration, , and is computed as: where is the tidal period. Due to the presence of a river and its contribution to filling the basin, is limited to the available volume in the system that can be filled with ocean water during one tidal cycle: I assume that erosion processes are controlled only by wind wave action and the influence of tidal currents is negligible [Christiansen et al., 2000;. In addition, due to the effective wind wave dissipation by vegetation, marsh bed erosion can be neglected Moller et al., 1999]. Therefore, bed erosion can happen only on the tidal flat platform and is governed by the wave-induced bed shear stress, (see appendix C). The sediments removed from the tidal flat through erosion processes are added back to the system as a source of sediment input. I estimate the rate of sediment input due to bed erosion, , by: where 0 is a bed erosion coefficient and is the critical shear stress ( = 0.3 Pa, see the complete list of model parameters in Table C.1 in appendix C). accounts for the fraction of time within a time step (set to one tidal period) when the tidal flat is submerged and can be eroded, and is computed as: where is the tidal amplitude. Deposition, however, can occur on both tidal flat and marsh surfaces. The rate of deposition on the tidal flat, , depends on the average concentration of the system and is limited to the total available sediment in the water column. Hence, it is computed as: where is the settling velocity. I assume that due to the presence of vegetation all sediment in the water column above the marsh deposits on the marsh surface. Therefore, the rate of deposition on the marsh, , is: The sum of these two deposition terms gives the rate of total deposition, : The rate of sediment export, , from the control volume with outgoing ebb currents depends on the sediment concentration and the size of the tidal flat, and is computed as: The last term in equation (3.1), , reflects the net rate of sediment that can be introduced to the system due to the erosion of the margin between the marsh and tidal flat (hereafter referred to as 'the margin'), or can be removed from the system due to deposition on the margin and marsh expansion. This term is computed as: where \u0307 is the change of margin position in time and is the sediment bulk density. To model the dynamics of the margin, I use the approach proposed by Mariotti and Carr [2014] and describe \u0307 based on the competition between margin erosion, , and progradation, : Margin erosion is controlled by wave power density at the margin and is computed as: where is a margin erodibility coefficient, is the specific weight of water, is the wave group velocity, and is the wave significant height on the tidal flat (see appendix C). Margin progradation is dictated by sediment accretion on a gently sloping surface and is computed by: where is a margin accretion coefficient which describes the geometry of the marsh boundary [Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013]. Mariotti and Carr [2014] discuss that estimations of and cannot be independently performed, however, the selection of = 2 (equivalent to a slope of 26\u00b0) corresponds to = 0.16 ( ) \u22121 which provides the best fit for margin migration data from marshes along the US Atlantic coast reported in Mariotti and Fagherazzi [2013]. For simplicity, I consider a wind regime blowing perpendicular to the margin with a constant velocity of 6 m/s [Mariotti and Carr, 2014]. The morphological evolution of the bed topography of the tidal flat platform is governed by local erosion and deposition processes and varies with SLR rate, : where \u0307 is the rate of change of tidal flat depth. The first and second terms on the righthand side of equation (316) incorporate sediment deposition and erosion processes, respectively. The rate of change of marsh depth, \u0307, however, is mainly governed by sediment deposition processes from inorganic and organic sediment, and SLR rate: where is the rate of organic matter production. I estimate from: where incorporates vegetation characteristics and the density of the organic soil produced, and is the biomass production rate. I model using the approach proposed by Marani et al. [2010] which describes the production rate based on the vegetation fractional cover and carrying capacity of the system, . Biomass is assumed to be in equilibrium with marsh platform elevation and thus the steady state solution for biomass is estimated by (1 \u2212 ), where and are mortality and reproduction rates, respectively. and are functions of the elevation of the marsh platform relative to mean sea level (MSL), , and are computed as: assuming that the common halophytic salt marsh vegetation, Spartina alterniflora, is the dominant species colonizing the marsh with its highest density at = 0 and lowest density at = due to adaptation to hypoxic conditions [Morris et al., 2002]. The assumption of steady state biomass is valid only if \u2265 0, otherwise, if the marsh surface is below MSL, the vegetation cannot grow (i.e. if < 0, = 0) [Silvestri et al., 2005]. The set of nonlinear dynamical equations describing lateral margin dynamics, the vertical marsh and tidal flat dynamics, and the concentration in the well-mixed water column describe the evolution of the system and are here solved numerically, both in steady and unsteady state (equations 3.1, 3.13, 3.16, and 3.17, see appendix C for more detailed description)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "The findings reveal that vertical depositional processes on tidal flats in addition to the horizontal dynamics of margin migration can lead to transitions from tidal flat-to marsh-dominance. It is important to note that these vertical dynamics can influence the basins of attractions leading to marsh-or tidal flat-dominance in two ways: 1) by adding to the marsh-dominance basin and 2) by influencing the rate at which the transitions from one basin of attraction to another can happen. The latter is supported by the finding by Mariotti and Fagherazzi [2013] that the depositional vertical dynamics happen at faster timescales than horizontal ones. Therefore, transitions from tidal flat to marsh can happen faster if vertical dynamics are involved in addition to the horizontal dynamics. Moreover, the relatively slow horizontal dynamics, asymptotically leading to marsh-or tidal flat-dominance, suggest that estuaries are likely to be found, at any given time, in a transition state between marsh-and tidal flat-dominated estuaries, dictated by temporal variations in environmental forcings. Despite their importance in determining marsh-vs. tidal flat-dominance, however, previous studies only consider the horizontal depositional/erosional processes that result in margin migration, and neglect the situations under which tidal flats can emerge and convert to marsh regulating transitions between tidal flat-and marsh-dominance [e.g., see D'Alpaos and Kirwan and Murray, 2007;Kirwan et al., 2016;Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013;Mariotti and Carr, 2014;Mudd et al., 2009]. These vertical depositional processes are especially critical when addressing system response to environmental change in different locations with varying tidal ranges. For instance, the vertical processes can largely alter the dynamics of the system and significantly add to the extent of the marsh-dominance basin (e.g., Figure 4.3 d and Figure 4.4 d). In addition, while considering only the lateral margin dynamics suggests that marshes in a macrotidal environment with a tidal range of 5 m can be vulnerable to a SLR rate of 6 mm/yr, incorporating the vertical depositional dynamics shows that marshes are indeed resilient to SLR and can survive ( Figure 4.3 d). Moreover, the model experiments reveal that river inputs of water and suspended sediment influence the stability and extent of wetland and embayed estuary equilibria, though they do not alter the basic dynamics that produce these alternative stable states. Increasing river discharge promotes marsh expansion when the river concentration is greater than the ocean concentration and leads to marsh retreat when the river concentration is smaller, having a similar effect to SLR in terms of shrinking marsh-dominance basin. Therefore, in a system with varying ocean and river concentrations, the ocean to river discharge ratio is one of the key controlling factors of the system behavior as it determines the final yield of sediment import to the system. In addition to the river characteristics, other environmental and topographic parameters govern the morphodynamics of tidal flat/marsh platforms. For instance, increasing the ocean sediment concentration leads to marsh-dominance expansion and stability of marshes in response to changes of SLR rates. The effect of increasing tidal range is similar: marshes are more resilient in a macrotidal environment compared to mesotidal and microtidal systems [D'Alpaos et al., 2011;. In contrast, SLR and wind velocity favor tidal flat expansion and small marsh-dominance basins. Estuary size, when comparing estuaries with similar river characteristics and ocean sediment inputs, is another key determinant of marsh vs. tidal flat extent. Indeed, the size of the basin shapes the behavior of the system by controlling the water volume and determining the relative importance of ocean to river discharge. Moreover, the results suggest that estuary length and basin width influence the system through different mechanisms. Estuary length influences both tidal flat and marsh whereas the basin width mainly controls marsh area. In general, with higher ratios of tidal flat area to marsh area, the system tends to lose sediment through export via ebb currents, whereas lower ratios favor sediment absorption by the system through effective sedimentation on the marsh surface. It is worth noting that the results of my model are quantitatively limited to the different system configurations considered in this work (since the marsh vs. tidal flat boundaries can shift in case of system settings due to variation in the average concentration of the system and depth), however, they are qualitatively robust in explaining the relationships between different factors in determining tidal flat vs. marsh extent. A sensitivity analysis suggests that among all parameters, basin width and river concentration have the most influence on the model output variations, whereas SLR rate is one of the least influential parameters. In addition, when basin width is fixed, the influence of both river concentration and SLR rate increases for basins with smaller widths. This finding confirms that riverine sediment inputs can especially help marshes in narrower basins, where they are highly threatened by elevated SLR rates, prevent drowning in response to SLR. My model addresses the relevant mechanisms for morphodynamic evolution of tidal flat and marsh within an estuary, however, it has some limitations as some processes have been simplified. For instance, my model considers a constant effective sediment concentration and falls short of addressing varying concentration during a tidal cycle as a result of erosion and deposition, and with changing water depth. Due to these limitations and the limitations discussed earlier about the model framework, the model should only be used to understand the role of different dynamical mechanisms, rather than to produce detailed predictions. In summary, the model developed is the first estuarine scale model which includes the full range of relevant geomorphic processes including local processes at the scale of an individual marsh/tidal flat and larger scale processes at the scale of watershed and estuary. The findings reveal that different mechanisms regulate the transitions from tidal flat-to marsh-dominance: lateral erosion and accretion dynamics at the margin, and vertical accretion dynamics on tidal flat surface that can happen much more rapidly than lateral dynamics. I suggest that considering both lateral and vertical dynamics is critical and otherwise it is not possible to address the full range of mechanisms regulating marsh extent. In addition, the results show that rivers can affect the extent of marshes in two ways: 1) by fluvial sediment delivery to tidal platforms, and 2) by regulating exchange with the ocean through riverine discharge. Among various environmental forcings and geometric properties controlling tidal flat-vs. marshdominance, river concentration is found to be a key factor influencing the marsh vs. tidal flat extent for basins with similar widths. Considering that different parts of the estuary may have different sizes and orientations, the same wind regime can represent a very different forcing in different parts of the system (due to the potential variations in the fetch length and the angle between direction of wind and marsh margin in different locations). Additionally, sediment availability may be quite variable across an estuary. All these situations may explain the simultaneous occurrence of marsh-and tidal flatdominance in different parts of a single system."}, {"section_title": "Simulations Setup", "text": "The model experiments begin with uniform marsh and tidal flat platforms with depths set to \u00bc and \u00be of the tidal range, respectively. I used two different approaches to run the model simulations under different conditions of a system containing marsh and tidal flat platforms. First, I set the initial value of tidal flat width equal to 100 m and numerically solved the system of equations (including equations 3.1, 3.13, 3.16, and 3.17) at steady state to find the equilibrium solutions. To do this, I used a Matlab\u00ae solver that implements the Trust-Region Dogleg method, an advanced Newton method for nonlinear problems (fsolve). In this approach, I disregarded the elevation at which the dominant marsh vegetation, Spartina patens, starts to grow. Therefore, this approach does not account for tidal flat conversion to marsh. Instead, it only considers the conditions under which the horizontal erosion and deposition dynamics on the marsh/tidal flat margin lead to transitions between tidal flat-and salt marsh-basins of attraction. In the second approach, I used a Matlab\u00ae ordinary differential equation solver that implements the Numerical Differentiation Formulas (ode15s). I simulated the evolution of the system for 1000 years using time steps equal to one tidal period. Starting with 1 m as the initial tidal flat width, if at the end of 1000 years the system was filled with marsh or the marsh was still expanding, the system was considered to lie on a marsh-dominance basin, whereas if the marsh was fully eroded or was still contracting, the system was considered to lie on a tidal flat-dominance basin. I kept repeating this procedure with larger initial values of tidal flat width in 1 m increments up to the size of basin width. The initial tidal flat widths lying on the border between marsh-and tidal flat-dominance basins were considered the solutions at equilibrium. Here, I allowed tidal flat conversion to marsh by setting the elevation at which vegetation starts to grow to mean sea level, and thus, both vertical and horizontal dynamics can lead to transitions between basins of attraction. In both approaches, the reference values for variables were set to: tidal range = 1.4 m, river concentration = 5 and 50 mg/l, river discharge = 5 and 50 m3/s, ocean concentration = 10 mg/l, basin width = 5 km, estuary length = 5 km, wind velocity = 6 m/s, and sea level rise rate = 6 mm/yr. Table C.1 lists the parameter values considered for my simulations.

I applied a variance-based method which considers the contribution of variables to the variance of model outputs as a measure of sensitivity, known to be effective for environmental studies [Pianosi et al., 2016]. The general form of the model is given by = ( 1 , 2 , \u2026 , ), where is the model output and is the input variable for = 1, 2, \u2026 , . The \"main effect\", , is a measure for the direct contribution of the th variable in the total variation of model outputs and is defined by [Saltelli et al., 2010]: where denotes the variance, denotes the expected value, and ~ refers to all variables except for . corresponds to the variation in the outputs that can be explained by . In other words, it accounts for the reduction of output variance if is fixed. To measure the overall contribution of the th variable in the model results, the \"total effect\", , is then defined by [Homma and Saltelli, 1996]: describes all the influences of on the outputs including both the main effects and joint effects due to possible interactions with other variables. I also analyzed the joint influence of different variables due to the possible physical interactions between them [Saltelli et al., 2010]: Here, accounts for the influence that the interaction between the pair of and can have on the model results. I considered eight variable inputs including river concentration (ranging between 10 and 5000 mg/l), river discharge (ranging between 10 and 5000 m 3 /s), ocean concentration (ranging between 5 and 65 mg/l), tidal range (ranging between 0.5 and 16.5 m), wind velocity (ranging between 2 and 10 m/s), sea level rise rate (ranging between 2 and 18 mm/yr), basin width (ranging between 1 and 17 km) and estuary length (ranging between 1 and 17 km). I considered five different values for each variable producing 8 5 =390625 different settings for an estuary system. The results suggest that the influence of basin width on the critical fetch length is the highest among all the parameters (with = 0.67 and = 0.69 which are more than three times larger than those of other variables). In addition to the indirect controls of basin width on critical fetch (e.g., determining the ocean to river discharge ratio and controlling the amount of sediment import/export and accretion/erosion processes), basin width also directly affects the critical fetch length by setting its boundary limits. This direct control overshadows the influence of other parameters. To resolve this issue, I fixed the basin width and computed the main and total effects of other parameters. I repeated this for different values of basin width. The results show that the effects of river concentration are the largest (Figure 4.7). Tidal range, wind velocity and river discharge are the other influential parameters. Despite the physical interactions between river concentration and discharge, the effect of river discharge is less than half that of river concentration. This could be because of a possible saturation of the effect of increased discharge on the behavior of the system, such that river discharge fills the system and the excess water does not contribute to the system dynamics. The results also show that the influences of SLR rate and ocean concentration when considered alone are the smallest, however, they contribute to output variation through interactions with other parameters. The difference between S and T describes the portion of the total effect that is only due to interactions with other parameters, and is largest for river concentration and tidal range. This suggests that the interactions between these parameters are probably greater than with other parameters. Analyzing the joint influences of parameters verifies this point (Figure 4.8). It is also important to note that influence of river discharge is the largest when interacting with river concentration, determining the sediment import to the system through the river. "}]
