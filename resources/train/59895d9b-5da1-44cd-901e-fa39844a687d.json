[{"section_title": "", "text": "In previous research, a substantial gap in test scores between white and black students persists, even after controlling for a wide range of observable characteristics. Using a data set made available by the National Center for Education Statistics, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, this paper demonstrates that in stark contrast to earlier studies, the black-white test score gap among incoming kindergartners disappears when controlling for a small number of covariates. Over the first 2 years of school, however, blacks lose substantial ground relative to other races. There is suggestive evidence that differences in school quality may be an important part of the explanation. None of the other hypotheses tested to explain why Blacks are losing ground receive any empirical backing. The difference between this study's findings and previous research is consistent with real gains made by recent cohorts of blacks, although other explanations are also possible.

Despite the fact that we see no difference in initial test scores for observationally equivalent Black and White children when they enter kindergarten, their paths diverge once they are in school. Between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade, Black students lose .20 standard deviations relative to White students with similar characteristics.' If the gap in test scores for these children continues to grow at the same rate, by fifth grade the Black students will be .50 standard deviations behind their White counterparts a gap similar in magnitude to that found in previous analyses (Jones et. al., 1982, and Phillips (2000))."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "The leading explanation for the worse trajectory of Black students in our sample is that they attend lower quality schools. When we compare the change in test scores over time for Blacks and Whites attending the same school, Black students lose only a third as much ground as they do relative to Whites in the overall sample. This result suggests that differences in quality across schools attended by Whites and Blacks is likely to be an important part of the story. Interestingly, along \"traditional\" dimensions of school quality (class size, teacher education, computer:student ratio, etc.), Blacks and Whites attend schools that are similar. On a wide range of \"non-standard\" school inputs (e.g., gang problems in school, percent of students on free lunch, amount of loitering in front of school by non-students, amount of litter around the school, whether or not students need hall passes, and PTA funding), Blacks do appear to be attending much worse schools after controlling for individual characteristics.' Our story is incomplete, . 4 Neither Hispanics nor Asians experience this widening test score gap over time. Indeed, Hispanic children systematically close the gap relative to Whites, presumably because their initial scores are artificially low as a consequence of limited English proficiency among some Hispanic parents. 'This pattern is also consistent with self-selection of low-achieving Whites into schools attended by Blacks. Casting doubt on this alternative explanation is the fact that Whites who go 3 6 however, because the observable differences across schools do little to explain the widening Black-White gap. We explore a range of other explanations as to why Black children are losing ground, but find very little empirical support for these alternative theories. Black students do not appear to suffer bigger \"summer setbacks\" when school is not in session. The lower trajectories of Black students is not simply an artifact of standardized testing. Subjective teacher assessments of student performance yield patterns similar to the test-score data. Having a Black teacher provides no benefit to Black students compared to their White classmates, calling into question the possible role of either overt discrimination or low expectations for Black children on the part of White teachers. Finally, adding proxies for behavioral problems does not alter our findings. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II provides a brief review of the literature. Section III describes and summarizes the data set. Section IV presents the basic results for incoming kindergartners, demonstrating that the Black-White test score gap disappears once other confounding factors are accounted for.

Background and Previous Literature", "text": "The Coleman Report (Coleman et. al. 1966) was the first national study to describe ethnic to school with Blacks have baseline test scores upon entering kindergarten that are similar to those who are in all-White classes (Humphreys, 1988, documents a similar finding among high school students). When we eliminate from the sample Whites who have no Black children in their class (more than 60 percent of all White children fall into this category), we obtain similar results. 4 7 differences in academic achievement among children at various stages of schooling. It documented that substantial differences in educational achievement between blacks and whites not only existed at every grade level, but increased with student age. Since then, substantial effort has been devoted to understanding what variables account for the gap, as well as how and why the magnitude of the gap has changed over time.' A number of stylized facts have emerged. Socio-economic status and the effects of poverty are important factors in explaining racial differences in educational achievement (Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997, Mayer 1997, Brooks-Gunn et. al (1994, 2000. Even after controlling for socio-economic status in conventional regression analysis, a substantial gap still remains. That gap has generally been declining over time, although for high school students today, the gap is slightly larger than it was in the late 1980's (Grissmer et. al. 1998, Hedges and Nowell 1998, and Humphreys 1998. Finally, the gap in test scores between Blacks and Whites historically emerges before children enter kindergarten and tends to widen over time (Phillips et. al. 1998, Carneiro, Heckman, andManoli 2002)."}, {"section_title": "III. The Data", "text": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Thus far, information on these children has been gathered at four separate points in time. The full sample was interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade. One-fourth of the respondents were also interviewed in the fall of first grade. The sample will eventually be followed through fifth grade.' Roughly 1,000 schools are included in the sample, with an average of more than twenty children per school in the study. As a consequence, it is possible to conduct within-school analyses. A wide range of data is gathered on the children in the study, which is described in detail at the ECLS website http: / /nces.ed.gov /ecls. We utilize just a small subset of the available information in our baseline specifications (although we also show that similar results are obtained in a much more fully specified model). Students who are missing data on test-scores, race, or age are dropped from our sample. Summary statistics for the variables we use in our core specifications are displayed by race in Table 1, with White referring solely to non-Hispanic Whites.' Our primary outcome variables are math and reading standardized test scores.' Standardized tests were administered to In addition, there is an ECLS birth cohort that tracks a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 children born in 2001 through the first grade. There are also a small number of children in the data whose racial status is classified as \"other.\" These include Hawaiian, mixed race, and Native American students. Such students are included in our regressions, but not shown in the summary statistics table. 9 These tests were developed especially for the ECLS, but are based on existing instruments including Children's Cognitive Battery (CCB); Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (PIAT-R); Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-3 (PPVT-3); Primary Test of Cognitive Skills (PTCS); and Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R). A \"general knowledge\" exam was also administered. The general knowledge test is designed to capture \"children's knowledge and understanding of the social, physical, and natural world and their ability to draw inferences and comprehend implications.\" No further information is available on the precise content of the general knowledge exam questions or skills tested. We limit the analysis to math and reading scores, primarily because of the comparability of these test scores to past research in the area. In addition, there appear to be some peculiarities in the results of the general knowledge exam. For instance, Asians score well above other 6 9 the full sample in the fall of kindergarten and in the spring of first grade.' The reading test includes questions designed to measure basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, and word recognition), vocabulary and comprehension, listening and reading comprehension, knowledge of the alphabet, phonetics, etc. The math test evaluates number recognition, counting, comparing and ordering numbers, solving word problems, and interpreting picture graphs. The values reported in the table are item response theory (IRT) scores provided in ECLS-K, which we have transformed to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one for the overall sample on each of the tests and time periods.\" In all instances sample weights provided in ECLS-K are used.'2 White students on average score .274 standard deviations above the mean on the math exam in the fall of kindergarten, whereas Black students perform .364 standard deviations below the mean on that groups on math and reading, but do extremely poorly on the general knowledge exam. Also, Black students do extremely poorly on the general knowledge exam, even though teachers rate them only slightly behind Whites in this area on the subjective teacher evaluations. Most of our results also appear in the general knowledge scores, and we note the instances where differences arise. 1\u00b0 The tests were also given in the spring of kindergarten, but we limit our focus to the endpoints of the available data. The kindergarten spring test results are in all cases consistent with the results presented in the paper. \" Because children were asked different questions depending on the answers they provided to the initial questions on the test, IRT-adjusted scores are preferable to simple testscore measures reflecting the number of correct answers a child provided. For more detail on the process used to generate the IRT scores, see chapter 3 of the ECLS-K Users Guide. Our results are not sensitive to normalizing the IRT scores to have a zero mean and standard deviation equal to one. 12 Because of the complex manner in which the ECLS-K sample is drawn, different weights are suggested by the providers of the data depending upon the set of variables used. We utilize the weights recommended for making longitudinal comparisons. None of our findings are sensitive to other choices of weights, or not weighting at all. 7 1 0 test, yielding a Black-White gap of .638 standard deviations. By the spring of first grade, that gap has increased to .728 standard deviations. The initial Black-White gap on reading is smaller (.401 standard deviations). Like math, however, the reading gap widens substantially to .529 standard deviations by the end of first grade. It is worth noting that the Black-White gaps are substantially smaller than those observed in earlier data sets for children of the same age. For instance,  report a raw Black-White test score gap of over one standard deviation in reading using the Children of the NLSY (CNLSY) and Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) data sets, which covers the cohorts born in the years 1980-1987(CNLSY) and 1984-1985. A second outcome measure that we analyze is subjective teacher assessments of a child's math and reading achievement. Teachers were asked to answer 20 questions about the child's academic performance, ranking them on a scale of \"Not Yet\" to \"Proficient.\" These answers were then transformed into IRT scores. As was done with test scores, these subjective assessments have been re-normalized to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. The patterns in the teacher assessments mirror those in the test-score data: Black and Hispanic students start out substantially below Whites, and Black students lose ground over the first two years of school, whereas Hispanics maintain their position relative to Whites. The most notable difference between the test scores and teacher assessments is that Asian students are rated at or below the level of White students in the fall of kindergarten on the teacher assessments, but then gain relative to Whites over time. The remainder of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the other variables used in the analysis. In contrast to the test score variables, for which we have observations at multiple points in time, most of the control variables are either collected only once (typically kindergarten fall, but in some cases kindergarten spring), or exhibit little variation over time for individual students. The most important of these covariates is a composite measure of socio-economic status constructed by the researchers conducting the ECLS survey. The components used in the SES measure are parental education, parental occupational status, and household income. Other There are substantial differences across races on many of these variables. Black children in the sample are growing up under circumstances likely to be less conducive to academic achievement than White children: lower socio-economic status, fewer children's books in the home, etc. Hispanics are also worse off than Whites on average. For Asians, the patterns are more mixed. While this may seem an odd set of covariates to include, our rationale is that the results we obtain with this small set of variables mirrors the findings when we include an exhaustive set of over 100 controls.' We caution against a causal interpretation of the coefficients on the covariates, which we view as proxies for a broad set of environmental and behavioral factors. In light of past research that has had great difficulty making the Black-White test score gap disappear, we focus on the results from these very sparse regressions to highlight the fact that the sharp differences between our results and earlier studies is not primarily a consequence of the availability of better covariates in the ECLS. \" A more detailed description of each of the variables used is provided in the appendix. 14 We also present the results using a fuller set of controls for completeness. 9 12 IV. Estimating racial test score gaps for incoming kindergartners The vector of other covariates included in the specification, denoted X varies across columns in Table 2. As one moves to the right in the table, the set of covariates steadily grows. In all instances, the estimation is done using weighted least squares, with weights corresponding to the sampling weights provided in the data set. The first and sixth columns of Only a small gap persists for Hispanics. The advantage enjoyed by Asians becomes even greater. R-squared increases substantially relative to the previous specification. The fact that the Black-White test score gap essentially disappears with the inclusion of sufficient controls in Table 2 is a very striking result, given that in past research a substantial gap has persisted, regardless of the covariates included.' For example, Hernstein and Murray (1994) reduce the gap by one-third, Neal and Johnson (1996) reduce the gap by sixty percent, and  reduce the black-white gap by two thirds.\" Indeed, despite the fact that  have the greatest success in explaining the racial differences in reading achievement, the residual gap is almost as large as the raw gap in our data. There is little reason to believe that it is the precise set of covariates available in the ECLS that accounts for our ability to eliminate the gap. For example, just accounting for socio-economic status at kindergarten entry, we estimate the Black-White gap in reading as -.134 compared to -.67 in . Rather, it appears either that the Blacks we examine made real gains \" The two exceptions we are aware of in which the Black-White test score gap has been made to disappear are Li and Poirier (2002) and Carneiro, Heckman, and Manoli (2002). Li and Poirier (2002), using a Bayesian structural model, find no systematic differences between Blacks and Whites using the NLSY. Hernstein and Murray (1994) and , using different methods on the same data, find large gaps still persists. Using Children of the NLSY, Carneiro, Heckman, and Manoli (2002) find that on some tests, racial gaps disappear with controls, although large gaps remain on other tests designed to capture similar sets of skills. relative to Whites, or alternatively, non-random selection into earlier data sets led to exaggerated estimates of the racial gap in earlier studies.' The final specifications in Table 2 (columns 5 and 10) include an exhaustive set of roughly100 covariates capturing city size, neighborhood characteristics, region of the country, parental education, parental income, parental occupational status, family size and structure, whether the mother worked, type of pre-school program participation, whether English is spoken at home, and the extent of parental involvement in a child's life and school. We report only a subset of the covariates in Table 2; full results are presented in Appendix Table 1. Almost all of the controls enter in the predicted direction and with coefficients of plausible magnitude. Interestingly, none of the coefficients on race change appreciably. Only a few of the parameters on the controls included in the parsimonious specifications are greatly affected either, and these are easily explained. The socio-economic status coefficient shrinks because the full set of covariates includes variables that go into the construction of the composite indicator such as parent's income and occupational status. The coefficient on age becomes highly negative because an age squared term (which is positive and significant) is included in the full specification. The inclusion of these additional variables does little to improve the fit of the model. Table 3 explores the sensitivity of the estimated racial gaps in test scores across a wide variety of alternative specifications and sub-samples of the data. We report only the race coefficients and associated standard errors in the table. The top row of the table presents the baseline results using a full sample and our parsimonious set of controls (corresponding to columns 4 and 9 of Table 2). Weighting all of the observations equally in the regressions leaves the Black-White gap in math and reading remain virtually unchanged. Employing an alternative test-score measure (T-scores, which are norm-referenced measurements of achievement) has very little impact on the results. One might be concerned that restricting all the coefficient estimates to be identical across the entire sample may yield misleading results. Regressions on a common support (e.g. only on single mothers, or only in rural areas) provide one means of addressing this concern. Almost every subset of the data examined yields results roughly similar to those for the overall sample. There is some slight evidence that Black females do better relative to Whites than do Black males. The results appear to be quite consistent across quintiles of the socio-economic status distribution. Due in part to relatively imprecise estimates, the equality of Black and White test scores on math and reading tests can rarely be rejected for any of the quintiles. Rural Blacks do somewhat worse relative to whites than those in central cities. Blacks in private schools appear to do especially well, consistent with Neal (1997) and Grogger and Neal (2000).19 The results presented in Tables 2 and 3 maintain the assumption that children of different races are equally responsive to changes in covariates. Cross-race differences in coefficients are 19 We have also experimented with limiting the sample to the set of children for whom there is substantial overlap across races in background characteristics. More specifically, we ran probits with an indicator variable for Black as the dependent variable and the full set of covariates as predictors. When we drop from the sample the roughly 30 percent of students whose predicted probability of being Black is less than 10 percent or greater than 90 percent, the Black-White gap on math rises slightly and the reading gap becomes closer to zero. potentially important because they affect the interpretation of the racial test score gap estimates in the preceding tables. Black children experience worse environments on average. If Black children do not derive as much benefit from improvements in socio-economic status, number of children's books, higher birth weight, etc., then our earlier results will overstate the convergence in Black-White test scores. Table 4 presents within-race estimates of our basic specifications to determine how large this bias may be. Columns 1 and 6 replicate the coefficient estimates from the full sample. The remaining columns present results within a specific race category. The Black children in our sample are less responsive to changes in socio-economic status than Whites: a one-standard deviation improvement in socio-economic status for a Black child is associated with a .176 standard deviation increase in math scores, compared to .316 for a White child. For most of the other covariates, however, the White and Black coefficients are similar. Using the coefficients in columns 3 and 8, a Black child that had the characteristics of the average White child in the sample would be estimated to score -.21 standard deviations below that White child on math and be almost exactly even in reading.' Thus, to the extent that public policies are designed to improve the environments experienced by Black children, our baseline estimates may slightly overstate the ground that would be gained by Blacks. This logic also holds for Hispanics, but not for Asians, who seem to be more responsive to environmental influences."}, {"section_title": "V. The evolution of the racial test score gaps as children age", "text": "The results of the previous section demonstrate that although Black test scores lag Whites by a large margin, the inclusion of a small number of covariates eliminates any systematic differences in the math and reading performances of Whites and Blacks entering kindergarten. Hispanics somewhat lag Whites, and Asians exceed all of the other races. In this section, we explore how those racial gaps change over time. In terms of raw test scores, simple calculations based on the numbers in Table 1 show that Black students lose some ground relative to Whites between the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade: .090 standard deviations on math and .128 standard deviations on reading. Table 5 presents regression results for those two time periods We report results only from our \"parsimonious\" regression specification; similar racial gaps emerge when the exhaustive set of covariates is included. Controlling for other factors in the regressions, Black students appear to lose much more ground than they do in the raw means: -.156 standard deviations on math and .188 standard deviations on reading.' If Black students in the sample continue to lose ground through ninth grade at the rate experienced in the first two years of school, they will lag White students on average by a full standard deviation in raw math and reading scores and over twothirds of a standard deviation in math even after controlling for observable characteristics (substantially smaller for reading). Raw gaps of that magnitude would be similar to those found in previous studies of high-school age children (Grissmer, Flanagan, and Williamson 1998, 21Similar results (not shown in the table) are obtained when we include the full set of nearly 100 covariates. In those specifications, Black students lose .136 standard deviations on math and .109 standard deviations on reading. Including the fall kindergarten test score as a covariate predicting the spring first grade test score also has little impact on the results: Black students lose .192 (.140) standard deviations in math (reading). Hedges and Nowell 1998, Humphreys 1988, and Phillips, 2000. In striking contrast to the Black-White gap, Hispanics show gains relative to Whites between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade. Asians lose roughly as much ground as Blacks on math (although they start ahead of Whites) and also fall slightly on reading. Thus, Black students are not only losing ground relative to Whites, but even more so relative to Hispanics, and somewhat less compared to Asians. VI. Why are Black students losing ground in the first two years of school? Understanding why Black students fare worse in the first two years of school, is a question of paramount importance for two reasons. First, knowing the source of the divergence may aid in developing public policies to alleviate the problem. Second, determining the explanation for the widening gap will help to determine whether the simple linear extrapolation over the academic career is a plausible conjecture. There are a number of plausible explanations as to why the racial gap in test scores grows as children age: (1) Black children attend lower quality schools on average, (2) the importance of parental/environmental contributions may grow over time. Since Black children are on average disadvantaged in this regard, they fall behind, (3) because of worse home and neighborhood environments, Black students suffer worse \"summer setbacks\" when school is not in session, 4the results are an artifact of the particular standardized tests used/poor measurement of a child's environment, rather than representing true losses, (5) something about the interaction between Black students and schools interferes with the learning process. Such factors might include discrimination/low expectations on the part of teachers toward Black students, systematic 17 20 differences in self-control or socialization across children of different races, etc., or (6) the fall kindergarten test scores are measuring a different set of skills than the later tests and the gap between Whites and Blacks is greater on the set of skills measured later. We address each of these hypotheses in turn. Are Black students losing ground because they attend worse schools? There is substantial racial segregation in school attendance in the United States. In our data which samples roughly 20 children each from approximately 1,000 schools, in 35 percent of those schools there is not a single Black child in the sample.' The mean Black student in our sample attends a school that is 59 percent Black and 8 percent Hispanic. In contrast, the typical White student goes to a school that is only 6 percent Black and 5 percent Hispanic. Given that the overlap in schools attended by Blacks and Whites is relatively limited, one plausible explanation for why Black students are losing ground is that they attend worse schools on average. Because our data set has many individuals from each school include in the sampling frame, school-fixed effects can be included in the estimation. With school-fixed effects, the estimated Black-White test score gap is identified off of the relative performance of Blacks and Whites attending the same school, as opposed to across schools. To the extent that differential average school quality across races is the complete explanation for the widening racial test score gap, one would predict that the gap should not widen over time when comparing Blacks and Whites attending the same school. There are, of course, thorny issues of sample selection that potentially complicate the interpretation of these results: White students who elect to attend 22 Black students may attend these schools, but just not be in the classrooms sampled. This set of students is relevant because only mixed-race schools provide useful variation to identify the racial test score gap when school-fixed effects are included. Column 3 of the table shows the baseline results reflecting the fact that Blacks are losing ground in the full sample (-.156 standard deviations relative to Whites in math, -.188 standard deviations in reading). When we eliminate students attending all-White schools from the sample, but otherwise estimate identical specifications, the results are not greatly affected. Blacks continue to lose substantial ground by the end of first grade. When school-fixed effects are included in the regression (columns 7-9), the Black-White test-score gap is identified off of differences between Blacks and Whites attending the same school. The estimates of ground lost by Blacks shrinks to less than one-third of the magnitude in the full sample, and is not statistically different from zero in these specifications.' ' This finding in some ways parallels Currie and Thomas's (1995) finding that students early gains for students who attend Head Start tend to disappear due to low quality schools that these students later attend. In our data, however, there is no positive effect of Head Start on student test scores even in kindergarten, once other factors are controlled for. These findings are consistent with but not definitive proof of the argument that systematic differences in school quality for Blacks and Whites may explain the divergence in test scores. An alternative explanation is that Whites who choose to attend schools with Blacks are systematically worse than other Whites. Note, however, that a comparison of columns 1 and 4 show that in the fall of kindergarten Black students actually fare somewhat worse relative to Whites who attend schools with Blacks then they do with the full sample of Whites. This finding suggests that the Whites who go to school with Blacks (controlling for observables) actually achieve at a slightly higher level than do those who attend all-White schools, which is consistent with previous research. Moreover, comparing columns 4 and 7, in kindergarten fall, Blacks do even worse relative to Whites attending the same school than they do compared to other Whites. Thus, a simple selection story in which low-achieving Whites are more likely to go to school with Blacks is not consistent with the data. On the other hand, we cannot rule out a priori the possibility that Whites who attend school with Blacks are on lower academic trajectories, despite the fact that they initially score better on tests than other Whites. If Blacks attend worse schools than Whites on average, one might expect that this would be reflected in observable characteristics of the schools. Table 7 analyzes this issue. Each row of the table corresponds to a different measure of school quality. Column 1 presents means and standard deviations of each variable in the data. Columns 2-5 report the race coefficients from regressions that are parallel to those elsewhere in the paper, except that school inputs are the dependent variable rather than test scores. Thus, the entries in columns 2-5 reflect the extent to which children of other races attend higher or lower quality schools on each of the measures, controlling for our \"parsimonious\" set of covariates. On traditional measures of school quality 20 such as class size, teacher's education, computers in class, and interne connections, differences between blacks and whites are small. On the other hand, the percentage of students eligible for free lunch, the degree of gang problems in school, the amount of loitering in front of the school by non-students, and the amount of litter around the schools are much higher for blacks. There are a number of important weaknesses in the argument that differential school quality explains the divergent trajectories of Whites and Blacks. First, the observable measures of school inputs included in Table 7 explain only a small fraction of the variation in student outcomes. For instance, adding the school input measures to our basic student-level test-score regressions only increases the R-squared of the regression by .05. Second, even after the school input measures are added to the test-score regressions, the gap between Blacks and Whites continues to widen. Thus, these particular school inputs are not adequately capturing the critical differences across schools. Finally, on the measured school inputs, both Hispanics and Asians also experience worse schools than Whites, but neither of those groups is losing ground. Because of these important weaknesses in the story, the evidence linking school quality differences to the poor trajectories of Blacks can be characterized as no more than suggestive. Does the importance of parental/environmental inputs grow as children age? Black children tend to grow up in environments less conducive to high educational attainment. If the importance of parental/environmental inputs grows as children age, Black students would be expected to lose ground relative to Whites. The evidence in Table 5, however, argues just the opposite. If that were true, than one would expect to observe the raw gaps widening between Blacks and Whites, but to the extent our control variables adequately capture a child's environment, the residual gap after including all the covariates would remain 21 constant. In fact, however, the residual gap increases more than the raw gap contradicting this explanation.' Also, the magnitude of the coefficients on socio-economic status, age at kindergarten entry, and mother's age at first birth are smaller in the first-grade test-score regressions. That suggests that the relative importance of non-school factors decreases over time, presumably because schools become a critical input into educational gains once children enter school.\" Do Black children suffer worse summer setbacks when school is not in session? Alexander (1992 and and Heyns (1978), have argued that Black students lose more ground over the summer than White students as a consequence of worse home and neighborhood environments, and they gain ground over the school year while in school. If this were the explanation for the falling performance of Blacks, then public policies should be aimed not at schools, but rather, summer interventions. Our data provides a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis because a subset of the sample is tested both in the spring of kindergarten and in the fall of first grade, shortly after students return to class, allowing us to isolate the relative summer setbacks for Blacks and Whites. The results are reported in Table 8. 24 Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, one might expect that the opposite hypothesis would hold true: the importance of parental inputs declines with age. Prior to reaching school age, the relative share of educational inputs provided by parents is very large. Once school starts, much of the burden for educating is shifted to the schools. Our empirical evidence does not, however, provide much support for this conjecture either. \" An alternative explanation for the shrinking coefficient on the SES variable is that socio-economic status varies over time. Therefore, using the kindergarten value of the SES variable in the first grade regression induces measurement error. That explanation cannot explain the declining coefficients on age at school entry and mother's age at birth. Moreover, for other variables that are time varying, like number of books and WIC participation, the coefficients do not shrink in the first-grade regression. For the subset of the sample that is tested in the fall of first grade (about one-fourth of the students), we report at each point in time both the raw test score gap and the residual gap controlling for our parsimonious set of covariates. For the regression results, only the coefficient reflecting the Black-White test score gap is shown in the table, and each entry in the table is from a separate regression. The test score gaps in the fall of kindergarten (column 1) and spring of first grade (column 4) for this subset of the sample are similar to those for the sample as a whole, suggesting that the sub-sample is representative. Of greater interest is a comparison of the test scores in the spring of kindergarten versus the fall of first grade, since most of the intervening time was spent outside of school. On the raw scores, there is little difference before and after the summer break; to the extent there is any gap, it favors Black students. With controls, Black students lose slightly relative to whites over the summer on math (the gap rises from -.097 to -.134), but the null hypothesis of no change cannot be rejected. The point estimates for reading show slight gains by Black students relative to Whites over the summer. Thus, the empirical results lend little support to the hypothesis that differential summer setbacks explain the lost ground of Black students in our sample. We do observe Blacks losing ground during the school year in both subjects in both years, in direct conflict with Entwisle and Alexander (1992)."}, {"section_title": "Are the results simply an artifact of standardized testing?", "text": "Given the potential difficulties of evaluating student achievement using standardized tests in children so young, one possibility is that our results are simply an artifact of standardized testing. To assess this hypothesis, we examined the relative performance of children of different races on subject teacher evaluations. The teacher assessments were normalized to be mean zero with a standard deviation equal to one. The regressions are identical to the specifications using test scores with one important difference. Because of concerns about heterogeneity across teachers in the way they may rate students on these subjective evaluations, we include teacherfixed effects in all of the regressions using these measures. Thus, the estimates are based on a student's evaluation relative to other students in the same classroom. The results for teacher assessments are presented in Table 9. The odd columns contain the raw gaps across races on the assessments; the even columns control for our parsimonious set of regressors. As before, the interpretation of the coefficients is standard deviation units. In kindergarten fall, Black students are judged by teachers to be .26 to .28 standard deviations behind Whites on both math and reading. These gaps are smaller than those observed on the standardized tests. Controlling for other characteristics, the Black-White gap shrinks to .103 standard deviations on math and .066 standard deviations on reading. Just as was the case with test scores, the gap between Whites and Blacks widens substantially by the end of first grade. Thus, the patterns in the test scores are replicated in teacher assessments. This is true not only for Blacks, but also for Hispanics and Asians. The most notable divergence in results between test scores and teacher assessments is that teachers initially rate Asians as performing no better than Whites, but increase their evaluation of Asians over time. In the test score data, the opposite pattern emerges."}, {"section_title": "Can teacher bias or differential socialization explain Black students losing ground?", "text": "If, as some have argued, White teachers have lower expectations for Black children or otherwise discriminate against them in the classroom (Baron, Tom, and Cooper 1985, Dusek, 1975, Ferguson 1998, and Lightfoot 1978, then one would predict that Black students with 24 White teachers should lose more ground than Black students with Black teachers. and slightly better on reading, relative to Black students who have two Black teachers. By the end of first grade, however, the Black-White test score gap is greater across the board for students who have at least one Black teacher (i.e., the coefficients in column 4 are always more negative than those in column 2). This finding is exactly the opposite of what one would predict from a discrimination story. Although not shown in tabular form, we have also explored whether differences in socialization and behavior might explain the results. The data set includes a number of variables that might be correlated with cultural differences in socialization. Parents and teachers were asked to rate the child on various social skills including: self control, approaches to learning, interpersonal skills, and exhibiting problem behaviors. The inclusion of these variables in our regressions, however, had virtually no impact on the measured Black-White test score gap or it's trajectory over time.\" Does the material tested change as children age in a manner that lowers the relative performance of Black students? In personal correspondence, ECLS reports that the fraction of the exam devoted to each set of skills remains constant as children age. In the fall of kindergarten, few children are expected to correctly answer questions involving multiplication and division, and by the spring of first grade, few children are expected to miss questions involving counting. Nonetheless, the same mix of questions is asked. Still, it is potentially interesting to compare the relative performance of Black and White children on the different types of questions over time. Table 11 reports the Black-White gap on questions assessing specific sets of skills at both the beginning and the end of the sample. The estimates in the table are based on specifications including our parsimonious set of regressors, and the magnitude of the estimates is once again interpretable as standard deviation units. In math, the lost ground on the part of Blacks is attributable almost solely to poor performance on addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Black students perform almost as well as Whites in the fall of kindergarten on these tasks, but lag Whites by over two-tenths of a standard deviation by the spring of first grade. To the extent that skill in manipulating numbers is likely to be a more important input into understanding higher-order math than are simple tasks such as counting or evaluating relative size, these results may foreshadow continued losses for Blacks relative to Whites in math as they age. Blacks lose roughly equal ground on all aspects of reading proficiency."}, {"section_title": "VII. Conclusion", "text": "Previous efforts to explain the Black-White test score gap have generally fallen short a substantial residual remained for Black students, even after controlling for a full set of available covariates. Using a new data set, we demonstrate that among entering kindergartners, the Black-White gap in test scores can be essentially eliminated by controlling for just a small number of observable characteristics of the children and their environment. Once students enter school, the gap between White and Black children grows, even conditional on observable factors. We test a number of possible explanations for why Blacks lose ground. The only hypothesis which receives any support is that Black students attend worse schools on average. Compared to previous studies, our results provide reason for optimism. Research on earlier cohorts of children found much greater Black-White test score gaps, both in the raw scores and controlling for observables. When we attempt to mimic the non-random sample frames in earlier research (for example only looking at low-birth weight babies as in IHDP), we continue to find much smaller gaps in our sample. One plausible explanation for the differences between the current sample and cohorts attending kindergarten 10-30 years ago is that the current cohort of Blacks has made real gains relative to Whites. Reconciling our results with past studies represents an important direction for future research.
