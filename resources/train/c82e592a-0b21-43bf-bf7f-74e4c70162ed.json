[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Circulating ceramide levels are abnormally elevated in age-dependent pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the potential impact of age on plasma ceramide levels has not yet been systematically examined. In the present study, we quantified a focused panel of plasma ceramides and dihydroceramides in a cohort of 164 subjects (84 women) 19 to 80 years of age. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable linear regression analysis revealed a positive association between age and ceramide (d18:1/24:0) (\u03b2 (SE) = 5.67 (2.38); p = .0198) and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) (\u03b2 (SE) = 2.88 (.61); p < .0001) in women, and between age and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) in men (\u03b2 (SE) = 1.86 (.77); p = .0179). In women of all ages, but not men, plasma ceramide (d18:1/24:1) was negatively correlated with plasma estradiol (r = -0.294; p = .007). Finally, in vitro experiments in human cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors showed that incubation with estradiol (10 nM, 24 h) significantly decreased ceramide accumulation. Together, the results suggest that aging is associated with an increase in circulating ceramide levels, which in post-menopausal women is at least partially associated with lower estradiol levels."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The ceramides are key lipid constituents of mammalian cells. They regulate the structural properties of the lipid bilayer [1] along with its interaction with cellular proteins [2] , and control many signalling processes, including cell survival [3] , growth and proliferation [4] , differentiation [5] , senescence [6] and apoptosis [7, 8] . Dysfunctions in ceramide-mediated signalling may contribute to the initiation and progression of a variety of age-dependent diseases. Human studies have shown the existence of abnormal plasma levels of various ceramide species -including ceramide (d18:1/18:0), (d18:1/22:0), (d18:1/24:0) and (d18:1/24:1) -in several conditions such as obesity [9] , type-2 diabetes [10], hypertension [11] , atherosclerosis [12] and other cardiovascular diseases [13] . Furthermore, elevated serum levels of long-chain ceramides have been linked to the increased risk of memory deficits [14] and may be predictive of hippocampal volume loss and cognitive decline in patients affected by mild cognitive impairment [15] . Other studies have reported the existence of sex-dependent differences in circulating ceramides, albeit with apparently contrasting results [16] [17] [18] . For example, in a study of a large cohort of Mexican-Americans of median age 35.7 years, plasma ceramides were found to be higher in men than in women [17] . By contrast, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, whose participants were aged 55 or older, plasma ceramide concentrations were shown to be higher in women than in men [18] . These discrepancies may reflect across-study differences in design and participation.\nAging in rats and mice is associated with sexually dimorphic changes in the sphingolipid composition of several brain structures, including the hippocampus [19] . Age-dependent sphingolipid alterations have also been documented in peripheral rodent tissues [20] . In the present study, we hypothesized that aging in humans might be similarly associated with changes in ceramide levels. To test this idea, we profiled six ceramides and dihydroceramide species in lipid extracts of plasma from 164 subjects (84 women) of age 19 to 80 years, using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Plasma ceramide levels in women are positively correlated with age", "text": "An initial analysis of the data revealed the existence of a statistically detectable interaction between sex and ceramide levels, which prompted us to focus our attention on age-dependent changes occurring in either sex.

Pearson's analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant positive correlation "}, {"section_title": "AGING", "text": "between ceramide levels and age (r = 0.378; p = .0004). Because the largest accrual in plasma ceramides occurred between the age of 40 and 50 years, which is coincident with menopause, in a secondary analysis we grouped the data according to the subjects' menopausal status. We found a statistically detectable difference between pre-menopausal women (20-54 years) and post-menopausal women (47-78 years) (Fig 1B) . In particular, the levels of long-chain ceramide (d18:1/18:0) (p = .0035, unpaired Student's t-test), very long-chain ceramides (d18:1/24:0) (p = .0012) and (d18:1/24:1) (p < .0001), and dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:1) (p = .0340) were higher in postmenopausal relative to pre-menopausal women ( Fig  1B) . No differences were found in the levels of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) (p = .3526) and dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:0) (p = .3633). In contrast with these findings in women, men showed no significant age-dependent increases in plasma ceramides (r = 0.143; p = .208) (Fig  2A) . Male subjects in the age groups 19-54 and 55-80 years displayed comparable levels of circulating ceramide (d18:1/18:0) (p = .7112), (d18:1/24:0) (p = .7895), (d18:1/24:1) (p = .0847) and dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:1) (p = .9014). However, dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:0) was significantly lower in men >55 years, compared to younger men (p = .0003) (Fig 2B) .\nIn an additional analysis, we compared total ceramide levels in plasma of pre-and post-menopausal women with those measured in men of the same age group (Fig  3) . The results show that pre-menopausal women had significantly lower levels of circulating ceramides (p < .05, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test) relative to men of similar age (Fig 3A) . The difference disappeared after menopause (p > .05) ( Fig  3A) .\n"}, {"section_title": "Variables associated with plasma ceramides", "text": "Next, we used multivariable linear regression models to test the association between age and ceramides and adjust for potential covariates for which data had been collected (Table 1) . These factors included hypertension (32/164 subjects, 16 women), tobacco smoking (23/164 subjects, 17 women), use of anti-hypercholesterol (12/164 subjects, 3 women) or contraceptive agents (6/164 subjects, 6 women), obesity (0/164 subjects) and diabetes (0/164 subjects). We did not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked as a variable of multivariable linear regression analysis. Plasma lipid levels were not collected for these samples. The adjusted linear regression analysis confirmed that ceramide (d18:1/24:0) (\u03b2 (SE) = 5.67 (2.38); p = .0198) and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) (\u03b2 (SE) = 2.88 (0.61); p < .0001) were positively associated with age in women and also, unexpectedly, revealed an opposite, albeit weaker, trend with ceramide (d18:1/16:0) (\u03b2 (SE) = -.08 (.04); p = .0285) (Table 2A) . Interestingly, the analysis also pointed to a significant association, found only in women, between hypertension and ceramide (d18:1/16:0) (\u03b2 (SE) = 4.78 (1.42); p = .0012) and (d18:1/18:0) (\u03b2 (SE) = 2.48 (.97); p = .0126) (Table (Table 2B) , the analysis unmasked a statistically detectable association between age and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) (\u03b2 (SE) = 1.86 (.77); p = .0179). Finally, we found no associations, in either sex, between ceramide levels and any other variable, including smoking, contraceptive use or anti-hypercholesterol agents, obesity and diabetes (Table 2A-B) .\nPlasma ceramide levels are negatively correlated with estradiol in women, but not in men Next, we investigated a possible association between plasma levels of estradiol, which are known to fall significantly at menopause, and ceramides. Estradiol was measured with a competitive binding immunoassay. As expected, plasma estradiol was higher in pre-menopausal women (<55 years) compared to men in the same age group (p < .001, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test) (Fig 3B) . After menopause, estradiol levels sharply decreased in both sexes (Fig 3B) . Fig 4 illustrates the results of Pearson's analyses of ceramide levels in female subjects of all ages. The results show a statistically significant negative correlation between estradiol and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) (r = -0.294; p = .007), a non-significant negative trend between estradiol and ceramide (d18:1/24:0) (r = -0.202; p = .066) and no correlations between estradiol and other ceramide species. By contrast, in men, no correlation was observed between estradiol and any ceramide species, including ceramide (d18:1/24:1) (r = -0.034; p = .763) (Fig 5) , which was found to be correlated with aging (\u03b2 (SE) = 1.86 (.77); p = .0179) (Table 2B) ."}, {"section_title": "Estradiol suppresses ceramide accumulation in vitro", "text": "Sphingolipid-derived mediators such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate regulate steroidogenesis [21] , but it is still unknown whether estrogen hormones influence sphingolipid metabolism. To gain insight into the causality of the negative correlation observed between estradiol and ceramide in women, we asked whether the sex hormone might regulate ceramide mobilization (i.e. formation and/or degradation) in human MCF7 breast cancer cells, a cell line that expresses the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) [22] . MCF7 cells were treated with estradiol (10 nM) for 24 h and ceramides quantified in lipid extracts by LC-MS/MS. Results indicate that the exposure to estradiol causes a substantial reduction in ceramide (d18:1/16:0) (p = .02, unpaired Student's t-test), (d18:1/24:0) (p = .0002) and (d18:1/24:1) (p = .0006) ( Table 3) , thereby suggesting that estradiol causes a downregulation in the biosynthesis or/and an upregulation in the degradation of these substances."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In the present study, we investigated the age-and sexdependent trajectories of plasma ceramides in 80 men and 84 women aged 19-80 years. The results show that, in women, plasma levels of two ceramide species -(d18:1/24:0) and (d18:1/24:1) -increased with age, and that this change cannot be ascribed to confounding AGING factors such as obesity, diabetes, and other health conditions. In men, the analysis revealed an association between age and ceramide (d18:1/24:1). Further analyses identified a significant negative correlation between circulating levels of estradiol and ceramide (d18:1/24:1) in women of all ages, but not in men. Finally, in vitro experiments showed that estradiol lowers ceramide levels in human cells expressing estradiol receptors. The findings suggest that aging is accompanied, in men and women, by an increase in the plasma concentrations of two ceramide species, (d18:1/24:0) and (d18:1/24:1), which are also known to be elevated in age-dependent pathologies such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [23, 24] . The results also point to the intriguing possibility that estradiol might control circulating ceramide levels in a sexually dimorphic manner.\nPrevious studies have reported sex-dependent differences in plasma ceramides, but with somewhat contrasting results, which might be due to disparities in sex, fasting, age and body mass index across the studies. In a small investigation of blood serum samples from 10 Caucasian volunteers (5 males aged 27-33 years and 5 females aged 26-33 years), ceramide (42:1) was found to be higher in women compared to men [16] . Another study, performed on a much larger cohort of young Mexican Americans (1,076 individuals, 39.1% males, median age 35.7 years) [17] , uncovered an association between plasma ceramides and sex after adjusting for These studies did not focus on age as a variable. By contrast, in the present work we set out to address the impact of aging on ceramide levels and excluded subjects with disease conditions that had been previously shown to affect ceramides, such as diabetes [25] , cancer [26] , renal disease [27] , cardiovascular disease [28] and obesity [29] . We did not exclude subjects with hypertension, however, because the association of this disease state with altered ceramides remains to be fully established [11, 18] . In our sample, we were able to confirm the presence of age-and sexdependent differences in the plasma concentrations of certain ceramide species, but not others. A multivariable analysis showed that, in women, aging is accompanied by increased levels of ceramide (d18:1/24:0) and (d18:1/24:1). In men, the analysis also unmasked a statistically detectable association between age and ceramide (d18:1/24:1). These age-dependent changes could not be ascribed to obesity, diabetes, tobacco cigarette smoking and use of anti-hypercholesterol or contraceptive agents. Interestingly, secondary data analyses found that ceramide levels were significantly lower in female than male subjects aged 20-54, a difference that disappeared after menopause. In their 2015 study, Mielke and collaborators did not specifically include menopause as a variable, but suggested that menopause and estradiol may influence ceramide levels [18] . [31] [32] [33] . In this context, it is important to point out that increased plasma ceramide levels have been consistently linked to heightened risk of myocardial infarction and stroke [34] . Moreover, recent evidence indicates that alterations of ceramide levels may mirror, indirectly, ongoing neurodegenerative processes and might be used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease development and progression [35] . Interestingly, the close association between alterations in ceramide levels and the likelihood of developing cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-related pathology may be particularly Cells were treated for 24 h with vehicle (0.1% DMSO in phenol-free DMEM) or 17-\u03b2-estradiol (10 nM) and ceramide levels were measured by LC-MS/MS.\nAGING strong in women, thereby indicating that sex-related mechanisms might participate in shaping the Alzheimer phenotype. Of note, elderly women show changes in plasma ceramide levels at the onset of their memory impairment [15] . In the past few years, the neurobiology of memory disorders has received increasing attention [36] . Memory deficits are often reported by women in temporal proximity of menopause [37] , and recent findings indicate distinct changes in memory processing that appear to be linked more to the post-menopausal status than to chronological aging: in peri-menopausal women, the onset and progression of cognitive decline are often associated with a menopause-related decrease in estradiol levels [38] . Thus, the interplay between estradiol and ceramides, described here, may potentially be of broad significance for a variety of age-dependent disorders, including cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment or any intersection of the two conditions [39] .\nThe present study has several limitations. First, even though we excluded persons affected by obesity and diabetes, we did not collect information on metabolic factors that could potentially impact ceramide mobilization -such as adiposity, physical activity and levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol and glucose in blood [18, [40] [41] [42] . Second, our study was focused on a specific subset of ceramides that we had previously found to be altered in the hippocampus of aged male and female mice [19] . This group of ceramides has been proposed as potential biomarker for cardiovascular risk [43] , but is still only a small fraction of the vast number of ceramides produced by the body. Third, we measured total circulating levels of ceramides and did not attempt to separate ceramide pools bound to specific plasma lipoproteins [44] . It is possible that aging might exert an effect similar to obesity and diabetes, which have been shown to change the distribution of ceramides among lipoproteins [41] .\nOur findings also raise a number of relevant questions, which should be addressed in future work. First, even though the results suggest that estradiol modulates ceramide mobilization in women, the precise mechanism and functional significance of this effect remain to be determined. One possibility is that activation of estrogen receptors results in the downregulation of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, for example by suppressing the expression of key enzymes such as serine-palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase [45] . Other possibilities are that estradiol might stimulate the expression of ceramide-hydrolyzing enzymes such as acid or neutral ceramidase or of ceramide-transporting proteins [30] . Probing the link between estradiol and ceramides will require additional experimentation, which may include measuring circulating ceramide levels in women throughout the menstrual cycle or assessing the impact of endogenous and exogenous estradiol on sphingolipid metabolism in female animals. At the functional level, studies are needed to correlate ceramide and estrogen levels to a broad panel of biomarkers (e.g., lipoprotein profile, Creactive protein) and clinical outcome measures (e.g., future adverse cardiovascular events and cognitive impairment) [43] . Without such information, the clinical significance of our findings remains speculative. Second, the lack of correlation between estradiol and ceramide (d18:1/18:0) and lack of association with age implies that this ceramide species, though elevated after menopause, may be subjected to a different regulation than ceramide (d18:1/24:1), whose levels are correlated with estradiol and are statistically associated with age. Third, we observed a substantial age-dependent decrease in plasma dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:0) in men aged 54-80 years. The significance of this finding is presently unclear, but warrants further attention. Fourth, we unexpectedly uncovered an association between hypertension in post-menopausal women and elevated levels of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) and (d18:1/18:0). While this result is consistent with previous reports [11] , caution is warranted until studies with a larger cohort of pre-and post-menopausal women are performed. Finally, as mentioned above, the relation between ceramide levels and premorbid changes in cardiovascular, metabolic or cognitive function was not investigated in our study and deserves further investigations. Despite these unanswered questions, our results reveal the existence of a link between age, estradiol and ceramides, which might contribute to age-dependent pathologies in postmenopausal women."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "Investigation has been conducted in accordance with the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of Helsinki and according to national and international guidelines and has been approved by the authors' institutional review board."}, {"section_title": "Study subjects", "text": "We recruited 164 Italian subjects (84 women) from 19 to 80 years of age (Table 1) .
