[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Global satellite observations show the sea surface temperature (SST) increasing since the 1970s in all ocean basins, while the net air-sea heat flux Q decreases. Over the period 1984-2006 the global changes are 0.288C in SST and 29.1 W m 22 in Q, giving an effective air-sea coupling coefficient of 232 W m 22 8C 21 . The global response in Q expected from SST alone is determined to be 212.9 W m 22 , and the global distribution of the associated coupling coefficient is shown. Typically, about one-half (6.8 W m 22 ) of this SST effect on heat flux is compensated by changes in the overlying near-surface atmosphere. Slab Ocean Models (SOMs) assume that ocean heating processes do not change from year to year so that a constant annual heat flux would maintain a linear trend in annual SST. However, the necessary 6.1 W m 22 increase is not found in the downwelling longwave and shortwave fluxes, which combined show a 23 W m 22 decrease. The SOM assumptions are revisited to determine the most likely source of the inconsistency with observations of (212.9 1 6.8 2 3) 5 29.1 W m\n. The indirect inference is that diminished ocean cooling due to vertical ocean processes played an important role in sustaining the observed positive trend in global SST from 1984 through 2006, despite the decrease in global surface heat flux. A similar situation is found in the individual basins, though magnitudes differ. A conclusion is that natural variability, rather than long-term climate change, dominates the SST and heat flux changes over this 23-yr period. On shorter time scales the relationship between SST and heat flux exhibits a variety of behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides periodic assessments of the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as possible response strategies. The fourth and most recent Assessment Report (AR4), entitled Climate Change 2007, consists of contributions from three working groups plus a very useful synthesis (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007) . Perhaps the foremost conclusion of AR4 is that the warming of the earth's climate system is unequivocal. It is based largely on the report of Working Group I (Solomon et al. 2007) , whose chapters document global average warming of both the land and sea surfaces (Le Treut et al. 2007 ), of air temperature (Trenberth et al. 2007 ), and of upper-ocean temperatures (Bindoff et al. 2007) , as well as a widespread reduction in snow and ice cover and rising global average sea level (Lemke et al. 2007 ).\nAccording to Trenberth et al. (2009) , there is a near balance at the top of the atmosphere between the incoming solar radiation ('341 W m 22 ), the reflected solar ('2102 W m 22 ) , and the terrestrial radiation to space at longer wavelengths ('2239 W m 22 ). The latter is reduced by the presence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, so to maintain this radiative balance the earth's climate is warmer than it otherwise would be. Another major AR4 conclusion is that most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic increases in GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane as well as any additional water vapor held in the warmer atmosphere (Hegerl et al. 2007 ). The estimated combined GHG forcing is only about 2 W m 22 , at least some of which should be offset by increasing aerosols (Lemke et al. 2007 ) (Le Treut et al. 2007 ).\nIn the warmer climate, the average surface warming is not uniform and is nearly 50% greater over land than over the ocean (Le Treut et al. 2007) . A robust finding of AR4 is that this warming pattern is seen in all future warming scenarios (Meehl et al. 2007) . Therefore, there is a need to understand the smaller ocean surface warming and its relation to ocean heat uptake because the less taken up by the ocean, the greater the possible effects on terrestrial climate. However, a key uncertainty is that climate data coverage remains limited in some regions, including remote ocean areas (Bindoff et al. 2007) . Although the recent advent of Argo floats (Roemmich et al. 2004 ) has greatly improved the observational network, significant improvement in this situation will take many years because of the multidecadal time scales of climate change and large natural variability. However, improved reexaminations of existing observations could have immediate beneficial consequences.\nFor example, the AR4 states that the oceans are warming with the global average temperature above 700-m depth having risen by 0.108C between 1961 and 2003 (Bindoff et al. 2007 ). The basic foundation for such estimates of ocean heat content change is the World Ocean Database (Conkright et al. 2002) . But, Harrison and Carson (2007) compare warming trends from three analyses of these data and find warming to increase with the degree of interpolation in the analysis. With the least interpolated data, they find that most of the ocean does not have significant 50-yr trends at the 90% confidence level. With first interpolation to standard depths, then horizontal objective analysis, the trend estimates of Levitus et al. (2005) become larger, with striking differences appearing even in regions of their statistically significant trends. Harrison and Carson (2007) suggest that interpolation over the very data sparse areas of the World Ocean may have substantial effects on results. Some other issues with the World Ocean Database are biases in the ocean measurements, the paucity of deep observations and aliasing of signals from mesoscale eddies, the internal tide, and inertial motions.\nThe purpose of the present work is to bring estimates of global air-sea fluxes (Large and Yeager 2009 ) to bear on the processes behind the recent increases in sea surface temperature (SST) and to test the underlying assumptions of a Slab Ocean Model (SOM). These fluxes were computed from the forcing developed for the Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiments (COREs) (Griffies et al. 2009 ) through a novel analysis and merging of existing data. They include both heat and freshwater fluxes from 1984 through 2006, and the time series of global and ocean basin averages are shown in Large and Yeager (2009) . Over these years the climatological global heat flux is about 2 W m"}, {"section_title": "22", "text": ", with an uncertainty of about the same magnitude as the 2 W m 22 GHG forcing, but only on the global scale. This uncertainty grows to tens of watts per square meter on smaller regional scales (Large and Yeager 2009) . Therefore, the focus will be on global and basin scales. Furthermore, it will be on changes in annual flux anomalies, both to filter large seasonal signals and to mitigate systematic errors. By only considering changes, the results do not depend on whether there is overall heating or cooling of the global ocean. Implications for upper-ocean temperature change and heat uptake are outlined in section 2, with the role of ocean processes outlined in section 2b. The heat flux and companion SST datasets are presented in section 3. Least squares linear regressions of annual anomaly time series are used in section 4 to estimate the 23-yr (1984-2006) changes in fluxes and in SST that need to be reconciled with SOM assumptions and radiative forcing. Again, it is argued that large basin and global scales are more tractable than smaller regions. Variability relationships on shorter time scales and over the longer 1949-2006 period are also discussed. Finally, section 5 contains a discussion and conclusions.\n. The anticipated compensation by Q air is now quantified in Table 2 ). This latter signal is due to a small decrease in Q A over these 23 years, which is counter to the increase expected over longer time scales in response to increases in atmospheric GHG composition. Therefore, the ISSCP-FD time series suggest that this 23-yr period is too short to be representative of long-term climate change in response to O(1 W m 22 ) anthropogenic GHG forcing plus counteracting aerosol effects.\nA strong conclusion is that from 1984 through 2006 the upper ocean did not behave as a slab ocean model because increasing SST and decreasing heat flux are inconsistent with SOM behavior. If Q sky truly decreased, or even increased by less than Q pbl decreased, then (13) says that ocean processes must have been active in the SST increase. The most likely way for this to happen is if the warming strengthened the upper-ocean stratification so that cooling by vertical ocean processes became less, perhaps with some shoaling of the mixing depth. Indeed, heat flux anomalies would be expected to warm SST faster than subsurface temperatures, increasing the stratification and inhibiting entrainment mixing of cold water to the surface. Although consistent, there are also other factors at work, such as the wind and freshwater forcing, including sea ice melt, not considered here. The inference for a dominant role for vertical ocean processes is indirect because their time evolution is not known. However, it is supported by the data, by their dominant role in ENSO variability, and by arguments that lateral processes must be small globally and seem to be so on basin scales too, and that changes in mixing depth would need to be too large to play an important role on their own.\nClearly A curious observation is the tendency for the radiative flux Q sky particularly the longwave component, to counter SST increases. This effect is quantified by C* sky , 0, globally and in most basins. If this negative feedback is more generally true, then an interesting speculation is that it may be more difficult for nature to warm SST than believed on the basis of Q sst and Q pbl only.\nThe nonsolar feedback of C* pbl 1 C* A 5 233 W m 22 8C 21 is more than twice as strong as the 214.6 W m 22 8C 21 estimated by Doney et al. (1998) from an early coupled climate model. Just C* pbl alone is about 50% stronger, suggesting that some climate models may have a weaker negative heat flux feedback to SST changes than estimated here for the 1984-2006 period. In particular, during late-twentieth-century warming in the latest Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), Q pbl provides little or no negative feedback (Bates et al. 2012) , in contrast to the large negative values of C* pbl in Table 2 . The suggestion, following from the discussion of warming in section 4c, is that there may be more surface warming due to increasing Q air in these models than found in observations of the 1984-2006 period."}, {"section_title": "Air-sea interaction and coupling", "text": "The ocean and atmosphere directly interact physically through the fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The latter two fluxes are directly connected through the latent heat flux associated with evaporation. At high latitudes the presence of sea ice often leaves only a fraction of the ocean surface exposed directly to the atmosphere above. Over the remainder the air-sea interaction is indirect through the sea ice. The ocean-ice heat flux is difficult to estimate and small because sea ice is a very effective insulator. Therefore, it is not consider further."}, {"section_title": "a. Air-sea heat flux", "text": "Calculations of the air-sea heat flux into the ocean Q are detailed in Large and Yeager (2009) . For present purposes it is instructive to decompose this flux according to direct sources of interannual and decadal variability. The ocean surface albedo is constant on these time scales, so the net solar flux Q S as well as the downwelling longwave radiation Q A vary with the properties of the overlying sky, such as clouds. Their sum is given by\nThe remainder of Q is determined by properties in the atmosphere and ocean planetary boundary layers and is denoted as Q pbl :\nSpecifically, Q pbl is the sum of the turbulent fluxes of latent heat Q E and sensible heat Q H plus the blackbody longwave radiation from the ocean surface Q B . The latter is given by\nwhere s 5 5.67 3 10 28 W m 22 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the surface emissivity is taken to be 1.0 to account for the small fraction of Q A that is reflected (Lind and Katsaros 1986) . The bulk formulae parameterize the turbulent fluxes in terms of the near-surface atmospheric state (wind U, potential temperature u, specific humidity q, and density r) and the ocean state (SST and ocean surface current U o ):\nand\nwhere\n21 is the specific heat of air, L y ' 2.5 3 10 6 J kg 21 is the latent heat of vaporization, and C E and C H are the empirical bulk transfer coefficients. The air at the ocean surface is assumed to be saturated with its specific humidity approximated by the function shown in \nwhere the factor 0.98 applies only over seawater. In nature any change in SST is expected to affect both q and u and vice versa. To examine the fluxes associated with these related changes, it is useful to partition Q pbl into a term, Q sst , that varies with SST plus a second, Q air , that varies with air temperature and humidity:\nwith\nand\nThese two terms depend on the relative wind speed jDUj and only changes or differences are physically meaningful. In addition, Q sst dampens changes in SST by exchanging heat with the atmosphere. Similarly, Q air dampens changes in air temperature by exchanging heat with the ocean. An air-sea heat flux coupling coefficient C as can be defined as the change in Q divided by the associated change in SST. The only component that can be explicitly defined is\nThis coefficient is negative definite because an increase in SST tends to reduce the heat flux into the ocean from all three terms. The negative feedback of the first term comes from Q B and is shown in Fig. 1b \nThe Q B feedback becomes less than the sensible feedback for wind speeds greater than about 4 m s 21 . The latent heat term (11) is a strong function of SST and is more than double the sensible feedback (12) for SST greater than about 108C. It becomes the dominant feedback at high winds and higher SST.\nA given change DSST over a time interval can be accompanied by changes in the atmospheric state and, in particular, the boundary layer wind, temperature, and humidity, as well as the cloud field. Therefore, the total change in Q is not given by (10), but rather by an effective coefficient C* as 5 DQ/DSST. This coefficient can be empirically determined, as can other effective coefficients, such as C* sst 5 DQ sst /DSST, and similarly defined C * air , C* pbl , C* sky , and C* A . The values of these effective coefficients empirically include wind speed effects and other correlations. They are expected to vary regionally and with time interval."}, {"section_title": "b. Sea surface temperature evolution", "text": "A prognostic equation for the time evolution of SST, and hence of annual anomalies, was formulated by Stevenson and Niiler (1983) as\nwhere h is an effective mixing depth and the product of ocean density times heat capacity is (rC p ) w 5 4.1 MJ m 23 K 21 . In (13) lateral and vertical ocean processes are represented by R H (e.g., lateral advection over the depth h at all scales) and by R V (vertical diffusion plus entrainment at h). The heating due to the latter is inversely proportional to h, while the entrainment itself is proportional to an entrainment velocity at h: w e (2h) 5 w(2h) 1 D t h, where D t represents the total derivative and w(2h) is the vertical velocity at depth h. According to (13) a constant positive (negative) righthand side would maintain a linear trend of increasing (decreasing) SST.\nA slab ocean model simply solves (13) with interannually invariant specified spatial distributions of depth h and of the net heating due to all ocean processes. Under these conditions the addition of an anomalous annual heat flux DQ to the balancing heat flux over a time interval Dt of 1 yr would produce an annual temperature change given by\nwhere an effective annual mixing depth could be diagnosed from (14) but cannot, in general, be computed from the specified SOM annual cycle of h. In a SOM, therefore, a constant positive (negative) heat flux anomaly would produce an increasing (decreasing) linear trend in SST anomaly. Here anomaly means the difference from what is required to balance ocean heating processes. The importance of determining how trends in SST are maintained in nature is magnified by the practice of using SOMs to determine climate sensitivity of atmospheric models. This parameter is perhaps the most important characteristic of climate models. It is defined as the equilibrium increase in global surface temperature to a doubling of carbon dioxide in an atmospheric model coupled to a SOM. As intended, this climate sensitivity depends primarily on the atmospheric model, and neither on the use of a SOM nor on the specified mixing depth h (Danabasoglu and Gent 2009) . Instead, h and other ocean model physics determine the time required to reach equilibrium.\nAccording to (8), with all other fluxes and flux parameters being constant, a linear trend in SST would lead to slightly more than a linear decrease in Q sst and, hence, Q because of the nonlinearity of Fig. 1a . The flux change would be given by\nThus, there is a conflict because with C* sst , 0 an increasing trend in SST could not be sustained. On climate time scales, a common argument is that increasing radiative fluxes are sufficient to make C* as $0. However, there are other possibilities. In general h is time varying, especially over the season cycle when it can deepen from O(10 m) in summer to hundreds of meters in winter. It is also highly variable spatially. Therefore, as is evident from (14), annual average SST and its spatial averages can change without a corresponding change in surface heat flux. In the limit DQ 5 0, we have C* as 5 0. Such an example would arise if there was anomalous summer heating in summer when h is shallow, combined with compensating winter cooling when h is deeper. Similarly, a regional average SST would change if heat flux changes differed between shallow and deep mixing regions even if there were no change in the average Q.\nTherefore, an indicator of such rectification would be a much less negative effective coefficient (e.g., C* as ) based on spatial averages (e.g., DQ and DSST) compared to the spatially averaged coefficient (e.g., C as )."}, {"section_title": "The SST and heat flux datasets", "text": "The Hadley-optimum interpolation (OI) product (Hurrell et al. 2008) provides monthly SST over all of the world's oceans and has been made compatible with historical sea ice distributions. These data are a merger of the monthly Met Office Hadley Centre Sea Ice and SST dataset, version 1 (HadISST1) and the NOAA weekly optimum interpolation analysis, version 2 (OIv2) (Reynolds et al. 2002) . HadISST1 is described and evaluated by Rayner et al. (2003) . It includes historical SSTs reconstructed from ship observations beginning in 1871 (Folland et al. 2001) . There is evidence (Hurrell and Trenberth 1999) that, for present purposes, the random and sampling error in the SST should be sufficiently reduced in the annual means, that themselves are typically further averaged over large ocean regions using area weighting. Persistent systematic errors are eliminated by analyzing only time changes. There is no evidence of potentially problematic interannually varying large-scale error.\nThe air-sea heat fluxes are from version 2 of the CORE fluxes (COREv2) described in Large and Yeager (2009) . They were computed according to the formulas of section 2a and purposefully exclude all numerical weather prediction, including reanalysis, products that directly involve clouds, such as radiation and precipitation. This CORE judgment is supported by more recent examinations, Bosilovich et al. (2011) , for example, of the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). Therefore, the radiative components of Q sky are available only after June 1983 when the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project flux data (ISCCP-FD) begin. The solar radiation is uniformly reduced by 5% between 508S and 308N. For smoothness the reduction is linearly diminished to become zero poleward of 608S and 408N. The magnitude of the reduction is based on comparisons with measurements from the Tropical Ocean-Atmosphere (TAO) and Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) surface mooring arrays (Large and Yeager 2009 ). The geographic extent is suggested by comparisons with zonal means from other over-ocean products shown in B\u00e9 ranger et al. (2000) and in Taylor (2000) . Some degree of reduction is consistent with comparisons with the Baseline Surface Radiation Network in Zhang et al. (2004) .\nThe Q pbl averages are computed onward from 1949 using the atmospheric state from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis, but only after making a number of critical adjustments to flux parameters based on a variety of more reliable satellite and in situ measurements. These adjustments and the radiation reduction are time invariant, so have negligible effects on the present analyses of time changes. Although Large and Yeager note that there is little justification for invariance, they also show how unknown time-dependent errors may compensate one another.\nThe overall effects of the adjustments are faster wind speeds, drier humidities, and reduced radiation. As a result the climatological global-mean airsea heat flux becomes 2, down from 30 W m 22 . This lower value plus an expected small ocean heat loss through sea ice is in agreement with the observation of small ocean heat content changes (Harrison and Carson 2007) (Levitus et al. 2000 (Levitus et al. , 2005 . However, in regional comparisons Large and Yeager (2009) are sufficient to produce so negative a coupling when the SST is greater than about 268C. Elsewhere, the interplay between wind and SST determines the distribution of Fig. 2 (14) as the ratio of global averages. This difference indicates that little or no warming is due to the rectification effects discussed at the end of section 2."}, {"section_title": "Trends and changes (1984-2006)", "text": "Annual anomalies of both SST and heat flux have been constructed relative to the means over the 23 years from 1984 to 2006. This period is chosen as a standard baseline because it has a complete set of flux estimates. Throughout these years, satellite measurements are available for input into constructing the SST fields, so the earlier presatellite era problems of consistency and sampling over remote ocean regions are greatly ameliorated. Nevertheless, time series of SST and heat flux anomalies were computed back to 1949 because they suggest a different behavior up to the 1970s.\nLinear regressions of annual anomalies over the 1984-2006 period are used to compute trends, which are expressed as the 23-yr changes D 23 from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2006. To partition Q pbl anomalies according to (7), annual SST anomalies at all points are used to estimate\nSpatial averages of these estimates reflect the spatial correlation of SST anomalies and the nonlinearities of Fig. 1 that are implicit in the global distribution of C sst (Fig. 2) . Although, Q sst could be computed from (8), these estimates are sufficient for present purposes because changes in Q pbl , not its partition, are central.\nThe spatial distributions of 23-yr changes in SST, Q, Q sky , and Q pbl are shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. 3b) because they are largely compensated by changes in\nThe SST changes of Fig. 3a are not uniform. Only small regions (e.g., off Baja California) show D 23 SST , 20.58C. But there is large-scale warming of the North Atlantic south of the ice zone and including the Mediterranean Sea, in the western Pacific of both hemispheres, and in the Indian Ocean. Over most of these regions there is a general reduction in Q pbl , as expected from C sst , 0, and this signal is identifiable in D 23 Q (Fig. 3b) because the Q sky signals (Fig. 3d) the subpolar North Atlantic occurred in just 2 years following the winter of 1995. Robson et al. (2012) argue that the rapid heating was caused by a surge in northward ocean heat transport in response to the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index of 1995/96 following a prolonged positive phase. The hindcast study of Yeager et al. (2012) finds rapid warming at this time when a reduced surface cooling no longer balances an already strong heat transport. This latter picture is consistent with the increase in Q in this region of Fig. 3b , which is due to changes in both Q sky and Q pbl , possibly because of less cloud and weaker winds, respectively, associated with the positive to negative shift in the NAO index. Both studies suggest an important role for ocean heat transport, R H in (13), at least in the subpolar North Atlantic. Hereafter, such lateral advection signals are minimized by averaging over entire ocean basins or the global ocean. Table 1 . They range from only 0.088C in the Southern Ocean to 0.488C in the Atlantic Ocean. As previously noted, the latter is dominated by the North Atlantic SST response (Fig. 3a) to the NAO shift. Significant contributions to the global change of 0.288C also come from the western Pacific and Indian Oceans.\nOver the full 58 years of Fig. 4 the largest SST increase of ;0.78C is seen in the Indian Ocean basin because of significant warming prior to the mid-1970s. There is similar, though weaker, behavior in the Southern Ocean where the SST increase over the entire record is more than twice its D 23 SST.\nThis SST analysis is not aimed at ENSO variability, which is highly damped by basin and global averaging and is typically spread over two annual anomalies. Nonetheless, major ENSO events do appear in Fig. 4 , particularly in the Pacific. For example, the highest Pacific anomalies appear in 1997/98. In 1998 this signal is reinforced from the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins to give the largest global anomaly. These warm years are largely offset by the colder years of 1999/2000, so the 23-yr trends are not adversely affected. However, this compensation would not be true even globally of shorter trends-over 1985-98, for example."}, {"section_title": "b. Basin and global changes in heat fluxes", "text": "The datasets do allow Q sst , Q air , and Q pbl heat fluxes to be computed from 1949 through 2006 over the ice free ocean. Figure 5 shows the annual values globally and for the individual basins, except for the Arctic where sea ice coverage can dominate interannual variability (Fig. 3) . The Q sst anomaly time series reflect SST anomalies of Fig. 4 according to (15), depending on the spatial correlation between local SST and heat flux changes that are implied by the coupling coefficient distribution of Fig. 2 . The ratios of this global and the four basin values of C* pbl to the corresponding C* sst are 0.48, 0.57, 0.33, 0.45 and 0.42, respectively. Therefore, about half the decrease in Q sst is compensated by an increase in Q air . Now, consider the full 57 yr of Fig. 5 . The compensation of Q sst by Q air can be seen on the longest time scales in all basins. However, on decadal time scales the negative correlation sometimes breaks down. In the Indian Ocean (Fig. 5d) , the two cycles of large 5 W m 22 amplitude decadal variability in Q sst (dotted trace) through the 1950s and 1960s is not seen in Q air and the 2000s show an increase in Q air but a more steady Q sst . In the Atlantic (Fig. 5b) , there is a positive correlation between Q sst and Q air (dashed trace) from about 1954 through 1961, and the two quantities are not closely coupled from 1984 to 1998.\nIn Fig. 6 annual anomalies of Q, Q pbl , and Q sky are shown for all 23 years when the latter is available from ISCCP-FD. On shorter time scales within this period, the relationships between SST and the various terms of the surface heat flux fundamentally differ from one period to another as well as from basin to basin. To illustrate, consider the decade centered about January 1991. SST departures from the linear trends in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Fig. 4) can be generally described as positive over the first half decade and negative over the second half decade. Accordingly, the Q sst departures in Fig. 5 are of opposite sign. In the Atlantic Q air is nearly a constant 23 W m 22 over the 10 yr, so Q pbl follows Q sst with a negative displacement. But Q sky departures (Fig. 6b ) are in phase with the SST and of similar amplitude, so that there is very little signal in Q departures from its trend. In contrast, Fig. 5d shows Q air in the Indian Ocean basin following the sign of SST and over most of the second 5 yr (1991-95), nearly completely compensating Q sst , so that there is little signal in Q pbl other than a small negative departure in 1992. Therefore, Q over this half decade is correlated with Q sky departures, which are negative in 1991 and 1992 and near zero afterward. There is a different interplay between Indian Ocean terms over the first 5 years (1986-90) of the decade. There is less compensation from Q air , so Q pbl departures are generally negative, but these are overmatched by large positive departures of Q sky that make Q significantly above its linear trend from 1987 through 1989. "}, {"section_title": "c. Longwave radiation", "text": "Because water vapor is a very strong GHG, a simplistic view of a warming world is that the greater water vapor holding capacity of the atmosphere would amplify warming aloft. The resulting increase in Q A is one mechanism for surface warming of the ocean. Another is an increase in Q air [(9) ] by entrainment of warmer air into the atmospheric boundary layer, which could then hold even more water vapor and absorb more longwave radiation. In either case, increases in water vapor and other GHGs would need to be sufficient to overcome any decrease in Q pbl in response to warmer SST. In computing Q A , the ISCCP-FD radiative transfer calculations do use a spatially and temporally varying water vapor. Moreover, the vertical distribution of water vapor-and hence the temperature of the water vapor and the subsequent effects on the emission, absorption, and transfer of longwave radiation are accounted for. Perhaps because of these radiative effects, the Fig. 6 time series and Table 2 changes do suggest a more complicated behavior over the 1984-2006 period. On time scales of a few years or less, Q A contributions cause global Q sky (Fig. 6a) to be very highly correlated with the column-integrated water vapor (CIWV) above the ocean estimated from satellite measurements. For example, the 1997-98 signal of 1.2 mm in CIWV shown in Fig. 10 of Trenberth et al. (2005) corresponds to the 3 W m 22 variation in Q sky of Fig. 6a (dotted) . However, on longer time scales other factors appear to be at work, such as the temperature of the water vapor, because the Trenberth et al. 198822003 trend in CIWV of 4.1 mm decade 21 corresponds, not to an increase but to a decrease of about 2 W m 22 in Q sky . This change is largely due to Q A , which is nearly balanced by an increase in flux reaching the land surface (Bates et al. 2012 ). Thus, ISSCP-FD longwave is consistent with the synthesis land plus ocean surface values of Stephens et al. (2012) both in the mean and in the insignificant change from the ERBE years to the CERES (2000-04) .\nA time-dependent error in Q A would need to be more than 9 W m 22 greater in the early 1980s than in the mid2000s so as to be consistent with the simplistic view of warming by Q A . Cloud errors are always a concern but are of opposite sign in Q A than in Q S , so there tends to be compensation in Q sky ."}, {"section_title": "d. The SOM assumptions", "text": "According to (14) the observed linear trends in annual SST from 1984 through 2006 could be sustained by a constant positive heat flux, Q. However, Fig. 6 shows that annual Q anomalies are not constant but are themselves decreasing. Although the sign of Q may be uncertain, the decrease in anomalies is robust and quantified in Table 2 by the negative D 23 Q in all basins, and hence globally. Specifically, the CORE fluxes in Thus, the data we do have indicate that, as SST increased after 1984, Q sky did not increase. This result and the then inevitable decrease in Q imply that the slab ocean model assumptions leading to (14) are incorrect. However, the assumption of no heating due in lateral ocean processes, R H 5 0 in (13), is likely valid on basin and global scales. Globally, the heat flux through continental boundaries is essentially zero. On basin scales the assumption is supported by the similarity between the global and basin behavior, despite large difference in magnitude, whereas R H heating of one basin would mean cooling of another.\nA difficult SOM assumption to justify is for h in (13) to remain interannually invariant when both diurnal and Therefore, so as to produce the observed SST warming and decrease in heat flux, in the absence of other ocean processes, the rate of shoaling would need to have been 230 m yr 21 . But, there is no evidence of h changing to within even two orders of magnitude of this rate over the 23 years from 1984 to 2006. Instead, from (13) the most likely explanation is that the cooling expected due to vertical ocean processes R V /h diminished from 1984 to 2006. Unfortunately, the evolution of this term is not observable on basin and global scales, but as a testament to its potential power we note that it is the primary driver of ENSO variability in the equatorial Pacific."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusions", "text": "Global datasets (Hurrell et al. 2008) show a rise in SST in all ocean basins from the 1970s onward-in particular, in the North Atlantic, western Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The latter has the largest basin-scale warming and is evident from the 1950s. The SST increase has been much smaller in the Southern Ocean where the effects of sea ice changes are of both signs and largely cancel. Although the basin-scale changes are small (,18C), satellite observations since the late 1970s have greatly ameliorated consistency and sampling problems so that signals since then are generally believed to be real (Le Treut et al. 2007 ).\nThe net heat flux into the ocean between 1984 and 2006 is highly uncertain and cannot be said to differ from zero by more than its uncertainty plus the cooling through sea ice. This viewpoint is consistent with estimates of little, if any, ocean heat content changes (Harrison and Carson 2007) . On basin scales the distribution of mean heat flux is consistent with observationally based estimates of ocean heat transport (Large and Yeager 2009 ), but the transport uncertainties are large too. Therefore, it must reemphasized that the present results say nothing about the absolute magnitude of the heat flux into the ocean. Instead, they depend only on changes in annual anomalies. The time invariant adjustments of section 2 have negligible impact on these changes. For example, the solar radiation reduction alters the Table 2 globally and by at most 0.15 W m 22 on basin scales. Although unknown time-dependent errors could affect these changes, there is nothing known to suggest anything significant, and the data used here represent the current state of knowledge. The downwelling longwave flux is the most suspect, so it was examined in section 4c and found to be consistent with Stephens et al. (2008) .\nThe global increase in SST from 1984 through 2006 on its own would be expected to reduce the heat flux into the global ocean by about D 23 Q sst 5 213 W m"}]
