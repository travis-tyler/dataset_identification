Enrollment growth has been reduced and could actually become negative as a result of demographic factors that have already affected elementary and secondary school populations. The resulting lowered demand for faculty, coupled with the reduced number of new tenured positions. is creating in some fields a staffing problem that is likely to be aggravated during the next decade. Other fields, espeoially engineering and computer sciences, have problems in attracting faculty. Expansion of graduate programs has already begun to taper off, but there have been increases in port-time study. changes in the age-mix of students, and increased interest in continuing education in nontraditional modes. Inflation,, as well as the changes in enrollment, have placed increased burdens on university budgets. All of these trends are likely to continue, at least into the near future, and will affect most aspects of academic endeavor, including those dealing with science and technology. Trade-offs between research, instruction, and public service will have to be considered more carefully by most institutions. The difficult decisions that 1,1, ill have to be made can be put on a firmer basis if sufficient background information is available. This report is designed to provide such information. This publication is the first :n a series of consolidated biennial analyses of academic R&D expenditures, the utilization of scientists and engineers, and he characteristics of the graduate science student population. Data from three NSF academic surveys provide the basis for most of this study. In prior years, information from each of these surveys was analyzed and published separately. The new publication integrates results from all three and analyzes trends in more detail. Suggestions and comments on this new publication are most welcome. lune Charles E.

One-half of the $7 billion devoted to basic research was performed in academia. Between fiscal years 1972 and 1977, growth in academic R&D performance averaged 9 percent annually in current dollars. most of which occurred after fiscal year 1974. However, inflation reduced this growth to an average of I percent per year in real terms over the five years reported in this publication and at 2 percent per year beginning in fiscal year 1975. A rise in academic employment of scientists and engineers accompanied this growth in R&D expenditures, increasing at a yearly rate of 3 percent. During 1972-77 the life sciences dominated academic S/E resource increases. R&D expenditures in the life sciences accounted for 65 percent of the fiscal years 1972-77 net growth. academic s/e personnel Doctorate-granting institutions increased their employment of scientists and engineers by 3 percent per year between January 1973 and January 1978, An even higher rate of grow th occurred in master's-granting institutions, up an average of over 6 percent per year *Nearly 17.000 more part-timers employed in 1978 in universities and colleges than in 1973, an increase of 35 percent: an even higher number of fulltimers-was added. 24,700. but their growth rate was considerably slower, up 11 percent in five years. The surge in part-time employment suggests an increasing institutional dependence on short-term and relatively transient appointments and a slowing down in the hiring of full-time staff, particularly by 2-year institutions. On a full-time-equivalent (FTE) basis, the number of scientists and engineers employed in R&D activities increased 22 percent in five years: those in teaching rose by 14 percent. The rise in R&D involvement was consistent with the concurrent increase in R&D expenditures and utilization of postdoctore tes and graduate research assistants. 13-1 and chart 1). To view the volume of university R&D performance in terms of the total U.S. level, however, tends to obscure the academic sector's sub. stantial contribution to basic research. To gain a better perspective. one should focus on the dollars spent in academia for basic research performance alone. Just over one-half of the estimated U.S. total of $7 billion committed to basic research in 1979 was performed in the academic sector (appendix table 13-2 and chart 2). When the amount devoted to basic research conducted in federally funded research and development centers (FFRDC's) associated with universities is added to this total, the proportion becomes even higherthree- fifths of the national basic research total. The universities' R&D totals discussed here are actually understated; they represent separately budgeted research activity only The amount of departmental research performed in university facilities cannot be reported by institutions through current accounting procedures since it cannot be separated reliably from the resources devoted to instruction."}, {"section_title": "Universities4", "text": ". detailed characteristics, 1972-77 In the 5-year period, 1972-77, examined in detail in this report. current-dollar volume of university basic research expenditures rose by 38 percent, but this apparent growth was not sufficient to overcome the effects of inflation, and, in fact, a 3-percent erosion in the realdollar level actually occurred.' This downturn in academic basic research performance over the entire five years took place at the same time that applied research activities in university laboratories were growing in real dollars.' However, the relative level of applied research funding is still small (appendix table B-3 and chart 3). The surge in university expenditures for applied research raised the total from $544 million in 1972 to 51,067 million in 1977. nearly doubling in current dollars and up 38 percent in constant dollars. Although the real rate of growth averaged 6.6 percent per year during 1972-77, the total academic expenditures devoted to applied research amounted to only one-tenth of the national applied research total by 1977.'

In addition to this amount, purchases for research instrumentation and smaller items of scientific equipment are often made out of current R&D accounts related to specific projects rather than from capital funds.

A recent study of the overall academic labor market revealed that the supply of part-timers is probably larger than that of full-timers, both because academic employers can draw on persons with full-time jobs to teach an occasional evening or off-hours course, and because part-timers can be hired with a lesser degree or with less experience than full-timers. . the change in level of academic employment of staff holding teaching and research appointments. To measure the amount of effort devoted to these activities the NSF personnel survey has used both a \"primarily employed\" and a \"full-time-equivalent\" (FTE) concept during the period studied. The former method requires institutional respondents to classify their professional staff according to how they spent the major portion of their time, i.e., whether in teaching. research and development, or any other S/E activity. The alternate method using FTE scientists and engineers converts the headcount data into the approximate time or effort spent in each of the three functions. On a \"primarily employed\" basis, both teaching and research staff increased at about universities has been shown to affect the type of appointments being made.

NSF staff visited 14 public and 9 private doctorate-granting universities to examine the nature of this employment expansion.'7 Among its other findings, the study determined that groWth in sponsored research funding is beginning to influence academic recruitment practices. A shift was noted to an increasing use of doctoral research staff and .short-term appointees that were hired for specific research projects. especially in major research universities. The ability of these scientists and engineers to obtain outside support was found to be the major determinant in the hiring of such researchers. Another study conducted by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1978 determined the characteristics of nonfaculty doctoral staff, and it concluded that this group, while an important segment of the academic community, represented only 3 percent of all doctoral scientists and engineers employed in academia in 1977 and that more than one-half were employed in the biosciences and physics.'\" This relatively small component of the academic staff may become more significant as the research enterprise grows in complexity.

If academic R&D expenditures continue to maintain the momentum exhibited during the 1972-77 period, doctoral research staff without faculty rank will provide an invaluable resource for R&D performance.

The rise in proportion of part-timers in these institutions suggests a sharper curtailment in hiring of permanent employees and an increasing dependence on shortterm and transient appointments. A varioy oi reasons behind this increased utilization of part-timers in all institu7 tions of higher education has surfaced in recent studies of this aspect of the academic labor market. The high rate of growth in S/E employment at 2-year institutions particularly was _confirmed in studies of salary differentials between full-and part-time employees in all fields. One such study found that \"... A larger proportion of part-timers are hired at two-year institutions than at any other institutions of higher education. Stringent pressures to keep tuition costs low for the relatively low income clients which these institutions serve and limited State and private funding make the hiring of less costly faculty an attractive option; increasing enrollments and fairly high turnover rates provide these institutions with the opportunity to increase the number of part-timers without causing substantial dislocations of full-timers. . .\"21 A warning signal has been raised about the future in another study that concluded that \"...

Some of these characteristics have been examined in a current NSF study of sex and ethnic differences in the Federal Government's employment of scientists and engineers that may help explain salary differences in the academic sector.\"' As part of a recent NRC study of salary differentials, special tabulations from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients showed that at the full-professor level, the dollar gap between men and women actually widened between 1973 and 1977 in three fields: chemistry. medical sciences, and psychology.\"\" At the assistantprofessor level, however, all of the fields studied showed an improvement in the equalization of salaries between men and women doctorate-holders during 1973-77, although men'ssalaries were still slightly higher in 1977. Overall, the average salaries of male doctorateholders in all sectors of S/E employment, including academia, averaged $5.400 higher than their female counterparts, up from $3,600 higher in 1973.27 An NSF-sponsored studyassessed job access, positions, promotion practices, and salaries of women holding higher education appointments through a series of site visits to nine typical institutions.

Employment plans expressed by new doctorate recipients in social sciences disciplines in 1977, as reported on the NRC Survey of Earned Doctorates, indicated that only 6 percent desired postdoctoral study in these fields on graduation; the majority expected some other form of employment within education institutions.

When coupled with the 2,500 more S/E degrees awarded, overall growth in master's degree awards in science-related fields amounted to 9 percent,' Only the number of doctorates awarded declined in science, engineering, and health fields, a slowdown that began a year earlier. full-time graduate science enrollment in doctorategranting institutions In the 1974-77 period, full-time enrollment in graduate S/E fields rose a total of 11 percent, a surge that took place almost entirely between 1974 and 1975; the growth rate decelerated to an average of 2 percent in each succeeding year Other signs of change were evident in the relative share of those studying full time, dropping from 74 percent of graduate S/E enrollment to 71 percent. In every major field, growth either slowed markedly by 1977 or actually reversed (appendix table B-32 and chart 321.

Because Computer Sciences: computer programming,' computer and information sciences (general); design, development, and application of computer capabilities to data storage and manipulation; information sciences and systems; systems analysis LIFE SCIENCES Agricultural Sciences: agronomy, animal science, dairy science, food science and technology, forestry, horticulture, poultry science Biological Sciences: anatomy, bacteriology, biochemistry, biogeography, biophysics, ecology, embryology, entomology, evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, nutrition and metabolism, parasitology, pathology, pharmacology, physical anthropology, physiology, plant sciences, radiobiology, systematics, zoology, interdisciplinary fields for the training of technicians Medical Sciences: Internal medicine, neurology, ophthalmology, preventive medicine and public health. psychiatry, radiology, surgery, veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatry, anesthesiology, chemotherapy. dermatology, geriatrics, nuclear medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, oncology, pediatrics, physical medicine and rehabilitation, interdisciplinary fields for the training of Avoid double counting; if an individual is a full-time employee, but his assignment involves more than 1 department or more than 1 campus, he/she should be counted as 1 full-timer in his/her actual or primary field of employment and at his/her primary campus location. Item 1. Full-time scientists and engineers, by field and function in which primarily employed, January 1978. In items la to lh, the functional classification of professional personnel into teaching (column 2), R&D (column 3), and other science and engineering activities (column 4), should be based on the function in which the person is primarily engaged or employed at the institu- In classifying personnel by function, note that determinations made solely on the basis of job titles may produce a significant bias primarily toward teaching. It is important to recognize that persons with professorial rank may also be engaged in research."}, {"section_title": "anuary", "text": "In classifying an individual under a particular category (teaching, research and development, or other science and engineering activities), take into consideration all official activities even if carried on in a school or department other than the one in which he holds his principal appointment. Teaching (column 2) is defined as encompassing those activities connected with degreecredit courses or which are intended to lead ultimately to the granting of degrees or certificates or to professional certification or licensing. Include under \"teaching\" any academic administratorsuch as the President, a Dean, or a department chairmanwho holds a science or engineering degree, unless the individual is primarily involved in the administration of R&D activities. If the individual cannot be identified with one specific discipline, report the field of his highest earned degree. Administrators primarily involved in R&D activities should be reported in the \"R&D\" column. Include personnel engaged in instruction of first-year trainees, residents, and other professional personnel receiving advanced training such as postdoctoral fellows or trainees. Time spent by faculty or other staff members in supervising the thesis work of graduate students is considered to be part of the teaching function. Exclude instructors in nursing programs, dental hygiene, etc., specialties that relate primarily to direct patient care. Research and development (column 3) includes basic and applied research in the sciences and engineering and design and development of prototypes and processes. Research is a systematic, intensive study directed toward fuller knoWledge of the subject studied. Research includes activities that are separately bulgeted, including all activities specifically organized to produce research outcomes and commissioned by an agency either external to the institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within the Full-time-equivalent distribution, by function. In line li, apportion _staff members across the three functions on the basis of the proportion of effort or time spent in each of the functions, thus correcting for the \"primarily engaged\" headcount data reported in line ih. For example, an individual devoting three-fourths of his time to teaching and one-fourth to research and development should be counted as 0.75 in teaching and 0.25 in research and development. The FTE values should then be accumulated for each function. This sure should then be rounded to the nearest whole number before entering the total on the questionnaire. In line 1i, totals entered in columns 2, 3, and 4 should add to the total in column 1. Item 2. Full-time scientists and engineers, by highest earned degree and function in which primarily employed, January 1978. For the purposes of this survey, earned d. \"Master's\" degrees includes all degrees above the bachelor's and first-professional degree and other than the doctorate degrees reported between lines 2a and 2c. e. \"Bachelor's or the equivalent\" degrees includes all individuals whose highest earned degree is the bachelor's degree or a 4-or 5-year first-professional degree, or who have the equivalent in experience, even if they have not earned such a degree (line 2e). Item 3. Part-time scientists and engineers, by field and function in which primarily employed, January 1978. Instructions for item 1 relating to classification by field and function also relate to part-time professional staff in item 3. In estimating the full-time-equivalents of part-time personnel in line 3i, take into account both the overall workload and the proportion of time spent on each of the three functions of activity. For example, if full-time workload is 40 hours per week, and an individual is estimated to spend 10 hours on teaching and related duties and 6 hours on research, his FTE values would be teaching.25 (10/40); R&D--.15 (6/40). The 1E values should be accumulated for each function and rounded to the nearest whole number before entering the total on the questionnaire. The FTE values entered in columns 2, 3, and 4 should then be summed to arrive at the total to be entered in column 1. Item 4. Part-time scientists and engineers, by highest earned degree and function in which primarily employed, January 1978. Instructions for item 2 relating to the classification by field and highest earned degree also relate to part-time professional staff in item 4. Item 5. Full-time scientists and engineers, by field in which primarily employed and sex, January 1978. Institutions are requested to report total fulltime scientists and engineers, by sex and field in which primarily employed.

To estimate total full-time-equivalents (FTE's) in column 4, take into account both allocation of effort, by field, and proportion of full-time workload accounted for by part-time personnel. FTE's in column 5 should reflect research effort of both full-and part-time professional personnel. The following example showing how data might be reported in columns 1 through 5 is included for illustrative purposes only. For the sake of this computation, it is assumed that the data are estimated on the basis of detailed records on faculty activity. The Foundation recognizes, however, that the information systems at many academic institutions do not, in fact, yield data at this level of detail.
