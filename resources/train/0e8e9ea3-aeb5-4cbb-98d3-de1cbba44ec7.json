[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using objectively collected physical activity (PA) data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the authors tested whether patterns of daily activity and sedentary time differed by cancer survivorship in older adults. METHODS: In total, 659 participants (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 71 \u00b1 10 years; 51% women) who had self-reported information on cancer history were instructed to wear an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Accelerometer data were summarized into: 1) PA volume and 2) activity fragmentation (interrupted activity), expressed as both continuous and as dichotomized (low and high) variables. Participants were categorized into 4 groups by cross-classification of dichotomous PA volume and fragmentation. Multiple regression models were used to estimate differences in PA patterns by cancer history. RESULTS: Cancer survivors averaged 0.12 fewer log-transformed activity counts per day (standard error, 0.05; P = .02) than individuals who reported no history of cancer after adjusting for demographics, behavioral factors, and comorbidities. Although fragmentation did not differ by cancer survivorship in the continuous model (P = .13), cancer survivorship was associated with 77% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.82) of having high (vs low) fragmentation and 94% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.33) of having combined low PA/high fragmentation (vs high PA/low fragmentation) relative to those with no cancer history. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that cancer survivors engage in lower total daily PA and that they perform this activity in a more fragmented manner compared with adults without a history of cancer. These results may reflect the onset and progression of a low-activity phenotype that is more vulnerable to heightened levels of fatigue and functional decline with aging.

This measure characterizes the frequency with which an individual transitions into a sedentary state from an active state throughout the day, providing\nCancer December 15, 2018 contextual relevance to the manner in which PA is accrued. 14 To date, the differences in fragmentation and the combined assessment of total daily PA and fragmentation in cancer survivors remain unexplored.\nThe primary objective of the current study was to assess differences in markers of PA patterns in a large cohort of well functioning, middle-aged and older adults (ages \u226550 years) by cancer history.

The Actiheart is a lightweight device that uses a uniaxial accelerometer and a heart rate monitor to measure PA in nonlaboratory, community-dwelling settings. The device was positioned horizontally on the chest at the third intercostal space using 2 standard electrocardiogram electrodes, and participants were instructed to wear the monitor continuously for 7 consecutive days. The Actiheart collects movement as acceleration in units of gravity (g) at a sampling rate of 32 Hz per second. Data are aggregated into 1-minute activity counts (unitless quantities of overall movement). At the end of the accelerometer collection period, participants returned the Actiheart to the Clinical Research Unit by express mail, and the data were downloaded using Actiheart software (version 4.0.103).\nAccelerometer data were summarized into 2 continuous metrics: 1) total daily activity and 2) activity fragmentation. To calculate total PA volume, activity counts were summed across all minutes for each valid day and averaged across all valid days (total activity counts/day) for each participant. Because the distribution of total activity counts per day is right-skewed at higher intensities, total PA volume was log-transformed (log-transformed total activity counts [LTAC]). To calculate activity fragmentation, an active-to-sedentary transition probability was calculated as the number of PA bouts (consecutive minutes registering >10 counts per minute) 17 divided by the total sum of minutes spent in PA. Higher activity Cancer December 15, 2018 fragmentation (eg, a higher score) represents more interruptions in activity performed throughout the day, translating to shorter activity bouts and more sedentary time. Both total volume and activity fragmentation also were treated as categorical variables by dichotomizing each variable at their respective median values to derive \"high\" and \"low\" groups.

In addition, those with a history of cancer were more likely to have \u22652 comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoarthritis. The average \u00b1 SD age at cancer diagnosis was 65 \u00b1 11 years. Figure 1 describes the major types of cancer reported. The highest prevalent cancer type was prostate cancer (41%), and the lowest was lung cancer (1%). Descriptively, cancer survivors accrued fewer daily activity counts (eg, lower total PA) and had higher fragmentation indices (eg, more interruptions in activity), as indicated in Table 1 . Table 2 presents the means and SDs for LTAC and fragmentation (index score) by total sample and stratified by the median of each metric. The sample median was 10.28 for LTAC and 0.27 for fragmentation. Medians were used as thresholds for both variables that categorized 330 into a low group and 329 into a high group. Table 3 provides estimated differences in PA by daily volume and fragmentation by according to cancer history status across 4 models that represent successive covariate adjustment.

For example, a cancer survivor aged 60 years accumulated the Cancer December 15, 2018 same amount of PA in a nearly identical fragmented pattern as a cancer-free adult aged 65 years when holding other demographics, behavioral factors, and comorbidities constant. These results suggest that cancer onset or medical interventions to treat cancer may have detrimental and lasting effects on both the time and the duration spent being active, possibly reducing the capacity to endure longer bouts of daily activity, with aging.\nOur results suggest that cancer survivors not only engage in less daily PA but also accumulate daily activities in bouts of shorter duration by taking more sedentary breaks. Previous studies have primarily investigated differences in time spent at various intensities of activity by cancer history, with a focus on meeting federally recommended PA guidelines (150 minutes/week in MVPA). 13, 18, 19 In general, those studies suggested that cancer survivors largely do not reach recommended PA guidelines and are more likely to engage in light-intensity activities than moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activities. 13, 18, 20 Furthermore, Thraen-Borowski and colleagues demonstrated that the total time spent in light-intensity activity was significantly lower, whereas sedentary time was higher, in individuals who had a history of cancer compared with those who had no history of cancer. 13 It is important to note that the accelerometer data from that study was collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which had an analytic sample that was comparatively younger (mean age, 62 years) and had more women in the cancer survivor sample (58%) than in the current BLSA sample (mean age, 74 years; 31% women). 13 These differences are driven mainly by variations in the distribution of cancer types but indicate that, despite these differences, there are robust variations in quantities and patterns of daily PA by cancer history. Furthermore, our results expand on these findings to demonstrate that these differences may perpetuate for years after treatment in well functioning older adults.\nObjective methods to describe transitions into and out of activity throughout the day are not well understood. To our knowledge, our findings are the first to define and describe activity fragmentation using the probability of transitioning from an active to a sedentary state in cancer survivors. These findings suggest that long-term cancer survivors accrue PA in shorter bouts with a greater number of breaks in activity throughout the day. Taking more activity breaks translates into spending more time in sedentary behaviors and increasing the likelihood of taking fewer breaks in sedentary time. These findings are consistent with previous work from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, suggesting that cancer survivors tend to take fewer breaks from their sedentary behavior despite accumulating similar total daily sedentary time, translating into longer bouts of sedentary behavior compared with those with no history of cancer. 13 In addition, BLSA cancer survivors had markedly lower employment rates and higher rates of smoking and comorbidities compared with those without a history of cancer; factors that warrant further investigation as possible contributors to the degradation of daily PA accrual. Collectively, these results indicate that cancer survivors may be at elevated risk of the deleterious effects of prolonged, sedentary behavior, including adverse metabolic 21, 22 and cardiovascular health, 23 functional decline, 24, 25 and mortality. 26 Fragmented PA patterns observed in BLSA participants with a history of cancer are potentially explained through the likelihood of becoming fatigued faster when performing sustained PA. In healthy adults aged \u226550 years, self-reported fatigue in response to a standardized task, or perceived fatigability, has been negatively associated with PA. 27 Furthermore, time-of-day differences in PA accumulation were observed across fatigability levels-indicating that those with higher fatigability had delayed activity peaks and earlier downshifting in PA participation later in the day. By using the same cohort, Gresham and colleagues demonstrated that a history of cancer was associated with greater odds of being highly fatigable and presenting with poor walking endurance. 6 In addition, those with a cancer history had an increased risk of becoming highly fatigable with progressive aging. Potential explanations of fatigue-driven fragmentation include the burden of senescence cell accumulation as a side-effect from cancer treatment 28 or more clinical side effects, such as muscle deconditioning and loss, 29, 30 weight gain, 31, 32 and pain. 3 Collectively, these results suggest that fatigue and fatigability are likely lasting results of either cancer, cancer treatment, or a combination of both; however, more research is needed to examine the capability of fragmentation to indicate the onset and progression of fatigability, changes in body composition, pain, and reductions in energetic capacity and reserve experienced by cancer survivors.\nWe acknowledge there are limitations to this study. First, because of limited accelerometer data, we were not able to characterize a longitudinal correlation between cancer history and PA accumulation. Second, our study was not powered to determine whether cancer type, stage, or treatment played a role in the association between cancer history and daily PA. Third, cancer diagnoses that Cancer December 15, 2018 occurred closer to accelerometer collection periods were not accounted for and may explain some of the differences observed in cancer survivors. Fourth, activity was calculated as movement generated from the chest, and the observed differences may be attenuated when compared with body locations that capture more movement, such as the wrist. 33 Fifth, BLSA participants are healthier than the general older adult population, thus potentially underestimating the effects of cancer history on daily PA. More research is needed to replicate our findings, particularly in short-term cancer survivors and those actively receiving treatment. Strengths of our study include a large sample of older adults with objective PA data, utilization and combination of novel accelerometer metrics to phenotype PA accumulation in a cancer-related cohort, and using data from a study primarily meant to study normative aging and therefore reducing the potential of comorbid disease burden.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to use activity fragmentation, a novel biophysical marker of activity performed in free-living settings, in a cancer population. Our findings suggest that older adults with a history of cancer accumulate less daily activity and that their activity is performed in a less continuous and more fragmented way. Further research will be necessary to understand the biologic underpinnings that drive the fragmentation of daily activity-including physiologic reserve and accelerated functional decline with aging-and develop interventions that promote recovery to normal activity levels in adults who experience cancer. In addition, longitudinal studies are needed to define clinically important increases in activity fragmentation that may be indicative of the onset and progression of adverse health conditions commonly observed among cancer survivors."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING SUPPORT", "text": ""}]
