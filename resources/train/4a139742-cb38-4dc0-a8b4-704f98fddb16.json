[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "BACKGROUND: Individual environmental exposures are associated with cancer development; however, environmental exposures occur simultaneously. The Environmental Quality Index (EQI) is a county-level measure of cumulative environmental exposures that occur in 5 domains. METHODS: The EQI was linked to county-level annual age-adjusted cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program state cancer profiles. All-site cancer and the top 3 site-specific cancers for male and female subjects were considered. Incident rate differences (IRDs; annual rate difference per 100,000 persons) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using fixed-slope, random intercept multilevel linear regression models. Associations were assessed with domain-specific indices and analyses were stratified by rural/urban status. RESULTS: Comparing the highest quintile/poorest environmental quality with the lowest quintile/best environmental quality for overall EQI, all-site county-level cancer incidence rate was positively associated with poor environmental quality overall (IRD, 38.55; 95% CI, 29.57-47.53) and for male (IRD, 32.60; 95% CI, 16.28-48.91) and female (IRD, 30.34; 95% CI,) subjects, indicating a potential increase in cancer incidence with decreasing environmental quality. Rural/urban stratified models demonstrated positive associations comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles for all strata, except the thinly populated/rural stratum and in the metropolitan/urbanized stratum. Prostate and breast cancer demonstrated the strongest positive associations with poor environmental quality. CONCLUSION: We observed strong positive associations between the EQI and all-site cancer incidence rates, and associations differed by rural/urban status and environmental domain. Research focusing on single environmental exposures in cancer development may not address the broader environmental context in which cancers develop, and future research should address cumulative environmental exposures.

Recent research suggests that genetic variations interact with harmful environmental exposures to exacerbate exposure effects and increase cancer risk. [3] [4] [5] Analysis of data on twins suggests that the genetic contribution to cancer is approximately 50%, suggesting that exogenous factors play a significant role in cancer development. [6] [7] [8] Environmental exposures can alter or interfere with a variety of biological processes, including hormone production and function, inflammation, DNA damage, and gene suppression or overexpression. 4, 9 For example, lung cancer is associated with several environmental exposures, including radon, 10, 11 pesticides, 12, 13 and diesel exhaust. 14, 15 Breast and prostate cancers are also associated with environmental exposures, such as ionizing radiation, solvents, and environmental mutagens. [16] [17] [18] Social exposures, such as poverty, and the built environment have also been associated with cancer outcomes. [19] [20] [21] However, the interaction of multiple environmental exposures remains largely unstudied 22, 23 ; therefore, the burden of environmentally induced cancer may be underestimated.\nEpidemiologic research has traditionally focused on single environmental exposures because the empirical quantification of cumulative exposures, from various environmental sources, is difficult. 24, 25 However, measuring a single environmental exposure does not fully capture environmental effects on health. Rather, several environmental exposures (including social exposures) occur simultaneously, working through multiple mechanisms to induce poor health outcomes, including cancer.\nTo capture multidimensional ambient environmental exposures, the Environmental Quality Index (EQI) was developed. The publically available EQI 26 is a county-level measure of cumulative ambient environmental exposures for the United States for the period 2000-2005. 24, 27 The index was constructed to provide 1 unified EQI as well as domain-specific indices for all counties.\nWe used the EQI to assess the burden of cumulative environmental exposures on all-site and site-specific cancer incidence. We examined county-level cancer incidence rates for the period 2006-2010 in association with the EQI, which represents the period 2000-2005. To assess which environmental domains drive the associations with cancer incidence, we also considered domain-specific indices. Factors influencing environmental quality vary in urban and rural areas 28 ; therefore, we also investigated associations between cancer incidence and the EQI and domain-specific indices stratified by rural/urban status."}, {"section_title": "METHODS AND MATERIALS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population and Outcome Data", "text": "Population-based cancer incidence rates were abstracted from National Cancer Institute state cancer profiles 29 for all available counties in the United States for which data were available. This is a national county-level database of cancer data that are collected by state public health surveillance systems. All-site cancer is defined as any type of cancer that is captured in the state registry data, though nonmelanoma skin cancer is not included. All-site ageadjusted cancer incidence rates were abstracted separately for male and female subjects. County-level annual ageadjusted all-site cancer incidence rates for the years 2006-2010 were available for 2687 of 3142 (85.5%) counties in the United States. Counties for which there are fewer than 16 reported cases in a specific area/sex/race category are suppressed to ensure confidentiality and stability of rate estimates; this accounted for 14 counties in our study.\nTwo states, Kansas and Virginia, do not provide data because of state legislation and regulations which prohibit the release of county-level data to outside entities. Data from Michigan do not include cases diagnosed in other states because data exchange agreements prohibit the release of data to third parties. Finally, state data are not available for 3 states, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington. 29 The age-adjusted average annual incidence rate for all counties was 453.7 per 100,000 persons.\nWe selected 2006-2010 as it is subsequent in time to the EQI exposure data which was constructed to represent the years 2000-2005. We also gathered data for the 3 leading causes of cancer for male (lung, prostate, and colorectal) and female (lung, breast, and colorectal) subjects. These cancers account for a total of less than 50% of all cancer incidence (breast, 14.0%; prostate, 13.3%; lung, 13.3%; colorectal, 8.0%). 30 Incidence rate data were limited for site-specific cancers due to the smaller number of cases. Site-specific cancer incidence rates for male subjects were available for 2322 (73.9%) counties for lung cancer, 2508 (79.8%) counties for prostate cancer, and 2133 (67.9%) counties for colorectal cancer. For female subjects, site-specific cancer incidence rates were available for 2168 (69.0%) counties for lung cancer, 2460 (75.3%) counties for breast cancer, and 2020 (64.3%) counties for colorectal cancer.\nExposure Data: The EQI The EQI was used as an exposure metric as an indicator of cumulative environmental exposures at the county level during the period 2000-2005. A complete description of the datasets used in the EQI are provided in Lobdell et al, 27 and methods used for index construction have been described by Messer et al. 24 The EQI was developed for the period 2000-2005 because it was the time period for which the most recent data were available when index construction was initiated. The EQI includes variables representing each of the environmental domains. The air domain includes 87 variables representing criteria and hazardous air pollutants. The water domain includes 80 variables representing overall water quality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality, atmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination. The land domain includes 26 variables representing agriculture, pesticides, contaminants, facilities, and radon. The built domain includes 14 variables representing roads, highway/road safety, public transit behavior, business environment, and subsidized housing environment. The sociodemographic environment includes 12 variables representing socioeconomics and Original Article crime. Supporting Table 1 provides all variables in each domain by construct.\nDomain-specific indices (air index, water index, etc) were created by retaining the first component of a principle components analysis (PCA) that included all of the domain-specific variables. The EQI was created by retaining the first component of a principle components analysis that combined the domain-specific indices. Recognizing that environments differ across the rural-urban continuum, the EQI and domain-specific index construction was also stratified by rural-urban continuum codes (RUCC). 31 We used 4 RUCC categories: RUCC1, which represents metropolitan urbanized; RUCC2, which represents non-metropolitan urbanized; RUCC3, which represents less urbanized; and RUCC4, which represents thinly populated, all of which have been used in previous health analyses. [32] [33] [34] [35] Finally, we have 6 nonstratified indices (1 overall EQI and 5 domain-specific indices) and 6 corresponding indices for each of the 4 RUCC strata. This allows for assessment of cumulative environmental exposure, domain-specific drivers, and rural/urban variations. The rural/urban stratified overall EQI is shown in Figure  1 ; for each index, higher values correspond to poorer environmental quality."}, {"section_title": "DATA ANALYSIS", "text": "We assessed relationships between county-level exposures representing the period 2000-2005 and cancer incidence rates representing the period 2006-2010 to account for the lag in cancer development. Exposure variables used in the analysis were: nonstratified and RUCC-stratified EQI, and nonstratified and RUCC-stratified domain-specific indices. For cancer outcomes, we considered countylevel, age-adjusted, all-site cancer incidence rates and ageadjusted, site-specific cancer incidence rates for the leading cancer types by sex. Indices were developed as continuous variables and standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Therefore, analyses used quintiles of the indices to allow for more meaningful interpretation (between areas of good [1] , moderate [3] , and poor [5] environmental quality). The index quintiles were associated with county-level cancer incidence rates using fixed slope, random intercept multilevel linear regression models, with state as the random effect and county as the fixed effect, to estimate the fixed effects of index quintiles on cancer incidence rates. Correlations among the EQI domains ranged from 0.08 (air and water domains) to 0.40 (air and built domains). 24 Domain-specific analyses were adjusted for all other environmental domains. Given that the EQI includes variables from all domains of the broader environment, there are few potential confounders to adjust for in the analysis. However, analyses were adjusted for county percentage of the population that ever smoked, which is available from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database. Analyses of breast cancer incidence rates in female subjects were additionally adjusted for county-level mammography screening rates. Results are reported as incidence rate differences (IRDs; annual rate difference per 100,000 persons) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing each quintile with the lowest quintile/best environmental Figure 1 .

We used difference measures because given the severity of the outcomes of interest, they are informative for assessing public health impact and to inform decision making. 36 "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Population Description", "text": "Of the 2687 counties in the analysis, 34% (921) were metropolitan urbanized (RUCC1), 10% (274) were nonmetropolitan urbanized (RUCC2), 34% (927) were less urbanized (RUCC3), and 21% (564) were thinly populated (RUCC4). This mirrors the RUCC distribution of all US counties, which is also 34% RUCC1, 10% RUCC2, 34% RUCC3, and 21% RUCC4. The average annual county-level age-adjusted all-site cancer incidence rate was 451.03 cases per 100,000 population (standard deviation, 59.43).

Comparing the highest quintile/poorest environmental quality with the lowest quintile/best environmental quality for the overall EQI, all-site county-level cancer incidence was positively associated with poor environmental quality overall (IRD, 38 (Fig. 2) . RUCC-stratified models demonstrated positive associations comparing the highest quintiles with the lowest quintiles for all strata except the thinly populated stratum and increasingly stronger associations by quintile for all-site cancer in the metropolitan urbanized strata.\nAssociations with the air index and all-site cancer incidence rates were positive and demonstrated an increasing trend by quintiles, indicating a potential increase in cancer incidence with decreasing air quality (Fig. 2) . Comparing the highest quintile with the lowest quintile, the analysis demonstrated all-site county-level cancer incidence was positively associated with poor air quality (IRD, 44.19; 95% CI, 34.84-53.54). Patterns of associations were similar across rural/urban strata, demonstrating an increase in all-site cancer incidence with worsening air quality.\nEffect estimates for the water index were negative or near null for all-site cancer incidence. For example, for allsite cancer comparing the highest quintile with the lowest quintile, the IRD was 20.75 (95% CI, 214.21 to 12.70) and there was no trend by quintile. Results for RUCCstratified analyses were similar, demonstrating negative or near null effect estimates without a trend by quintile. The metropolitan urbanized strata, however, demonstrated negative results across all quintiles with the highest effect estimates seen with the 4th and 5th quintiles (IRD, 219.68; 95% CI, 235.45 to 23.91; and IRD, 220.45; 95% CI, 235.24 to 25.85, respectively), indicating a decrease in all-site cancer with worsening water quality.\nEffect estimates for the land index varied by quintile and by RUCC.

The highest effect estimate for the built index was in the 4th quintile (IRD, 29.82; 95% CI, 21.27-38.38). Patterns of association were positive across all rural/urban strata, with the highest associations seen in the thinly populated strata.\nEffect estimates for the sociodemographic index were also positive for all quintiles of the EQI, though a trend by quintiles was not seen in the nonstratified analysis. The highest effect estimate for the sociodemographic index was in the 3rd quintile (IRD, 20.59; 95% CI, 11.30-29.88).

Associations differed by rural/urban status and by the 5 environmental domains considered. The highest associations were seen in the air, built, and sociodemographic domains, suggesting these domains are driving the associations with cancer outcomes. Associations in the most urbanized areas were highest for both male and female subjects and across the domain-specific indices. When site-specific cancers were considered, the highest positive associations were seen for prostate cancer in male subjects and breast cancer in female subjects.\nGenetic variation alone does not account for all cancer outcomes, but instead interacts with harmful environmental exposures, modifying the effects of these exposures and risk of cancer. [3] [4] [5] Environmental exposures can alter or interfere with a variety of biological processes, including hormone production and function, inflammation, DNA damage, and gene suppression or overexpression. 4, 9 Analysis of data on twins suggests that the genetic contribution to cancer is approximately 50%, allowing for a significant role of environmental exposures. 6, 8 Both breast and prostate cancers are associated with environmental exposures such as ionizing radiation and solvents. [16] [17] [18] Our findings also show positive relationships between incidence of breast and prostate cancer and environmental quality. Lung cancer is associated with air pollution exposures such as diesel exhaust 14, 15 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 37 Our findings demonstrate positive associations between lung cancer incidence in male subjects and poor air quality. Lung cancer has also been shown to be associated with land pollutants such as radon 10, 11 and pesticides 12, 13 ; however, we did not observe associations with lung cancer and the land domain index.\nEnvironmental health research has used indices to represent multiple variables with a single quantitative measure. This methodology has most commonly been used to represent the built and social environments to describe neighborhood differences. 38, 39 Air pollution studies have also used an index to examine complex mixtures of air pollutants. 40 These cumulative metrics have been associated with various health outcomes, including preterm birth. [38] [39] [40] Measuring a single environmental exposure does not fully capture the health effects resulting from the overall burden of environmental exposures. Rather, environmental exposures occur simultaneously and work through multiple mechanisms to result in cancer. This is the first study, of which we are aware, to use an index of environmental quality to assess the burden of cumulative environmental exposures on cancer incidence.\nIndex development methods have typically been used within a single environmental domain but not to assess simultaneous burden across environmental domains. The EQI is a novel metric of cumulative environmental exposures which was developed using publically available data. However, combining data across domains is challenging for several reasons. Environmental data are often collected for administrative and regulatory purposes and therefore may not provide the spatial and/or temporal coverage to properly assess health outcomes. 41 For both the development of the EQI and this analysis, data were better represented in urban areas compared with suburban and rural areas.\nThe use of an ecological exposure metric is both a limitation and strength of this analysis. The EQI represents the period 2000-2005 and reflects exposures occurring before cancer incidence assessed in this analysis, but there are varying and long lag periods associated with the development of cancer. The EQI is a rank index and can Original Article be representative of environmental quality over time. Sensitivity analyses have shown little change in county rankings over time; however, we did not assess changes over more than 10 years, which may be possible lag periods for cancer development. In addition, the ecological nature of this analysis does not allow us to account for individual level confounders such as alcohol use, physical activity, and nutrition, which may bias results. However, the use of a broad ecological exposure metric is also a strength of this analysis because of the ability to assess the cumulative environment. The EQI considers hundreds of environmental exposures simultaneously across multiple environmental domains, including the sociodemographic environment, which is often neglected when considering environmental exposures. In addition, we were able to leverage publically available exposure and outcome data to assess relationships between environmental quality and cancer incidence on a national level.\nIn conclusion, our county-level analyses demonstrated positive associations between cumulative environmental quality and cancer incidence for all rural/urban strata. The results were mixed for domain-specific indices; for breast and prostate cancer incidence, results were strongest in the air domain. Our analyses suggest that cumulative environmental quality can influence cancer risk and that associations vary by urbanicity. Our study addresses the current appeal for research that expands beyond single exposures by using the EQI, a novel index representing 5 environmental domains. 42, 43 This study demonstrates that focusing on single environmental exposures in cancer development, though necessary to understand specific mechanisms, may not address the broader environmental context in which cancers develop and that future research should address the impact of cumulative environmental exposures.
