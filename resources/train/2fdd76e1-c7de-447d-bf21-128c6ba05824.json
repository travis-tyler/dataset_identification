More parents are delaying their child's entry, and U.S. states are moving school entry cutoffs earlier, mainly because older students outperform younger ones on many educational outcomes. Much of the literature interprets advantages held by older students as benefits to entering school older, but because entering older means being older when students take tests, it is unknown if performance differences are attributable to entry age or test age. Policy and parent behavior depend on which age effect matters more. Using a natural experiment from the province of British Columbia, Canada, that temporarily altered entry dates, I estimate an upper bound of the test age effect and a lower bound of the entry age effect.

The belief that students who enter school older will perform better is partly responsible for a developing trend in education that has been coined the \"graying of kindergarten\"-the increase in the age of the average student on his or her first day of school. In the United States, the increase in age at entry is being driven by a rise in the number of parents enrolling their children one year later than normal and by states that have moved their school entry dates earlier in the year."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Even though policy and parental decisions about school entry dates are being made under the belief that when students are older at entry they perform better on average in school, we do not know for sure whether estimated age effects are due to the effect of entering older or the effect of being one year older when tested. These effects are difficult to separate empirically because students who enter school one year older are almost always one year older when they take tests, making it impossible to know whether any estimated effect represents entry age, test age, or a combination of both. Knowing the relative magnitudes of entering older versus being older when tested is important because policy may differ depending on which effect is responsible for the advantages held by older students. For example, finding a large difference in student performance attributable to entry age could imply adjustments to the current school entry structure. On the other hand, finding a large difference in performance attributable to test age suggests finding alternatives to the common practice of testing all students in the same grade at the same time, but it does not necessarily have direct implications for school entry policy.\nGiven the importance of separating entry age from test age, this article attempts to disentangle the two effects by exploiting a natural experiment that temporarily changed the school entry laws for students in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada. To address the issue of school readiness, in the early 1990s the B.C. Ministry of Education switched from a single-date entry system to a dual-date entry system. Prior to 1990 under the single-date entry system, all students who turned five years old in a given calendar year began school in September of that year. Under dual entry, however, children turning five 1. Deming and Dynarski (2008) note that in 1968, 96 percent of U.S. six-year-olds were in grade 1 versus 84 percent in 2005, with much of the difference being enrolled in kindergarten. Furthermore, Bedard and Dhuey (2007) note that in 1985, seventeen states required a child to be five in September of the first year of school, whereas twenty years later that number jumped to thirty-six states. More recently, four states have introduced legislation to move the cutoff earlier in the calendar year (Weil 2007). years old between May 1990 and October 1990 began school in September 1990, and children turning five between November 1990 and April 1991 began school in January 1991. Due to strong opposition by teachers and parents, the dual entry system was repealed almost immediately in June 1991. As part of the annulment of this policy, students born in November and December 1990 were moved ahead to first grade without having completed a full year of kindergarten, while those born in January-April 1991 were required to repeat kindergarten. This effectively placed students in the grade level they would have been in under the old single-date entry system. This policy had the effect of breaking the direct link that normally exists between entry age and test age for students who were part of dual entry. In particular, students turning five years old around 1 November 1990 started school at different ages, but because of the reshuffling of students after the cancellation of dual entry they were approximately the same age when they began all future grades. In addition, students turning five years old around 1 January 1991 all began kindergarten at the same time, but due to the reshuffling they entered all future grades at different times. For these groups of children, entry age and test age do not move together, making it possible to separate the two effects empirically.\nUsing data from the B.C. Ministry of Education on the group of children affected by dual entry, I empirically separate the entry age from the test age effect. What I provide is an upper bound estimate of the test age effect and a lower bound estimate of the entry age effect because neither effect can be completely disentangled from a schooling effect. If the true estimates are close to the bounds, the estimates indicate that test age has a negative effect on the probability of repeating third grade and a positive effect on grade 10 math and reading test scores. On the other hand, entry age has a relatively small effect on grade repetition and grade 10 test scores. To the extent that the estimates deviate from the bounds due to positive schooling effects, the true test age effect will be lower than reported, and the true entry age effect will be higher. The empirical results are robust to adding controls for baseline student characteristics and a polynomial in day of birth, which accounts for any effect of season of birth on outcomes.\nI show that important heterogeneity in the effect exists across gender. Perhaps the most interesting result is that the effect of test age on the probability that a student repeats grade 3 is more than twice as large for boys than for girls. This result may derive from maturity differences between boys and girls at young ages and suggests that if lowering the amount of grade repetition is important from a policy perspective, increasing the age at which students enter school for the first time (which will also increase their age when they enter each grade) may have an especially pronounced effect on boys. Given the higher effect on boys, such a policy could also reduce the gap in the amount of grade repetition between boys and girls.\nUsing long-term test scores as the outcome, I find that being younger has a disproportionately larger effect on girls, especially in reading. The lower bound of the entry age effect continues to be relatively small for both genders. This result suggests that the policy described above, while helping boys more relative to girls in short-term outcomes, could help girls more relative to boys in terms of long-run test outcomes. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) and Crawford, Dearden, and Meghir (2007) have also recently produced research directly separating these two effects empirically.\n2 My contribution over and above their strong research is that I separate entry age from test age for grade repetition, which neither work examines as an outcome. In addition, while I use a similar estimation method, the identifying variation comes from an entirely different and unique source. Using variation from a different source will help either confirm existing findings or highlight important differences. Finally, I use data from the province of British Columbia, which has a school system that is very typical of the average Canadian or U.S. school system. These estimates can be applied more directly to a North American context as compared with the other two articles, which use European data from countries with very different school systems than those typical in North America. I proceed by discussing the main identification problem faced by researchers in this field. I next review what has been researched up to now in terms of estimating age effects in general, and more specifically in terms of separating entry age and test age. I then discuss my identification and estimation strategy, followed by a presentation of the results and concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "ENTRY AGE OR TEST AGE? THE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM", "text": "Researchers are interested in estimating the effect of both entry age (AE i ) and test age (AT ig ) on some outcome (O ig ). One way to estimate this relationship is with the following linear equation:\nwhere i indexes students and g indexes the grade level. The available data are usually observations on a group of students in a particular grade taking a test at the same time. Using such data means that the level of schooling is constant for all students, and its effect is absorbed into the intercept. As several recent articles have highlighted, there are at least two important problems with trying to estimate equation 1 using this kind of data."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The first is that both AE i and AT ig are endogenous because parents can usually defer entry of their child into school by one year and because a nontrivial number of students either repeats or skips a grade at some point in their schooling career. The students whose age is manipulated in this way are typically a nonrandom group, so without any further control variables ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of equation 1 will be biased. All the research cited in the following section has solved this problem easily by instrumenting AE i and AT ig with variation in age derived from the interaction of date of birth and school entry laws. Identification comes from the fact that given fixed school entry dates, date of birth is correlated highly with age but is expected to have no independent effect on outcomes.\nThe second problem has received relatively less attention. For any child that is in school, the following identity always holds:\nUsing a sample of children who are in the same grade, S ig is held constant, meaning that any change in AE i must be accompanied by an equal change in AT ig . It is therefore impossible to estimate equation 1 in most situations because of a perfect collinearity between the two independent variables. Most of the previous research has instead estimated\nThe problem with this approach is that because of the collinearity problem noted above, students who enter older will always be older when they take tests, meaning that what equation 3 identifies is some combination of the entry and test age effects. Many researchers have found that the estimate of \u03b2 * 1 tends to decline in higher grade levels, and this is sometimes used to argue indirectly that test age is responsible for the majority of the effect because a one-year age difference for older children translates into a smaller maturity difference than for younger children. The problem is that not all researchers find a declining age effect over time, and furthermore the fact still remains that they cannot directly separate either effect.\n3. A third problem that is not covered here is that the effects of chronological age cannot be separated from relative age-the effect of being the oldest in the class. Some researchers have tackled this issue: see Fredriksson and Ockert 2006 , Elder and Lubotsky 2009 , Cascio and Schanzenbach 2007 , and Kawaguchi 2006 . The general consensus seems to be that the relative age effect is small and likely very close to zero.\nIn this article I focus on providing a direct solution to the second identification problem by using a policy change that helped remove the direct collinearity between AE i and AT ig . It is important to keep in mind, however, that while I can separate AE i from AT ig , a final identification problem precludes separating either effect from S ig . While children are in school, it is fundamentally impossible to independently identify all three effects because holding one of the three variables constant and manipulating one of the other two implies that the third variable must also change by the same amount. For example, holding AE i constant means that AT ig = S ig . Likewise, when AT ig is kept constant, AE i = \u2212 S ig . Given that test age varies directly with schooling while entry age varies inversely with schooling, test age effects are upper bounds while entry age effects are lower bounds. I discuss the implications of this fact in the context of the empirical estimates below."}, {"section_title": "EXISTING LITERATURE", "text": "Most of the articles in the age effects literature have estimated that younger students perform worse than older students on a variety of educational outcomes. In early elementary school, researchers find that older students have a test score advantage between 0.3 and 0.8 standard deviations (\u03c3 ) (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Elder and Lubotsky 2009; McEwan and Shapiro 2008; Smith 2009; Fredriksson and Ockert 2006; Datar 2006; Puhani and Weber 2006) , are less likely to repeat a grade by up to 15 percentage points (Elder and Lubotsky 2009) , and are less likely to be diagnosed with a learning disability by up to 3 percentage points (Elder and Lubotsky 2009; Dhuey and Lipscomb 2007) . Toward the end of compulsory schooling and beyond, researchers show that the test score advantage held by older students persists at a lesser magnitude of roughly 0.1-0.2\u03c3 (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Elder and Lubotsky 2009; McEwan and Shapiro 2008; Smith 2009; Fredriksson and Ockert 2006) and that other outcomes such as being university bound and wages may also be affected by age (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Fredriksson and Ockert 2006; Datar 2006; Puhani and Weber 2006) . While most of these studies interpret their estimates as the effect of starting school later, the identification problem outlined above suggests that they cannot separate it from the effect of being one year older when tested.\nEven though these articles cannot directly separate the two effects, some conclusions about the relative magnitudes of entry age versus test age have been advanced based on their findings. One argument is that since the age effect falls over time (for most studies), test age effects might be dominating. On the other hand, McEwan and Shapiro (2008) find an increasing age effect over time for Chile, suggesting possible entry age effects. 4 Further evidence in favor of test age is given by Elder and Lubotsky (2009) , who estimate the age effect in early kindergarten and argue that there has not been sufficient exposure to schooling for an entry age effect to affect students. A small handful of articles have made direct attempts to separate entry and test age. An early attempt is Datar (2006) , who uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten, Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), sample to estimate the entry age effect for a group of children in kindergarten and grade 1. Assuming that test age is linear in time, it is differenced out by using test score gains as the dependent variable, leaving only entry age. She finds a significant positive entry age effect. This work is somewhat limited by the fact that it cannot provide test age effects and because the data allow a focus only on very young students. Furthermore, it is unclear whether test age effects are linear over time, which is crucial to the identification strategy. Fredriksson and Ockert (2006) also provide an early attempt to identify the effect of entry age on educational attainment and earnings for a sample of individuals from Sweden who have finished their schooling. When individuals are outside the school system, entry age and test age are no longer directly linked, and the effects of entry age can be identified. Furthermore, in Sweden graduates typically all have the same amount of schooling, so that is also removed as a confounder. The authors find a small positive effect of starting school later on attainment and a small negative effect on earnings overall.\nMore recently, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) estimate the effects of entry age and test age on IQ scores for a sample of eighteen-year-old Norwegian men. Identification is possible because the IQ tests are not part of the school system, and therefore no exact linear dependence between entry age, test age, and schooling exists.\n5 They conclude that the bulk of the age-related differences in test scores are attributable to test age. Using a larger sample that includes women, they also look at the effect of entry age on longer-term outcomes such as educational attainment, earnings, and early fertility using the same identification strategy as Fredriksson and Ockert (2006) . They find no effect on educational attainment, a small negative effect on early fertility, and a small positive effect on earnings.\n4. Test age is generally thought to be related to maturity. As children age, the maturity gap between two students who are one year apart in age gets smaller and smaller, hence the shrinking age effect. Entry age effects are expected to grow over time as the skills of older students who perform better initially are reinforced through placement in advanced streams, for example. 5. While the authors are able to separate entry age from test age, they are not able to separate either effect from schooling for their main sample because most students take the IQ test while they are still in school. Using a sample of school finishers, they do show that this does not bias their estimates much.\nA slight limitation is that their data force them to focus entirely on postschooling outcomes. While long-term outcomes are certainly important economically, providing estimates of entry age and test age early in school is equally important for education authorities and parents who may base policy and school entry decisions on these early differences. A secondary limitation is that IQ scores are available only for males, so heterogeneity across gender cannot be examined. This is important because the effect may differ quite substantially across gender. Finally, it is unclear whether differences in the Norwegian education system would affect generalizability of their results to other countries. Crawford, Dearden, and Meghir (2007) identify entry age and test age effects for test scores using a sample of English schoolchildren. They separate the effects with geographic variation in the structure of the school entry rules: some jurisdictions have multiple entry points, while others do not. This creates a sample in which some children who start school at the same time are tested at different times, and some children who are tested at the same time started school at different times. The authors find that most of the age effect is attributable to test age, which is large in early elementary school and diminishes thereafter."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "I contribute to the literature in several ways. The main contribution is that I directly identify lower bound entry age and upper bound test age effects for a sample of in-school children using a completely new source of identifying variation. The studies by Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) and Fredriksson and Ockert (2006) consider only outcomes post schooling. Furthermore, most of the previous literature that has identified age effects for in-school children has only been able to speculate on the relative strength of these two effects based on how the age effect evolves over time. While Crawford, Dearden, and Meghir (2007) also directly separate these effects for in-school children, I add to their work by considering an additional outcome (grade repetition), considering a different source of identifying variation, and using a Canadian sample from a jurisdiction typical of any Canadian or U.S. educational system, which will highlight any differences in these effects across European and North American education systems."}, {"section_title": "IDENTIFICATION AND ESTIMATION", "text": "A recent policy experiment in British Columbia creates a unique way to separate entry age from test age effects. For many years up to 1990, British Columbia had a single-date school entry system. Under this system, students turning five years old in a given calendar year would start school in September 6. Like Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) , they cannot separate the effect of schooling from entry age or test age while children are in school.\nof that year. This effectively meant that all students born within a calendar year started school together in September five years later. As part of a larger education reform initiative called the Year 2000 Education Plan, the B.C. Ministry of Education mandated a \"dual entry\" system into kindergarten in school year 1990-91.\n7 Unlike the previous system, under dual entry students turning five years old between 1 May and 31 October 1990 began school in September 1990, while students turning five years old between 1 November 1990 and 30 April 1991 began school in January 1991. Equivalently, students born within the six-month span between November and April would start school five years later in January, while those not born within that span started a few months earlier in September."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "Under considerable criticism, dual entry was quickly repealed at the end of the school year in June 1991 and replaced with the old single-entry system. As part of the change back to the single-entry system, the government mandated that the children born in November and December be moved ahead to grade 1 without completing a full year of kindergarten, and the children born in January-April repeat kindergarten, putting them into the cohort they would have been in if dual entry had never existed.\nThe existence of multiple entry dates and the subsequent reshuffling of students had a significant impact on student entry age and test age, breaking the perfect collinearity that normally exists between these two variables. This effect is most easily understood by examining the graph in figure 1. This graph plots entry age and test age against date of birth for a group of grade 3 students whose birth dates put them among the cohorts of students subjected to dual entry. The exact linear relationship is broken at three distinct discontinuity points. Students born near 1 November 1985 entered grade 3 at approximately the same time but began school at different times. While students born just after that date were legislated to start school slightly older, the fact that the government forced them ahead to grade 1 upon cancellation of dual entry meant that they entered grade 3 at roughly the same age as those born just before 1 November 1985. Thus we have a group of students who started school at different ages but whose test age is held constant. An identical relationship exists for students born near 1 May 1986. 7. Dual entry was piloted in select school districts in 1989-90 that opted into the program. Because I cannot identify which districts opted in, I focus on analyzing students who were born in the time period when this policy was specifically legislated and mandatory for all districts. See Glegg (1995) . 8. The Year 2000 plan was intended to establish broad goals for learning among B.C. youth. Most important for this analysis is that there were no changes implemented by this plan that would have affected cohorts of children differently, particularly those in the immediate vicinity of entry cutoffs. Furthermore, at the time these children were being born, this plan was not yet in effect, so parents could not have sorted in response to its anticipation. For a brief discussion of the plan, see Gammage (1991) ."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. Predicted Entry and Test Ages under Dual Entry in British Columbia", "text": "Students born just before 1 January 1986 were legislated to start school at roughly the same time as students born just after that date, but again, because they were forced to skip ahead to grade 1 while students born just after were forced to repeat kindergarten, the two groups entered grade 3 at different times. The key here is that there is now a group of students who all began school at the same age but entered grade 3 at different ages.\nThe existence of these three discontinuities breaks the direct linear relationship between entry age and test age and thus makes it possible to separate these two effects from each other. Empirically, I make use of this identifying variation by estimating the following instrumental variables (IV) model using two-stage least squares (2SLS):\nIn this model, O ig is an indicator for either grade 3 repetition or grade 10 test scores, AE i is actual student entry age, and AT ig is actual student test age. I treat both AE i and AT ig as endogenous and instrument them with predicted entry age AE p i and predicted test age AT p ig . Predicted entry age is derived as the age a student should have been had she begun school according to the entry rules, while predicted test age is the age a student should have been had she entered grade 3 (or taken the grade 10 tests) according to the rules.\nDiscrepancies between predicted and actual entry and test age arise when students delay entry or repeat or skip grades.\nRecall that although the procedure statistically separates the effects of entry age from test age, due to the identity in equation 2, it cannot separate either effect from schooling (and it is impossible to do so while children are in school). Holding entry age constant, increases in test age will be accompanied by increases in schooling, whereas when holding test age constant, increases in entry age will be accompanied by decreases in schooling. Thus we must think of \u03b2 1 as a lower bound estimate of the entry age effect and \u03b2 2 as an upper bound estimate of the test age effect.\nBoth predicted test age and entry age are piecewise linear functions of birth date, where discontinuities arise at the school entry cutoff points. Because both instruments are deterministic functions of birth date, internal validity depends entirely on whether the birth date is correlated with factors that determine student outcomes. The most obvious violation of this restriction would be if a nonrandom group of parents could somehow plan their child's date of birth to be at a specific time. Season of birth in particular has been linked with observable parent factors in the existing literature (e.g., Bound and Jaeger 2000; Buckles and Hungerman 2009), but as I show later, the results are generally robust to including a third-order polynomial in day of birth, which should account for any relationship that might exist between the outcomes and the time of year that a student was born.\nBirth date planning of a more precise nature around the discontinuity points, perhaps through Cesarean sections or induced labor, may also create an internal validity problem. While there is no direct evidence that parents plan births according to school entry laws (Dickert-Conlin and Elder 2009), there is evidence that they plan births precisely according to tax rules (Dickert-Conlin and Chandra 1999). I show that there is no evidence in the B.C. data of such behavior, suggesting that internal validity is not compromised by this type of behavior.\nThe unique nature of the policy experiment used in this article creates some additional ways in which the exclusion restriction may be violated. Such a violation could occur, for example, if students entering school in January were streamed into separate classes. If this were the case, students entering in January and September may have experienced different classroom environments, in particular with respect to class size. The exclusion restriction may also fail if teachers treated January entrants differently. Finally, if there were any other provision in the Year 2000 Education Plan that is related to date of birth, internal validity would be compromised.\nThere is some evidence that the influence of confounding factors like those suggested above are minimal. I have not been able to find any specific policy in the Year 2000 Education Plan that might be related to a student's date of birth, meaning that the problem of confounding policies is likely minimal or nonexistent. With respect to classroom streaming, the direct implementation of this policy was very abrupt, such that schools were generally unprepared to make special arrangements for the cohort of January entrants. According to a recent article in the Victoria Times Colonist (Knox 2008) , more often than not these students were placed in existing classrooms with their peers who had entered four months earlier in September. This means that classroom assignment is likely not related to date of birth and would therefore not confound estimates.\nOne effect I cannot directly rule out is that some students were treated differently by teachers. Teachers in particular may have given the January entrants some special treatment because they were the first cohort that did not enter in September. Again, however, the abruptness of the policy may act to mitigate any influence this might have had. While teachers would have liked to alter lesson plans and treat these students differently, they may not have had enough time to implement such a strategy. Of course, this does not preclude students being treated differently on a day-to-day basis, but it may have prevented something more systematic and planned.\nAssuming heterogeneous treatment effects, the question of external validity arises because the IV model above identifies a local average treatment effect (LATE) of entry age and test age on outcomes. This local estimator applies to people whose actual entry and test age are determined by the school entry laws and the government's subsequent reshuffling of students between kindergarten and grade 1. For most cohorts in the sample, the fraction of students who start school in accordance with the laws is over 90 percent, suggesting that for many people entry age is directly influenced by the laws. 9 If most people in the sample are affected by the instrument, the LATE may be a good approximation to the average treatment effect (ATE). Note, however, that the cohort born in November-December 1985 shows considerably more slippage than other cohorts, with only 46 percent of student starting in accordance with the laws. For this cohort, it is perhaps less plausible that the LATE and ATE are close to one another. To get a handle on whether this is true, I assume that the entry age of all students who start on time has been manipulated by the instruments (thereby making them \"compliers\" in the treatment effects sense), and I then compare personal characteristics of these students across cohorts. Evidence based on this exercise indicates that 9. It is technically not possible to tell whether older students who start on time are affected by the laws or whether they would have started at that time in the absence of the laws. It seems reasonable to assume that many of these students would not have started school at the exact time predicted by the entry laws had they not been forced to do so. Note that increasing predicted entry age must be associated with increasing actual entry age or no change in entry age for the monotonicity assumption of LATE to be valid.\nthese complying students may not be different across the cohorts in terms of baseline characteristics, implying that the LATE could indeed be generalizable to the average person in the sample. The uniqueness of the policy that induced the age variation also raises some questions about external validity. Dual entry and its cancellation altered entry and test age but also made the overall schooling experience quite different from past and future cohorts. For example, this cohort may have been treated differently, perhaps even developing a stigma. Thus increasing entry or test age in a different context could lead to different results. While this is entirely possible, in defense of the generalizability of the estimates I obtain, their sign and magnitude are generally comparable to other research (in particular Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2008 and Crawford, Dearden, and Meghir 2007) . Because of this, I believe that my estimates are at least as good an approximation of what might happen if the same treatment were applied outside the sample, but I certainly do not rule out the possibility that the results are not completely generalizable."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND ANALYSIS SAMPLE", "text": "The data used for analysis are derived from administrative records collected once yearly by the B.C. Ministry of Education. They contain information on all students attending any public or private school in British Columbia between 1990 and 2004.

While it is technically possible to study repetition of other grades, I focus only on grade 3 because the structure of the B.C. school system creates a situation with very few repeaters in the surrounding grades. The curriculum is separated into three stages: the primary years (K \u2212 3), the intermediate years (4-10), and the graduation years (11-12). Because there is a natural transition point between the primary and intermediate years, in the sample I use for analysis I observe 2.67 percent repeating grade 3 versus 0.5 percent or less repeating the surrounding grades. 11. Using a cumulative measure indicating whether a student has repeated any grade prior to grade 3 as the outcome would be problematic for this analysis. The coefficient on test age would then have the awkward interpretation as the impact of being one year older at the beginning of grade 3 on having repeated at least one grade in the past.

All students are required to write the test, but a small subsample of about 5 percent are excused if they cannot write due to learning disabilities or if their English skills are not adequate. Only the grade 10 test scores are used as outcomes because the test was initiated in 1999, and this is the only test students entering school around 1990 are observed writing. This variable is standardized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one for each test in each year.\nBecause exact birth date is known, test age and entry age can be computed precisely for each student. I construct test age as 1 September of the beginning of grade 3 when repetition is the outcome or the exact day of the standardized test for the grade 10 sample. Since all schools in British Columbia start at the same time each year (the day following Labor Day), setting 1 September as the test age should not cause problems.

Note that one ambiguity in entry dates arose because of British Columbia's practice of collecting data once every October. Most students born between January and April 1986 began school in January 1991, but they could have delayed entry until September of that year. When dual entry was canceled, this group of students was forced to repeat kindergarten, meaning that a January entrant who started in January cannot be identified separately from a January entrant who delayed entry until September. To solve this ambiguity, I assume that all January-April students observed for the first time in kindergarten in October 1991 began school on 1 January 1991. This introduces measurement error into entry age (but not test age), which may bias coefficients toward zero. 13. Though the loss of students from the universe is not trivial (about 20 percent for the grade 10 sample), students in each subsample remain comparable to the universe itself along baseline characteristics, so I do not expect that the attrition will cause selection problems. As one robustness check, I ran the regressions for grade 3 students using the grade 10 subsample and the results were very similar, further bolstering the notion that the attrition does not cause problems. The results should be interpreted as holding only for those students who stay in the B.C. school system through grades 3 or 10. Notes: +1 indicates that students are born one month after the listed cutoff, whereas \u22121 indicates they are born one month before the cutoff. Age is in years; Repeated grade, Male, Aboriginal, and Non-English are all percentages; Numeracy and Reading scores are z-scores with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \"All\" refers to the entire sample of students, and the dates listed in the header refer to a school entry cutoff point.\nage or test age discontinuity. The reason for focusing on the area around the discontinuity is that this is where the identifying variation arises, and this is thus the most important subgroup of students to analyze. Column 1 presents means for all variables using each subsample as a whole. On average the grade 3 students are just over five years old at entry and eight years old at the beginning of grade 3, while the grade 10 students are just under sixteen years old at the time they are tested. About 2.6 percent of grade 3 students repeat, and the mean numeracy and reading test scores for the grade 10 students are slightly above zero, meaning that students in the birth cohorts I choose to analyze are above average. Just over half of the students are male, 8-10 percent are Aboriginal, and 10-12 percent speak a non-English language at home.\nColumns 2-9 present the same averages for subgroups of students born on either side of the five relevant school entry cutoff dates. I focus in particular on grade repetition, test scores, and the age variables because these are the main factors in the estimating equations. Variation in entry age and test age are consistent with previous descriptions. There are notable discontinuities in test age near both of the January entry cutoff dates, but there is much less variation around the November and May cutoffs. Conversely, entry age varies significantly at all cutoffs except January 1986. Note that there is some variation at this discontinuity, and this is the result of parents reshuffling after the policy was canceled. Finally, there are notable differences in grade repetition at all the cutoff points. More often than not, people born just before a cutoff point are much more likely to repeat a grade. Generally speaking, test scores are higher for students born just after each discontinuity, but normally less than 5 percent of a standard deviation.\nThe patterns of entry age, test age, and outcomes across each of the discontinuity points provide some intuition behind the results to come. At the 1 November 1985 discontinuity, notice that to the right of the cutoff the average entry age increases, but so does grade repetition. On its own, this implies that entering older increases grade repetition, but recall that increases in grade repetition are associated with declines in schooling. Thus this pattern suggests that there may be a schooling effect overriding any entry age effect among these students. Looking across to the 1 January 1986 cutoff, students born just after the cutoff are younger at entry but older at the beginning of grade 3 and have a much lower probability of repeating grade 3. Those born just after the cutoff also have more schooling, suggesting that when test age and schooling effects work together, the result is quite a large change in outcomes. Interestingly, with a large increase in entry age to the right of the 1 May 1986 discontinuity there is very little change in grade repetition, which is consistent with offsetting entry age and schooling effects. These preliminary summary statistics suggest that both entry age and test age effects are likely to be positive, but both are influenced by the associated change in schooling. Table 2 outlines the fraction of students who enter school on time (in compliance with school entry laws) for different subgroups of students defined over birth date ranges for the entire sample universe. For nearly all cohorts, well over 90 percent enter on time, with most closer to 100 percent. Among those students who enter one year early or late, it appears as though the slippage occurs mostly due to starting school late. One cohort stands out in particular: those born between November and December 1985. These students were the first cohort slated to start in January under mandated dual entry. Because of parental reluctance to have children begin school halfway through the school year, many parents opted to have their children start four months early, and a slightly smaller fraction postponed entry to the following September. This explains the large amount of slippage for that particular cohort. 14 14. The values for the January-April 1986 cohort are measured with error because all students born in this range were assigned a 1 January entry date. See note 11 for an explanation of this issue. Notes: Expected start date is derived from B.C. law and is based on when the student turns five years old. On time refers to the percentage of students who begin at the assigned entry date, late refers to students who postpone entry by one or two entry dates, and early refers to students who begin one or two entry dates before their normal entry date.\nWhile this slippage does not affect the internal validity of the LATE estimates, it may affect their interpretation. The IV estimator is defined over those people who comply with the rules, and if this is a select subset, the results may not be that generalizable. In particular, one worry is that the NovemberDecember compliers discussed above are a very select subgroup. To assess the validity of this claim, table 3 computes means of baseline characteristics for students who start school on time, separated by the time period in which they were born. The idea behind this table is that if students who start on time represent compliers (in the treatment effects sense) sufficiently well, comparing their baseline characteristics gives us some idea of whether the NovemberDecember students are a select subgroup. There are only slight differences between the November-December cohort and the rest of the cohorts in terms of gender and whether they speak English at home, indicating that they are not an overly select subgroup of students. This supports the notion that the LATE estimates may be generalizable to the average student in the sample. Notes: The percentages generated in this table use only the sample of students who start on time (those who follow school entry rules strictly). Non-English refers to the student's home language being anything other than English."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "First-Stage Estimates", "text": "In table 4, I show the first-stage estimates of actual entry age and test age regressed on the instruments-predicted entry age and test age. Odd columns present specifications without any controls, whereas even columns add school fixed effects, baseline covariates, and a cubic in day of birth. Panel A presents the estimates for the grade 3 subsample, and panel B presents those for the grade 10 subsample. Due to the inclusion of both predicted entry age and test age in each specification, the coefficients can be slightly confusing to interpret. In column 1 of panel A, which uses entry age as the dependent variable, the coefficient on predicted entry age suggests that for students who are supposed to start grade 3 at the same time (i.e., holding predicted test age constant), those who are predicted to enter one year older are actually 0.982 years older when they enter. The fact that the coefficient on predicted entry age is not identically equal to 1 reflects the effects of delayed entry, as some parents will postpone entry of their child by up to one year. The coefficient on predicted test age in column 1 implies that among students who are supposed to enter school at the same time, those with a higher predicted test age actually enter slightly younger. This coefficient can be interpreted as a measure of the nonrandomness of the group of parents that choose to delay entry. According to these estimates, holding constant predicted kindergarten entry age, those who are predicted to have a lower test age will be those who delay entry.\nIn column 3 of panel A, I run a similar regression except with test age as the dependent variable. The coefficient on predicted test age means that among students who are supposed to start school at the same time, those with a predicted test age that is one year older actually take the test 0.831 years older. The slippage here results from the effects of both delayed entry and grade repetition. Finally, the coefficient on predicted entry age means that among students who were supposed to start grade 3 at the same time, those who are predicted to be one year older at entry are 0.072 years older when they actually enter grade 3. Again, this can be interpreted as a measure of the nonrandom group of parents that choose not to follow the rules: children who have an older predicted entry age are slightly more likely to have been held back and start grade 3 later. While this result seems counterintuitive, I believe it is driven by the large number of students born in November-December 1985 who started school late, since they tended to be older at entry than the students born just prior to November, with whom they were supposed to begin grade 3. A similar set of results follows in panel B, using the grade 10 sample. The noticeable difference from panel A is that in the equation with test age as the dependent variable, increases in expected test age lead to a much smaller increase in actual test age. In addition, among those who are supposed to take the grade 10 test at the same time, those expected to be one year older at entry are 0.235 years older when they sit for the test. This suggests the same pattern "}, {"section_title": "Notes:", "text": "The critical values for the under-identification and weak identification statistics can be found in Stock and Yogo (2002) .

It is important to keep in mind, however, that this does not invalidate the identification strategy in any way. Table 4 also presents the R 2 and F-statistic as measures of the validity of the instruments. The R 2 is between 0.391 and 0.742 across regressions, indicating that the instruments explain a large amount of the variation in both entry age and test age. The F-test of joint significance of both of the instruments is extremely high, which, according to the Staiger-Stock rule of thumb of 10, is preliminary evidence in favor of strong instruments. Note that because there are two endogenous variables, the first-stage F-statistic could be misleading if one instrument is a strong predictor of both endogenous variables. In this case, however, it is clear that predicted entry age is a strong predictor of actual entry age and predicted test age is a strong predictor of actual test age, meaning that the first-stage F is not likely giving misleading results. Nevertheless, I present the results from a more appropriate test developed by Stock and Yogo (2002) in the next section.\nThe critical values for the under-identification and weak identification statistics can be found in Stock and Yogo (2002) .

The results of this research suggest that at least in terms of grade repetition, one potential cause of this problem may be that young boys are simply not mature enough at the time they start grade 3. Allowing them one extra year before beginning that grade may lead to a large decrease in the number of boys that end up repeating a given elementary grade. As Sax (2007) suggests, one way to accomplish this is to have boys enter school when they are one year older than girls. Such a policy would have the effect of increasing both entry age and test age and could allow the gap between boys' and girls' performance to be closed somewhat. Even given the potential benefits in the reduction of grade repetition, it is unclear whether parents would accept a policy that discriminates only on the basis of gender. A potentially more viable alternative would be to direct extra school or parent resources toward boys to compensate for their relative disadvantages in terms of maturity."}, {"section_title": "Baseline 2SLS Estimates", "text": "I now turn to the baseline 2SLS estimates of both the entry age and test age effects, which are located in table 5. In this section I focus on the first two columns for each outcome: an OLS estimate for comparison and the 2SLS baseline estimates. The third column contains 2SLS specifications with covariates, which I discuss in the next section. When grade repetition is an outcome, the OLS estimate of test age is strongly negative, while the entry age effect is mildly positive. OLS estimates are presented only for comparative purposes; due to potential endogeneity of entry and test age, 2SLS coefficients are more reliable. In terms of 2SLS, I estimate a large and significant effect of test age and a much smaller negative effect of entry age. Quantitatively, increasing test age by one year leads to a 6.0 percentage point decline in the probability of repeating grade 3. Comparatively, McEwan and Shapiro (2008) estimate that increasing age leads to a more modest 2 percentage point decline in the probability of repeating first grade, and Elder and Lubotsky (2009) estimate a much higher 13-15 percentage point decline. Compared with both those estimates, the coefficient estimated here is still large but somewhere in the middle of the range.\nLooking now at column 5, which uses the grade 10 numeracy test as an outcome, 2SLS estimates reveal a pattern of small negative entry age effects but large positive and significant test age effects. The 2SLS estimates imply that increasing test age by one year will increase numeracy test scores by 9.0 percent of a standard deviation (\u03c3 ). This estimate is slightly smaller than other estimates in the literature using data near the same grade but somewhat similar to the estimate from Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) , which was around 0.10\u03c3 for their Norwegian sample.\nMoving to column 8 in table 5, the 2SLS estimates suggest a slightly higher effect of test age on reading scores than that obtained using numeracy as an outcome but a similar effect for entry age. Quantitatively, increasing test age by one year leads to a 0.107\u03c3 increase in reading scores. Table 5 presents two instrument tests to supplement the first-stage Fstatistics already presented. First is an under-identification test intended to check whether the 2SLS system passes the \"rank\" test with a null of full rank, while the second is a weak instrument test based on the Cragg-Donald statistic, where the null is either that 2SLS is less biased than OLS by a given fraction or that the size of the 2SLS tests does not exceed some given threshold. The cutoff values for these tests using different such thresholds are located in Stock and Yogo (2002) , and I will note here that the values of the test statistics exceed all possible critical values by a large amount, indicating strong instruments.\nRecall that the test age effect is an upper bound, whereas the entry age effect is a lower bound. The small size, and sometimes \"wrong\" sign, on entry age suggests that schooling does exert some influence over students' outcomes that is about as large as the entry age effect. Given a schooling effect, the true test age effect is therefore lower than the upper bound estimate in this article. Unfortunately I cannot directly assess the size of this schooling effect with any sort of certainty using the B.C. data. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) , however, are able to address this issue directly; when they restrict their sample of Norwegian males to those who have finished schooling, they find that both the entry age and test age effects shrink toward zero. Interestingly, the entry age effect shrinks much more than the test age effect does, suggesting that schooling and test age are likely playing the largest roles, and entry age is playing a relatively smaller role, in determining school outcomes. To the extent that the variation used in this study and in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) is similar, one might expect a similar pattern using the B.C. sample.\nThe variation used in this article, however, does have one unique aspect that implies a potentially different impact of schooling. Whereas the confounding influence of schooling in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) arises because some students have been exposed to extra schooling at the end of their schooling career, the confounding influence in this article arises due to extra time in kindergarten at the beginning of their schooling career. If one believes that the impact of extra kindergarten fades by the time students enter grade 3 or grade 10, the confounding impact of schooling may not be that large. There is some support for this idea in the literature on early childhood interventions, though overall the evidence appears to be mixed on whether such interventions persist.\n15 Even so, it is still likely to be the case that schooling exerts some influence over these outcomes, and this must be kept in mind when interpreting the coefficients."}, {"section_title": "Robustness", "text": "Since both instruments are derived from piecewise linear functions of date of birth, it is crucial to identification that date of birth is not correlated with the error term in the main structural equation. There is evidence that season of birth is correlated with many of the predictors of school outcomes (Buckles and Hungerman 2009) , so when using an IV strategy based on birth dates one must control for such effects. Furthermore, it is possible that precise timing of birth around specific key dates might cause a relationship between birth date and outcomes at the discontinuities that generate the main identifying variation. While there is no evidence that parents plan births around discontinuities specifically for school entry purposes (Dickert-Conlin and Elder 2009), there is evidence that they target birth dates just before the calendar year for tax purposes (Dickert-Conlin and Chandra 1999) . Because one of the main discontinuities occurs on 1 January, such tax planning may also induce a 15. For example, DeCicca (2007) shows that the effects of attending full day versus half day kindergarten fade out within a couple of years. But Currie (2001) and Currie, Garces, and Thomas (2002) suggest that impacts of Head Start (and other programs) may actually carry over to medium-and long-term outcomes.\ncorrelation between date of birth and unobserved parental characteristics that would work against the identification strategy.\nTo check robustness to season of birth effects I include a series of control variables for baseline characteristics, school fixed effects, and a cubic polynomial in day of birth. The school fixed effects are designed to proxy for any school and neighborhood characteristics such as income and education that may be correlated with both date of birth and school outcomes. The cubic in day of birth is meant to absorb any relationship that might exist between the time of the year a student is born and grade 3 repetition or test scores.\nSpecifications including these controls are reported in columns 3, 6, and 9 of table 5. The general pattern is that the effects are robust to the inclusion of these controls. In particular, the coefficients on both test age and entry age for grade repetition differ minimally. The test age and entry age coefficients on both numeracy and reading scores increase in magnitude but not by enough to cause serious concern.\nAnother check on the robustness to season of birth effects is to limit the sample to those located around the discontinuities, because this is where all the identifying variation occurs and because the influence of season of birth factors should be eliminated by considering such a small subset of the population born around the same time. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) and Elder and Lubotsky (2009) implement this strategy under the assumption that it eliminates the potential for bias stemming from birth date timing or the seasonality of births described above. One potential problem with this strategy that must be kept in mind is that if treatment effects are heterogeneous, different estimates could arise if this specific subpopulation responded to the age change differently from the average individual in the population. Table 6 presents the results from limiting the sample to those born one month on either side of the school entry cutoffs. The results are very similar to the baseline results, except that the magnitudes of the test age effects have increased. The standard errors also increase significantly due to a large loss of sample size; it is approximately one-twelfth the size. In spite of this, the test age effects still remain highly statistically significant. The overall conclusion from this exercise is that the estimates are robust to limiting the sample to those near the identifying variation.\nTo address issues of precise birth timing, I look for evidence that parents precisely time births to one side of each of the discontinuities. The only really concerning cutoff is the one at 1 January 1986; since the dual entry policy came into effect several years after any of the children in the sample were born, parents could not have sorted around the 1 November or 1 May cutoffs. They may, however, have sorted around the 1 January cutoff based on tax Notes: The discontinuity sample includes those born one month on either side of the discontinuities generating the identifying variation.

One method to assess birth date targeting is to take the population of all births between 1 May 1985 and 31 December 1987 and look at a frequency histogram of the number of births per day to see if there is any clustering near 1 January. Unfortunately, disaggregated vital statistics data on births for British Columbia are not readily available, so as a second-best alternative I look at the sample of all 120,108 kindergarten entrants from the B.C. data during the relevant time period. The frequency histogram of number of births using the kindergarten entry cohort is plotted in figure 2. Dips on weekends and key holidays are clearly evident in the graph, as is a distinct seasonal pattern, but there does not appear to be any obvious clustering around any of the discontinuities. To support this claim further, I regressed the natural logarithm of counts of the number of students born on each day (and the raw counts in a separate regression) on a second order spline function of birth date, allowing changes in the intercept at each of the key cutoff points and for different slopes between any two adjacent cutoff points. Table 7 shows that there are only tiny changes in the intercept as the spline function crosses each of the cutoffs, supporting the notion that parents have not precisely timed births around any of the discontinuities. For visual reference, figure 3 plots student counts and the associated predicted values from the regression against date of birth. Notes: This table presents regressions of either the logarithm of the number of students or the number of students born on each day on a quadratic spline function of date of birth, allowing for breaks at each school entry cutoff point."}, {"section_title": "Subgroup Analysis", "text": "Perhaps more interesting than the effect of entry age and test age on the average individual is the difference in these effects across gender. Some researchers argue that the brains of boys and girls develop at different rates when they are young (Sax 2007) , so there is an a priori reason to believe that both entry age and test age would have different effects across gender. If the effect of entry age is seen to be different by gender, and if reducing gender gaps in both the outcomes analyzed in this article is policy relevant, it raises the possibility of a \"genderized\" school entry policy where boys enter at one time and girls enter at another. If test age effects differ by gender, some may suggest the same policy, as changing entry age normally changes test age at the same time. It also raises the possibility of an alternative policy that tests boys and girls at different times. Table 8 replicates the baseline estimates with covariates for males and females. Interestingly, the effect of test age on grade repetition is much higher for males than for females. Being one year older when starting grade 3 reduces the probability of repeating that grade by about 8.2 percentage points for males and 3.4 percentage points for females. This result is perhaps unsurprising given that males are thought to be less mature than females at younger ages, so allowing them to be one year older would have a much stronger effect. The entry age effects are near zero for both genders, indicating a lack of such an effect or an offsetting schooling effect.\nFor test scores, the test age effects are roughly similar between males and females, with females showing slightly larger effects in both numeracy and reading. What is much different is the size of the entry age effect. Recall that the entry age effect is a lower bound, being pulled down by a schooling effect. If this is true, it appears that females are much more negatively affected by the loss of schooling that accompanies entering school one year older. Quantitatively, entering one year older tends to reduce female test scores by about 0.068\u03c3 in numeracy and 0.052\u03c3 in reading. For males, the effects are much smaller and statistically insignificant. "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Disentangling the entry age from the test age effect is important for parental behavior and policy. Most of the existing research that estimates the relationship between age and student outcomes has not been able to separate these distinct effects. In this article I solve this identification problem by comparing the outcomes of children enrolled in B.C. schools around the time of the dual entry experiment. By decoupling entry age from test age, this policy allowed me to provide estimates of the two independent effects (but not independent of schooling) on grade repetition and test scores.\nEstimating the relevant parameters using an IV model, I reach several interesting conclusions. The first is that the upper bound test age effect is large for both grade repetition and test scores, suggesting a strong test age effect bolstered by a schooling effect. Second, I find small negative lower bound entry age effects, which are suggestive of a positive entry age effect being offset by an equally large schooling effect. Generally speaking, these results are quite similar to other European estimates that have been put forth recently. I show further that the effects of test age are different by gender, with males showing a stronger effect on grade repetition and females showing a slightly stronger effect on grade 10 reading scores. The qualitative predictions of the IV model used are robust to inclusions of a set of controls that accounts for the effects of season of birth in particular.\nHow can these results help inform parental decisions and policy? Interestingly, increasing the current school entry age from, say, five to six years of age may help students greatly if both entry and test age effects are positive, since such a policy would make students older at entry and when they are tested. Thus, had the policy not been canceled so quickly after implementation, a policy such as B.C.'s dual entry experiment may have benefited students in terms of increasing both entry age and test age. Changing the school entry structure, however, can be confusing and controversial. In fact, the major reason that B.C.'s dual entry program failed was the opposition of parents to the change away from the single-entry system. It was seen as confusing and was certainly not fully understood (see Ungerleider 2003 ). An alternative method would improve the outcomes of the youngest children without manipulating their entry ages.\nIf entry age effects are small and test age effects are large, some student outcomes can be improved if we alter the way students are tested. In most jurisdictions, all students are tested at the same time of year, creating a large variance in test age at the time of the test. As an alternative, students could be tested at the same age, which would eliminate the maturity advantage held by older students at test time. This type of policy, however, would be difficult to implement and is likely to be unpopular with parents and possibly educators. As an alternative, one might also consider age adjusting test scores to reflect the relative maturity disadvantages.\nYet another, more feasible, option would be to direct extra resources at the youngest students in a class with the intention of providing compensation for the age disadvantage they face. Examples of such investments include extra books, after-school programs, or teaching assistants that focus their attention on the younger students.\nIt is also important to keep in mind the variation in these effects across gender. Males are currently lagging behind females based on several educational outcome measures. The results of this research show that part of the reason could be that test age affects males more strongly than females. Thus, if an alternative entry age policy were to be considered, defining entry dates by gender could be a feasible option if parents were not too opposed. A slightly more feasible policy would be to pinpoint younger males and help by directing more resources toward them.\nThanks to Abigail Payne, Tom Crossley, and Phil DeCicca for many valuable discussions.
