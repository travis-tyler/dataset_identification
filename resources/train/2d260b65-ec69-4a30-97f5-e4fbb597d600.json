[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Attitude can be considered as one of the most important affective constructs in education (Osborne, Simon, & Collins, 2003) and improving a positive attitude toward scientific subjects among students is a crucial goal of science education, which plays a key role in any country's economic and technological development (TIMSS, 1999) . This is confirmed by research findings showing a positive relationship of attitude toward science and achievement, because students with a more positive attitude toward science are more likely to have sustainable learning and to continue with those subjects they enjoy (Pell & Jarvis, 2001; Else-Quest, Mineo, & Higgins, 2013) .\nAttitude generally refers to a favorable or unfavorable feeling toward something (Koballa & Warden, 1992) as well as to feelings about engaging in the behavior (Chiappetta & Koballa, 2002) . According to the International Encyclopedia of Education, science attitudes are positive or negative feelings that an individual holds about science subject (Lakshmi & Rao, 2003) . However, literature provides several definitions about this construct. For instance, Klopfer (1971) categorized a set of affective behaviors such as: the manifestation of favorable attitudes toward science and scientists; the acceptance of scientific enquiry as a way of thought; the adoption of scientific attitudes; the enjoyment of science learning experiences; the development of interests in science and science-related activities; and the development of an interest in pursuing a career in science or science related work. Then, Gardner (1975) defined attitude toward science as \u00ablearned predisposition to evaluate [\u2026] objects, people, actions, situations or propositions involved in learning science\u00bb (p. 2) and proposed a differentiation between \u00abattitudes toward science\u00bb and \u00abscientific attitudes\u00bb. Osborne et al. (2003) described further components of attitude toward science, including anxiety toward science, self-esteem, motivation, enjoyment of science, attitude of peers toward science, classroom environment, and achievement in science. Whereas, a comprehensive review by Blalock et al. (2008) categorized it into four different areas: attitude toward science, scientific attitude, the nature of science, and scientific career interests. Given the wide range of instruments published for measuring attitudes toward science from various perspectives, Weinburgh (2000) has reported an increasing trend to measure this construct over time, as well as a large number of related components which tend to add ambiguity more than clarity to the understanding of the construct (Koballa, 1988) . Therefore, as stated by Shah and Mahmood (2011) , \u00abkeeping in view the diversity of sub-constructs associated with the construct of attitude, developing a scale for measurements of attitude toward science becomes a complex task\u00bb (p. 72). In this regard, most of studies regarding attitudes toward sci-ence have considered learning as a sub-factor of the whole scales/research instruments and only few researchers specifically focused on attitude toward science learning (Shah & Mahmood, 2011) , albeit it is strongly associated with increased retention, attention to classroom instruction and academic achievement (Gasiewski et al., 2012; Narmadha & Chamundeswari, 2013) .\nBased on this premise and given the lack of similar measures in the Italian context, the present paper aims at developing and validating a brief scale specifically assessing attitude toward learning scientific subjects (such as mathematics or natural sciences) and at testing its measurement invariance across genders. Such a measure could be easy to use in the school context from teachers and educators thus providing them preliminary and quick information on student attitudes which are relevant for academic achievement. This is particularly relevant in the light of the current effort to promote student achievement and more positive attitudes toward learning within the Italian school system, especially with regard to mathematics (Argentin et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical rationale and development of the scale", "text": "In the first step of the instrument development, we examined relevant research on the issue and similar existing measures (Fraser, 1981; Parkinson et al., 1998; Renmin et al., 1998; George, 2000; Weinburgh, 2000; Nasir & Kono, 2004; Reiss, 2004) . We adopted the theoretical framework proposed by Cheung (2009) which considered three classes of observable attitudinal responses toward the attitude object: affective (feelings and emotions), cognitive (evaluative beliefs), and behavioral (action tendencies) responses. Consistently, an initial set of 12 items was developed dealing with four different domains (three item each), which were used by Cheung (2009) to assess attitude toward chemistry: (1) Liking for lessons about scientific subjects; (2) Interest in scientific work at school; (3) Evaluative beliefs about school scientific subjects; and (4) Behavioral tendencies to learn scientific subjects. Items scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale (not at all, little, somewhat, very much) , indicating students' agreement with some statements about their learning of scientific subjects. Then, a team of three experts in educational psychology rated the appropriateness of each item based on four criteria (relevance, clarity, simplicity, and ambiguity) by a 4-point scale (e.g., 1 = not relevant / clear / simple or doubtful, 2 = item needs some revision, 3 = relevant/clear/simple or no doubt but needs minor revision, 4 = very relevant / clear / simple or meaning is clear). This was in order to test the items' face validity, an estimate of the instrument's ease of use, clarity, and readability. Each item was given four different ratings. Item Content Validity Index was then computed as the percentage of experts that approved the item and gave it a score of 3 or 4. The researchers discarded the items which did not score over 0.75 for each criterium (Martuza, 1977) , and only the item with the highest score for each domain was retained. The result was a four item scale, reported as follows: 1. I like attend lessons about scientific subjects (Liking for lessons); 2. There should be more hours of scientific subjects at school (Interest in school work); 3. Scientific subjects are the most interesting ones (Evaluative belief ); 4. I would like to learn more about scientific subjects (Behavioral tendency)."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The sample of this study comprised 18,436 students attending middle schools at 7th grade.\nIn detail, boys were 51% while girls were 49%, mostly aged from 11 to 13 years (M = 11.93, SD = 0.42).

This perception can be seen as a cognitive evaluation of the abilities to accomplish certain tasks. According to the hierarchical self-concept model of Marsh and Shavelson (1985) , students' academic self-concept is a subcomponent within a model where general self-concept is at the top of the hierarchy. In this study, math academic self-concept was measured on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from \u00abstrongly disagree\u00bb to \u00abstrongly agree\u00bb.

They were requested to express their level of agreement with some statements on a 4-point Likert scale, adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) by Pintrich and De Groot (1990) and then specifically validated in the Italian context (Poliandri et al., 2011) .

Skewness and kurtosis values between -1 and +1 were assumed to indicate an acceptable range to prove normal univariate distribution (Peat & Barton, 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Construct validity", "text": "To test construct validity, the total sample (n = 18,436) was divided into two groups by using the odd-even split method: Group A (n = 9,218) and Group B (n = 9,218). Group A was used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to establish the factor structure, and Group B was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure of the scale found in Group A. EFA with a maximum likelihood (ML) was performed to extract underlying common variance among items. In this regard, several researchers and statistical practitioners advocate the use of ML over other methods because of its sensitivity to model misspecification, which may reduce type II error rates (Olsson et al., 2000) . Direct oblimin rotation was then used with the aim of obtaining simple structure and considering best results. Because it assumes the factors to be correlated, it is worth testing the oblique rotation that is psychometrically apt for the data. Each item was included in a specific factor if there was a minimal factor loading of 0.4, while to determine how many factors should be retained, two main criteria were used (Fabrigar et al., 1999) :\n\u2022 The Kaiser criterion to select those factors that have an eigenvalue > 1.\nBecause this criterion could misrepresent the most appropriate number of factors, we also calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for the eigenvalues; \u2022 Parallel analysis, a method based on the generation of random variables, to determine the number of factors to retain. In this procedure, eigenvalues extracted from experimental data (i.e., values forming a standard scree plot) are plotted against those extracted from randomly generated data.\nComponents with eigenvalues exceeding those extracted from the random data are considered for retention. For this study, 100 randomly generated data sets equal in size to the experimental data were constructed. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Test of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) was computed, as a measure of the shared variance in the items. Values between 0.7 and 0.8 are considered as good and values between 0.8 and 0.9 are considered as excellent (Hutcheson & Sofroniou, 1999) . Whereas, anti-image correlations higher than 0.5 are regarded as acceptable (Field, 2013) .\nIn performing the CFA on the second sub-sample, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method was used for the current model, because there was no violation of the multivariate normality assumption in terms of skewness (M = -.16, SD = .26, ranging from -.37 to .22) and kurtosis (M = -.68, SD = .14, ranging from -.85 to -.52). Different components of fit were evaluated (Hu & Bentler, 1995) , because it is generally recommended that multiple measures be considered to highlight different aspects of fit (Tanaka, 1993) . As a stand-alone measure of fit, chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) is known to reject trivially misspecified models estimated on large sample sizes (Hu & Bentler, 1995) ; therefore, the \u03c7 2 ratio (\u03c7 2 /degrees of freedom [df ]) was used to evaluate stand-alone models. This index tends to be less sensitive to sample size, and values less than 3 (or in some instances 5) are often taken to indicate acceptable models (Kline, 2010) . We also evaluated model fit using the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Smaller \u03c7 2 , AIC, and BIC values correspond to better fitting models (Schumacker & Lomax, 2010 "}, {"section_title": "Measurement invariance", "text": "To test the measurement invariance across gender groups, a multi-group CFA was conducted. The test assumption of measurement invariance is that the construct being measured is the same in different groups; as well, the invariance can be examined at multiple levels (configural, metric, scalar). To test the model fit for the structure of the scale across gender groups, we used the same goodness of fit indexes presented above. To test whether the measurement invariance across gender groups holds, we used the change for CFI and RMSEA (\u0394CFI and \u0394RMSEA) as indexes used in previous studies (Gardner & Qualter, 2011; Irwing, 2012) .\nWe used decline in model fit at a given stage of the analysis as an indication that the assumptions of invariance do not hold in the constrained parameters (French & Finch, 2006) . Cheung and Rensvold (2002) recommended that the changes lower than or equal to .01 for CFI and RMSEA indicate that invariance holds.

With regard to the prospective choice of higher education, a single item was used which examined students' preferences for the type of secondary school they were going to attend in the future, including lycei (classic, scientific, linguistic, human sciences, artistic, music and dance), technical institutes (economic, technological) and professional institutes (services, industry and handicrafts).\nConsistently with the theoretical framework (Osborne, Simon, & Collins, 2003; Lavonen et al., 2008) , students choosing future scientific education (in our case, scientific lyceum 3 ) were expected to score higher on ATLoSS compared with other groups."}, {"section_title": "Reliability", "text": "ATLoSS was examined to assess the reliability of test scores.

Parallel analysis confirmed that one factor should be retained because only the first eigenvalue (equal to 2.84) from our actual data set exceeded the 95th percentile of eigenvalues derived from random data sets (CI = 0.99, 1.05). Therefore, the results of this EFA was not rotated. The KMO of 0.82 verified the sampling adequacy for the EFA.

To test the hypothetical structure of the scale extracted from EFA, a CFA with ML estimation was used on the second half of the sample (n = 9,218). The CFA confirmed the one-factor solution of the scale and indicated that the proposed model provided a good fit to the data according to the standards by Hu and Bentler (1995) .

The factor loadings were .77 (item 1), .82 (item 2), .82 (item 3) and .68 (item 4).

The first step included the formulation of 12 items consistently with Cheung's framework (2009), which covers four different domains: (1) Liking for lessons about scientific subjects; (2) Interest in scientific work at school; (3) Evaluative beliefs about school scientific subjects; and (4) Behavioral tendencies to learn scientific subjects. Face validity was tested and allowed the retention of four items which reflected the content of the original item pool. An initial EFA showed a one-factor solution and next CFAs confirmed good fit indexes for construct validity and measurement invariance (configural, metrical, scalar) across genders. The scale had high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .864).\nConcerning convergent and discriminant validity, higher ATLoSS scores were associated with math academic self-concept and interest/enjoyment in math, as confirmed by previous research on attitudes toward scientific school subjects (Osborne, Simon, & Collins, 2003; Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014) . Besides, a statistically significant but not meaningful negative correlation was detected between test anxiety and attitude toward learning of scientific subjects; therefore, such a correlation cannot be taken into account and consistently discussed.\nCriterion-related validity was also confirmed because the scale succeeded in differentiating higher and lower performing students, based on both marks in math (teacher evaluation) and test of math competence (standardized assessment). Besides, students who chose scientific education as preference for secondary school showed higher ATLoSS scores compared to students who indicated other preferences, thus suggesting a potential predictive power of ATLoSS which could be further examined in future research in educational guidance.\nSome limitations of the study need to be acknowledged: the limited content focus of the scale does not consent to grasp the complex and multifaceted nature of students' attitudes toward scientific subjects, such as the development of an interest in pursuing a career in science or science related work. In addition, the lack of measures on science-related attitude or competence/achievement in the present study does not consent to provide exhaustive evidence about convergent validity of this scale with other scientific school subjects different from mathematics.\nHowever, the ATLoSS scale seems to be a valid and reliable measure which can provide relevant implications for both research and practice, consistently with the general recommendations on large scale assessments in science education (Britton & Schneider, 2007) . It represents a brief and easy instrument which can be used in large scale student assessments, also through online surveys. Besides, teachers and educators can be provided with preliminary and quick information on their students' attitudes which are relevant for academic achievement. In this sense, ATLoSS can serves as an initial screening tool for detecting students who might not benefit from scientific education in order to promote their sustainable learning. Given the association found between ATLoSS scores and academic achievement, this scale could -along with other measures -help differentiate among students who are low performing in school scientific subjects those who show less positive attitudes. In this sense, ATLoSS can serve as an important instrument to monitor the quality of teaching and the educational relationship with the class, so as to promote more involving activities based on real-life situations in scientific education. The relevance of attitudes toward scientific subjects can also be advocated in the light of the intercultural and interethnic contact between immigrant students and autochthone students, which often characterizes the multilingual environments within the Italian schools. Indeed, the cross-cultural nature of scientific education has rich implications for developing new orientations to students' difficulties, because it leads to the examination of new contributory factors and different pathways (Hawkins & Pea, 1987) . Scientific learningespecially in mathematics -can be conceived as intercultural because it relies on an independent language and a shared formal thinking, which have to be acquired explicitly in order to be able to understand and actively use them (Prediger, 2001) . Therefore, scientific subjects may symbolically represent a bridge between different cultures within formal learning contexts, as in the case of foreign language. In this regard, previous research has demonstrated that foreign language learning may reduce children's ethnic prejudices and favor processes of social integration (Pirchio et al., 2017) . As well, family foreign language learning creates a positive attitude toward multilingualism, thus developing better contextual conditions for multilingual education (Pirchio et al., 2015) . From this perspective, future studies could explore the potential contribution of attitude toward scientific subjects to the development of more collaborative and inclusive learning environments (Caputo & Langher, 2015; Langher et al., 2016; Langher, Caputo, & Ricci, 2017) , also in the light of the association between students' perception of school climate and math achievement (Caputo, 2013) ."}]
