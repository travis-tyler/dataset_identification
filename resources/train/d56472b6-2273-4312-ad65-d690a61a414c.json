[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Although the share of all 3-and 4-year-old children enrolled in center-based care and early education has grown steadily in recent decades, rates of enrollment for children from low-income families still lag behind those for children from families with high incomes. During the 1990s, growing public funding for compensatory preschool education and means-tested child-care assistance had the potential to increase the availability of free or low-cost formal child-care arrangements and thus the attendance of low-income children. This article analyzes repeated cross-sectional data on formal child-care attendance from the October Current Population Survey as well as data on state-level funding. The results indicate that increases in public funding are positively associated with the probability that low-income young children attended formal care. These results also suggest that gaps in formal care between low-and high-income families would have widened in the absence of public investments."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "to be in center-based care arrangements (Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics 2003; Meyers et al. 2004 ).\nChildren's cognitive abilities are also very unequal by the time they start school. For example, data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, indicate that low-income children score lower than more affluent children on four dimensions of school readiness: cognitive skills and knowledge, social skills, physical health and well-being, and approaches to learning (West, Denton, and Germino-Hausken 2000; Lee and Burkam 2002) . Moreover, early disparities in academic outcomes are likely to persist into later childhood and adolescence (Caneiro and Heckman 2003) .\nSorting out the causes of educational disparities is a complex task. Nevertheless, research suggests that differential exposure to high-quality center-based care and early education may be one contributing factor. A large body of evidence demonstrates that children who attend these programs enter school with better academic skills than children who have not attended such programs (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000; Smolensky and Gootman 2003) . Moreover, low-income children and children whose parents have low levels of education experience the largest and most lasting benefits from attending center-based care and early education programs (Karoly et al. 1998; Currie 2001; Magnuson et al. 2004) . Disparities in children's exposure to educationally enriching early care are particularly worrisome, given this evidence. Compared to children in higher-income, and better-educated families, children in lower-income and less well-educated families may be doubly disadvantaged by living in less educationally stimulating homes and having less access to educationally enhancing early child care. This compounded disadvantage in early childhood may have lasting effects on social and economic opportunities later in life (Caneiro and Heckman 2003) .\nIn response to increased demand among working mothers for highquality child care and as a result of a growing recognition that centerbased care and early education programs prepare children for formal schooling, federal and state governments have expanded funding for compensatory early education programs and for means-tested child-care subsidies. It is not known whether or to what extent this expansion has increased the enrollment of low-income children in educationally enriching programs. Whereas Head Start monies can only be used to provide early education for low-income children, means-tested childcare subsidies may be used for many types of child care, and some features of subsidy programs (e.g., high copayments) may discourage parents from using formal care arrangements .\nThis article explores the effects of public funding on formal childcare enrollment. The analyses use repeated cross-sectional measures from 1992 to 2000 of enrollment in center-based child care and early education. Throughout the article, both of these will be referred to as formal child care.\n1 Results suggest that expansions in public funding increased the likelihood that low-income children were enrolled in some type of formal care. The magnitude of the association suggests that nearly half of the increase in enrollment in formal child care among low-income children during this time may be attributed to the expansions in public funding. Although income-related enrollment disparities persist, the findings suggest that income-related gaps in early education would probably have been larger in the absence of the funding increases."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The proportion of young children experiencing center-based child care and early education has risen dramatically in the recent past (Bainbridge et al. 2005) . This rise in formal care was driven both by an increase in maternal employment, particularly among mothers with young children, and by an increased emphasis on the importance of early learning.\nParents with young children choose nonparental care arrangements from an array of informal and formal care programs. Informal care is often provided by nannies, neighbors, and relatives. Formal care may be provided by schools, as well as by for-profit and nonprofit providers of early education and child care. Although early education programs presumably differ from center-based child care in the extent to which early learning is emphasized by program staff and perhaps in the hours of operation, the distinction between these types of programs is increasingly blurred. Many programs of both types now address the dual goals of supporting working families and providing enriching learning environments. Early education programs often offer extended hours to provide wrap-around child care (i.e., care offered before or after preschool sessions), and child-care centers use early learning curricula (Adams and Rohacek 2002) .\nParents face a complex array of child-care and early education choices as they try to balance competing concerns. Thus, it is not surprising that their decisions are influenced by several factors, including personal preferences, family structure, employment, and the local availability of formal and informal care providers (Singer et al. 1998; Pungello and Kurtz-Costes 1999; Huston, Chang, and Gennetian 2002; Meyers and Jordan 2006) . The cost of formal care and families' economic resources are particularly important influences on families' care choices. With the cost of full-time private preschool or center-based care during the 1990s averaging $4,000-$6,000 per year, center-based child-care and early education arrangements were prohibitively expensive for many low-income families, as such costs would often consume as much as one-quarter of their income Rosenbaum and Ruhm 2005) . The high price of formal child care depresses both maternal employment and the use of this type of care, particularly among low-income, low-skilled, and single mothers (Hofferth and Wissoker 1992; Anderson and Levine 2000; Blau 2001 ). The costs of private early education programs are equally high, and the availability of publicly funded early education programs is limited. Many low-income parents may thus be priced out of such programs (Smolensky and Gootman 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Child-Care Policies", "text": "The United States addresses income-related disparities in early education and in child-care enrollment through two parallel policies: compensatory early education programs and means-tested child-care-assistance programs.\n2 Federal and state investments in both areas grew substantially in recent years, although such programs continue to serve only a portion of low-income children (Smolensky and Gootman 2003) .\nCompensatory early education programs are most explicitly targeted at reducing inequality in early education. These programs aim to increase school readiness and decrease human capital deficits by providing early education services to 3-and 4-year-old Butler and Gish 2003) .\nSome states and local school districts now fund early education programs, which are often called prekindergarten programs. State funding for prekindergarten increased during the 1990s to reach about $1.9 billion in 2000, and recent estimates suggest that 17 percent of 4-year-olds are enrolled in prekindergarten programs (Barnett et al. 2005) . These programs vary in the amount and types of early education they provide. Most states provide part-day services to children who, based on their family or community characteristics, are deemed in need of early education. Some states subcontract with existing early education providers; others deliver services within public school settings. State prekindergarten initiatives are not intended to supplant Head Start services, and during the 1990s, the bulk of state investments in prekindergarten was concentrated in just a few states .\nThe second track in U.S. policy, means-tested child-care assistance, reduces the cost of nonparental care for low-income families by subsidizing private, market-based child care. Subsidies are provided for all types of care, including center-based care, early education programs, and informal care by family child-care providers, friends, relatives, and babysitters. The federal government currently funds means-tested childcare assistance through three block grants to the states. These funds are used to assist families by directly paying private providers or (more commonly) through vouchers issued to reimburse private providers or parents (Smolensky and Gootman 2003) . States contribute their own funding through maintenance of effort (MOE) expenditures (i.e., expenditures that states are required to make in order to continue to receive federal funding at the same level as they have in previous years), and some states choose to further supplement federal monies.\nFederal and state funding for means-tested child-care assistance has grown sharply in recent years as a result of welfare reform. The single largest federal block grant is the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which was established in 1996 to replace and consolidate several prior child-care funding programs . Currently, states can use CCDF funds to serve families with incomes up to 85 percent of the state median income (although many states set a lower threshold). Parents must be working or in school to qualify for assistance. States must offer parents a choice of care types and providers but are free to set parental copayment and provider reimbursement rates as well as procedures for establishing and recertifying eligibility.\nThe second major current funding stream for means-tested child-care assistance is the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program in 1996. States may transfer up to 30 percent of their TANF funds to CCDF; about half the states currently commit some TANF funds to CCDF (Gish 2002) . States can also use TANF funds to subsidize child care directly (largely through vouchers). These funds typically assist welfare-reliant families in which the parent is working, in education, or in training, as well as former welfare recipients who are now employed. 3 The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is the third and smallest source of federal child-care assistance for poor families. In 1999, approximately 13 percent of SSBG funds were used for child-care services or vouchers (Gish 2002) .\nState and federal funding for child-care subsidies increased dramatically during the 1990s, from a combined total of $1.7 billion in 1992 to $9.5 billion in 2000 (Gish 2002 ). Federal investments eclipse state funding. Combined spending for the three block grants (CCDF, TANF, and SSBG) approached $7 billion in 2000, constituting 42 percent of all federal investment in early childhood care and education (Gish 2002) .\nAlthough federal and state funding is provided through distinct funding streams, these funds may be pooled in several ways. Some states combine all of their funding for means-tested child-care subsidies into a single delivery system. Local program providers may use multiple fund-ing streams in order to offer full-day services, including early education, child care, and wrap-around care (Witte and Trowbridge 2004) . Parents may rely on multiple forms of assistance to offset the costs of their care arrangements )."}, {"section_title": "Child-Care Policy and Enrollment in Formal Care", "text": "If high prices discourage low-income families from accessing formal care, the expansion of means-tested assistance during the 1990s should have enabled more low-income parents to enroll their young children in formal care. Because low-income parents are often priced out of formal care, it is not surprising that the use of formal care increases when policies lower the costs of child care (Blau and Hagy 1998; Blau 2001; Michalopoulos and Robins 2002; Powell 2002) . However, the specific associations between the availability of public child-care assistance and the care arrangements of low-income children are not well understood.\nEstimating the effects of subsidy receipt is complicated because it may be endogenous to both employment decisions and child-care arrangements. As a result, in a small number of cross-sectional studies, researchers model child-care arrangements and maternal employment as jointly determined decisions, examining the extent to which access to subsidies promotes maternal employment in combination with particular types of care (Blau and Hagy 1998; Michalopoulos and Robins 2000; Powell 2002; Tekin 2004 ). In addition, these studies typically rely on some form of exogenous variation in access to subsidies, often state or local policies, to proxy for subsidy use. For example, Erdal Tekin (2004) predicts subsidy receipt with state-level data on the number of children who receive child-care subsidies and CCDF funding. He finds that receiving subsidies predicts the use of formal child care among low-income single mothers with young children. Subsidy receipt increases the probability of combining maternal employment with center-based care by 33 percent but has less effect on the likelihood of combining employment with informal sources of care.\nAnother set of studies relies on experimental welfare-to-work programs, some of which offered enhanced child-care assistance, as a source of exogenous variation in access to child-care support (Crosby, Gennetian, and Huston 2005 ; see also Fuller et al. 2002) . In a review of several experimental studies, Danielle Crosby and colleagues (2005) find that a 7 percentage point increase in the use of formal child care among 3-5-year-olds can be attributed to enhanced child-care assistance policies. Enhanced assistance, however, is broadly defined in these studies to include not only more generous subsidies but also resource and referral services as well as direct payments to providers. Thus, the increased use of center care among welfare populations cannot simply be attributed to increased funding for child-care subsidies.\nPrior research suggests that the expansion of means-tested compensatory education and child-care subsidies during the 1990s should increase the probability that low-income children experienced formal care, but research provides little guidance as to the relative magnitude of the associations. The expansion of compensatory education programs, such as Head Start, is likely to have the largest direct effect on formal care enrollment by expanding the supply of low-cost or free preschool slots for low-income children. The expansion of CCDF, TANF, and SSBG funding for child-care assistance is also expected to increase the participation of low-income children in formal care, as it reduces the cost of such care for parents. The potential positive effects of expanded public funding, however, may be tempered by several complicating factors.\nFirst, a portion of the expanded funding may have been spent to increase the quality of programs and the hours that children are served rather than to enroll additional children in formal care. These considerations may be particularly relevant for Head Start. Since 1992, 25 percent of the increases in Head Start funding was earmarked for quality improvement; funds may also be used to provide extended hours of care or full-day programs rather than to enroll additional children (Butler and Gish 2003; Besharov and Higney 2006) . Second, expanded funding for unconstrained child-care subsidies (i.e., those subsidies that permit parents to use any type of care) may increase the overall use of nonparental care but have limited effects on the use of formal care because parents may use the subsidies to pay for informal care by family, friends, and family child-care providers, as well as for center-based care and early education programs. The effects of child-care-assistance expenditures on formal care enrollment may also be influenced by state child-care policies and administrative processes that govern eligibility, application procedures, family copayment rates, and provider reimbursement (Adams, Snyder, and Sandfort 2002; Fuller et al. 2002; Meyers, Heintze, and Wolf 2002; Gennetian et al. 2004) . For example, low provider-reimbursement rates may depress parents' use of formal care by limiting the supply of center-based child-care and early education programs willing to accept subsidies. High copayments may divert parents away from expensive modes of care, such as preschools. Local agency intake, application, and referral procedures may also affect parents' knowledge and choice of care arrangements; if state officials and agency staff seek to stretch available dollars to cover as many recipients as possible, they may encourage families to use types of care that are less expensive than formal child-care programs.\nThird, the extent to which additional public funding increases the percentage of children who experience formal child care also depends on the extent to which low-and no-cost alternatives are substituted for already existing formal care arrangements. If low-income parents are entirely priced out of formal care, the availability of subsidized preschool slots and means-tested vouchers could lead them to substitute formal care for parental care or other informal arrangements. However, in the absence of subsidized care, low-income parents might be able to arrange for some type of formal care by, for example, using public school-based prekindergarten or negotiating the price with the provider. In this situation, the availability of free or low-cost alternatives might shift children between preschool settings, offset the costs of existing arrangements, or increase the amount of time children spend in formal care, but such availability would not increase the proportion of children who experience formal care.\nFinally, the extent to which expanded funding for child care promotes children's enrollment in formal child care also depends on the characteristics of the families and children who gain access to child-care assistance and early education programs. Prior research suggests that the employment and child-care decisions of single mothers are more sensitive to child-care prices than are the decisions of their married counterparts. Married mothers tend to have more resources available to pay for care and may also rely on a partner to provide some hours of care (Anderson and Levine 2000) . Thus, increased child-care funding might have a greater effect on formal child-care enrollment among single-mother families than it does on such enrollment among marriedcouple families. The effects of funding expansions on enrollment may also vary with child age. Throughout the 1990s, enrollment rates in formal care were markedly higher for 4-year-olds than for 3-year-olds. This difference perhaps reflects the greater availability of low-cost programs, such as prekindergarten, for 4-year-olds (Bainbridge et al. 2005) . Consequently, increases in early education and child-care funding during the 1990s may have a larger effect on the probability of formal care enrollment among 3-year-olds than among 4-year-olds."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Prior research suggests that the large increase in public funding for compensatory education programs and means-tested subsidies in the 1990s may have increased low-income families' use of child care, particularly of formal care in child-care centers or early education programs. To date, the size of this effect has not been empirically estimated, perhaps in part because doing so is difficult. States do not collect comparable data over time on formal care enrollment or program quality. In addition, few studies with large and nationally representative samples track young children's experiences in formal care. Most studies that collected detailed information from parents about early education and child-care arrangements were fielded only at one or two time points during the 1990s. The only study that repeatedly surveyed parents about early education and formal center-based care programs is the U.S. Census Bureau's annual October CPS, which includes basic questions about the enrollment of 3-and 4-year-old children in school or school-like arrangements.\nThe analyses in this article make use of repeated cross-sectional data from the annual October CPS (from 1992 to 2000) to examine whether and to what extent increases in public spending for compensatory education programs and means-tested child-care assistance predict increases in low-income children's participation in formal care. With rates of enrollment in center-based child care and early education increasing among low-income children, to what extent do increases in Head Start and child-care funding explain these increased levels of enrollment? Do effects differ according to children's ages or their mother's marital status?"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The annual October CPS collects demographic information from parents and also includes an education module that surveys parents about the school attendance of 3-and 4-year-olds. It has been fielded annually since 1968. For the analyses, these CPS microdata are combined with state-level information on child-care and Head Start expenditures, the two largest sources of public funding for early education and child care, as well as with data on other state demographic, political, and policy factors. Some analyses also make use of estimated state prekindergarten expenditures. The sample is limited to families surveyed in the CPS between 1992 and 2000, because these are the years for which consistent and reliable data about child-care and early education funding are available. The sample is also limited to families from relatively large states, since the data from smaller states may not provide reliable information on trends in preschool enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Formal Care", "text": "The outcome measure is the enrollment of 3-or 4-year-old children in formal child care. The October CPS tracks school enrollment by asking respondents whether children age 3 and older attend school. A child is coded as being in formal care if the child's parent answered affirmatively to this question. Thus, in this article, the term \"formal care\" refers to any program that the respondent identifies as a school."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "To explore whether the CPS measure of school enrollment results in similar information as measures of formal child care used in other surveys, it is useful to compare the 1999 October CPS data with detailed data from the National Household Education Survey (NHES) for 1999, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) for 1998, and the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF) for 1999. These comparisons indicate that the measure of school enrollment in the October CPS is similar to measures in other studies that include center-based care, Head Start, nursery school, and prekindergarten. For example, the NHES estimates of the proportions of 3-and 4-year-olds attending center-based care in 1999 (46 percent for 3-year-olds and 70 percent for 4-year-olds) are quite similar to the October CPS estimates of children's school attendance for that year (40 percent and 68 percent, respectively; authors' calculations). The NHES definition of centerbased care includes day-care centers, nursery schools, prekindergartens, preschools, and Head Start programs. An analysis of the ECLS-K data also yields comparable estimates for 4-year-olds' attendance in center-based care and Head Start (69 percent) in 1997 (authors' calculations). With respect to 3-year-olds, findings from the NSAF parallel those from other sources (38 percent attend center-based care), but rates of enrollment for 4-year-olds are slightly lower (61 percent; authors' calculations). The NSAF definition of center-based care includes school, prekindergarten, preschool, day-care centers, and Head Start. The NSAF's lower enrollment rates for 4-year-olds probably reflect a discrepancy in the timing of the assessment. The NSAF was administered throughout the year, and thus some respondents were surveyed during the summer months when educational programs may not have been in session. In sum, the CPS measure used here is likely to capture nearly all forms of center-based care and early education. It also seems likely that parents in the CPS do not identify informal child care and family child care as school, even when such care is licensed. 5 Thus, although the annual October CPS differs from other studies by asking about school rather than nonparental care arrangements, this measure yields similar information about children's participation in center-based care and early education programs. This article describes both types of programs as formal child care.\nIt is important to note one question change in the annual October CPS. Prior to 1994, parents were asked, \"Does your child attend regular school?\" In 1994, the CPS added a prompt to clarify that \"regular school includes nursery school, kindergarten, or elementary school and schooling which leads to a high school diploma.\" The addition of this prompt might influence reported enrollment rates. This is handled in these analyses by including year fixed effects. Trends in enrollment for children from low-and higher-income families in the sample are provided in table 1."}, {"section_title": "Income", "text": "The October CPS collects categorical income data by asking respondents which income range represents the total combined income of all members of the family residing in the household during the preceding 12 Note.-NA p not applicable.

Because of inflation, income categories are not strictly comparable across years. As a result, in these analyses, children are classified into income quartiles for families in households with young children of ages 3 and 4. If the rank order from rich to poor is roughly correct in each year, low-income families (the bottom quartile, representing the lowest 25 percent of family incomes) can be reliably distinguished from higher-income families (the top three quartiles, representing the highest 75 percent of family incomes). The analyses also include year dummy variables, which will correct for any changes in the composition of the low-income sample over time.\nFrom 1992 to 1995, families in the lowest quartile reported family household incomes less than $15,000; from 1996 to 1998, these families had incomes of less than $20,000; in 1999 and 2000, they had incomes of less than $25,000. This categorization of low income roughly captures the proportion of families that may be eligible for child-care assistance by the end of the 1990s. In 2000, the average state income eligibility threshold was 59 percent of a state's median income. This threshold is about $24,869 if the national median income is used as the base (U.S. Census Bureau 2003). This categorization also is consistent with the percentage of young children who were living in poverty in the early and mid-1990s (approximately 23-24 percent). By the late 1990s, poverty rates among young children declined to under 20 percent (USDHHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 2001). Thus, the lowest income category is not as consistent with the share of children in poverty in the later years. For example, in 2000, the poverty threshold was $13,874 for a family consisting of a single parent with two children; it was $17,463 for two parents and two children (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a)."}, {"section_title": "Control Variables", "text": "Child and family characteristics are included in the analyses as covariates to control for other factors that may affect enrollment in center-based care and early education.

Thus, children's records were matched to those of their parents in order to obtain more detailed family household information.\nThe child and family household covariates include dichotomous measures of child and family characteristics that prior research suggests influence parents' choice of care arrangements.

Thus, the total amount of Head Start spending exceeds federal funding. The fiscal year for Head Start begins in September, reflecting its adherence to a schoolyear calendar. Hence, children's enrollment in center-based care and early education in October is linked to funding from the prior month and throughout the remainder of the school year.\nAll funding measures, including those for child-care subsidies and Head Start, are adjusted for inflation (using the consumer price index) and for the number of poor children under age 13 in the state (using numbers calculated from the U.S. Census Bureau's annual March CPS). 8 In addition, spending measures are scaled in $100 increments.\nIn most analyses, all sources of funding are combined into a measure of total early education and child-care funding.

Results from three specifications are presented. Predictors in the first model include total funding, child and family characteristics, and a set of year and state dummy variables. The second model adds a set of state characteristics. The third model adds an interaction term (low income by total funding) to test if the estimated difference in the effects of funding for low-and higher-income children is statistically significant.\nAdditional models are estimated to determine how robust the findings are to alternative specifications, such as including a measure of prekindergarten funding and changing the years from which the sample is drawn. Finally, to explore whether spending has differential effects depending on children's age and their mother's marital status, interaction terms (age 4 by spending and married by spending) are included in the regression analyses. As discussed earlier, there may be age differences, such that the enrollment of 3-year-olds was more strongly affected by expenditures, given the higher enrollment levels and much wider availability of low-cost programs (including prekindergarten programs) for 4-year-olds. Differences by marital status are also possible. Compared with married mothers, single-mother families may be more sensitive to child-care costs and also more strongly affected by expansions in child-care subsidies related to welfare reform (although these subsidies would have been available to all low-income families, regardless of marital status).\nAn advantage of using the CPS microdata is that they include measures of important child and family household characteristics (such as the child's race or ethnicity), which may be related to early education enrollment. Including these variables should help to remove any spurious correlations that may result from changing sample characteristics and from changes in early education funding.\nOne puzzle is how to handle maternal employment and family household income. If increasing rates of maternal employment or rising family incomes are driving both increases in public expenditures as well as families' use of formal child care, then to isolate the effects of state funding, these confounds should be controlled. However, some (e.g., Powell 1997) argue that maternal employment and child-care decisions are jointly determined, in which case controlling for maternal employment is inappropriate. Although this joint determination is less likely to affect decisions related to early education than decisions related to other types of child care, this consideration nevertheless suggests that neither income nor employment should be included as controls.\nThe analyses undertaken for this article are conservative in that they include a dichotomous measure of maternal employment. The measure of household income is excluded because inflation makes the categories incomparable over time and because the models include a control for maternal education, which is highly correlated with family household income. Nevertheless, results are not sensitive to the exclusion of maternal employment or the inclusion of a set of income dummy variables (for the categorical levels of family income).\nThe use of state and year fixed effects is particularly important in this analysis. States with high levels of funding for child care and early education may differ in unobserved ways from states with low levels of funding, and this unobserved heterogeneity may bias estimates. By using state fixed effects, the analyses remove any bias due to persistent unobserved differences across states. Year fixed effects remove bias from trends that are common across states and that are due to unobserved events, including changes in the composition of the low-income pop-ulation. Thus, the analysis capitalizes on the large increases in statelevel expenditures by identifying the effects of changes in funding on formal enrollment within states over time.\nState and year fixed effects do not control for state characteristics that change over time, and thus, the inclusion of measured state characteristics is also central to the estimation strategy. Because the vast majority of the funding for Head Start and means-tested child-care subsidies comes from the federal government and because increases in spending on early education and child care are largely due to increased federal appropriations, it seems unlikely that changes in state characteristics are correlated with changes in the per child spending measures.\nIn the period under study, most increases in expenditures for childcare assistance were allocated based on a formula that considered both prior levels of funding and the need for assistance (as proxied by the number of children living in low-income families). In the case of CCDF, a state's federal guaranteed funds are fixed. The amount is based on prior levels of child-care assistance spending under the AFDC program. Federal mandatory (MOE) matching funds are based on the relative share of children under age 13. Disbursements of federal discretionary funds are based on the share of children under age 5, the share receiving free or reduced-price school lunch, and the state's per capita income (Gish 2002) . Prior to the establishment of the CCDF in 1996, discretionary matching funds for child-care assistance were allocated to states using the same three factors. In the case of Head Start, additional funds are allocated across states in proportion to the number of poor children in each state (Butler and Gish 2003; Besharov and Higney 2006) . Consequently, spending estimates are adjusted for the number of poor children under age 13, and the analyses include variables that proxy for related state characteristics. These variables include the poverty rate among children under age 6 and the log of the state's per capita median income.\nOther state characteristics are included to capture broad demographic shifts that might be related to public funding for child care and early education and to enrollment in formal care. These variables include the proportion of the state population that consists of women over age 16, the proportion that is black, the proportion that is elderly, and indicators of the political climate (the proportions of the state's house and senate that are Republican). In addition, state policy measures are included as covariates to capture changes in welfare policy during the 1990s.\nAnalyses ideally would include all state characteristics that are spuriously rather than causally correlated with formal care participation. However, it is difficult to determine which characteristics and demographic trends are exogenous. To the extent that state characteristics included in the models have some direct effects on spending, the models may overcon-trol for state factors and bias the estimates of spending downwards. For example, if an increase in the female population over age 16 is linked to increases in formal care because that group effectively advocates for public funding for early education, then models controlling for this variable may underestimate the effects of public funding. If, however, an increase in the population of women over age 16 is also linked to the supply of formal care programs, then omitting this variable from the analyses may result in overstating the effects of spending. Consequently, results are presented from models with and without covariates. This approach places some bounds on the range of possible effects.\nFixed effects methods compare children within a state over time. One concern is having sufficient numbers of observations within a state during each year. Small numbers of observations in a state for a particular year will lead to measurement error. In the analyses for low-income children, sample sizes in some states for some years are very low.\n11 In order to reduce the possibility that associations will be obscured by small sample sizes, the sample is limited to children residing in states in which at least 15 low-income children were observed during at least 2 years. Imposing these criteria reduces the sample from 35,032 to 21,598 and limits the sample to children residing in 26 of the 50 states (see table A2 in the appendix for details on the composition of the sample). 12 "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Trends in funding (presented in table 1) suggest that, for the most part, levels of early childhood education and care funding have increased steadily. 13 Total federal funding for early education and care (per poor child under age 13) appears to have nearly tripled. Prior to 1996, per child funding increased at a roughly similar rate for both child-care subsidies and Head Start. Beginning in 1997, however, funding for childcare subsidies grew at a higher rate than funding for Head Start. Subsidy funding accounted for about one-half of total funding in 1992 but for over two-thirds by 2000.\nMean levels of formal care enrollment also show strong upward trends from 1992 to 2000 among both low-income and higher-income children (table 1) , although year-to-year changes in enrollment and funding are not always positive. Low-income children remain less likely than their higher-income peers to be enrolled in formal care. However, the gains in enrollment over this period appear larger for low-income children than for their higher-income counterparts (over 16 percentage points compared with 8 percentage points).\n14 Because of the eligibility guidelines, early education and care funding should be positively associated with low-income children's enrollment in formal care but should not be associated with the enrollment of higher-income children. The large increase in early education and care funding, coupled with a relatively Note.- Table shows marginal effects and standard errors from probit regression models. Models 1 and 2 contain a full set of child and family covariates listed in table 2, as well as state and year fixed effects. Model 2 also contains the full set of state characteristics and welfare policy variables listed in table 2. Low income refers to families with incomes in the bottom 25% of the distribution for family incomes in the sample; higher income refers to families with incomes in the remaining 75% of the distribution. * . p \u2264 .05 ** . p \u2264 .01 large increase in enrollment among low-income children, provides preliminary evidence that public funding might have promoted enrollment in formal care for low-income children.\nMultivariate regressions are estimated separately for the low-and higher-income children in the sample. The first four columns of table 3 present results from analyses regarding low-income children. The last four columns present results from analyses regarding higher-income children. Findings suggest that public funding for formal care is positively and significantly associated with low-income children's enrollment. An additional $100 of funding per poor child under age 13 is associated with an increase in the enrollment rate in formal care of more than 1 percentage point (from the base rate of 41 percent). 15 Public funding increased by about $800 per child from 1992 to 2000. This suggests that funding expansions may account for 9.6 of the 16 percentage point gain in low-income children's enrollment in formal child care.\nResults from model 2 suggest that the effect of state spending is slightly larger when state characteristics are taken into account. The estimated effect from model 2 translates into a 1.8 percentage point increase in enrollment per $100 increase in early education funding. 16 Given the size of the funding increase, this estimate indicates that expansions in public funding for formal care might account for as much as 14 of the 16 percentage point enrollment gain among low-income children from 1992 to 2000.\nIn addition, results in model 2 indicate that the coefficients for the year dummy variables are negative. These negative coefficients result from including the measure of log state per capita median income, which is positively related to enrollment in formal child care and increases over time. 17 Removing this variable from the analysis yields coefficients for the year variables that are not statistically significant. This suggests that, in a multivariate analysis, there is no clear time trend in enrollment.\nResults in table 3 show that public funding for formal care has no discernable effect on the formal care enrollment of higher-income children. Results also suggest that the coefficients for several child and family characteristics differ across the low-and higher-income populations. For example, among those with higher incomes, college-educated mothers are more likely than less educated mothers to place their children in formal child care. In the low-income sample, employed mothers are more likely than nonemployed mothers to place their children in formal child care. These differences suggest that formal care selection processes may depend on family's socioeconomic resources.\nTo formally test whether the effects of early education and child-care spending for low-income children differ from those for higher-income children, regressions are estimated with an interaction term (spending by low income). The results indicate that the estimated associations between funding and formal care enrollment are significantly larger among low-income children. The difference in the estimated effects of funding is about 0.006 , suggesting that, at 0.012, the overall (p ! .05) effects of funding are twice as large among low-income children as they are among higher-income children (results not shown)."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "To check the robustness of the results, a set of similar analyses are conducted, varying the years under consideration and the sources of support included in the funding measure. First, to examine possible differences in the years before and after welfare reform (when childcare funding mechanisms and the data source for TANF expenditures differed), models were estimated separately for these years. Although Note.- Table shows marginal effects and standard errors from probit regression models. Models 1 and 2 contain the full set of child and family covariates listed in table 2, as well as state and year fixed effects. Model 2 also contains the full set of state characteristics and welfare policy variables listed in table 2. Low income refers to families with incomes in the bottom 25% of the distribution for family incomes in the sample.\nthe estimates in equations for the early (1992-96) and later (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) years are as large as those for the entire time period, the association between funding and enrollment in formal care appears to be somewhat larger prior to 1997 (see table 4 ). The coefficients suggest that, between 1992 and 1996, an additional $100 resulted in a more than 5 percentage point increase in enrollment. Separate analyses (not shown) find similar results for this period if only child-care subsidy spending was included.\nAnother issue is whether the effects of Head Start and child-care assistance differ from each other. Increases in spending on both programs should have boosted children's enrollment in formal child care, and as noted earlier, spending on the programs is highly correlated within states over time. Nevertheless, the programs operate in different ways, and this may lead to differential effects. To explore this, each type of funding is entered separately into regressions (as reported in table 4). Results from these analyses suggest that the magnitude of the associations between child-care subsidy funding (welfare and CCDF monies) and enrollment mirrors prior findings for total child-care funding. The coefficients for Head Start expenditures are larger than those associated with subsidies, but standard errors are also large. This pattern of effects is also found when both child care and Head Start were entered jointly into a regression. A Wald test indicates that the estimated effects of the two funding variables are not significantly different ( 2 x p 0.12, ). These results indicate that it is appropriate to combine these p p .75 streams to measure total funding.\nWhen entered alone, Head Start funding does not significantly predict formal care enrollment. This finding is not surprising, because Head Start eligibility is restricted to children from families with incomes below the poverty threshold, whereas the low-income sample used here includes a broader sample of families (those from the lowest quartile of family income). When the sample is limited to children in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, results suggest that Head Start funding is statistically significantly associated with formal care enrollment (results not shown). 19 Although the low-income category is designed to roughly match the families that were eligible for some form of child-care assistance during the 1990s, further analyses are conducted to determine whether findings are sensitive to alternative definitions of the low-income population. These further analyses maintain the inclusion criteria of having at least 15 low-income children in each state and year. Consequently, in conducting these analyses, a more generous definition of low income (bottom 30 percent of the income distribution) results in a larger sample of low-income children; a more restrictive definition (bottom 20 percent of the income distribution) results in a smaller sample. Results do not differ substantially when analyses are conducted with different definitions of low income, although the effects of funding on formal care are slightly more pronounced among children in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution (0.02, ) than among those in the bottom p ! .05 30 percent of the distribution (0.012, ). p ! .05 In addition, to check whether the addition of a question prompt in the 1994 October CPS influences the results, models were estimated in which analyses are limited to years when respondents were surveyed with the exact same item (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) . Again, results are robust to this specification (results not shown).\nAnother issue is whether the effects of spending on enrollment for low-income children differ by the child's age and the mother's marital status. Enrollment rates of low-income 3-year-olds were much lower than those of 4-year-olds. In part, this perhaps reflects the greater availability of formal child-care programs for older children. From 1992 to 2000, 3-year-olds' enrollment increased from 17 to 35 percent in the sample, while 4-year-olds' enrollment increased from 48 to 63 percent. Results from the interaction analyses suggest that each $100 increase in childcare subsidies has less effect on the enrollment of 4-year-old children (0.008) than it does on the enrollment of 3-year-old children (0.024; see table 5, model 2). Thus, increasing public funding for child-care subsidies and Head Start might be most effective in boosting the formal care enrollment of children under the age of 4.\nIncreased state spending on prekindergarten programs, which primarily target 4-year-olds, are not included in the primary measure of total funding. This omission may influence the findings. Among the states included in the sample, state spending on prekindergarten rose in 1994 from about $59 per poor child under age 13 to about $183 in 2000. The robustness of results is checked by adding estimated state prekindgergarten expenditures to the measure of total public funding. Results from regression analyses with a full set of controls suggest that the effects of total public funding, including prekindergarten (results not shown; 0.014, ), are remarkably similar to the effects found p p .07 for the combined measure of Head Start and child-care subsidies (0.014, table 3). 20 The coefficient is less precisely estimated, however, p ! .05; reflecting that there are fewer years of data and that extrapolation is used to determine prekindergarten spending for several years.\nBecause state prekindergarten initiatives primarily serve 4-year-old children, analyses also consider whether including prekindergarten funding alters the pattern of results by child age. Results from regressions that include interaction terms for total funding (prekindergarten and children's age) yield no evidence that public support is differentially predictive of 3-or 4-year-olds' formal care enrollment. These findings suggest that child-care subsidies and Head Start may be more strongly linked to enrollment among 3-year-olds than among 4-year-olds, whereas prekindergarten spending boosts the enrollment of 4-year-olds more than that of 3-year-olds. Indeed, regressions in which prekindergarten spending (only) is interacted with the child's age provide some hint that prekindergarten spending is more highly linked with formal care enrollment among 4-year-olds than it is among 3-year-olds."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "With regard to differences by marital status, just over one-third of the mothers of low-income children in the sample were married. In the early 1990s, rates of enrollment in formal care among low-income children differed by the mother's marital status. In 1992, married mothers were slightly less likely than their unmarried counterparts to have children who experienced formal care (28 percent vs. 34 percent). However by 2000, this gap slightly increased; formal care was experienced by only 40 percent of children of married mothers. By contrast, nearly 50 percent of children of single mothers experienced formal care. Results from analyses do not provide strong evidence that the effects of child-care subsidies are lower among married mothers than among their single counterparts, although the estimate is in the expected direction (see table 5) .\nA final concern is the composition of the sample. Although the choice of 15 for the minimum number of low-income observations for a state and year was somewhat arbitrary, analyses indicate that estimates were not sensitive to using larger (e.g., 20 or 30 low-income observations per state and year) or slightly smaller (e.g., 13 or 14 low-income observations per state and year) alternative cutoffs. This increases confidence that the findings are not an artifact of the choice of sample size cutoffs.\nA minimum of 15 observations of poor children for each state and year is used in order to reduce measurement error, but doing so restricts the analyses to states with large populations. It is possible to include children residing in smaller states in regressions that do not include state fixed effects. These analyses use differences across states and over time to identify the effects of funding. If the state fixed effects are removed from the regression, but the same sample of children residing in large states is maintained, total funding is associated with an estimated 0.024 increase in the probability of enrollment. However, when (p ! .05) the children residing in small states are included in this analysis, the association is much smaller (0.008, ). If analyses consider only p ! .05 those children who reside in small states, funding is not associated with these children 's enrollment (\u03ea0.002, ) . If comparing the enp p .62 rollment rates of children across states provides a meaningful picture of how increases in funding influence center-based child-care and early education enrollment, then these findings may indicate that increases in funding may not affect the probability that children residing in smaller states are enrolled in formal care. However, as discussed, this approach may not be appropriate because of the omission of controls for differences across states."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main focus of this article is whether the increases in public funding for early education and child care in the 1990s resulted in higher levels of formal care enrollment among low-income 3-and 4-year-olds. The results suggest that expansions to public funding increased the probability that a child was enrolled in center-based care and early education programs over this period. The magnitude of the estimated effects indicate that increased funding accounts for between 8 and 11 percentage points of the 16 percentage point increase in low-income children's enrollment. These estimates are robust to the inclusion of measures of state characteristics that may be correlated with child-care and early education funding and enrollment.\nIn contrast, results suggest that increased public funding for childcare subsidies and Head Start has little association with the use of formal care among higher-income children. Nevertheless, the probability that higher-income children were enrolled in formal care during the preschool years also appears to have increased between 1992 and 2000. This suggests that, in the absence of expanded public support for early education and child care, income-related disparities in enrollment may have widened.\nIn order to isolate the effects of spending, analyses employ state fixedeffects models that rely on increases in spending within states over time. This approach rules out many alternative hypotheses for the findings, increasing confidence that the estimated effects may be causal. However, in order to estimate models that identify the effects of increases in funding within states over time, analyses must be limited to children residing in relatively large states. Although sensitivity analyses with state fixed-effects models suggest that the findings are not contingent on the particular definition of a large state, once the state fixed effects are removed from the models, analyses provide some evidence that the results may not hold for children residing in small states. Consequently, the findings should only be generalized to large states, and future re-search should consider the association between public funding and formal care enrollment in small states.\nThe estimated effects of funding on enrollment in formal care are greater between 1992 and 1996 than between 1997 and 2000. One possible explanation for the difference is the growth in the later period of unconstrained subsidies, which can be used for informal as well as formal care. A similar period effect is observed if only subsidy funding is analyzed. This finding suggests that states may have changed subsidy policies and administrative practices in the late 1990s. The increased emphasis on rapid employment for welfare-recipient families, for example, may have increased parents' need for (and welfare agencies' encouragement of) the use of subsidies to purchase informal arrangements. For parents exiting welfare, such arrangements were both more readily available and less costly than formal child-care arrangements. Head Start program enhancements, including the expansion from part-to full-day services, may also have diluted the effect of funding increases on the creation of new enrollment slots during the 1990s. It is also possible that child-care subsidy expenditures are measured with more error after the transition to TANF because guidelines allow states to report the same funds as MOE spending for both TANF and CCDF; if so, the resulting measurement error would bias the estimates toward zero.\nThe estimated effects of child-care subsidy and Head Start funding are larger for 3-year-olds than for 4-year-olds. However, the analyses of state prekindergarten spending indicate that this pattern (larger effects for 3-year-olds) may be offset by some increases in state prekindergarten funding for 4-year-olds. Indeed, it may be that increased availability of prekindergarten for some 4-year-olds reduces the role that child-care subsidies and Head Start play in promoting enrollment in early education among this age group. Future research, with improved data on prekindergarten spending, is necessary to more carefully evaluate this possibility.\nIf the probability of enrolling in formal care increases by 1 to 2 percentage points with an increase of $100 in funding per poor child under age 13, is that a large effect? An association of this magnitude suggests that over half of the increase in low-income children's enrollment in formal care in the 1990s may be explained by increases in public early education and child-care funding. In that sense, such an increase may be considered a large effect. But should an even larger increase in enrollment be expected from a 300 percent increase in available funding (per poor child under age 13)? The answer is not straightforward. First, parents' choice of child care is not solely determined by price. There are many other concerns, such as convenience or consonance of the care with their work schedule and values, that parents take into account when making child-care decisions (Lowe and Weisner 2004; Meyers and Jordan 2006) . Rising rates of maternal employment and nonstandard-hours employment, particularly among low-income mothers in the late 1990s, may have altered the attractiveness or feasibility of formal care relative to informal forms of care.\nSecond, the analyses consider the enrollment of children in formal care only. Over half of funding during this period was provided in the form of unconstrained subsidies, and such funding grew at a much faster rate than funding specifically designated for early education. Unconstrained subsidies can be used for both informal and formal child care, and state policies and administrative procedures (such as reimbursement rates and copayment schedules) may divert parents toward less costly forms of informal care (Meyers et al. 2002) . Total public spending per poor child is still well below the cost of full-time center-based care or preschool. Indeed, even after the funding increases in the 1990s, federal sources allocate only $1,200 per poor child under age 13. As a result, only a fraction of low-income children have access to full-time center-based care. Some states ration this assistance by limiting the number of families served. Only an estimated 15 percent of income-eligible children received assistance through means-tested subsidy programs in the late 1990s, and many states maintained waiting lists for assistance during the period examined here . Other states ration assistance through policies (such as high family copayments and low reimbursements to providers) that discourage families from using formal care arrangements, which are often more expensive than other forms of care.\nFinally, the analyses only consider whether a child participates in center-based care or an early education program. The analyses cannot determine whether increases in funding alter the intensity of children's participation in formal care (in terms of the number of months or hours that children attend these programs) or the quality of care children experience. Further investigation of this issue is complicated because of the data limitations discussed previously, but the issue is an important topic for future research.\nBecause findings suggest that expansions in child-care and early education funding increase enrollment in formal care among low-income children but not higher-income children, the analyses provide evidence that the gaps in enrollment between low-and higher-income children might have been larger in the absence of the funding increases. It follows, then, that further expansions may be effective in increasing the formal care enrollment of low-income children and in closing persistent gaps in enrollment between children from low-and higher-income families. Indeed, when the costs of early education and center-based child care were reduced for low-income families in the 1990s, more children experienced formal care.\nHowever, the structure of funding also may affect enrollment. Although unconstrained child-care subsidies afford parents the maximum degree of choice over the selection of child-care arrangements, subsidies may be a weaker tool for reducing gaps in formal care enrollment than investments directly targeting the expansion of the supply of free or affordable early education services. In addition, the equalizing effects of subsidies on enrollment gaps will be weaker still if state policies and administrative practices discourage the use of these subsidies for early education arrangements that cost more than informal arrangements.\nSeveral limitations to this study should be noted. First, because the analyses are limited to states with large populations of children, the results may not generalize to states with smaller populations of children. It would be valuable to conduct similar analyses with a data set that has large samples of low-income children in at least some smaller states. Second, it is not possible to estimate precisely the links between all sources of increases in early education funding and formal care enrollment. In particular, data constraints hamper the estimation of the role of local school-district and state prekindergarten expenditures. The investigation of prekindergarten, however, indicates that omitting this source of funding from the main estimates does not bias estimates of the effects of Head Start and child-care subsidies on center-based care and early education enrollment.\nFinally, the analyses do not prove that increases in expenditures for early education caused increases in low-income children's enrollment. Rather, the analyses show evidence of a strong link between increases in funding and enrollment within states over time. Given that early education is not currently an entitlement and that child-care subsidy assistance continues to be rationed (formally and informally), the availability of assistance is likely to be exogenous to the child-care decisions of individual families at a point in time. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that changes in enrollment in any given year are most likely due to expenditures rather than the reverse (i.e., that changes in enrollment determined public expenditures).\nIt is possible, however, that other unmeasured changes in state characteristics and policies may bias the estimates. To reduce this possibility, analyses include changes in important policies that have been credited with increasing maternal employment during this period. These changes include the introduction of welfare waivers, PRWORA, and state Earned Income Tax Credits. Analyses also include measures of key state characteristics (such as the unemployment rate, percent of young children under age 6 in poverty, and per capita income) that might be linked to changes in funding. Including these covariates does not diminish the estimated effects of public funding for early education and child care.\nThis study points to several important issues for future research. First, the variation across states in how child-care subsidies are structured suggests that future work might consider not only how funding affects the use of formal care but also how increased funding may interact with other child-care and early education policies. Will more children enter formal care if additional funding is used to reduce parent copayment rates? Will more children enter care if policies increase the number of families receiving assistance or raise the reimbursement rates for providers? The answers to these types of questions may provide valuable information to guide policy decisions.\nAs the discussion noted earlier, the current analyses cannot measure the amount of time that children spend in formal care or the quality of the programs that children attend, nor can they track changes in enrollment in other types of child care. Ultimately, in order to assess the importance of the enrollment changes documented here, it is important to know something about each of these outcomes. For example, it is important to understand the quality of the programs and hours of attendance relative to what children otherwise would experience. Future research should also look at the implications of these enrollment changes for children's school readiness and families' economic wellbeing.
