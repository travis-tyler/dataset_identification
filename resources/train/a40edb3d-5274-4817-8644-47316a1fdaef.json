[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease impairing a person's ability to perform day to day activities. The clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age, disease span, progression rate, impairment of memory and cognitive abilities. Due to these variabilities, personalized care and treatment planning, as well as patient counseling about their individual progression is limited. Recent developments in machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides significant opportunities to address this critical need. In this work, we use unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches for subtype identification and prediction. We apply machine learning methods to the extensive clinical observations available at the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. Our analysis depicts the progression space for the Alzheimer's disease into low, moderate and high disease progression zones. The proposed work will enable early detection and characterization of distinct disease subtypes based on clinical heterogeneity. We anticipate that our models will enable patient counseling, clinical trial design, and ultimately individualized clinical care."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and age-associated neurodegenerative disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia which progressively affects memory, intellectual skills, and other mental functions. Researchers have shown that AD initiates 10-15 years before the actual disease symptoms are manifested [2] . In the absence of any cure, early detection of AD onset and progression rate is significant as it helps in designing disease modifying treatment strategies. A major challenge for AD prediction and individualized clinical care is the phenotypic heterogeneity that exists within the AD population.\nAttempts thus far at the characterization of disease subtypes have followed a path of clinical observation based cognitive abilities. The disease is often separated into dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a stage between expected cognitive decline of normal aging and a more serious decline of dementia. MCI patients are at a higher risk of progressing to dementia, but not all the patients end up developing AD [11] . Previous studies attempted to detect incipient AD in patients with MCI or predict early stage of the AD using Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) [10] , [11] . Psychometric and imaging data has also been used for predicting the progression of dementia in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment [13] . However, less work has been done on using just clinical data and predicting the Alzheimer's disease progression rate.\nWe have previously used multimodal clinical data to produce progression space for Parkinson's Disease [8] . Here we describe our work on clustering and early prediction of the clinical progression of the AD. We have used dimension reduction techniques to identify progression space, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for subtyping, and Random Forest to predict an individual's progression. This work has identified Alzheimer's Disease progression space with three clinically distinct disease subtypes corresponding to memory decline and cognitive decline. Following the successful creation of disease subtypes within a progression space, we created a baseline predictor that accurately predicts an individual patient's clinical group membership two years later.

After imputations using domain knowledge, data cleansing and preprocessing, 218 clinical features were retained. If required, one hot encoding was used for all the categorical variables. Min-max normalization was used to retain progression trend in multimodal measurements. To reduce the dimensionality of the data set, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [19] (with a rank of 2) was used. NMF reduced high dimensional data into a two-dimensional space. The transformed data were used to project the patient's disease progression stage at the 24 th and 48 th month. Coefficient matrix obtained from the NMF was used as a progression indicator to interpret the representation of the reduced space dimensions.\nUnsupervised clustering method Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [12] was used to identify clusters. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [17] was used to select the optimum number of clusters in GMM. After obtaining the progression space and classifying MCI and dementia patients into different progression subtypes, various supervised learning classifiers were compared to predict an individual patient's progression. We validate the effectiveness of our predictive models using a five-fold cross-validation and measuring the AUC of the ROC curve. th month. In this figure low progression rate zone is represented in red, moderate progression rate in blue and high progression rate in green. 3 Results & Discussion Figure 1 demonstrates Alzheimer's disease progression space for 24 th month, generated by the dimension reduction step. Using the values from the coefficient matrix, the latent features for the x and y-axis were interpreted and identified as cognition decline and memory decline representations. Along the positive direction of y-axis, the memory decline increases and along the negative direction of x-axis the cognitive decline increases. Therefore, the progression rate increases in the direction of the positive y-axis and negative x-axis. Using GMM, three optimum clusters corresponding to low, moderate and high progression rate were identified. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the three clusters in MCI and dementia patients. Random forest (RF) classifier [4] provided the most accurate model. RF parameters were fine-tuned using grid search and evaluated by 5 fold cross-validation accuracy. Two models were developed for predicting progression after 24 and 48 months (accuracy results are presented in Table 1 ). Figure 2 shows the area under ROC curve of the progression prediction model. ADNI is a longitudinal study in which the disease state of patients is assessed every 12 months. Generally, most patients' condition either deteriorated or stayed the same. However, in rare cases, the patient's condition has reversed to a better state. Essentially, some patients were observed moving from dementia to MCI or MCI to control stage. Interestingly, this behavior is been captured in our progression space. Figure 2 shows these reversion cases in the progression space. Patients moving from dementia to MCI fall in the intermediate region between dementia and MCI (moderate progression rate region). Similarly, patients moving from MCI to control lie in intermediate progression region between MCI and control. This observation signifies the robustness of our proposed progression space model.\nIn another observation, we see the effect of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic mutation. APOE comes in three variants namely, 2, 3, and 4, out of which APOE4 gene variant is closely associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's disease [18] . Figure 3 shows the cases with 0 and 2 counts of APOE4 variants in our AD progression space. As evident from the figure, observations with 0 count of APOE4 variant are concentrated towards the low progression rate zone, whereas observations with 2 counts of APOE4 variant are concentrated towards moderate and high disease progression rate. This observation is validated by the existing literature which has identified a significant correlation between APOE4 genetic variants and cognitive performance [15] . Noting that APOE4 data was not considered during the construction of the projection space as only the time-variant measurements are used to obtain progression space.\nUsing our progression space model we can also observe the aging pattern in controls. Figure 3 shows the normal cognition and memory decline in controls attributed to increase of age. Since this decline is not severe, control cases do not lie in moderate or high progression rate zones. A simple clustering of observations into two clusters shows the stark difference in the mean age of the clusters. It is interesting to note that the mean age for the cluster which is relatively close to the moderate progression rate zone is 75.25 years and mean age of the cluster away from the moderate progression rate zone is 70.75 years."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Prediction of disease and disease course is a critical challenge in the care, treatment, and research of complex heterogeneous diseases such as Alzheimer's.
