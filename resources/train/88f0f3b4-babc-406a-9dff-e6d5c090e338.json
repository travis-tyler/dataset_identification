[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Financial losses due to natural hazards have been increasing over the last 30 years (Munich RE 2012). In fact, 2011 had the largest worldwide losses from natural catastrophes on record-$380 billion in total, with 37% from storms and flooding (Munich RE 2012). This trend is expected to continue due to increasing coastal development, aging infrastructure, degradation of coastal habitats, and climate change (Nicholls and Small 2002;Knutson et al. 2010;UNISDR 2011). Coastal disasters like the Indian Super Cyclone, Hurricane Katrina, and Superstorm Sandy have raised public awareness about the challenge of protecting people and property from future hazards; at the same time, these disasters have also raised awareness about the opportunity of addressing this challenge using habitats (Das and Vincent 2009;Feuer 2012;Fischetti 2012). Studies have shown that natural habitats, such as marshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and coral reefs can reduce erosion, wave heights, and even sometimes reduce surge and tsunami waves (Gedan et al. 2011;Shepard et al. 2011;Ferrario et al. 2014). Yet, there is still considerable debate over the conditions under which habitats can provide coastal protection (Das and Vincent 2009;Arkema et al. 2013). Businesses and governments, who are responsible for billions of assets and people in coastal environments, are now increasingly interested in considering habitats, or natural defenses, in hazard management (Beck and Shepard 2012;NYS 2100Commission 2013Ferrario et al. 2014) or enhance the effectiveness of built defenses (Cheong et al. 2013). Habitats can mitigate damage from erosion and floods by acting as barriers, exerting drag and attenuating wave energy and heights, absorbing flood waters, and/or accreting soil or calcium carbonate to build or maintain the land or a reef structure (Shepard et al. 2011). For example, corals and oysters form large 3-dimensional reef structures that actively build the reef through calcium carbonate accretion and, like breakwaters, reduce the amount of wave energy from overtopping waves (Ferrario et al. 2014). Similarily, the porous but complex root and branching structures of mangroves attenuate waves and facilitate soil accretion (Das and Vincent 2009). Marsh grasses also attenuate waves and absorb flood waters, while facilitating soil accretion (Shepard et al. 2011;Moller et al. 2014). However, large or extensive habitats may be needed to have substantial impacts on hazards and habitats may have no impact on the largest hazards (Wamsley et al. 2010;Renaud et al. 2013). Habitats provide additional benefits that built defenses alone cannot provide. Habitats provide recreational opportunities, sequester C, and support fisheries and biodiversity (Barbier et al. 2011). Habitats may have lower maintenance costs because they are growing and self-maintaining (Ferrario et al. 2014). Moreover, hazard risk management approaches that use multiple strategies (e.g., natural and built defenses) are more resilient than strategies that rely on just 1 strategy (Ahern 2011). Despite increasing evidence that habitats may help provide coastal protection and additional ecosystem services, built defenses remain the primary options considered by business, governments, and other decision makers. The UK and US governments have made important progress to counter this trend by providing guidance on how to incorporate ecosystem services and specifically consider natural defenses or habitats into hazard management decisions (Penning-Rowsell et al. 2005; Environment Agency for England and Wales 2010; UK Environment Agency 2014; USACE 2015). This reflects a broader trend by national governments and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations to account for the value of natural capital in accounting and decision making (MEA 2005;USEPA 2010; UK National Ecosystem Assessment 2011; UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013; World Bank 2014). These efforts have been supported by the advancement and synthesis of ecosystem service quantification and valuation methods, models, tools, and databases (TEEB 2010;Bateman et al. 2011;Kareiva et al. 2011;WBCSD 2011;Bagstad et al. 2013;NESP 2014), some of which are specific to wetlands (Heal et al. 2005;Brander et al. 2006;Barbier 2012Barbier , 2013TNC 2015). A key remaining gap is that businesses do not have methods to evaluate natural defenses on a project basis using the same biophysical and economic metrics they use to evaluate built defenses. To date, few studies have linked habitat's capacity to reduce flood heights or erosion to reductions in economic damages or fatalities (except see Barbier 2007;Costanza et al. 2008;Das and Vincent 2009;Arkema et al. 2013), and even fewer have compared habitats to other built defense options (except see Francis et al. 2011;Ferrario et al. 2014). To our knowledge, no studies have compared natural and built defense options in the context of a specific business decision. Businesses evaluate investments, such as the costs and benefits of built defenses based primarily on their net present value (NPV), or similar financial metrics. However, businesses are increasingly looking for methods to help them account for ecosystem service values that are not included in financial analyses of NPV, such as the avoided property damage, business interruption, or capital costs from habitats that provide coastal protection services. Even though business's primary concern is for value to shareholders and owners, they are also increasingly concerned with accounting for ecosystem service values to the public, such as recreational values of coastal habitats, because of reputational benefits, consumer or community pressure, internal sustainability goals, or external financing requirements (WBCSD 2011). In this study, we developed and applied linked biophysical and economic models of coastal storm protection ecosystem services, as well as other ecosystem services, provided by marshes to enable businesses to evaluate natural and built defense options for hurricane risk mitigation under future conditions of coastal development and sea-level rise. We applied these methods to evaluate options for protecting a major coastal manufacturing facility-The Dow Chemical Company's Texas Operations in Freeport, Texas. We show how these methods enable a business to account for the private value of coastal storm protection services and evaluate hurricane risk mitigation options based on traditional NPV metrics. In addition, we show how qualitative, quantitative, and economic information on ecosystem services to the surrounding community and impacts to biodiversity may also provide supporting information to managers making investment decisions primarily based on private financial criteria. The result is a replicable method to account for ecosystem services in cost-benefit analyses of hurricane risk mitigation options that can be used by Dow and other businesses at other locations."}, {"section_title": "STUDY SITE", "text": "Dow's Texas Operations in Freeport, Texas (Figure 1) is responsible for 20% of Dow's global sales. The location is vulnerable to hurricanes because it is located in a low-lying area along the Gulf of Mexico (Jelesnianski et al. 1992). This area also has coastal marshes, which are partially protected in the Brazoria and San Bernard National Wildlife Refuges and provide important stop-over sites for migratory birds (USFWS 2012). A main levee protects the primary Dow facilities and the town of Freeport (Figure 1). However, a key part of Dow's integrated facility lies outside of this levee. This area, known as Stratton Ridge, is 12 km inland with an average elevation of 3.8 m. Underground salt domes at Stratton Ridge provide a critical feedstock to Dow's Freeport manufacturing plants. Although large hurricanes capable of flooding Stratton Ridge are rare, Dow previously considered building levees at Stratton Ridge to protect against a 100-y storm as a potentially costeffective way to reduce hurricane damage. A 100-y storm in this area is between a Category 3 and 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and, on average, may generate 4.4 m surges and 8 m waves at the coast (USACE 2002). Here, we advance Dow's previous hurricane risk analysis by accounting for 1) the 5 km extent of marsh in front of Stratton Ridge and the potential loss of this marsh, and 2) a potential increase in flood heights under a future with projected coastal development and sea-level rise."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Our approach enables businesses to incorporate habitats into natural hazard mitigation decisions by using process-based models that link forecasts of changes in coastal ecosystems to changes in ecosystem service production and economic values (Daily et al. 2009). This modeling approach allowed for the incorporation of more information on ecological and economic functions than a benefit transfer approach and is appropriate for data rich locations such as the United States. In less data rich locations or resource-constrained studies, benefit transfer approaches (Richardson et al. 2014) that use the large and growing literature on the value of wetlands and coastal protection services in particular may be necessary or more appropriate (Brander et al. 2006). We first explored the potential coastal protection services provided by marshes under different marsh conditions. Using a representative transect from the Stratton Ridge study area, we modeled wave attenuation and levee costs associated with a Category 3 hurricane across a range of values for habitat area and roughness. Using Dow's hurricane risk mitigation decision as an example application to a business, we then evaluated the private coastal protection value to the business of the 3 coastal defenses options at Stratton Ridge. A sample of public ecosystem services and impacts to biodiversity were also explored to provide supporting information to help the business understand how coastal defense options may support both corporate financial and sustainability goals. The next 2 sections describe the 3 coastal defense options for Stratton Ridge and the data used to construct the defense options under future scenarios of coastal development and sealevel rise. The 2 sections thereafter describe the models for coastal protection services and other ecosystem services and biodiversity."}, {"section_title": "Coastal defense options and evaluation criteria", "text": "We evaluated natural (marshes), built (levee), and hybrid (marshes and a levee designed for marshes) defenses designed for a 100-y hurricane relative to a business-as-usual or baseline scenario over Dow's 30-y planning horizon. The baseline scenario has no coastal defenses (levees or marshes) and reflects Dow's previous approach to modeling hurricane risk, which did not incorporate the potential protective capacities of marshes. The natural defense scenario took into account the role of existing marshes. The built defense scenario used the baseline scenario land cover and flood conditions and included a levee designed to prevent flooding at Stratton Ridge under these flood conditions. The hybrid defense scenario used the natural defense land cover and flood conditions and included a levee design (accounting for any flood elevation reduction due to natural defenses) to prevent flooding at Stratton Ridge (Table 1). We compared the different coastal defense scenarios based on the net present value (NPV) of coastal protection to Dow (avoided property damage, business interruption, and levee costs). These metrics do not include additional costs or impacts that may be relevant to other aspects of natural hazard mitigation planning by a business such as risk to human life (Jonkman and Vrijling 2008) or emergency service costs (Wolshon et al. 2005), because it is assumed that these are addressed separately by the business. This approach is consistent with the FEMA HAZUS model (FEMA 2011), Figure 1. Map of Dow Texas Operations and surrounding coastal habitats in Brazoria County, TX. The majority of Dow's facilities are protected by an existing levee (gray area); however, a key part of the integrated facility, Stratton Ridge (dashed oval), is outside the existing levee system. Biophysical and economic modeling of built defense, natural defense, and hybrid defense scenarios over 5 time periods (2006,2025,2050,2075,2100) focused on habitats, levees, and properties in the study area shown in red. The 3 parts of the figure show measured and modeled land cover around Freeport, TX: (A) current (2006), (B) 2050, (C) 2100. These maps show future losses of total land area and marsh area due to an increase of sea-level rise to 1.16 m above 2006 levels by 2100 and an increase in developed land by 2050. In the Stratton Ridge study area (red border), we predict a loss of 23% of the total land area and a loss of 35% of the marsh area by 2100. which is used in the United States, has been adopted worldwide by emergency managers, and does not model impacts to emergency service costs or human life. As supporting information, we also compared the scenarios based on the NPV of coastal protection (avoided property damage) and other ecosystem services provided to local and global communities, and biodiversity. We chose the coproduced public ecosystem services and metrics for biodiversity based on the ease and replicability of modeling using data from the area and based on the anticipated magnitude of the service. Consequently, the methodology used herein should not be considered a full accounting of the ecosystem services provided by marshes. It should be noted that we did not include potential negative impacts of the levee on marshes (Yin and Li 2001;Hupp et al. 2009;Harvey et al. 2011) and the ecosystem services they produce. This assumption is based on the fact that the levees would be located on the already developed industrial site and on our Sea-Level Rise Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) results ( Figure 1) that show that the area in front and around Stratton Ridge remains dry land through 2100 when sea-level rise is 1.16 m above 2006 levels. These results suggest that even with marsh migration the levee should not impact marshes within the time frame of our analysis. The process to estimate the 3 metrics for each defense option involved 6 steps. First, we modeled future land use-land cover (LULC) conditions in the Stratton Ridge study area based on projected sea-level rise and coastal development. Second, we modeled flood heights from Category 1-5 hurricanes and a 100y hurricane in the Stratton Ridge study area. Third, we used the flood water elevation for the 100-y hurricane to compute the height and cost of a levee at the Stratton Ridge facility under the built and hybrid defense scenarios. Fourth, we used flood water elevations for the Category 1-5 hurricanes to estimate property damage to Dow and the local community, as well as business interruption to Dow. Fifth, we estimated the monetary values to the public or biophysical quantities for coproduced public ecosystem services from the marshes: recreation (monetary value), C sequestration (monetary value), fisheries (number of species, relative impact), and biodiversity (number of species, quality). Finally, sixth, we calculated the discounted sum of costs and benefits to Dow and the public, and summarized nonmonetary metrics. All monetary estimates were adjusted to 2010 US$ using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index. We discounted net monetary benefits to Dow using a private discount rate of 7% based on recent returns on private investments (OMB 1992) and to the public using a social discount rate of 3%, which represents the consensus for projects of this time frame (Weitzman 2001). We also explored the sensitivity of the results to changes in the discount rate by using private discount rates of 7% AE 3% (absent further information on returns to private capital) and by using declining social discount rates of 4% for years 1 to 5, 3% for years 6 to 25, and 2% for years 26 to 75, as recommended by a growing body of literature (Weitzman 2001;Arrow et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Data inputs for coastal defense scenarios with future sealevel rise and coastal development", "text": "We represented the baseline scenario and each defense scenario (natural, built, hybrid) by a series of LULC maps for 5 different time periods (2006,2025,2050,2075,2100) and a levee height specification. Each map had a 10 m horizontal resolution. The LULC maps were created by modeling marsh growth and migration as a function of sea-level rise and coastal development projections across the entire coastal zone of Brazoria County (the county in which Stratton Ridge is located) using SLAMM 6 (Geselbracht et al. 2011). The inputs to SLAMM included the most current digital elevation maps, LULC data, location and height of existing levees or dikes, marsh accretion and erosion rate values at different locations in Brazoria County, future land development maps, and local sealevel rise projections (Supplemental Data Table S1). We derived digital elevation models (DEM) for the region from 2 sources. The first source was the 2006 Texas Water Development Board LiDAR (LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses light and radar to make high resolution maps) for Brazoria, Matagorda, and Galveston Counties. We also used the 2009 US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Joint Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise topographic LiDAR data derived from post Hurricane Gustav and post Hurricane Ike surveys. The 2009 elevation data covered Christmas Bay and the barrier beach areas near Surfside Beach. We obtained LULC data from the National Wetlands Inventory from data collected in 2006, 2001, and 1992. The 2006 data covered the majority of the Brazoria County coastal zone and the entirety of the Stratton Ridge study area. We represented future development by reclassifying parcels to developed and dry land in 2050 based on the Houston-Galveston Area Council's projection for development in 2040 (HGAC 2012). We used a 1 m global sea-level rise projection in our analysis because it is consistent with other planning processes (NOAA 2012) and considered highly likely based on current scientific literature (IPCC 2007(IPCC , 2013. Adjusting for the local historic trend of 4.35 mm/y of sea-level rise in the Freeport area, we projected local sea-level rise of 1.29 m between 1990 and 2100 or 1.16 m from 2006 to 2100 (the time range of our study) ( Table 2). We identified levee design heights based on flood elevation projections and the FEMA requirement for 0.30 m of freeboard above wave-run up (FEMA 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal protection modeling", "text": "Flood modeling. We modeled total flood heights generated by Category 1-5 hurricanes and a 100-y hurricane for each defense scenario in each of the 5 time periods using generic forcing parameters for surge elevation, waves heights and periods, wind speed, and predicted sea-level increases at the coast (Tables 2 and 3). Modeled flood heights were defined as the sum of surge and wave heights above the terrain elevation relative to mean sea level (MSL), for a given sea-level rise value. Tidal components were ignored because Freeport is a microtidal coastal region and hurricanes rarely last longer than a full tidal cycle nearshore. We modeled total flood height in the Stratton Ridge study area using an approach similar to the one currently recommended by FEMA (2007). First, we used DEMs to generate 19 1D transects perpendicular to the 2006 shoreline, from offshore depths of approximately 15 m to the 9-10 m contour inland. Then we removed the coastal dunes from each profile, after determining that they would fail during Category 2 or greater hurricanes (Judge et al. 2003). Next, we digitally smoothed each profile to minimize any numerical instability and populated each transect with appropriate LULC information, for each scenario. From this input data, we then used computed total flood heights (surge and wave heights) along each transect, for the different forcing and scenario defined in the analysis. Finally, we used the flood height on each transect to generate a 2D flood height surface. Surge. Theoretical modeling and some limited empirical data suggest that the effect of coastal marshes on surge is limited (USACE 2013), highly variable and may only occur when marshes have a relatively wide footprint (Wamsley et al. 2010). Consequently, given the relatively small extent of marshes in the Stratton Ridge study area (total 5 km from coast to Stratton Ridge) and its level of fragmentation, we assumed that the marshes have no effect on surge elevations. In addition, in keeping with the methodology Dow previously used to estimate surge risk at its Stratton Ridge facility, we estimated the surge elevation inland using a modified bathtub model. We modeled the surge S\u00f0x\u00de along each transect assuming that it is amplified linearly by a coefficient a starting at the coastline from an initial value where x is the cross-shore distance inland from the coastline and d Dow is the approximate orthogonal distance between the Dow facility and the coast (d Dow =12:3km). To account for The global sea-level rise scenario of 1 m by 2100 was produced by scaling up of the A1B-max scenario from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC 2007  the effect of sea-level rise on hurricane flood heights, predicted sea-level rise values were added to the surge profile S x \u00f0 \u00de. The amplification factor a was developed by Dow using NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (Jelesnianski et al. 1992) and results from their own and other's simulations of storm surge in the region using more complex models that allow for the landward propagation of surge (Aggarwal 2004). This analysis resulted in the following values for the amplification factor: a \u00bc 0:4 for S Coast 1:5 m, a \u00bc 0:86 for 1:3 < S Coast 3 m, and a \u00bc 1:3 for S Coast > 3 m. Comparisons of surge heights at Dow's facilities using data from past storms projected using these amplification factors were in good agreement with previously measured and modeled surge for this site (Jelesnianski et al. 1992) and sites with similar size habitat (Wamsley et al. 2010;Gedan et al. 2011). Waves. Accounting for inland flood depths due to surge amplification, sea-level rise, and the presence of vegetation, we modeled wave evolution along each transect, from the coastline to the limit of inland flooding, using the wave energy balance equation (Holthuijsen 2010) where r \u00bc 1024 kg/m 3 is the density of seawater, g \u00bc 9.81 m/s 2 is the gravitational acceleration, H is the wave height, and C g is the speed at which wave energy travels. W growth represents an input of wind energy to the wave field, which causes waves to grow and regenerate as they travel inland. We computed W growth as a function of the wave height, the hurricane wind speed and the water depth at each cross-shore location following the method laid out by the FEMA (1998). We also assumed that wind speeds are not reduced by marshes. The variables D break and D bottom represent the dissipation of wave energy due to wave breaking and bottom friction, respectively. They are calculated at each cross-shore location x as (Thornton and Guza 1983)  where b is a breaking coefficient, g is a breaking index, with default values of 1.0 and 0.78, respectively. The wave radial frequency s is a function of the wave field peak period, k is the wavenumber, h is the local water depth at each cross-section x, and includes surge and sea-level rise values. Finally, C f is a friction coefficient. Physical obstructions on the landscape such as marshes, forests, and development dissipate wave energy. Their effects are incorporated in the model by a friction factor, C f . We computed the friction factor from the Manning's n value associated with different classes of LULC, following the methodology used by the USACE model STWAVE (Smith et al. 2001;Cialone and Smith 2007;Wamsley et al. 2009). We generated different Manning's n values for different LULC classes by grouping them based on the defined SLAMM habitat categories (Table 4). Note that for the baseline scenario, we converted all marsh and swamp habitat currently present in the LULC map to undeveloped dry land. Economic valuation. We estimated the value of coastal protection services provided by the marshes and levees to Dow in each defense scenario in terms of avoided property damage, avoided business interruption, and avoided levee costs. We estimated the value of coastal protection services to the public in terms of avoided property damage only. We computed these metrics over 30 y by comparing annual costs incurred by each defense scenario to annual costs computed under the baseline scenario. For each scenario, we translated flood heights generated by each storm into property damages with the standard depth-damage approach used by FEMA and the USACE in their HAZUS flood modeling (Scawthorn et al. 2006). Using damage estimates for each hurricane category and the annual rate of occurrence of a hurricane of that category (Table S2), we calculated the annualized loss expectancy for Dow and the community in the study area. Annual rates of occurrence were calculated based on a record of all hurricanes from 1842 to 2012 that passed along the 400 km stretch of coastline around Freeport, Texas (extending between Corpus Christi, Texas and Beaumont, Texas). We also examined the sensitivity of the results to AE20% changes in the annual rate of occurrence for each hurricane category. We estimated business interruption for Dow using ratios relating business interruption to property damage that were previously developed by Dow (i.e., 1:1 with levee, 1.5:1 without levee). Finally, we calculated levee costs by developing a generic levee cost model for earthen levees using cost data from a nearby and recent earthen levee project and assumed that all costs occurred in year 1 (Table S3). Depth-damage functions are a mathematical relationship between the depth of flood waters in relation to the first floor of a building, and the amount of damage to the structure and the building contents that can be attributed to that flood water. This relationship can be expressed as where D is the total damage to the structure and contents, V is the market value of the structure, and s and c are the structure and contents damage ratios for a given flood height above the first floor elevation y. Both the content damage and structure damage are expressed as a fraction of the structure value, leaving the depth-damage function to only rely on flood height and structure value. Equation 6 is a general mathematical representation of the location specific depth-damage functions developed by the USACE (FEMA 2011). For the Stratton Ridge facility and other commercial and industrial buildings present along each transect, we used depth-damage functions developed by the USACE in Galveston, Texas (FEMA 2011) (Table S4). For Stratton Ridge, we focus on damages to structures only and assume that damages to contents are negligible, because the structures at Stratton Ridge are utility buildings with the value being primarily in the structure. We assumed that those structures are slab on grade and adjusted flood heights by 1 ft. This is a reasonable assumption for facilities that are far inland and likely near the edge or outside of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or the area that is expected to be impacted by a 100-y flood. No commercial or industrial facilities were located near the coast in the Stratton Ridge study area. For residential structures, the most common types of structures in the Stratton Ridge study area, we used the depth-damage functions for single-story and multistory (no basement) damage functions presented in USACE (2003) ( Table S4). Given that we did not have parcel-level information on the number of floors per residential structure, we created composite damage functions based on the damage functions for single-story and multistory buildings without a basement by weighting the damage ratios based on empirical estimates of the percentage of building in Texas that are singlestory (72%) and 2-stories or higher (28%). To address the lack of information on foundations, we used regional summary data on the distribution of foundation types for pre-and postFIRM (buildings built before and after flood maps were available) and the height above grade for the finished first floor for different foundation types from the HAZUS model (see Tables  S5 and S6) (FEMA 2011). As this data is available at a regional level and not the parcel level, we estimate an average height above grade by assuming an equal distribution of preFIRM, FIRM-A (areas subject to 100-y floods, as determined by approximate methods), and FIRM-V (areas subject to 100-y floods and storm-induced waves) buildings and weighting height by the stated distribution of foundation types. This yields an average height increase of 1.8 m above grade for all buildings. To protect confidential information on the value of Dow's property and to make the results more general to industrial applications, we obtained data on the value of industrial (land use code F2) structures in Brazoria County and neighboring Galveston County from the county appraisal district offices (Table S7). Damages were calculated for the 4 structures at Stratton Ridge, assuming that the structures are identical. We used the 95th percentile of structure values to reflect the fact that the Dow facilities, which are part of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere, are extremely high value facilities relative to the industrial facilities in the area. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using the 75th and 90th percentile values. For nonStratton Ridge structures in the study area, we obtained a spatial inventory of the building stock and property values from the Brazoria County appraisal district office. Recognizing that future development may result in new properties exposed to hurricanes, we estimated the average value of commercial and residential structures per hectare for 2011 and used this USD/ha figure to construct values for parcels that are projected to be developed in 2050. We also made the simplifying assumption that all development takes place in 2050 and that no development that exists in 2011 reverts to undeveloped land."}, {"section_title": "Additional ecosystem services provided by marshes", "text": "Recreation. To quantify the value of natural habitats for recreation, we used the InVEST Recreation model (Wood et al. 2013). Despite the large literature on recreational use values, the lack of visitation data in many places (including in Freeport and near the coastal marshes in that region) is a major challenge for using these recreational use values via benefit transfer methods. We overcame this challenge and were able to take advantage of this larger literature and apply recreational use values (US$/user/day) from the Recreation Use Values Database by first using the InVEST recreation model to estimate recreational user days. This model predicts recreational user-days in 5 km cells based on linear regression analysis of the relationship between landscape attributes across space and geotagged photographs downloaded from the web site Flickr (http://www.flickr.com) (Table S8). To estimate absolute user-days per grid cell, we used an estimate of the relationship between the annual density of photograph user-days and average annual user-days from data on visitation to 72 Texas State Parks between 2008 and 2012. We translated user-day estimates into economic values using estimates of recreational values from the Recreation Use Values Database for North America (Table S9). The Recreation Use Values Database for North America contains 2703 estimates of value per user day from 352 studies of recreational values in the United States and Canada from 1958 to 2006. We selected a subset of values from studies that had estimated values for recreational activities that are likely to occur in coastal marsh areas (i.e., fishing, kayaking, motor boating). We used the mean value for each activity weighted by the percent of users expected to engage in the activity based on expert knowledge to calculate a mean value for all activities. Carbon. We used the InVEST Blue Carbon model to estimate C sequestration (mT C/ha/y) by marsh plants to the sediment (Tallis et al. 2013). To simplify the analysis, we did not model sequestration to above and below ground biomass, which likely makes the results an underestimate of C sequestration by marshes. We used habitat-specific C loss or gain rates to model effects of transitions of marsh habitat to other habitats. We calculated the social cost of C (SCC)-or the net present value of the sum of future damages due to increases in atmospheric C-using one of the \"middle\" SCC estimates ($22/mT CO 2 [or $81/mT C], 3% discount rate) developed by the federal Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon (IWG-SCC 2010). Fisheries. We qualitatively assessed the fisheries service of coastal habitats in the study area by modeling the propensity of a suite of species to respond to projected changes in coastal habitat area. We identified the most important fisheries species using commercial and recreational landings data from Texas. We determined which coastal habitats are used by these species by querying the scientific literature and fisheries or fish biology databases. Finally, we scored the potential species response by direction of change (increasing or decreasing) and the expected magnitude of the change (very low, low, medium, high, or very high). We did not estimate the economic value of enhanced fisheries production services from marshes because this would require quantitatively modeling the increase in fish catch due to coastal marshes, which was outside the scope of this study. Biodiversity. We used the InVEST 3.0 Biodiversity Model (Tallis et al. 2013) to quantify trends in habitat quality. Habitat quality was estimated by modeling the effect of local threats on existing habitats. The main inputs to the biodiversity model were LULC data from SLAMM, data on 12 habitat threats, a habitat threat sensitivity table, and conservation management areas data. We used our estimated changes in habitat quality, as well as the number of bird species supported by coastal habitats, as an indicator of the intrinsic biodiversity value of the coastal habitats."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Potential protection provided by marshes along a representative transect", "text": "Marshes reduce wave heights, and hence total water levels, by dissipating wave energy via a bottom friction coefficient derived from a corresponding Manning's n value (see Waves above). Marshes also have the potential to reduce surge depending on the hurricane strength and orientation and the amount of marsh present (Wamsley et al. 2010). In this section, we illustrate how surge and wave height reduction by marshes can help reduce the total water levels and the size of levees. In this example, we model how the largest marsh footprint east of the Stratton Ridge study area could reduce total water levels induced by a Category 3 hurricane in 2050 (where sea level has risen by 0.44 m). We find that marshes would have the potential to reduce wave heights by 33%, on average, across the transect (Figure 2A). At the landward limit of the marshes (14 km inland), the waves are reduced by 40% compared to their values in the absence of marshes (Figure 2A). However, as waves propagate further inland, the effect of the marsh decreases as waves are regenerated by winds and the waves become depth limited. Consequently, at 17 and 20 km inland, or 3 and 6 km landward of the edge of the marsh, the observed reduction in wave height decreases to 2%. Reduction in wave height, and thus in total water level, translates into a reduction in levee costs; however, in the Stratton Ridge application, levee cost reductions are not significant (Table 5). Under current-day marsh conditions, if a levee was built inside the marsh area shoreward of the Stratton Ridge facility (an option that might not allow marshes to migrate inland and survive in the long term as sea level rises), the wave reduction services supplied by this habitat would decrease construction costs by approximately $1.5 million (2010 US$) (values anywhere between $1 and $2 million [2010 US$]) (Figure 3). If the levee was built at the landward edge of the marsh close to the Stratton Ridge facility, the cost reduction would be approximately $0.5 million (2010 US$) (Figure 3). As the distance inland and away from the landward edge of the marsh increases, the wave attenuation properties of the marsh decreases thereby translating into decreasing benefits in terms of avoided levee costs. For levees built further than 20 km from the shoreline, the presence of the wetlands does not have any effect on levee cost. Note that the cost does not decrease monotonically moving landward because the difference in flood depth does not decrease monotonically even though total flood depth does decrease monotonically. This pattern is a result of the fact that the wave evolution and wave regeneration equations are nonlinear. The local bathymetry and topography also influence wave height and any potential increase in wave height due to regeneration. We evaluated the relative importance of marsh coverage and uncertainty in the physical characteristics of marshes by recomputing profiles of wave height using different n values and marsh coverage configurations. We found that using a higher n value, or assuming that the marsh is not fragmented, yields large and similar reduction in wave height of approximately 45%, on average, over the marsh footprint ( Figure 2B). The lower water levels computed using a nonfragmented marsh, or a higher n value, also reduced levee construction costs by more than $1.5 million (2010 US$), if such a structure were built inside the marsh (Figure 3). On the other hand, using a uniform n value corresponding to regularly flooded marshes (Table 4) yields wave height values similar to what was obtained when marshes where not taken into account (Figure 2). At any value for Manning's n, we find that the role of marshes is greatest near the coast and their protective role decreases further inland, with marshes in this simulation having no impact on levee construction costs in regions farther than 20 km inland (Figure 3). In addition to reducing wave height, marshes can also reduce surge height. However, following USACE (2013) and recognizing that marshes in Freeport are relatively small in size, fragmented, and the Dow facility is far from the coastline, we ignored the impact of marshes on storm surge. However, Wamsley et al. (2010) found that, under some circumstances, marshes can reduce surge height by up to 5.6 cm/km. Using the same transect east of Dow's facility as above, this translates into 30 cm reduction in surge height at the edge of the marsh area, given its level of fragmentation. Assuming existing marsh coverage characteristics, we found that this reduction of surge had a limited impact on wave height and reduced levee height by nearly 30 cm, because wave heights are nearly identical. This level of reduction is much higher than what marshes directly fronting the facility will achieve, because they are only 5 km wide in total, on average. Furthermore, as mentioned in Wamsley et al. (2010) and in USACE (2013), it is unlikely that marshes reduce surges by that high amount for most storms. Consequently, given the extreme nature of some of the storms considered in this analysis, we hereafter assume that marshes have negligible impact on surge. In summary, this initial analysis exercise shows that marshes have the ability to reduce water levels and levee construction costs for a Category 3 hurricane conditions. However, the ability of marshes to influence total water level and levee construction costs landward of their footprint (their far-field effect) decreases as flood waters depths decrease and distance from the marsh increases. In addition, this analysis has shown that results are highly dependent on the exact footprint delineation of the marshes and the Manning's n value used to compute the friction coefficient. Similar results were found by (Guannel et al. 2014) in Galveston Bay, using actual physical parameter values (e.g., diameter, height and density of various marsh types) instead of n."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of coastal defense options at Stratton Ridge", "text": "We applied our flood modeling and economic valuation methods, together with modeling of other ecosystem services and biodiversity, to evaluate 3 coastal defense options (built, natural, and hybrid) at Stratton Ridge. Here, we present the results on the area and type (that affects Manning's n values) of natural defenses in the future; flood heights, levee heights, and costs in the future and across defense scenarios; the total value of coastal protection (avoided storm damage and levee costs) to Dow in the future and across defense scenarios, and the quantity and value of coproduced public ecosystem services from natural defenses. Effects of future sea-level rise and development on natural defenses. Our results predict a 23% decrease in the total land area (30 728 acres) in front of Stratton Ridge by 2100 relative to 2006 levels, with the greatest losses occurring in the second half of the century (Figure 1). Marshes may migrate inland with sea-level rise ( Figures 1B and 1C), although there is some uncertainty over whether soil types or the speed of sea-level rise will limit marsh migration. Inundation of marshes and conversion of marshes to bare mud flats may result in a 9% decrease in marsh area by 2050 and a 35% decrease by 2100, relative to 2006 levels ( Figures 1B and 1C). The accelerated loss of land in the second half of the century can be explained both by the increased rate of sea-level rise and the increased vulnerability of the coastline to erosion. Marsh-covered coastlines are less vulnerable to erosion than bare mud flats.  Table 4. (B) Profiles of wave height assuming that the wetland is not fragmented and covers the whole topographic profile from X % 200 m to X % 14 km, or has a high Mn of 0.074, the average Mn values used in the analysis, a minimum Mn value of 0.045 or that there is no vegetation. (C) Submerged topographic profile and location of the wetland. In contrast to sea-level rise, coastal development has a minimal impact on marshes because regional planners project development to occur primarily on dry land. Flood modeling, levee design, and levee cost. Flood modeling predicts that only floods from large (Category 3-5) storms may impact Stratton Ridge in all time periods, but smaller storms (Category 2) do not impact Stratton Ridge in the first half of the century (2006, 2025, and 2050) (Figure 4). However, flood heights from all storms are expected to increase over time as sea level rises meaning that in the second half of the century (2075, 2100) both large storms (Category 3-5) and smaller (Category 2) storms are expected to impact Stratton Ridge (Figure 4). A regression analysis of the effect of sea-level rise and marsh area on flood heights from Category 3-5 hurricanes showed that a 10% increase in sea-level rise may increase flood heights by 1.8% (95% confidence: 1.8%, 1.9%), whereas a 10% increase in marsh area may decrease flood heights by \u00c00.2% (95% confidence: 0.2%, 0.3%) ( Table S10). The small and decreasing size of the existing marsh (5 km) partly explains why the marshes make such a minor contribution to wave attenuation. Note that we also considered a scenario where all dry land was restored to marshes, creating a 10 km extent of marsh in front of Stratton Ridge. This scenario showed similar effects on flood heights as the scenario based on existing marsh; therefore, it was not considered further. An additional factor affecting the wave attenuation results is the fact that, in the short-term, Stratton Ridge is only inundated during large hurricanes (Category 3-5) and Equation 5 shows that greater water depths associated with surges from large hurricanes reduce the degree to which habits can attenuate waves. Finally, as mentioned previously, the influence of the marsh decreases with distance from its landward edge, so the wave attenuation benefits of the marsh are diminished by the time waves reach the facility, which is more than 5 km away from the marsh's edge. Flood modeling for a 100-y storm (between a Category 3 and 4 storm) suggests that the small effect of marshes on flood heights (reduction of 0.1 m in 2006 and <0.1 m in 2050) would not warrant a change in levee design height, whereas the effect of sea-level rise may warrant a change in levee design height ( Table 5). The natural defense scenario only reduces flood heights from a 100-y storm by 3% in 2006 and 2025 and, by 2050, natural defenses have no effect on flood height (Table 5). However, sea-level rise may increase flood heights by 12% (0.4 m) from 3.1 m in 2006 to 3.5 m in 2050 under the baseline scenario (Table 5). Based on these modeled flood heights, a 3.4 m levee would be needed to protect against a 100-y storm under 2006 conditions for the baseline scenario (Table 5). This levee would cost $26 million (2010 US$) to Dow to build in 2014 (Table 5). In contrast, accounting for sealevel rise, a levee designed for a 100-y storm in 2050 under the baseline scenario should be 12% higher, which would increase costs to Dow by $2 million (2010 US$) (8%) ( Table 5). Value of coastal protection to Dow: Avoided storm damages, business interruption, and levee costs. In the absence of a protective levee, we project that property damage and business interruption to Dow from single storm events will increase in the future due to sea-level rise and coastal development (Table S5 and Figure 5). For example, we estimate a single Category 3 storm to result in $476 million (2010 US$) in property damage and $714 million (2010 US$) in business interruption for Dow under the baseline scenario under current conditions; however, in 2100 property damage from a Category 3 storm may be $684 million (2010 US$) and business interruption may be $1.03 billion (2010 US$). Importantly, Category 1 and 2 storms are not projected to have any impact on the facility under 2006, 2025, 2050, and 2075 conditions; however, by 2100, Category 2 storms may begin to have minor impacts on the facility due to sea-level rise, with $11 million (2010 US$) in estimated property damage and $17 million (2010 US$) in business interruption costs. The small effect of marshes on flood heights means that marshes in the natural defense and hybrid defense scenarios have a limited ability to protect Dow against property damages and business interruption from Category 3 and 4 storms and provide no protection against Category 5 storms at Stratton  Figure 5. Avoided costs (property damage, business interruption, and levee costs) relative to the baseline (marshes absent and assumed to be undeveloped dry land) scenario across defense scenario and hurricane storm category, by year, at Stratton Ridge (12 km inland). Natural defenses provide protective value by avoiding costs from hurricanes; however, the protective value from natural defenses in Freeport are much smaller than those from built and hybrid defense scenarios that include levees because the large hurricanes that reach the Stratton Ridge facility reduce the marshes ability to attenuate waves. Ridge (Figure 5). In contrast, levees in the built defense and hybrid defense scenarios prevent property damage and business interruption from Category 3 storms, because flood heights from these storms are below the design height of the levee ( Figure 5). Levees also provide some protection to Dow against Category 4 and 5 storms; however, some damage may still occur due to overtopping of the levee (Figure 5). For hurricanes smaller than Category 3, floods do not reach Stratton Ridge so there are costs for the levee but no avoided damages ( Figure 5). We estimate that the current annual loss expectancy (AEL) (total expected property damage and business interruption to Dow from hurricanes in a given year, calculated as the sum over each hurricane category 1-5 of the product of the losses from a single hurricane event of that category and the annual rate of occurrence of each category) is $53 million (2010 US$), or 4.4% of the total potential losses ($1215 million [2010 US $]), under the baseline scenario. Built and hybrid defense scenarios may reduce Dow's AEL to $35 million and $34 million (2010 US$), whereas the natural defense scenario would only reduce Dow's AEL to $52 million (2010 US$) ( Table 6). With future sea-level rise, we predict Dow's AEL under the baseline scenario to increase 28% from $53 million to $68 million (2010 US$) by 2100 (Table 6). Our method of calculating the annual rate of occurrence of storms based on the historic record of all hurricanes within 400 km of Freeport may have introduced bias into our AEL estimates. Not accounting for how storm-forcing parameters decrease with distance from the center of the storm bias our AEL estimates upward. In contrast, not accounting for a potential increase in the frequency and intensity of storms due to climate change (Knutson et al. 2010) may bias our AEL estimate downward. Analysis of the sensitivity of AEL to AE20% changes in the annual rate of occurrence of storms suggests that the AEL may range from $43 million to $64 million (2010 US$) under the baseline scenario for the current time period (Table 6). This range is nonoverlapping with the range for the built defense ($28-$42 million [2010 US$]) and hybrid defense scenario ($27-$41 million [2010 US$]), but it is overlapping with the range for the natural defense scenario ($42-$63 million [2010 US$]) ( Table 6). We estimate that the NPV over the next 30 years of coastal protection to Dow (defined as the discounted sum of avoided property damages, business interruption, and levee costs) from the built defense scenario is $217 million (2010 US$), the hybrid defense scenario is $229 million (2010 US$), and the natural defense scenario is $15 million (2010 US$) ( Figure 6). These results show that coastal protection provided by marshes to Dow, although small in this case, can be accounted for using the same metrics that are used to evaluate built defenses. At Freeport, the 5 km total of marsh in the natural defense scenario provide $15 million in coastal protection to Dow, reflecting model results showing that the property damage and business interruption costs with marshes are lower than under the baseline scenario. The value of coastal protection in the hybrid defense scenario is higher than in the built defense scenario because not only do marshes reduce property damage and business interruption, they also reduce levee heights and costs (although the modeled levee design changes are small enough that they would not be implemented at Freeport). The ordering of the NPV of the coastal defense options is not sensitive to changes in the private discount rate; however, as expected, lower discount rates increase the NPV of the coastal defense options (4%: built, $312 million; hybrid, $329 million; natural, $21 million), whereas higher discount rates decrease the NPV of the coastal defense options (10%: built, $160 million; hybrid, $168 million; natural, $11 million). The lack of an effect of the choice of discount rates on the ordering of the coastal defense options can be explained by the large differences between the NPV of each of the options as well as the fact that these values do not include maintenance costs. If the built defense option had higher maintenance costs than the natural defense option, which could be the case because habitats are somewhat self-maintaining, we might expect to see an increase in the value of the natural defense option and a decrease in the value of the built defense option. However, it is unlikely that this would make up the approximately $200 million difference in the value between the options. A sensitivity analysis of coastal protection values to industrial property values shows that for lower value properties (75th percentile) the value of coastal protection from the natural defense scenario (<$1 million [2010 US$]) remains positive but are smaller whereas the value from the built defense (\u00c0$20 million [2010 US$]) and hybrid defense (\u00c0$20 million [2010 US$]) scenarios becomes negative due to the relatively high cost of the levee as compared to the avoided property damage. Coastal protection values from all scenarios remain positive but are smaller by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude when the 90th percentile value for industrial property values is chosen instead of the 95th percentile (built defense: $3 million, hybrid defense: $4 million, natural defense: $2 million [2010 US$]). This suggests that natural defenses that can be maintained at little to no cost could be beneficial to property owners, such as small businesses with lower value property for which more expensive measures like levees are not warranted financially, but natural defenses would likely not substitute for built defenses that can protect against large hazards (Renaud et al. 2013). Value of coastal protection to the public and additional public ecosystem services provided by marshes. Beyond coastal protection values provided to Dow, we estimate that marshes in the study area could provide at least $117 million in benefits to local and global communities over the next 30 years ( Figure 6). Recreation accounts for the majority of the benefits ($115 million [2010 US$]), whereas protection of the local community from hurricanes makes a minor contribution ($4 million [2010 US$]). Due to the loss of marsh from sea-level rise and development, we project net C emissions beginning in 14 years, which would result in a cost to society of $2 million (2010 US$). Using declining social discount rates results in somewhat higher public benefits from recreation ($118 million [2010 US$]), similar public benefits from coastal protection ($4 million [2010 US$]), and higher costs to society from net C emissions ($4 million [2010 US$]). In contrast, we estimate that all of the 12 marine and estuarine associated fisheries species may benefit from trends in sea-level rise. This positive result for fisheries may mask some potential negative effects, because the species we considered are primarily associated with salt marsh and estuarine habitats and would not be affected by losses of upland freshwater marshes. In addition to fisheries species, 301 bird species (USFWS 2013) and numerous other species such as the American Alligator, the Texas Diamondback Terrapin, Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle, the Gulf Salt Marsh Snake, mollusks, sea grasses, and reeds (TPWD 2013) occur in marshes around Freeport. In fact, Freeport often reports one of the highest bird species counts in the United States (Audubon Society 2013). However, we predict that increases in threats to marshes may result in a decline in habitat quality, especially for transitional and regularly flooded marshes ( Figures S2 and S3). This trend in habitat quality may negatively affect biodiversity. The biophysical conditions at Stratton Ridge make it unlikely that explicit consideration of marshes will alter Dow's risk mitigation strategy based on benefits that accrue to Dow alone. However, if Dow accounted for ecosystem For results using depth-damage functions with structure and contents, see Table S2. services to the public and support for biodiversity to meet corporate sustainability goals, the hybrid defense scenario may be the preferred scenario over the built defense scenario because it provides more value to Dow and the community, while also supporting fisheries and wildlife ( Figure 6)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The integrated ecological economic assessment approach that we developed and applied here provides businesses new tools and insights to integrate ecosystem services into hurricane risk mitigation. Modeling of coastal protection services showed that sea-level rise and habitat loss will increase flood heights and levee costs in the future, but that natural defenses may reduce overall flood height and levee costs by attenuating waves. Large, rough marshes (e.g., those that include shrubs and trees) provide the greatest protection against small to medium size storms near the coastline. At Dow's Stratton Ridge facility (12 km inland), protection provided to Dow by marshes against a large storm (100-y) does not warrant a change in Dow's levee design; however, increases in flood heights due to sea-level rise may warrant a change in levee design. Moreover, marshes in front of the levees may help maintain the coastline in the face of sea-level rise and also provide additional benefits to the public, including recreation and support for fisheries and biodiversity. These results suggest that a hybrid defense option may be the best option to meet Dow's needs while also benefiting the public and nature. This study made 4 advances to the research and practice of ecosystem services and coastal risk mitigation. First, it developed an integrated ecological economic method to quantify and value hurricane protection based on sea-level rise and different LULC projections in a region of interest. Second, it developed and advanced replicable open-source models (available at http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org) for assessing the role of natural habitats in coastal protection as well as other ecosystem services from those habitats. Third, by analyzing the coastal protection ecosystem service model, it provided new insights into what habitat and site characteristics may result in the highest coastal protection values, which could be useful for screening. Fourth, it demonstrated the use of these models in a specific business decision. The study, however, is limited in that it took a relatively simple approach to modeling flooding and the value of public ecosystem services provided from marshes. Future research could address the flood modeling limitations by modeling surge and waves using more advanced hazard and hydrodynamic models and using site-specific habitat information (e.g., plant diameter, height and density of various marsh types). Other LULC scenarios could be modeled that account for the potential migration of mangroves into the area with climate change and evaluate the implications (negative and positive) for ecosystem services and biodiversity. Our results also suggest that future studies should focus on areas where habitats have the greatest potential, namely in maintaining shorelines against erosion associated with waves, smaller storms, and sea-level rise in areas with habitats that have a great extent (e.g., Louisiana marshes) or have high roughness (transitional marshes with trees, mangroves). For the purpose of informing the business decision for coastal defenses, we only included a sample of public ecosystem services and biodiversity metrics as supporting information. These services were selected because they could be reliably modeled using land cover data as inputs and because we anticipated that they would be relatively large in magnitude. Further research could provide a more comprehensive accounting of the public ecosystem services and biodiversity. In particular, the growing body of literature on green-gray or hybrid infrastructure should more fully consider the potential negative impacts of gray infrastructure on habitats, recognizing that regulations may not exist or may not fully protect wetlands and other resources from direct and indirect impacts (Stavins and Jaffe 1990). Such studies may be particularly important to help identify opportunities for private-public partnerships to enhance community resilience to coastal hazards (Stewart et al. 2009). This work could draw on the growing body of work exploring the value of public goods provided by wetlands (Brander et al. 2006) and best practices guides for incorporating this information into cost benefit analysis for coastal protection strategies (Penning-Rowsell et al. 2005). Building the tools and case study evidence base for assessing the role of natural habitats in coastal protection is an important step, but integrating natural defenses into hazard mitigation decisions will require addressing additional challenges. We identified 2 such business integration challenges during this research that may be common to accounting for other ecosystem services. First, businesses typically compare alternative investments by measuring the return on investment in terms of increased cash flows, but the return on investment for habitat protection or levees is measured as avoided damages or costs. Even though a levee investment does not increase cash flows, it may be warranted if there is high certainty that it will avoid costs, especially via avoiding potential business interruption that would reduce cash flows. Currently, we do not have the same level of certainty for natural defenses. This leads to the second challenge. Only technologies that achieve specific standards (Harry and Schroeder 2006) may be considered as potential solutions in certain business processes. Field and experimental validation of the coastal protection values of habitats may help address this challenge, although some uncertainty may still remain due to the natural variability in habitat coverage, physical characteristics, and, hence, functions. Accounting for the additional benefits provided Figure 6. Net present value (NPV) of the defense scenarios at Stratton Ridge (12 km inland). The hybrid defense scenario has the greatest value followed by the built defense scenario and the natural defense scenario. The hybrid defense scenario is $11 million (2010 US$) greater than the built defense accounting for values to Dow only, and $130 million (2010 US$) greater than the built defense scenario accounting for values to Dow and the public. Note that C sequestration values over this time period were negative (and small) due to the loss of the marsh habitat. by habitats to local communities and biodiversity may provide incentives to include habitat protection or restoration as part of an integrated risk management plan even if the certainty of coastal protection is not extremely high. More cross-sectoral research efforts and business applications are needed to overcome the challenges we highlighted and to identify cases where coastal protection values from habitats are significant. Using methods we developed here, businesses may find cases where unilaterally investing in habitat protection makes sense as part of an integrated coastal risk management plan, especially if the additional benefits to the public and biodiversity are considered. Alternatively, it may make more sense for businesses to lead multistakeholder or private-public investments in habitats, such as supporting the use of National Recreation Areas designed for recreation and storm buffering benefits (NPCA 2013). Fundamental attributes of businesses, such as lower transaction costs (Coase 1937) and information advantages (Barney 1991), may position businesses to be natural leaders for multistakeholder investments. Ultimately, we expect that businesses that apply these types of tools and build awareness of ecosystem services in their corporate cultures will have better business outcomes and better outcomes for society and nature.
