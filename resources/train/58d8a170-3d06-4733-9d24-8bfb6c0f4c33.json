In addition, multiple pathological processes co-occur in AD, including inflammation and innate immune response, synaptic and vascular dysfunction, or blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment ( Figure 1 ). Successful treatment of AD may require the targeting of several pathological processes. Therefore, there is a clear need for suitable biomarkers to track pathological processes and detect concomitant pathologies, diagnose more accurately, assess prognosis, monitor treatment response, test target engagement, and to stratify participants in research studies and clinical trials. CSF biomarkers are widely used in research and clinical practice but lumbar puncture, despite being a well tolerated procedure with a very low rate of adverse effects, is still an invasive procedure. 4 Therefore, increasing efforts have been made in recent years to develop biomarkers in more accessible biological matrices including urine, saliva, and blood. 5, 6 The development of blood biomarkers has become a priority in the AD field and several new developments have occurred over the last few months.\nIn this review, we will examine the current status of AD biomarkers in CSF and blood (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). Because recent evidence suggests that sex, gender, or both can have an influence on different aspects of AD, we also briefly discuss their effects on fluid biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 pathology", "text": "A\u03b2 peptides are generated physiologically by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), a type 1 transmembrane protein. APP can be cleaved by two pathways. The amyloidogenic pathway comprises the cleavage by the \u03b2-secretase enzyme (\u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) generating the \u03b2 soluble N-terminal fragment of APP (sAPP\u03b2) and the APP carboxy-terminal fragment (\u03b2CTF). \u03b2CTF is subsequently cleaved in the membrane by \u03b3-secretase and results in A\u03b2 peptides of variable lengths and the amyloid precursor intracellular domain (AICD). The 40-amino acid form (A\u03b240) is the predominant type in the brain in physiological conditions, but the 42-amino acid Overview of the main AD-related fluid biomarkers. The table depicts the changes observed in AD (prodromal, dementia, or both) compared with controls as follows: \u2191 increased or \u2193 decreased levels in most or all studies; = no changes; \u2248 inconsistent results; \u25cb unknown; NA not applicable. To complete these table, we reviewed all studies available in AlzBiomarker (https://www.alzforum.org/alzbiomarker) for GFAP, MCP-1, neurogranin, NfL, sAPP\u03b1, sAPP\u03b2, sTREM2, VILIP-1, YKL-40. For A\u03b2, t-tau, and p-tau we reviewed those studies in AlzBiomarker with a total number of patients >300. We also included other biomarkers not available in AlzBiomarker that we, however, found relevant for AD. form (A\u03b242) is the predominant type in amyloid plaques. 7 The AICD may act as a transcriptional regulator of several target genes and is thought to contribute to AD pathology. 8, 9 The nonamyloidogenic pathway comprises the cleavage by \u03b1-secretase resulting in the \u03b1 soluble N-terminal fragment of APP (sAPP\u03b1) and the APP carboxy-terminal fragment (\u03b1CTF).\n\u03b1 CTF is cleaved by \u03b3-secretase that generates a p3 fragment and an AICD fragment. 7, 10, 11 Of note, A\u03b2 pathology is highly associated with the APOE genotype. Individuals carrying APOE-\u03b54 develop more amyloid plaques when they age. 12, 13 The APOE-\u03b54 allele decreases the brain clearance of A\u03b2, triggering its aggregation. 14 In addition, the APOE-protein can bind A\u03b2, but its affinity differs between the three APOE isoforms. Thus, it is important to interpret amyloid-related biomarkers in the context of the APOE genotype. 15, 16 A\u03b2 peptides CSF A\u03b242, in combination with t-tau and p-tau, constitutes the widely accepted CSF signature for AD diagnosis. CSF A\u03b242 has a high diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between AD and controls and, in addition, it is helpful for distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. More importantly, CSF A\u03b242 allows us to identify AD in its preclinical stage. CSF A\u03b242 accurately predicts disease progression in cognitively unimpaired individuals and in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 17 In contrast with amyloid PET, CSF A\u03b242 plateaus early in the disease progression. 18, 19 Despite the high agreement between amyloid PET and CSF A\u03b242, there are some conflicting results that may be due to the fact that CSF A\u03b242 reflects a biological process preceding the aggregation of A\u03b2 detected with amyloid PET. 20 Recently, optimal centiloid cut-offs have been defined maximizing the agreement between the PET and CSF levels of A\u03b242. 21 However, the use of CSF A\u03b242 can be limited by the impact of pre-analytical factors and by interindividual differences in A\u03b2 production. These limitations can be partially overcome by normalizing A\u03b242 values with A\u03b240. A\u03b240 does not change in AD and its concentration in CSF is 10-times higher than that of CSF A\u03b242 and can, therefore, be used as a 'proxy' of total A\u03b2 levels. The CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio appears to be a better predictor of amyloid PET positivity in prodromal AD and performs better at distinguishing AD from other dementias than CSF A\u03b242 alone. 22, 23 Similar to CSF A\u03b240, CSF A\u03b238 does not vary between AD and controls and the CSF A\u03b242/ A\u03b238 ratio shows a comparable predictive potential to that of the CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. 22 Increasing efforts are focusing on the measurement of blood A\u03b2. Most previous studies demonstrated inconsistent results and a lack of correlation between CSF and blood A\u03b2. [24] [25] [26] That was probably due to the fact that A\u03b2 concentration in blood is low 27 and A\u03b2 measurements were affected by matrix effects. However, recent studies using ultrasensitive assays are very promising. A\u03b2 has been measured in blood using the Simoa platform, 28, 29 immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) [30] [31] [32] and stable isotope labeling kinetics followed by IP-MS. 33 . These studies have shown that blood A\u03b242, A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio, or both, correlate with those in CSF and with amyloid PET. [31] [32] [33] They have also shown that A\u03b242, A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio, or both differ between AD and controls or other diagnostic groups, although the magnitude of the difference is smaller than that found in CSF. The xMAP technology has been used to measure A\u03b242/A\u03b240. While a study demonstrated that A\u03b242/A\u03b240 could not predict AD, 34 other studies showed that pretreatment of plasma with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors may help to detect amyloid positive individuals. 35 37 Other A\u03b2 pathology biomarkers Soluble fragment sAPP\u03b1 or sAPP\u03b2 can be readily measured in CSF, but results are conflicting with regards to differences between AD and controls, or between progressive MCI and stable MCI. [38] [39] [40] [41] However, sAPP\u03b2 may be used as a target engagement biomarker of BACE inhibitors. BACE1 activity, or its protein levels, can be measured in CSF but there are some inconsistencies in the results for AD patients. Most studies showed an increase on BACE1 (either activity journals.sagepub.com/home/tan 5 or protein levels) in AD compared with controls. [41] [42] [43] In addition, patients with MCI appear to have higher levels of BACE1 activity and protein levels compared with controls or AD patients, and BACE1 has been shown to be a good progression marker in MCI patients. 44 However, other studies have reported different results, including no differences in BACE1 activity between controls, MCI and AD, or even decreased CSF levels in AD compared with controls. 45 53, 54 In addition, it is important to note that t-tau is measured using antibodies against the mid-domain, and there are other truncated tau forms in CSF that are being investigated.\nIn contrast, CSF p-tau is considered to be a biomarker of tau deposition in AD. In fact, CSF p-tau appears normal or only slightly increased in most of the other neurological diseases. Thus, CSF p-tau is a more specific biomarker for AD.\nIn the recently published AT(N) system, 2 CSF t-tau and p-tau, account for neurodegeneration (N) and tau pathology (T), respectively. However, these two biomarkers are highly correlated and it is difficult to determine which component of each biomarker reflects neurodegeneration and tau pathology. Phosphorylation at threonine 181 (p-tau 181 ) is the most widely used target as a p-tau biomarker in the clinical setting and increases very early in the AD continuum, even before tau PET becomes positive.\nOther tau species are increased in AD, including those phosphorylated in other mid-domain residues (threonine 231, serine 199, and 231) and C-terminal residues (Serine 396 and 404). 55 Of note, the abundance of several other phosphorylation sites in tau differs in the brain and CSF of individuals with and without AD. 56 In addition to being validated diagnostic markers of AD, CSF t-tau and p-tau are useful biomarkers to stage the disease, predict its prognosis, and monitor drug response. Tau deposition follows disease progression more effectively and has a stronger correlation with cognitive status than A\u03b2. 57,58 However, longitudinal studies have shown that CSF t-tau and p-tau, and other neurodegeneration markers, may decrease in advanced stages of the disease. CSF t-tau and p-tau have been shown to be good predictors of progression from cognitively unimpaired to MCI and progression to AD dementia. 17 CSF t-tau and p-tau are normally monitored in clinical trials, but the association between these biomarkers and the therapeutic response remains unclear.\nSimilarly to blood A\u03b2, the introduction of ultrasensitive immunoassays now allows the reliable measurement of tau in blood. Before this, most studies showed considerable variability in results. 26 Using the ultrasensitive techniques, several groups have shown an increase in blood t-tau in AD compared with controls, 59-62 but the overlapping values between groups precludes their use as a diagnostic tool. In addition, plasma t-tau predicts cognitive decline and the risk of dementia. 59, 60, 63 The measurement of blood p-tau is technically challenging but promising results are being produced.

Among the neurofilaments, NfL has the most promising results as a biomarker. NfL leaks into the CSF after neuronal and axonal damage. CSF NfL increases in multiple neurological diseases and is widely accepted as a nonspecific biomarker of axonal injury. [68] [69] [70] Of note, this increase is more prominent in the neurological diseases where there is axonal degeneration, white matter injury, or both, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), FTLD, and CJD.\nThe development of ultrasensitive techniques enables the accurate measurement of NfL in blood. Blood NfL levels closely correlate with those of CSF. 71, 72 Therefore, blood NfL can be considered to be a noninvasive proxy of CSF NfL. Plasma or serum NfL levels are increased in AD and MCI compared with controls and in other neurological diseases. [72] [73] [74] [75] More importantly, blood and CSF NfL levels increase many years before the symptom onset in autosomaldominant AD, [76] [77] [78] and in Down syndrome. 79 In addition, CSF and blood NfL are associated with disease severity markers including brain atrophy, glucose hypometabolism, and cognitive impairment, which favors its use as a disease staging biomarker. 71, 80 Finally, increasing agreement favors the use of NfL, instead of t-tau, as an independent marker of neurodegeneration 'N' in the AT(N) classification for AD. 3 Visinin-like protein 1 Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) is a calcium sensor protein that is highly expressed in neurons. 81 Intracellular VILIP-1 expression is decreased in AD, especially in the entorhinal cortex. 82 VILIP-1 in CSF is correlated with t-tau and p-tau, supporting the theory that VILIP-1 is a neuronal injury biomarker. 83 Most studies, except one 84 have shown that VILIP-1 is increased in AD compared with controls, 26, 83, 84 . Further studies have suggested that it could help to differentiate AD from other dementias. [85] [86] [87] In addition, VILIP-1 has been shown to predict cognitive impairment and atrophy rates and to identify the MCI individuals that will progress to AD dementia. 84, [87] [88] [89] Longitudinal measurements in late-onset AD and autosomal-dominant AD have shown that the initial increase in CSF VILIP-1 is ameliorated as dementia develops, similar to what happens with other neural injury markers including CSF t-tau. 90, 91 Studies on blood VILIP-1 are limited, but a significant increase in plasma VILIP-1 has been reported in AD compared with controls. 87 In autosomal-dominant AD mutation carriers, VILIP-1 was also found to be increased but this finding did not not reach statistical significance. 90 "}, {"section_title": "Synaptic dysfunction", "text": "Synapse dysfunction and eventual synapse loss is an early process in AD pathogenesis. 92, 93 Pathological studies have demonstrated that synapse loss is closely associated with cognitive impairment. 94, 95 Synaptic biomarkers can be classified as presynaptic (axonal) and postsynaptic (dendritic) biomarkers.

The CSF/serum albumin ratio was associated with CSF NfL but not with AD CSF core biomarkers, suggesting that BBB damage is not a specific feature of AD. 121 Other biomarkers that have been proposed to reflect BBB integrity include tight junction proteins, the proinflammatory cytokine CypA, MMP-9, and blood-derived fibrinogen and plasminogen. 122 In addition, the CSF soluble plateletderived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (sPDGFR-\u03b2) has been proposed as a marker of pericyte breakdown. 117, 123 The endothelial markers, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) have been studied in AD. Previous investigations of CSF and blood VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 have produced conflicting results, but a recent study found that the CSF levels of these biomarkers were increased in preclinical, prodromal, and dementia stages of AD, and correlated with CSF tau, A\u03b2, cortical thinning, and subsequent cognitive deterioration in nondemented patients. 124 In addition, the same study found that an increase in CSF IL-15 and Flt-1, which are proteins also related to vascular dysfunction and inflammation. Blood levels of VCAM-1 are increased in AD and vascular dementia patients compared with elderly controls. 125, 126 Inflammation Inflammation and innate immunity play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis from the very early stages. [127] [128] [129] Misfolded and aggregated A\u03b2 and tau proteins bind to pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia and trigger an innate immune response. 127 This inflammatory response is heterogeneous and may have a beneficial effect (e.g. clearance of A\u03b2 and tau deposits, removal of cellular debris) 130 or, in contrast, a detrimental one (e.g. accelerated neurodegeneration). 131 In addition, the pattern of neuroinflammatory response may change throughout the AD continuum, exerting opposite effects at different stages. 132 Several inflammatory-related biomarkers are available but only help to determine partial aspects of the complex innate immune response. Thus, there is a need to develop and validate biomarkers, or combinations of them, that reflect different patterns of inflammatory response along the Alzheimer's continuum. Unfortunately, results on inflammatory-related biomarkers are inconsistent between studies. 133, 134 In this study we review the most promising ones."}, {"section_title": "Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2", "text": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor of the immunoglobulin family that is expressed on the plasma membrane of myeloid lineage cells, including microglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). TREM2 has multiple roles in microglia including migration, proliferation, cytokine release, phagocytosis, lipid sensing, APOE binding, and shielding of amyloid plaques. [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease and FTD-like syndrome, that are rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by an early-onset frontal syndrome and, in Nasu-Hakola disease, by a concomitant bone involvement. 142, 143 Low frequency coding variants in TREM2 have also been associated with an increased risk for AD 144, 145 and other neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 is a type-1 transmembrane protein that is shed at the C-terminus of histidine 157 by ADAM10 and 17, and its soluble ectodomain (sTREM2) is released into the extracellular space 138, 146 and can be measured in CSF and blood. 138, 147 CSF sTREM2 may reflect the amount of TREM2 competent signaling on the surface of microglia and can, therefore, be used as a marker of the TREM2-mediated microglia response. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still not known whether sTREM2 has a specific biological function other than acting as a decoy receptor opposing full-length TREM2 signaling.\nMost studies have reported increased levels of CSF sTREM2 in AD versus controls, 128,148-155 although this was not found in all studies. 138, 156 Further studies have demonstrated that CSF sTREM2 dynamically changes throughout the AD continuum and reaches a peak in the later asymptomatic stages and early symptomatic stages of late-onset AD and autosomal-dominant AD. 128,150,151,155 CSF sTREM2 is closely associated with tau-related neurodegeneration but not with A\u03b2 pathology. 150 In addition, CSF sTREM2 increases in MS and other neuroinflammatory diseases, 147, 157 HIV1 infections, 158 in dementia patients with delirium, 159 and in those patients with a biomarker profile for suspected non-Alzheimer pathology (SNAP). 150, 151 This suggests that a TREM2-mediated microglial response occurs whenever there is neural injury, and not only in AD. Of note, CSF sTREM2 normalizes in MS after treatment with natalizumab or mitoxantrone, 157 which indicates that CSF sTREM2 may be used to test treatment response. In contrast, CSF sTREM2 has not been shown to be increased in HD, 160 FTLD, 138, 161 or in repetitive head impacts. 162 Despite the changes found in CSF sTREM2 in AD, there is a considerable overlap in the values between AD and controls that precludes its use as a diagnostic marker. However, there is one situation where sTREM2 may be useful for diagnostic purposes. Both CSF and blood sTREM2 are undetectable in patients with Nasu-Hakola disease and FTD-like syndrome. 138, 156 Individuals bearing low frequency TREM2 coding variants, in contrast, may have increased, decreased, or unchanged sTREM2 levels compared with noncarriers of these variants. 148, 150, 153, 163 A major question in this field is whether TREM2 has a beneficial or a detrimental effect. Human neuroimaging cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that higher CSF sTREM2 is associated with increased gray matter volume and reduced diffusivity in early AD. 164, 165 More importantly, a recent longitudinal study in the ADNI cohort has demonstrated that in individuals with biomarker evidence of amyloid and tau pathology, regardless of the clinical syndrome, higher CSF sTREM2 at baseline is associated with an attenuated decline in memory and global cognition at follow-up. 130 In addition, common variants of the MS4A gene are associated with increased CSF sTREM2 concentrations. Of interest, these variants are additionally associated with reduced AD risk and delayed age at onset of disease. 163 Altogether, this suggests a beneficial effect of TREM2 function.\nIn contrast with CSF sTREM2, blood sTREM2 has been considerably less studied. No changes have been found in plasma or serum sTREM2 in MS, neuroinflammatory diseases, AD, FTD, or PD. 138, 147, 148, 153 Of interest, higher serum sTREM2 levels predict a higher risk of developing dementia in the Japanese population. 166 "}, {"section_title": "Progranulin", "text": "Progranulin is a secreted glycoprotein mainly expressed in activated microglia and, to a lesser extent, in neurons in the CNS.

However, the use of TDP-43 as a biomarker is restricted by the technical difficulties to specifically detect the protein. 215 \u03b1-synuclein pathology \u03b1-synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are intracellular inclusions that constitute the pathological hallmark of PD and DLB. 216 In addition, \u03b1-synuclein aggregates can be found in multiple system atrophy (MSA), predominantly in oligodendrocytes and neurons. 217 In combination, PD, DLB, and MSA are referred to as \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Of interest, over half of AD patients (including lateonset AD, autosomal-dominant AD, and Down syndrome) have Lewy pathology, especially in the amygdala. 218, 219 The pathological contribution of \u03b1-synuclein in AD is unclear, but it may promote \u03b2-amyloid and tau aggregation. 220,221 CSF \u03b1-synuclein has mainly been studied as a biomarker for \u03b1-synucleinopathies and most studies have observed a decrease in CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels in PD and DLB compared with controls or AD. [222] [223] [224] [225] In AD, CSF \u03b1-synuclein is slightly higher compared with controls. 26, 226 CSF \u03b1-synuclein is higher in those MCI patients that rapidly progress to AD. 227 Of interest, a set of AD patients have high CSF p-tau but low CSF \u03b1-synuclein, and it has been speculated that this may reflect AD patients with Lewy bodies. In CJD, CSF \u03b1-synuclein is significantly increased. 222, 228 In blood, no differences have been found in plasma \u03b1-synuclein between AD and controls, 229, 230 but one study observed that plasma \u03b1-synuclein increased in PD compared with controls. 231 Of note, most studies on \u03b1-synuclein have measured the full-length protein and research is being carried out to detect \u03b1-synuclein fragments and oligomers in biological fluids. It is also important to note that \u03b1-synuclein biomarkers may simply reflect age-related copathologies rather than specific AD pathologies."}, {"section_title": "Sex differences in fluid AD biomarkers", "text": "There is an increasing body of evidence that sex, gender, or both have an effect on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, course, and treatment response in AD. This is, however, a complex topic because multiple social and biological factors are involved. We will focus on sex differences, although gender (i.e. social and cultural differences rather than biological) have an impact on AD. 232, 233 The prevalence of AD dementia is higher in women than in men 234 and women appear to have a faster cognitive decline and brain atrophy rate once symptoms have started. 235 Some AD risk factors (e.g. depression and sleep disorders) are more prevalent in women 232, 236 and APOE-\u03b54 confers a greater AD risk in women than men. 237 In addition, early menopause is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline and AD neuropathology. 238, 239 Thus, understanding the role of sex in AD is crucial to develop a precision medicine approach in AD. 232 Although sex is generally included as a covariable in biomarker studies, only a few studies specifically focus on the effect of sex in biomarkers. Table 2 reviews the main differences on AD-related biomarkers between women and men. In most studies, no sex differences have been found in AD core biomarkers. [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] However, a few studies found higher basal levels of t-tau in women compared with men in the whole cohort, 243 or solely in the AD group, 245 which is consistent with the fact that women have higher levels of tau pathology compared with men in pathological and PET studies. 246, 247 In addition, the association between APOE-\u03b54 and CSF t-tau and p-tau is stronger in women than in men. 240, 243 Although most studies did not find differences in A\u03b242 between women and men, one study demonstrated a modifying effect of gender and APOE on the evolution of CSF A\u03b242 linked to age. Specifically, women carrying an APOE-\u03b54 allele have stable CSF A\u03b242 levels until the age of 50 years old but they then show a faster decline. 242 With regard to other biomarkers, the data available on sex differences is limited. A recent study including patients along the AD continuum found higher CSF NfL levels in men than in women. 186 CSF sAPP\u03b1 and sAPP\u03b2 have been reported to be higher in women with AD, 248 and CSF E-selectin and ICAM1 and VCAM1 are higher in men. 124, 242 Inflammatory biomarkers are the markers that appear to be more influenced by sex. CSF progranulin is consistently higher in men than in women 174,175,178 but, surprisingly, plasma or serum progranulin are higher in women. In addition, CSF sTREM2 may be slightly higher in men, although the difference is not as pronounced as in CSF progranulin. 148"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Overall, the effect of sex and gender on AD and, in particular, on AD fluid biomarkers, requires further research because it will help to improve the understanding of the disease and, especially, in the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies. The Women's Brain Project and the Alzheimer Precision Medicine Initiative have recently published some recommendations to improve the design, analysis, and reporting of sex and gender differences in future studies. 232"}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Elsa Velasco for the scientific illustrations included in this review.
