The questionnaire was first mailed in March 1989. A follow up mailing to nonrespondents occurred in early May, and a second in September 1989. Of the 72,555 individuals in the sample, 2,160 were deceased or otheiwise out-of-scope of the survey, including those who indicated on a previous survey that they held a doctorate from a foreign institution and were foreign citizens living outside the United States. This resulted in an active sample of 70,395 scientists and engineers. Analysis of undeliverable questionnaires showed an estimated 61,982 individuals were contacted. A total of 38,799 survey responses was returned. The survey overall response rates were 55.1 percent for the active sample and 62.6 percent of those contacted. The overall response rate for the 1989 active sample reflects respective declines of 3.0 and 8.3 percentage points below 1987 and 1985 levels.

Responses were assigned a weight that is the product of the sample weight for the stratum from which the sample case was drawn and the nonresponse adjustment factor.' No adjustments were made for item nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "Reliability s", "text": "The statistics in this report are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling variability occurs because a sample rather than an entire population is surveyed. Sampling errors are developed using a generalized procedure. Approximations were required in order to derive sampling errors that would be applicable to 3 wide variety of items. As a result, these sampling errors provide an indication of the order of magniti de of a sampling error rather than a precise sampling error for any specific item. The sampling error tables are The nonresponse adjustment factor is the number of survey sample cases in the stratum divided by the number of responses in the stratum. The sample weights (Ws) and the response weights (Wr) for each stratum were computed as follows: Web = (Na/na) where Nh and nb are the respective population and sample sizes of stratum (h). Wrb = f(Nb/nb)*(nbirb)) where nb is the number of survey sample cases in the stratum and rb is the number of survey responses in that stratum. 'The data and material on sampling reliability presented here are from The-MethPdolozical Report pf tbe 1989 Suryev of nisigigiBmigen.tg (Washington, D.C.: Office of Scientific and Enigineering Penonnel, National Research Council, 1991). derived from standard error equations and special parameters developed by the Bureau of the Census. Information is provided in table A-2 which permits the user to calculate approximate standard errors for totals using the formula: s = + bxr where \"x\" equals the estimated total and \"a\" and \"b\" are regression coefficients. Values of \"a\" and \"b\" by S&E fields for selected groups are given.6 Tables A-3 through A-6 present approximate standard errors associated with total subgroup size for different segments of the doctoral population. Tables A-7 through A-10 present standard error estimates for the estimated percent7 of a subgroup having a particular characteristic. Alternately, the approximate standard error of the percent may be estimated directly using the formula: where p equals the percent possessing the specific characteristic and x and y represent the numerator and denominator, respectively, of the ratio which yields the observed percent. The standard error estimates included in this report provide approximations of sampling reliability. They should not be considered precise measures.a In addition to sampling error, data is subject to nonsampling error. Sources of nonsampling error include nonresponse bias, whicii arises whcn individuals who do not respond to a survey differ significantly from those who do and measurement error, which arises when we are not able to precisely measure the variables of interest. These sources of error are much harder to estimate than sampling errors. f'The generalisad error estimates in this report were based on a set of assumptions which in the case of some small subpopulations did not appear to hold. In such cases, the parameters listed for a higher-level field within a demographic group or a higher-level demographic group within a field was considered a useful substitute as a generalised error estimate. 'Based on the ratio of two estimated totals, where the numerator is a subset of the denominator. rThe standard error estimates were derived from generalised functions based on a limited set of characteristics and may overstate the error associated with estimates drawn from strata with high sampling fractions. See The Methodological Report pf she 1919 Su.v ..0.213.taltkiEgiPilla 0P. IA 54 57 in order to obtain information on possible nonresponse bias the NRC conducted a nonresponse bias study, This study indicated that there are some statistically significant differences between respondents and nonrespondents. The major findings include: o The size of the US. population and labor force of doctoral scientists and engineers may have been overestimated in 1989 by about 4 percent because a higher proportion of nonrespondents than respondents were located outside the United States. o The unemployment rate of U.S. nonrespondents was the same as that of the respondents. This is evidence that published 1989 unemployment rates may not have been affected by nonresponse bias. o Sector of employment was considerably affected by nonresponse bias: those employed in educational institutions may have been overestimated by about 5 percentage points, and those employed in business/industry may have been underestimated by about 3 percentage points. o Tenure status also showed evidence of nonresponse bias: of those employed in 4-year colleges and universities, those not tenured may have been underestimated by about 4 percentage points. Little direct information about measurement errors in the SDR exists. However, experience with minor question changes indicates that some variables may be subject to sizeable measurement problems. For example, in 1987 the question on primary work activity was reworded by providing definitions of basic and appNed research."}, {"section_title": "Notes on the Tables", "text": "The following notes facilitate use of data in the detailed tables. Field was derived primarily from responses to question 9 that requested the name and title of the specialty most closely related to the respondent's principal employment. The code was selecte4 by respondents from the Employment Specialties List included with the questionnaire. Individuals who did not report S&E employment were assigned the specialty of their doctoral degree. Australasia = Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines. Primary work activity was determined from responses to question 12. i'Development\" includes the development of equipment, products, and systems as well as the design of equipment, processes and models. The 1987 questionnaire was reworded to include definitions of basic and applied research. Federal support was determined from responses to question 16. The reference period used for this question changed in 1987. The 1989 and 1987 questionnaires used \"the past year\" as the reference period, whereas prior surveys varied from the month of February, to a particular week in February, to the week defined by a particular day in February. Therefore, the data from survey years prior to 1987 are not comparable. Tenure status was obtained from the response to question 11. The question was reworded in 1979 to gather information on tenure track in addition to the basic question on tenure. Due to the introduction of additional categories in 1979, the data from prior survey years are not comparable. Salary data were derived from responses to question 14, which requested information regarding annual salary before deductions for income tax, social security, retirement, etc., but excluding bonuses, overtime, summer teaching, or other payment for professional work. Salaries reported are median annual salaries, rounded to the nearest $100 and computed for full-time employed civilian scientists and engineers only. Differences betwGen calendar-year salaries (11 to 12 months) and academic-year salaries (9 to 10 months) for individuals employed in educational institutions have been accommodatej by multiplying academic-year salaries by eleven-ninths to adjust to a calendar-year scale. For individuals not reporting whether their salary was for an academic or calendar-year, calendar year was used as the default category. Approximately, 10 percent of full-time employed scientists and engineers failed to make this distinction and approximately half of those had not reported any salary. Racial/ethnic data were based on questions relating to race and Hispanic heritage. The race/ethnic data appearing in the time-series tables of this report may differ significantly from estimates published prior to 1983. At that time, an analysis of racial/ethnic information found that there were inaccuracies in these data, especially in the reported numbers of Hispanics and Native Americans. Accordingly, racial/ethnic data for all previous survey years were modified before being entered on the 1983 files. For subsequent doctorate recipients, racial/ethnic identity was taken from the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The race/ethnic identity is not changed once an SED response has already been received. As a result of these modifications, race/ethnic data have become more accurate and stable over time. Labor force participation rate. The labor force is defined as those employed (E) and those unemployed but seeking work (U). The labor force participation rate (R,,,) is the ratio of the labor force to the population (P). Rip = (E+U)/P S&E employment rate.
