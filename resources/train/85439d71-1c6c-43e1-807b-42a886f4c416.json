In 1998, a total of 59,195 acres (15.4 percent) of the island of Oahu were classified as agricultural land use; 98,663 acres (25.7 percent) were classified as developed; 1,522 acres (0.4 percent) were classified as barren/mining; and 224,331 acres (58.5 percent) were classified as other. An accuracy assessment identified 98 percent accuracy for all land-use classes. In windward (moister) areas, dense vegetation and canopy cover along with rapid recolonization by vegetation potentially obscured land use from photo-interpretation.

Land use is one of the most influential human activities affecting water quality and natural resources in Hawaii. Land use affects the quality of water through modification of drainage and infiltration patterns, modification of vegetative cover, and the addition of physical and chemical compounds. Knowledge of land-use spatial patterns and change is necessary information for natural and cultural resource management. For example, soil and agricultural resource management require inventory and monitoring of land resources as identified in land-use maps; water-quality conditions can be compared between watersheds with similar or different land uses; and planning for future agriculture and development activities requires data on existing land use, trends, and resource availability. In Hawaii, there are a range of use intensities and great variability in the scale (areal extent) of these uses. Patterns of land use reflect multiple influences, including land ownership, available water resources, soil type, and economic opportunity. A description of land use during 1998 provides a reference for describing the dynamic nature of land use and its influence on resources of the island of Oahu. Hawaii's landscape provides a background for juxtapositions and contrasts in land use. For example, traditional, subsistence agriculture can be found immediately adjacent to industrial areas and resort tourist destinations. And because of Hawaii's tropical location centered in the Pacific Ocean, many land-use practices are specialized, such as hybrid seed-corn research with a 3 to 4 crop per year rotation and ginger root cultivation by land lease-holders with an approximately 5-year return interval to minimize nematode infestation. Recently, land use has changed rapidly and"}, {"section_title": "Land Use on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii, 1998", "text": "By Frederick L. Klasner and Clinton D.

This report and accompanying data set provide a generalized map of land use on the island of Oahu, including developed (sometimes referred to as urban) and agricultural areas, as well as barren areas resulting from mining or similar resource extraction. The land uses identified and mapped from 1998 and 1999 digital orthophotographs (DOQs) document land-use patterns through photointerpretation. These results may differ from the actual land use. Appropriate product use. There are a wide variety of appropriate uses for this product, including research, comparative land-use and land-cover analyses, and identification of generalized urban and suburban development or agricultural practices (including identification of land-use change and urban encroachment upon agricultural or coastal areas). Although the State tax map key and zoning designations are sometimes referred to as \"land use\" in Hawaii, the land use identified and delineated in this report reflects the classification system described. No effort was made to identify or delineate along legal or other boundaries. Accordingly, appropriate use of this product is best limited to applications where remotely sensed imagery is needed for identifying land use restricted to agriculture, developed, and barren/mining areas. The land-use map is intended for use at 1:24,000-scale or smaller. This product can be used in conjunction with other natural and cultural resource investigations to form a more comprehensive picture of land use and land cover in Hawaii. The Hawaii Natural Heritage Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), among others, are identifying and delineating what is here defined as \"other\" land-use and land-cover types (conservation, forest reserve, natural areas, and naturally or non-maintained barren, wetlands, forested, shrubland, or herbaceous cover types, see appendix A). Developed, agricultural, barren, and other land uses also were mapped using similar techniques during the late 1970s (U.S. Geological Survey, 1979). This and other previous investigations provide comparable reference materials for investigating land-use change."}, {"section_title": "Previous Investigations", "text": "The USGS described land use in Hawaii as early as the 1880s (Dutton, 1884). The USGS GIRAS (Geographic Information and Analysis System) protocol for collecting land-use and land-cover data (Mitchell and others, 1977) was applied on Oahu and throughout Hawaii (U.S. Geological Survey, 1979;U.S. Geological Survey, 1980), using the land-use and land-cover classification system established by Anderson and others (1976). Hawaiian land divisions are described by Chinen (1958), with assignment of land ownership in the 1840s \"Great Mahele\" providing a common reference point for identifying early land ownership, land use, and landuse change in the Hawaiian Islands (see Moffat and Fitzpatrick, 1995). The Hawaiian Government Survey from the late 1800s provides one of the first detailed, comprehensive, and consistent land maps of the main Hawaiian islands. Territorial Planning Board reports for Hawaii provide a general perspective on land use for the first half of the 1900s (see for example, Territorial Planning Board, 1939). The U.S. Department of Agriculture, University of Hawaii, and State of Hawaii, Department of Agriculture produced a variety of reports and maps for documentation and planning purposes, such as \"Agricultural Land-Use Planning in the Territory of Hawaii, 1940\" (Coulter, 1940 and \"Detailed Land Classification -Island of Oahu\" (Sahara and others, 1972). The \"Inventory of Available Information on Land Use in Hawaii\" (Harland Bartholomew and Associates, 1957) and the University of Hawaii, Land Study Bureau's (1971) annotated bibliography provide summaries of available land-use products for the State of Hawaii."}, {"section_title": "Description of the Study Area", "text": "The study area encompasses the entire island of Oahu and populated islets, using the shoreline identified in the 1999, 1:24,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.

The resident population of Oahu, which has more than doubled since 1950, was about 876,000 in 2000. The actual population, which includes an average number of visitors to the island at any time, was about 923,400 in 1998. The State of Hawaii zoning classification for land use on Oahu in 1999 was about 40 percent conservation, 34 percent agriculture, and 26 percent urban (State of Hawaii, 1999). The principal industry is tourism, followed by military activities and agriculture. Major land use changes are occurring in central Oahu. During the past several decades, plantation agriculture, primarily sugarcane and pineapple, which dominated for approximately 100 years, has declined and in its place has been an incursion of suburban development and a shift to diversified agriculture, including flowers, vegetables, fruits, and aquaculture.

These existing methodologies and classifications systems were adapted to better reflect land use in Hawaii. These adaptations, essentially selections among existing methodologies, emphasized consistent use of data sources, establishment of a hierarchical classification system, repeatable land-use identification and delineation techniques, field verification, accuracy assessment, and documentation."}, {"section_title": "Classification System", "text": "\"National Land Cover Data -Land Cover Class Definitions\" (U.S. Geological Survey, 2001) were customized to better represent tropical Pacific island land uses. Five primary criteria governed the modification of existing land-use classification systems (see Gilliom and Thelin, 1997): 1relevance to existing land-use management practices, (2) scale of the classification system appropriate for the scale of analysis and collapsible to more general classification systems, (3) transferable to smaller scales and to remote sensing source data of differing scales, (4) criteria for defining categories are stable over time, (5) classification system is practicable and applicable to other areas-particularly other Hawaiian and Pacific islands. This classification system emphasizes human use of land, in general categories of agriculture, developed, and barren/mining. This classification system was not structured for other land uses (defined by land-cover type as water, barren, wetland, forest, shrubland, or herbaceous, see appendix A). In addition to the National Land Cover Data class definitions, other land-use mapping reports were used to refine the classification system (table 1, at end of report), including: the Middle Rio Grande Basin study (Mladinich, 1999), NOAA C-CAP protocols (Dobson and others, 1995), and Anderson and others (1976). Koterba's (1998) and Gilliom and Thelin's (1997) classification systems were adapted to address agriculture and water-quality concerns. Agriculture categories were refined with local NRCS staff, integrating plant morphology, spatial arrangement of fields, and crop types as defined by the State of Hawaii (Hawaii Agriculture Statistics Service, 1999). Developed categories were refined by Oahu NAWQA Study Unit staff, emphasizing typical development patterns in Hawaii. The classification structure indicates the primary land use interpreted from the source data. For example, combined commercial-residential properties are classified according to the majority use. Agriculture, military, and tourism activity in Hawaii required special attention when classifying land use. For example, diversified agriculture development and promotion programs have resulted in areas with diverse agriculture practices intermixed with residential land uses. Military land uses such as offices, residences, ammunition storage bunkers, communications infrastructure, and other military equipment occupy a significant portion of land on Oahu. These uses are identified as developed, and are segregated by the type and density of development, as opposed to land ownership. Military target and bombing ranges in a natural or semi-natural state are not treated as agriculture or developed land uses. The hierarchical classification system provides generalized, less precise identification of land use at level 1 or level 2. More precise identification of land use is described in level 3 or level 4. Uncertainty or generalization in land-use identification is indicated by the use of only generalized categories; for example, where the type of orchard crop could not be identified, the land use is Agriculture (level 1), Planted/cultivated (level 2), Orchard (level 3), and no crop specific identifier (level 4) is provided. Definitions of land-use levels 1 through 4 for agricultural and developed categories and levels 1 and 2 for barren/mining categories are in table 1."}, {"section_title": "Source Data", "text": "Multiple sources of data were used to identify land use, primarily 1-m (3.3 ft) ground resolution black-andwhite DOQs, from 1998(U.S. Geological Survey, 1996.

Recognition elements (observable characteristics) interpreted from the image data included shape, size, pattern, shadow, tone, texture, association, and site (Avery and Berlin, 1985). Photointerpretation was completed on computer workstations using ESRI's (Environmental Systems Research Institute) ArcView GIS (version 3.2) software. The DOQ data was displayed in its original datum and projection (Universal Transverse Mercator [UTM] zone 4 projection, North American Datum 1983 [NAD83]). The shoreline identified, the seaward limit of SEA/OCEAN (the approximate line of mean high water) from 1999, 1:24,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset for Oahu, determined the spatial extent of land use. Minimum mapping units of 2.0 ha (4.9 acres) and a minimum polygon width of 30 m (98.4 ft) were used. Areas (slivers) that did not meet these minimum criteria were evaluated individually and absorbed into the adjacent polygon as appropriate. Some map-worthy ground features were slightly exaggerated or generalized in area or width to meet the minimum size requirements (see Mladinich, 1999). Some features too small to be collected were collapsed into a single feature. The data was interpreted and compiled in blocks of USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangles. Quadrangle land-use data was edge-matched and paneled together in a seamless unit. All polygons contain one label point, are closed, and adjacent polygons do not have identical attributes. Agriculture, developed, and barren/mining land uses were identified according to the classification system. Other areas (water, wetland, forest, shrubland, and herbaceous land uses, appendix A) were identified as \"other.\" The areal extent of each land use was delineated to the most detailed possible category in the classification system-a more general category was used when land use could not be identified to the more detailed category.

Also, a minimum of one field validation plot was located in each land-use category found in each USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle. Expert assessments were also made, with NRCS field staff identifying local agricultural land uses. Collaborators, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture, helped ensure that remote developed areas were not overlooked. NOAA C-CAP land-cover data were used for verification. On the basis of these procedures, adjustments were made to polygon boundaries and land-use categories."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment", "text": "Accuracy of mapped land use was evaluated using randomly generated locations, stratified by level 1 land use.

Of these 250 accuracy assessment locations, onefifth (50) were within areas where land use was classified as \"other\" (level 1), two-fifths (100) of the samples were within areas classified as agriculture (level 1), and the remaining two-fifths (100) were within areas classified as developed or barren/mining (level 1). Accuracy was assessed through review of image data sources for each location. Land use was considered accurate if the same land-use attributes and boundaries were photointerpreted during the accuracy assessment. Ancillary data sources were used when original image data sources did not provide adequate detail. If uncertainty remained regarding land use after the accuracy assessment, site visits were made to the location."}, {"section_title": "LAND USE", "text": "The hierarchical land-use classification system emphasized human use and land surface modification interpreted from digital aerial photographs. The categories presented reflect land use on Oahu. Other Pacific islands may include additional land uses; for example, orchard crops such as lychee (Litchi spp.) are present on the island of Hawaii, but were not found on Oahu in areas large enough to meet the minimum mapping unit criteria. Also, agriculture practices may evolve such that a plant currently cultivated only as horticulture may some day also be grown as a row crop. Additional landuse studies would likely need to add categories to the hierarchical classification to address such changes. Land use was identified, in the most general categories, as agriculture, developed, barren/mining, and other. While not intended to be exclusive, these generalized categories required interpretive decisions, such as where small-scale farms were mixed with residential areas. Similar decisions were made at more detailed levels of the classification system. The total land area studied for this report was 383,711 acres: 382,711 acres on the island of Oahu, 455 acres on Ford Island, 514 acres on Sand Island, 8 acres on Mokauea Island (near Sand Island), and 23 acres on Mokuoloe Island (also known as Coconut Island) ( fig. 2)."}, {"section_title": "Map Accuracy", "text": "The land uses mapped are a generalization of conditions observed in photographs. These data may not reflect ground conditions actually present at the site. Land use was interpreted from DOQ data and boundaries may cross natural or artificial features (such as streams or roads) to encompass an entire area where a pattern was interpreted as existing. Additionally, boundaries between distinct land uses must incorporate a natural or artificial feature where the width or area of the intervening feature does not meet the minimum mapping unit requirements. Thus, line work may not always match other digital data, such as land ownership, roads, or streams (see Mladinich, 1999). An accuracy assessment, repeating the photo-interpretation of land use at 250 randomly selected locations, identified 98 percent accuracy for all land uses. Developed and barren/mining areas combined had a 98 percent accuracy rate, while agricultural areas also had a 98 percent accuracy rate. No \"other\" areas identified in the accuracy assessment should have been classified as agricultural, developed, or barren/mining. Accuracy for windward areas of the island was 100 percent, where under-representation errors were more likely to fail to identify developed, agricultural, or barren/mining land use in areas of dense canopy or vegetative cover. Accuracy in dry, leeward areas of the island was 98 percent, where over-representation errors more likely identified unused land as developed, agricultural, or barren/mining when it should not have been because of sparser vegetation and slower vegetation recolonization rates."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Land Use", "text": "Hawaii's isolated, tropical location combined with traditional, diversified, and plantation agriculture has resulted in several unusual land-use patterns compared with the rest of the Nation. The \"small-scale rural\" (level 2) category is a by-product of diversified agriculture programs resulting in areas with intense and diverse agriculture practices intermixed with residential land uses. The State of Hawaii \"Agricultural Parks Program\" provides an example of how this process occurs, with long-term leases for crop production (and sometimes residences) provided to small farmers (http://www.hawaiiag.org/hdoa/arm_agparks_info.htm accessed 7/11/02). Another unusual category is \"grasses, biomass\" (level 3, level 4), an experimental bio-energy crop in the early 1990s no longer in cultivation as of 2002. A third unusual agricultural land-use category is \"abandoned,\" typically dominated by exotic grasses, with clear evidence of previous agricultural practices still apparent. Plantation agriculture in Hawaii has been declining for several decades, with much sugarcane and pineapple land abandoned during this time. Cycles in horticulture and aquaculture industries have also resulted in abandoned agricultural land. Agricultural land use occupied 59,195 acres (15.4 percent) of the study area in 1998 ( fig. 3).

Local concepts such as \"ohana\" (extended family) housing in a single family residence are incorporated through residential density classifications rather than a distinction between single versus multi-family housing. Land areas with combined or interspersed businesses and residences are classified according to the primary use evident in the imagery, as commercial or residential. Military land uses occupy a significant percentage of land in Hawaii and these uses also are segregated by the density of development. Military ammunition storage bunkers, communications, or other equipment may be disguised to prevent accurate identification from aerial photography sources, which may be reflected in this land-use map.
