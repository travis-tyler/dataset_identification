Like its predecessors, this report presents trends in doctorate production in the United States, describing the general demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients and the seven broad fields in which they earned their degrees. Each of the seven broad fields consists of several \"major\" fields (e.g., biological sciences i3 a major field within the broad field of life sciences, and psychology is a major field within the broad field of social sciences). The doctorate recipients themselves report their field of study and are counted accordingly. For a list of the fields discussed in this report, see the inside back cover and the specialties list in Appendix D. (Note: These field groupings may differ from those used by federal sponsors of the survey.) The front section of Summary Report 1993 presents brief narratives of key survey findings, accompanied by figures showing selected trend data. The numbers and percentages from which the figures were drawn are provided in a set of tables following the front section; relevant tables are referenced at the bottom of the figures. The front section also includes major findings from data presented in tables but not in figures. Although similar in content to last year's report, Summary Report 1993 presents additional data on race/ethnicity. Three tables that were popular with readers of past reports have been reintroduced: Table 5 (and Supplementary tables on 1993 doctorate recipients are displayed in Appendix A, and trend data on the 1983-1993 Ph.D. cohorts are presented in Appendix B. Appendix C provides technical notes that include nonresponse rates and other information related to tables and figures in the body of the report. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey questionnaire. Additional information is available from the Doctorate Records Project upon request. For a cost, the Project offers tables on the baccalaureate origins of Ph.D.s from 1920 to 1992 and tables on the doctoral specialties of 1976-1993 Ph.D.s, by citizenship, race/ethnicity, and gender. Customized tables can also be prepared at cost. In addition, a special issues brief on trends in postdoctoral appointments will soon be available free-of-charge. For more information, please contact: *** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** The estimates reported for the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) are simple tabulations of all available information, with no adjustment for nonresponse. Thus, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations that are unrelated to true trends. Response to the SED has been 95 to 98 percent over the years, except during the 1980s when it gradually declined to 92 percent. In an effort to improve the response rate, the survey methodology has undergone some revision in the years since 1989. Response has risen as hoped, stabilizing at 95 percent during the last three years (1991 to 1993). (Note: These percentages represent self-report rates, i.e., the proportion of survey forms completed by doctorate recipients. Questionnaires filled in with partial information by either the doctoral institution or staff of the National Research Council are not included in these self-report rates but are included in tabulations in this report.) The self-report rate for 1993 may increase somewhat in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 82 in Appendr: C for a table giving survey response rates from 1980 to 1993. Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were impicanented, increasing coverage of several variables (birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans). Response rates for these variables have thus improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the reported numbers of minority Ph.D.s. Postsurvey adjustment to data was greatest in 1990 and 1991, with the largest impact on the number of black Ph.D.s. For both of these years, the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustments were much smaller for 1992 data (a 1.4 percent increase in black Ph.D.$) because the survey cycle was extended a month to allow receipt of additional follow-up information before closure; the same is expected for 1993 data. All adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Thus, updates for 1990 appealed in Summary Report 1991; those for 1991 appeared in Summary Report 1992; and those for 1992 are included in this year's repert (see Appendix Table B-2). The data for 1993 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as for 1992, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1993 data will be presented in next year's report. In using SED data, the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Increasing or decreasing numbers in a citizenship or racial/ethnic group reflect to some degree any upward or downward change in both overall survey response and item response. ii-"}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selected Demographic Characteristics", "text": "The number of new Ph.D.s increased to an all-time high of 39,754 in 1993. This record continues the upward trend in doctoral attainment that started in 1986 after a period of stagnation during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The doctorates awarded in 1993 were granted by 368 colleges and universities in the United States and Puerto Rico. Women continued to earn increasing numbers of Ph.D.s (15,108 in 1993), while men still fell short of their record number of doctorates in 1972 (24,646 in 1993 compared to 27,754 in 1972). Whereas the number of male Ph.D.s barely doubled from 11,336 to 24,646 over the last three decades, the number of female Ph.D.s increased nearly elevenfold from 1,392 to 15,108. Women's representation grew from 11 percent in 1963 to 38 percent in 1993.  1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 Year See Tables 1 and 2. SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Earned Doctorates. U.S. citizens earned more than two-thirds (26,386) of the doctorates awarded in 1093. However, the share for non-U.S. citizens has increased steadily over the last 30 years, rising from 13 percent (1,605 Ph.D.$) in 1963 to 32 percent (12,173 Ph.D.$) in 1993. In 1993, non-U.S. citizen Ph.D.s on temporary visas outnumbered those on permanent visas by more than four to one-9,923 compared to 2,250. Temporary residents earned 26 percent of all Ph.D.s, whereas permanent residents received only 6 percent. (Note: Temporary residents are nonit -migrants who are granted visas for a specified temporary period of time. Permanent residents are immigrants who are gr. ited legal permanent residence in the United States.) After 14 years of Significant annual increases, the number of doctorates earned by temporary residents appears to have leveled off. However, it is too early to determine if this is the beginning of a new trend. Both the number and the proportion of Ph.D.s received by temporary residents were about the same as last year. Since 1963, temporary residents have increased their share of Ph.D.s from 10 to 26 percent. Permanent residents doubled their representation among doctorate recipients from 3 percent in 1963 to 6 percent in 1993. Moreover, permanent residents earned 2,250 degrees in 1993, surpassing their previous high of 2,093 doctorates in 1972. Over half of all non-U.S. Ph.D. recipients originated from four Asian countries: the People's Republic of China (19 percent), Taiwan (12 percent), Korea (12 percent), and India (9 percent). (See Table 4.) FIGURE 2 Doctorate recipients, by citizenship, 1963-1993. 30 See Tables 3 and 4. See technical notes in Appendix C for rates of nonresponse to the question on citizenship status. SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Earned Doctorates. Just over 11 percent of the doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1993 were earned by racial/ethnic minoritiesAsians, black Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. This represents an increase in minority representation of 3 percentage points since 1978 and a half-point increase since last year. Most U.S. minority groups increased their numbers and proportions of Ph.D.s since 1978 (except for blacks, whose 1993 proportion was just under that in 1978). Asian Ph.D.s experienced the largest growth, more than doubling their representation.  Black Americans received 1,106 degrees in 1993, continuing an increase in awards that began in 1988 (except for a dip of less than 4 percent between 1991 and 1992). This upward trend reversed a period of decline in the number of black Ph.D.s from 1972 to 1987. The 1,106 doctorates awarded in 1993 topped the 1,031 Ph.D.s earned by blacks in 1978 and nearly reached the all-time peak of 1,113 Ph.D.s in 1977. Blacks' 4.2 percent share of doctorates in 1993 was about the same as in 1978 (4.3 percent) and just slightly less than in the peak year of 1977 (4.4 percent). Of the top 21 institutions (ranked by number of Ph.D.$) that awarded bachelor's degrees to blacks who later received Ph.D.s between 1989 and1993, 17 are Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Three of the leading Ph.D. institutions (ranked by the number of Ph.D.$) are also HBCUs. (See Tables 6 and 7.) Field of Doctorate Of the seven broad fields of study profiled in this report, life sciences had the largest number of Ph.D.s-7,397 in 1993. (See Table 2.) Within science and engineering, life sciences outnumbered social sciences (6,545 Ph.D.$), physical sciences (6,496 Ph.D.$), and engineering (5,696 Ph.D.$). Engineering and physical sciences lost ground to the life and social sciences during the 1970s and early 1980s, but began to close the gap in the mid-1980s. Among the nonscience fields in 1993, education continued to outstrip humanities and professional/other fields, producing 6,647 doctorates compared to 4,481 in humanities and 2,492 in professional/other fields. However, the number of Ph.D.s in professional/other fields has increased at a fairly steady rate since 1963, and the number of doctorates in humanities is at its highest level since 1977.  Field of Doctorate 7 In 1993, doctoral awards to men surpassed those to women in all but one bread fieldeducation. Women predominated in the field of education with 59 percent of all doctorates and neared parity in social sciences and humanities. However, women remained underrepresented in the fields of engineering (9 percent of Ph.D.$), physical sciences (21 percent), and life sciences (42 percent). While women Ph.D.s increased in every broad field over the last 30 years, men experienced major declines after 1973 in social sciences, humanities, and education. Only half as many men received education doctorates in 1993 as in 1973.  1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 Life Sciences 196319681973198319881993Humanities 196319681973198319881993 See Table 2.

Their representation varied by fieldaccounting for 59 percent of Ph.D.s in engineering, 45 percent in physical sciences, and just 11 percent in education. U.S. citizens received more than three-quarters of the doctorates awarded in social sciences, humanities, and education. Among non-U.S. citizens, both permanent and temporary residents were most concentrated in engineering, followed by physical sciences and life sciences. U.S. citizens were most heavily concentrated in education, although they were highly represented in the fields of social and life sciences as well.   Table 3.

As a group, they accounted for 15 percent of the doctorates in education, 14 percent in engineering, and 9 to 10 percent in each of the other broad fields. In 1993, black, Hispanic, and Native American doctorate recipients were most concentrated in the field of education, followed by social sciences. Life sciences and engineering were the leading fields among Asian Americans. (See Table 5.) In 1993, black Americans received more than one-half of the doctorates awarded to minorities in the field of education and professional/other fields; blacks were also the predominant minority recipients of doctorates in the field of social sciences. Asian Americans accounted for well over one-half of minority Ph.D.s in engineering and physical sciences and also earned more doctorates in life sciences than any other minority group. Hispanics were the predominant minority group to receive doctorates in the field of humanities. (See Table 5.)    Table S.

TTD has remained fairly level since the mid-1980s, while RTD has increased at a slow but steady pace. The median TTD in 1993 was 10.5 years, and the median RTD was 7.1 years. Both TTD and RTD varied considerably by field. In 1993, doctorate recipients in physical sciences had the shortest TTD (8.3 median years), while those in education had the longest (19.2 median years). The shortest RTD was in engineering (6.3 median years), and the longest RTD was in the humanities (8.3 median years). Time-to-degree was shorter for men than for women, though differences in RTD almost disappear for Ph.D.s in the same broad field. Temporary residents exhibited shorter time-to-degree than both permanent residents and U.S. citizens, and Asian Americans had the shortest time-to-degree of all U.S. racial/ethnic groups. (See Table 10.) Postgraduation Plans Of those Ph.D.s in 1993 who reported definite postgraduation commitments, percent planned to be employed while 29 percent planned postdoctoral study. (Note: Postdoctoral appointments are considered to be postdoctoral study rather than employment in this report.) The proportion of new Ph.D.s with employment plans was significantly lower than 20 years ago, when 84 percent intended to work after graduation and only 16 percent planned further study. Doctorate recipients in education and professional/other fields were the most likely to have work plans (97 percent), followed closely by Ph.D.s in the humanities (93 percent). Study plans were by far most common in the life sciences (64 percent). The majority of Ph.D.s in every demographic group planned to work rather than pursue further study after graduation. However, women were more inclined towards employment than were men, and U.S. citizens were more apt to work than were foreign citizens. A significant proportion of temporary residents (39 percent) planned to continue their education. Among the aggregate of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Native Americans and blacks had the largest proportions with work plans (about 85 percent each), and Asians had the largest proportion with study plans (39 percent). (See Table 15.) In 1993, permanent residents who reported definite postdoctoral commitments were much more likely than temporary residents with commitments to have plans to remain in the United States (86 percent versus 55 percent). However, the proportion of temporary resident Ph.D.s intending to stay was nearly double the proportion in 1973 (31 percent). (Note: Temporary residents are allowed to extend their stay in the United States after receipt of the Ph.D. for additional study or work experience; however, they cannot remain indefinitely without a change in visa status.) Among permanent residents, the percentage of Ph.D.s with plans to stay in the United States was somewhat lower than 20 years ago. Postdoctoral study was planned by over half of the temporary residents who intended to remain in the United States, while permanent residents were nearly twice as apt to work as to study. (See Table 17.)

However, the proportion of Ph.D.s, planning to work in academe was smaller than 20 years ago (53 percent in .1993 versus 64 percent in 1973). Plans for employment in industry (including self-employment) increased over the last two decades, from 12 percent of Ph.D.s in 1973 to 19 percent of Ph.D.s in 1993. \"Other\" employment sectors (namely K-12 schools and nonprofit organizations) attracted t..e same proportion of Ph.D.s as industry in 1993. The sector of planned employment varied by field. In 1993, academic employment plans were most common among Ph.D.s in the humanities (85 percent) and professionaUother fields (76 percent). Industry was most frequently reported by engineers (56 percent) and physical scientists (50 percent). (See Table 18.) Whereas academic employment plans were more prevalent among women than men (58 percent versus 48 percent), the proportion of men in industry (24 percent) was twice that of women. The majority of Ph.D.s in every racial/ethnic group but Asians reported plans to work in academe. While Asians also favored academic employment (44 percent), their proportion in industry (41 percent) was nearly as large. Note that the sectors of concentration for the various demographic groups reflect the doctoral fields of the Ph.D.s. in these groups. (See Table 19.) See Tables 18 and 19.

Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20-24 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate 16.4 NOTE: SED = Survey of Earned Doctorates; SDR = Survey of Doctorate Recipients, whose sample is drawn from the SED. This table includes only 1990 Ph.D.s who were located in the United States in the 1991 SDR (total n = 1,901). The shaded percentages represent the proportions of Ph.D.s whose employment status in the 1991 SDR was consistent with their postgraduation plans in the 1990 SED. For example, the table shows that 86.9% of 1990 SED respondents who had plans for employment in academe upon graduation were still working in academe 1-2 years later, according to SDR data. * This comparison may underestimate postdoctoral study because it is likely that some Ph.D.s who reported plans for postdoctoral study in the SED had completed their postdoctoral appointments by the time the 1991 SDR was distributed. There is a gap of 1-2 years between the Ph.D. graduation dates in the SED and the reference date for employment in the 1991 SDR. In Table A-3, the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment After Doctorate\" (educiitional institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 52.8 percent of all c' ,emists had postdo,tGral study plans, 39.1 percent planned to be employed, and 8.1 percent did not report their postgraduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided. The data on study plans show that 26.5 percent of all chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 25.1 percent, research associateships; 0.5 percent, traineeships; and 0.7 percent, some other fc,-in of postdoctoral study. These percentages sum to 52.8 percent, the proportion of chemists who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to 39.1 percentthe proportion of chemistry Ph.D.s who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item 20: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 20: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite). Revisions to the questionnaire format beginning in 1990 appear to have resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity in recent years. Nonresponse to this item was 15.1 percent in 1993 compared to only 6.2 percent in 1989. The U.S. regions of employment shown in Table A Tables A-3 and A-5.

See the notice on page 41 for important information on recent increases in response rates and their impact on timeseries data. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977, it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980, the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racia]Jethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In Table A-4, Ph.D.s who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or other Hispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as Native American in this report.) In the section on \"Graduate School Support,\" a recipient counts in ..tore than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note on Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections of Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table A-3.

Beginning with Summary Report 1990, federal research assistantships (RAs) have been aggregated with university RAs and shown under \"University\" in this table. (Focus groups of doctoral candidates have indicated uncertainty as to the source of their RA funding; it is therefore likely that some RAs have incorrectly identified their support as university rather 5 r) 46 Appendix A than federal.) The reader is advised not to compare results from the 1990-1993 surveys with results from earlier years because percentages for university support appear higher and percentages for federal support appear lower in recent tables where RAs are aggregated. The data in Table A-3 s: auld be interpreted as follows: 160 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences in 1993 reported financial support from federal fellowships or traineeships during graduate school. This number is 3.3 percent of the male physical sciences Ph.D.s who answered the question on sources of support, and 132 percent of all males in any field who reported federal fellowship or traineeship support.           . 83.9 91.9 59.5 13.9 10.7 9.4 7.6 6.6 6.8 5.2 8.2 3.9 5.4 4.4 8.0 10.6 11.0 3.6 1.6 3.8 10.5 39.2 19.9 0.5 0.2 0.4 NOTE: Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates.

The \"other\" field categories e.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields. The seven tables in Appendix A present additional information on the most recent cohort of Ph.D.s by field of doctorate. The reader should note that numbers in Table B-2 have been revised since publication of Summary Report 1992. Because of late questionnaire returns and responses to follow-ups for missing information, data are subject to revision in the year after survey closure. New follow-up procedures first implemented in 1990 have increased coverage of several variables, including citizenship and race/ethnicity. One result has been greater postsurvey adjustment to racial/ethnic data than in earlier years. (Note: The greatest adjustment was to the numbers of black Ph.D.s in 1990 and 1991an increase of about 7.5 percent each year.) Updates to 1992 racial/ethnic data are shown in Table B-2 in this year's report. See the notice on page 71 for additional information on recent increases in response rates and their impact on time-series data. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977, it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977.

Thus, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations that are unrelated to true trends. Response to the SED has been 95 to 98 percent over the years, except during the 1980s %, hen it gradually declined to 92 percent. In an effort to improve the response rate, the survey methodology has undergone some revision in the years since 1989. Response has risen as hoped, stabilizing at 95 percent during the last three years (1991 to 1993). (Note: These percentages represent self report rates, i.e., the proportion of survey forms completed by doctorate recipients. Questionnaires filled in with partial information by either the doctoral institution or staff of the National Research Council are not included in these self-report rates but are included in tabulations in this report.) The self-report rate for 1993 may increase somewhat in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 82 for a table giving survey response rates from 1980 to 1993. Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented, increasing coverage of several variables (birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans). Response rates for these variables have thus improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the reported numbers of minority Ph.D.s. Postsurvey adjustment to data was greatest in 1990 and 1991, with the largest impact on the number of black Ph.D.s. For both of these years, the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustments were much smaller for 1992 data (a Lit percent increase in black Ph.D.$) because the survey cycle was extended a month to allow receipt of additional follow-up information before closure; the same is expected for 1993 data. All adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Thus, updates for 1990 appeared in Summary Report 1991; those for 1991 appeared in Summary Report 1992; and those for 1992 are included in this year's report (see Appendix Table B-2). The data for 1993 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as for 1992, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1993 data will be presented in next year's report. In using SED data, the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates.

RTD cannot be computed for individuals who have not provided all years of college attendance after earning the baccalaureate. Total time-to-degree (TTD) measures the elapsed time from baccalaureate to doctorate (including time not enrolled in school). TTD can be computed only for individuals whose baccalaureate year is known.

The numbers shown in Table 11 are the base for these percentages; they represent only those Ph.D.s whose primary support is known--not the total cohort of Ph.D.s in 1993. Because many recipients answered the support question but failed to designate a primary source, nonresponse. was quite high in 1993. The reader should note that while nonresponse to primary support has consistently been greater than nonresponse to other variables, it was especially high in the last two years (probably a result of revisions to the questionnaire format).

(The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering. and humanities fields.) According to the 1991 SDR, 97 percent of the 1990 Ph.D.s who had indicated \"definite\" employment plans at the time of graduation were in the U.S. labor force as of September 1991 (1-2 years after graduation), and most were working in the sector reported on their survey forms.
