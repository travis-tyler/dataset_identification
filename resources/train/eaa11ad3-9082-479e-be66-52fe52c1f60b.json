The recent incorporation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers into the diagnostic guidelines for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical AD represent a paradigm shift in the field [1] [2] [3] . The application of metabolomics technology for the discovery of AD biomarkers is receiving increasing attention [4] . As small metabolites represent the end result of cellular regulatory complexity, they are thought to be reliable proximal reporters of disease processes [5] . Several studies have reported on alterations in metabolite concentrations in blood between AD and healthy controls [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Most of these previous studies have relied upon relatively small sample sizes and different methodological approaches making comparative assessment of results difficult. Moreover, very few studies have focused attention on the discovery of predictive biomarkers of AD i.e. those indicative of greater risk of subsequent conversion to AD in older individuals who are cognitively normal. Such biomarkers would represent a substantial breakthrough as they would allow for the effective screening of large numbers of at-risk elderly and facilitate the testing of disease-modifying treatments in patients in very early stages of the AD disease process. If such biomarkers could accurately identify cognitively normal elderly at risk of subsequent AD, they would be of immediate clinical utility and merit use in routine clinical practice.\nA recent study reported the discovery of a 10-metabolite panel in plasma that could discriminate cognitively normal older individuals who developed incident AD within 3 years (n=10; validation sample; age; 79.3\u00b15.49 years) from healthy controls who remained cognitively normal (n=20; validation sample; age; 81.35\u00b13.25 years) [13] . This panel was described as having impressive accuracy (0.92 area-under-the-receiver-operatingcharacteristic-curve; sensitivity/specificity; 90%/90%), suggesting considerable clinical utility of these analytes as antecedent biomarkers of memory impairment in cognitively normal individuals who will eventually develop AD.\nHere, we test these index findings in a substantially larger sample from two wellcharacterized and longitudinally followed cohorts of older individuals from North America and Europe-the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) [14] and the Age, Gene/ Environment Susceptibility Study-Reykjavik (AGES-RS) [15] using the same targeted metabolomics platform utilized in the index study [13] (AbsoluteIDQ p180 assay, BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria). We examined serum metabolomic profiles at two time points for two groups -'non-converters' who remained cognitively normal between 2 time points, approximately 5 years apart, and 'converters' who were cognitively normal at baseline and converted to AD within the same interval as the nonconverters. In addition to testing whether we could replicate the previously reported findings by Mapstone and colleagues using their 10-metabolite panel [13] , we also used a data-driven approach using machine-learning methods to analyze the entire targeted metabolomic data we acquired to examine whether other metabolite signatures could be identified as predictors of incident AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2.1BLSA and AGES-RS cohorts", "text": "Several previous publications have described details of the BLSA [14, 16, 17] and AGES-RS cohorts [15, 18] .

[13] to test the accuracy of their 10-metabolite panel as a predictor of preclinical AD in our cohorts. In the BLSA samples, this panel gave an area-under the-curve (AUC) of 0.64 and sensitivity/ specificity of 51.6%/65.7% for discriminating baseline converter samples (i.e. preconversion) from non-converters. In the AGES-RS samples, the 10-metabolite panel gave an AUC of 0.394 and sensitivity/specificity of 47%/36% for discriminating baseline converter samples (i.e. pre-conversion) from non-converters. In comparison, Mapstone and colleagues reported an AUC of 0.92 and sensitivity/specificity of 90%/90% for discrimination between baseline converter and non-converter groups.\nNext, we tested the 10-metabolite panel as a biomarker of current disease using the same logistic regression model to discriminate samples concurrent to symptom onset in converters (i.e. post-conversion) versus non-converters. In the BLSA samples, this analysis yielded an AUC of 0.58 and sensitivity/specificity of 53.8%/62.6%. In the AGES-RS samples, the 10-metabolite panel gave an AUC of 0.481 and sensitivity/specificity of 52%/48% for discriminating AD samples (i.e. post-conversion) from non-converters. In comparison, the index study reported an AUC of 0.77 for discrimination between post-conversion and nonconverter samples (sensitivity/specificity were not reported for this analysis) [13] .\nNext, we analyzed the entire metabolite dataset of 187 metabolites without a priori hypotheses about the nature and/or identity of candidate AD biomarkers. In the BLSA samples, a Random Forest (RF) classifier discriminated pre-conversion samples from nonconverters with a classification accuracy of 64.2% and sensitivity/specificity of 55.5%/ 73.0%. L 1 -Regularized Logistic Regression (L 1 -RLR) gave the best discrimination between samples concurrent to symptom onset (i.e. post-conversion) versus non-converters with classification accuracy of 67.2% and sensitivity/specificity of 67.7%/66.7%. Two additional algorithms i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Elastic Net-Regularized Logistic Regression (EN-RLR) yielded similar performance characteristics (supplementary table-1) . Different metabolites, in particular phospholipids with fatty acid chains (summed to C30 to C44 carbon-carbon bonds) appeared to be important in discrimination between pre-and post-conversion samples relative to non-converters (supplementary table-2), suggesting that alterations in distinct metabolic pathways may underlie the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of AD.\nIn the AGES-RS samples, our machine learning analyses demonstrated poor discrimination between both pre-conversion and non-converters as well as post-conversion samples relative to non-converters. All the classifiers tested showed performance metrics similar to random classification of samples between groups. The L 1 -RLR classifier yielded classification accuracy of 46.5%, sensitivity/specificity of 45%/48% for pre-conversion samples and slightly better but substantially similar results for post-conversion samples. The other three classifiers gave similar results (not presented)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "An accurate and non-invasive blood biomarker associated with preclinical AD is likely to revolutionize the care of patients with this devastating disease and accelerate the development of novel disease-modifying treatments by targeting them in individuals at greatest risk. The identification of such blood biomarkers is therefore likely to be of immediate benefit to patients and their caregivers in clinical as well as research settings. A recent report that a panel of ten plasma metabolites in blood could accurately predict conversion to AD in cognitively normal older individuals, raised hope that such biomarkers are within reach and received wide attention both within and outside the scientific community [13, 20] . However, other high profile biomarker findings in the AD field have not been replicated [21, 22] , highlighting the need for large-scale confirmatory studies performed in well-characterized cohorts [23] .\nIn this report, we first attempted to confirm the index findings by Mapstone et al. using the same metabolomics platform and analytical methodology used in their report. We undertook these analyses in two independent cohorts from longitudinal studies of normal aging i.e the BLSA and AGES-RS studies. We assayed metabolite concentrations from nearly 800 serial serum samples and found that we were unable to replicate the high performance metrics of the 10-metabolite panel in the sample of 28 converters reported in the index study. To the best of our knowledge, our current report is the largest blood biomarker study of preclinical AD to date.\nIt is important to first consider the major methodological differences between the current report and that of Mapstone et al. These are summarized in table-2. The most obvious consideration is the choice of matrix used to measure metabolite concentrations. Whereas the original study assayed plasma, we used serum samples in our study. However, recent studies have provided strong evidence for a high concordance between concentrations of metabolites assayed in plasma versus serum on the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQ \u2122 platform.\nIn a large study sample from participants in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) (n=377; 180 female, 197 male, age range from 51 to 84 years), Yu and colleagues reported on the concordance between plasma versus serum concentrations of 122 metabolites assayed on the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQ \u2122 platform [24] . Using their published data (available at: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/ journal.pone.0021230#s5), we examined the correlation between plasma and serum for each of the 10 metabolites reported by Mapstone et al. These findings are summarized in table-3 and show that most of these metabolites are highly correlated between the two matrices, with seven of the 10 analytes showing a correlation coefficient >0.85. Taken together, these previous reports clearly establish that the majority of metabolite concentrations measured using the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQ \u2122 method, and especially the ten metabolites reported by Mapstone et al. are highly correlated between plasma and serum. Therefore differences in the matrix used between our report and the index publication are unlikely to account for our inability to replicate the previously reported results.\nThe second major factor that could potentially account for differences between our results and those previously reported is the time-to-conversion to AD. Cognitively normal participants in the original report developed AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) over an average follow-up interval of 2.1 years, whereas those in the BLSA had an average time to symptom onset of 4.8 years. We therefore analyzed samples from an independent cohort of older individuals from the AGES-RS study with an estimated average time-to-conversion to AD (2.62\u00b10.14 years) that was more similar to that reported in Mapstone et al. to confirm that our failure to replicate the index findings were not driven by a slightly longer time to symptom onset in the BLSA cohort. It is also worth noting here that our inability to replicate the previous findings extend to both the prediction of subsequent AD in cognitively normal individuals (i.e. pre-conversion versus non-converters) as well as the discrimination between AD (i.e. post-conversion) and non-converter samples. If the inconsistencies in results were due entirely to differences in time-to-symptom onset, we would expect replication of the previous findings at least as markers of concurrent disease.\nWe also considered whether duration of sample storage may account for the inconsistency in results between our study and the index study. In their report, Mapstone and colleagues did not provide details on either the duration of sample storage or when participant recruitment to their study began. We are therefore unable to determine whether differences in duration of sample storage may contribute to the inconsistent results. In both the BLSA and AGES-RS studies, serum samples were collected after overnight fasting in standard serum separator tubes, centrifuged and stored in cryovials at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. The mean duration of serum sample storage ranged from 15.67\u00b18.12 years in the BLSA and 8.04\u00b12.77 years in the AGES-RS study. Serum aliquots used in our current report were not subject to additional freeze-thaw prior to the metabolomics assays reported herein. Breier et al. have examined the role of several pre-analytical variables such as sample storage duration, temperature and freeze-thaw cycles in targeted metabolomics analyses in blood using the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQ \u2122 assay [25] . They conclude that the majority of metabolites measured are stable for up to 24 hours on cool packs and at room temperature even in non-centrifuged tubes. Additionally, serum metabolite concentrations were mostly unaffected by tube type and one or two freeze-thaw cycles. However, as some amino acids and biogenic amines may be unstable on cool packs, the authors recommend that blood samples be processed and frozen immediately after collection, as was done in both the BLSA and AGES-RS studies. We believe therefore, that serum metabolite concentrations measured in the BLSA and AGES-RS samples reported herein, followed optimal sampling conditions and storage times. Hence this pre-analytical variable i.e. sample storage duration is also unlikely to account for our failure to replicate the index findings of Mapstone et al.\nHaving assessed obvious methodological differences between our current study and that of Mapstone et al. which may account for the inconsistent results, we next considered the analytical procedures adopted to examine the metabolomics data derived in the respective studies. Our first analysis was based on an a priori selection of the 10 metabolites reported in the original study. The index report provides few details about how these 10-metabolites were eventually selected from the approximately 180 that are assayed on the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQ \u2122 platform [13] . Thus it is unclear how these data were processed, the exact procedures followed in constructing the final classifier and what, if any measures were adopted to avoid overfitting bias in estimating the performance metrics of the 10 metabolites. After our primary analysis with the a priori selected 10 metabolites that failed to replicate their original results, we examined the entire metabolomics data acquired in both BLSA and AGES-RS samples using machine learning approaches. By using rigorous partitioning of samples into training/test sets in two independent samples from the BLSA and AGES-RS studies, we guarded against over-fitting of data which is a common cause of inflated classification accuracies while using high-dimensional datasets such as metabolomics and proteomics on relatively small sample sizes [26] . In both the BLSA and AGES-RS samples, the analyses did not reveal a high level of discrimination between groups based on serum metabolite concentrations. In the BLSA, consensus metabolites were modestly associated with pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of AD and appeared to represent distinct metabolic pathways.\nIn conclusion, we were unable to replicate the high prediction performance for detecting preclinical AD reported previously for a metabolite panel assayed on the same platform using a substantially larger sample size drawn from two independent well-characterized longitudinal cohorts. Our study further underscores the importance of well-designed validation of exploratory biomarker studies. While the emerging technology of metabolomics holds great promise in epidemiological studies to accurately measure environmental exposure and quantify risk factors, our current report highlights the importance of performing large-scale replication of findings emerging from small index studies [27] ."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material."}, {"section_title": "Research in context", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Systematic review", "text": "We first reviewed (using PubMed) all publications reporting the use of metabolomics in plasma/serum of AD patients and healthy controls.
