[{"section_title": "Preface", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) provides a wealth of information about factors that influence student academic performance and social development and the processes through which these factors operate. Under the sponsorship of the National Center for Education Statistics (LACES); with additional support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs (OBEMLA), NELS:88 is being conducted in several waves: a 1988 base year, a first follow-up in 1990, a second follow-up in 1992, with future rounds yet to take place. The focus of this content overview is the research issues addressed by the instrumentation of the NELS:88 second follow-up. In 1988, by surveying nearly 25,000 eighth graders, their parents, teachers and principals, baseline measures were obtained at a point just prior to entry into secondary school. In 1990, the cohort was resurveyed, freshened to represent the nation's sophomores, and data collected from students' teachers and school administrators. In 1992, NELS:88 resurveyed students and dropouts representing the 1988 cohort four years later, capturing as well a nationally representative sample of high school seniors. NELS:88 is a singularly rich data base. At the student level, the second follow-up collected a third set of scores on the cognitive test battery, thus providing measures of cognitive growth since the eighth grade and the sophomore year. At the same time, questionnaire data capturedfrom the student's perspectiveeducational processes and individual plans for the future, at a point in time marking both the culmination of the high school experience and the onset of the transition to the labor market or postsecondary education. The NELS :88 instruments captured as well the experience of eighth grade and sophomore cohort members who did not graduate with their class, either because they were dropouts or had been retained in grade."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "The NELS Program. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) is the third in a series of longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education. NCES's longitudinal studies program reflects the agency's commitment to collect and analyze data on the factors affecting the transitions of students from elementary school to high school and eventually to productive roles in American society. Consistent with its commitment and in response to the need for policy-relevant, time-series data on nationally representative samples of elementary and secondary students, NCES instituted the National Education Longitudinal Studies (NELS) program, a continuing long-term project. The general aim of the NELS program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various grade levels, and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development. The NELS program currently consists of three major studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72); High School andBeyond of 1980 (HS&B of 1980); and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS :88). Taken together, these studies represent the educational experience of youth from three decadesthe 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. NELS:88 differs from both NLS-72 and HS&B in that the first data collection phase began in the eighth grade rather than high school. The 1988 base year of NELS:88 represents the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. The 1988 eighth-grade cohort is being followed at 2-year intervals in order to obtain policy-relevant data about educational processes and outcomesparticularly those pertaining to student learning, early and late predictors of dropping out, and school effects on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. The NELS:88 first follow-up, which took place in 1990, provides the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provides a comparison point to high school sophomores 10 years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captures the population of early dropouts (those who leave school prior to the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. The NELS:88 second follow -up took place in 1992, when most sample members were second-term seniors. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school and collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Because the NELS:88 longitudinal sample was freshened to represent the twelfth-grade class of 1992, trend comparisons can be made to the senior cohorts of 1972 and 1980 that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990 and identified and surveyed those additional students who had left school since the prior wave. The NELS:88 third follow-up took place in 1994, when most sample members had left high school. The primary goals of the 1994 round are to provide for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B and to address issues of employment and postsecondary access and choice. Additionally, the third follow-up provides a basis for assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route and for measuring the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other educational opportunities. A fourth follow-up is scheduled for 1998. Figure 1 illustrates components of this multilevel multi-wave study. Second Follow-Up Design and Results. As shown in Figure 1, the NELS:88 second follow-up comprises the following components: a student and dropout survey (utilizing questionnaires and cognitive tests), a teacher and a school administrator survey, parent survey, and collection of high school transcripts. Although final data collection results are not available for the parent and teacher components, results of the student, dropout, school administrator and transcripts components of the second follow-up survey are summarized in Table 1. NELS:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues, including: O Equity, access, and choice: NELS:88 data help to explore issues of equal educational opportunity (for example, access to quality educational programs), the role of the school in helping the disadvantaged, and the school experiences and academic performance of language-minority students; o Academic achievement and cognitive growth: NELS:88 measures students' academic growth over time as well as its correlates (that is, the family, community, school and classroom factors that promote or inhibit student learning); O Tracking and differential course-taking: NELS:88 explores the influence of ability grouping and differential course-taking opportunities on future educational experience and outcomes; O Dropping out: NELS:88 gathers data on persistence in school, determinants and consequences of dropping out of (and of returning io) the educational system; 2 U 1 LO  Percentages of cases for which a student/dropout questionnaire was obtained for which a cognitive test was also obtained. 12th grade school completion rate (for school questionnaires) of eligible contextual schools, where at least one student has completed a questionnaire. Coverage rate for student participants of the total eligible sample who also have a completed school administrator questionnaire or transcript data. Parent completion rate is based only on those sample members who completed a student/dropout questionnaire. Percentage of student respondents for whom a teacher rating was completed. O Transition patterns: NELS:88 documents the transition from secondary school to postsecondary education or the labor force and the continuing effects of the pattern of transition from eighth grade to secondary school; O School effectiveness: NELS:88 provides data to investigate the features that differentiate effective from ineffective schools; O Parental roles: NELS:88 also explores the relationship between educational institutions and processes and the community and family context including parent involvement in schooling, in planning for the child's educational development and opportunities, and in providing a home education support system. Each of these policy themes will be briefly discussed. Then, questions corresponding to these themes will be identified from the student, dropout, and school administrator questionnaires. The parent and teacher instruments, and high school transcripts, of course supply additional data points for examining many of these issues; their content is briefly sketched later in this document. Equity, access, and choice. The issue of equity is a major focus of NELS:88. Variation in the levels of information available to students and parents to guide choice of schools, programs and classes is commonly presumed to influence future outcomes. It is frequently maintained that students from some groups (for example, language minority, poverty status, or at risk) may typically have more limited access to and choice of different educational settings and processes (academic programs, opportunity to learn, positive school climate, postsecondary education, and so on). In addition, it is doubtful that there currently exists an equitable distribution of education inputs, resources, and processes for all students. NELS:88 collects data that permit such equity issues to be investigated. Cognitive growth. NELS:88 collects achievement test data in science, mathematics, English and social studies, for grades eight, ten and twelve. This makes it possible to address questions of cognitive outcomes and growth. In particular, levels of achievement gain over time can be assessed for various population subgroups and related to student characteristics (track, coursetaking, engagement, language proficiency), school and teacher characteristics (teacher quality, school climate, academic press), and parental characteristics (parental involvement, family resources, family structure). NELS:88 test data permit researchers to answer questions about differences in rates of change for different areas of learning, and to describe the demographic, institutional, and behavioral correlates of faster, more effective development. Tracldng. Another issue with significant outcomes for individual students is tracking or ability grouping and, relatedly, differential course taking patterns. Among the many important questions associated with this theme are the following: How soon and by what mechanisms are students grouped into ability-level clusters or educational program tracks (general, academic, or vocational)? What are the roles of students, teachers, administrators and parents in that process? What is the relative importance of formal and informal processes in tracking assignments? How much movement occurs from originally assigned tracks; can students move from one to another? What impact does school tracking have on the rest of students' social lives, friendships, associations, out-of-school activities? Does tracking foster overall achievement or does it serve more to perpetuate inequities and inequalities? NELS:88 offers a major opportunity to learn more about the dynamics of how schools track students (and how students [and their parents] track themselves), about how program and course placement decisions are made and the outcomes of such decisions on aspirations, expectations and performance. Topics such as patterns of coursetaking, types of grouping, relative influences on decisions, the influence of track placement on cognitive growth and persistence in high school, as well as opportunity for students to move among tracks and program types, can all be investigated using NELS:88 data. Outcomes of tracking and differential coursetaking may include or implicate dropping out, differential school achievement, attitudes toward school, social relations, postsecondary plans and opportunities, employment opportunities, and future occupation. Dropping out. NELS:88 began with a cohort of eighth graders. Therefore it captures the entire cohort of students entering secondary school who fail to complete their high school education. NELS:88 data provide a longitudinal picture of the process of dropping out. NELS:88 data can answer such basic questions as the following: who stays in high school and who drops out? What are the dynamics of dropping out, that is, the pattern of disengagement from school and the precipitating factors in embarking on a process of disengagement and premature exit from school, and what are the dynamics of returning to school, for those dropouts who go back to high school or seek an alternative credential? What happens to dropouts during the time period that the other members of their cohort remain in school? Transition patterns. NELS:88 bridges two critical transition points: the transition to high school, and the transition from high school to postsecondary education, the labor force, and family formation. The collection of comprehensive parent and teacher data at the time students are making these two critical transitions provides the data set with considerable power to disentangle the effects of home and school upon student development, and to illuminate the factors that influence the decision-making processes that affect the developmental paths and educational outcomes of students at these critical points. School effectiveness.' NELS:88 data can help to answer questions of school effectiveness such as what aspects of school structure and environment are associated with positive student outcomes (defined, in particular, by student performance or cognitive growth). Structural issues (school size, SES level, characteristics of the staff, school sector); environmental issues (school ethos or climate; principal and teacher autonomy; extent of conflict or accord between administrators and teachers on school goals, policies, and practices; integration of school and community), and academic issues (academic press, curricular offerings, extracurricular opportunities) are examples of potentially important school influences on student outcomes that are measured in NELS:88. Parental roles and influences. In addition to gathering information about family background and structure and the home education support system, the NELS :88 survey instruments seek to obtain data about parental and community involvement in schools. There are many fundamental questions about parental roles that NELS:88 data can help to illuminate. To facilitate the study of school effects, a special supplement to NELS:88the School Effectiveness Studyhas been made part of the first and second follow-ups. What determines parental willingness to sacrifice for their children's secondary or postsecondary education in terms of financial burden, time investment, and so on? To what extent do stronger parent networks improve schooling outcomes? Non-questionnaire data: tests and transcripts. The complete set of NELS:88 base year through second follow-up questionnaires is available from NCES.
