We called this index AD Pattern Similarity (AD-PS) scores. To demonstrate the construct validity of the scores, we investigated their associations with several AD risk factors. The ADNI and WHIMS imaging databases were collected with different goals, populations and data acquisition protocols: it is important to demonstrate that the approach to estimating AD-PS scores can bridge these differences. Methods: MRI data from both studies were processed using high-dimensional warping methods. High-dimensional classifiers were then estimated using the ADNI MRI data. Next, the classifiers were applied to baseline and followup WHIMS-MRI GM data to generate the GM AD-PS scores. To study the validity of the scores we investigated associations between GM AD-PS scores at baseline (Scan 1) and their longitudinal changes (Scan 2 -Scan 1) with: 1) age, cognitive scores, white matter small vessel ischemic disease (WM SVID) volume at baseline and 2) age, cognitive scores, WM SVID volume longitudinal changes respectively. In addition, we investigated their associations with time until classification of independently adjudicated status in WHIMS-MRI. Results: Higher GM AD-PS scores from WHIMS-MRI baseline data were associated with older age, lower cognitive scores, and higher WM SVID volume. Longitudinal changes in GM AD-PS scores (Scan 2 -Scan 1) were also associated with age and changes in WM SVID volumes and cognitive test scores. Increases in the GM AD-PS scores predicted decreases in cognitive scores and increases in WM SVID volume. GM AD-PS scores and their longitudinal changes also were associated with time until classification of cognitive impairment. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curves showed that baseline GM AD-PS scores of cognitively normal participants carried information about future cognitive status determined during follow-up. Discussion: We applied a high-dimensional machine learning approach to estimate a novel AD risk factor for WHIMS-MRI study participants using ADNI data. The GM AD-PS scores showed strong associations with incident cognitive impairment and cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age, cognitive function, cognitive status and WM SVID volume lending support to the ongoing validation of the GM AD-PS score."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Machine learning is becoming an increasingly popular approach in biomedical research related to high-dimensional data. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) research the challenge of early detection is of paramount importance, since pathological processes develop many years before the cognitive impairment is observed. Early detection of AD might help in selection of patients for clinical trials and improve the efficacy of clinical or behavioral interventions.\nMassive amounts of data from different sources are being used to develop early detection models (Weiner et al., 2013) . One of the more common types of neuroimaging data is structural MRI. Brain MRI is used to identify neuropathologies such as brain atrophy. Traditional approaches to study the impact of AD on brain structure are based on specific regions of interest (ROI) or voxel-based morphometry; these are univariate and cannot reveal complex spatial patterns of atrophy related to AD. Machine learning approaches are well-suited to address these challenges because they can capture complex patterns hidden in the data and build powerful prediction models based on high-dimensional data.\nMany recent studies have sought to derive machine learning models based on structural MRI to predict AD or MCI-AD conversion. Much of this work has used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, which was developed with highly standardized protocols to distinguish individuals with and without AD. For these methods to be adopted in practice, it is important to demonstrate their utility with different protocols for identifying dementia and MRI outcomes. These efforts could enable the AD research community to more fully use large amounts of imaging data already collected.\nA few groups have developed machine learning models using one imaging database, and then applied them to other databases using different populations and imaging protocols. Kloppel and colleagues showed the feasibility of automatic classification of AD using whole brain MRI scans collected in different centers and support vector machines (SVM) (Kloppel et al., 2008) . Davatzikos and colleagues used the ADNI dataset to train a SVM classifier used to estimate an index of AD anatomical risk called Spatial Pattern of Abnormality for Recognition of Early Alzheimer's disease (SPARE-AD). They investigated the association of this index with cognitive decline using longitudinal structural MRI data from cognitively normal participants and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Aging Study (BLSA) . Associations between the SPARE-AD index, plasma analytes, and AD risk factors have been investigated using other cohorts (Habes et al., 2016a; Habes et al., 2016b; Toledo et al., 2013) .\nThis study extends our previous research on AD pattern similarity (AD-PS) scores developed using structural MRI from ADNI (Casanova et al., 2013) . Our main goal here is to create a metric based on MRI to be used by Women Health Initiative investigators, as an AD risk factor reflecting the presence of AD-related spatial patterns in the brain. This study is part of an ongoing effort to investigate the feasibility and constructive validity of estimating a novel AD risk factor based on elastic net regularization and WHIMS-MRI data. To do this we computed AD-PS scores for the Women's Health Initiative Memory MRI study cohort, and then we evaluated whether these scores are associated with classifications of cognitive impairment (normal, MCI, and probable dementia), incident cognitive impairment, age, performance on a test of cognitive function, and white matter hyperintensity volume and other risk factors."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "WHIMS-MRI", "text": "The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) investigated the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on the risk of dementia and changes in cognitive function in women aged 65-79 at enrollment (1996) (1997) (1998) into the WHI randomized placebo-controlled hormone therapy clinical trials (Espeland et al., 2004; Shumaker et al., 1998) . The WHIMS-MRI study enrolled WHIMS participants from 14 of 39 sites (Jaramillo et al., 2007; Resnick et al., 2009 ) from January 2005 through April 2006, an average of 8 years after they had enrolled in the WHIMS trial and 1-3 years after study medications ended (Coker et al., 2014) .

Briefly, the scans were obtained with a 22 cm field of view and a matrix of 256 \u00c2 256 in 1.5 T scanners. Included were oblique axial spin density/T2-weighted spin echo (TR:3200 ms, TE \u00bc 30/120 ms, slice thickness \u00bc 3 mm), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted spin echo (TR \u00bc 8000 ms, TI \u00bc 2000 ms, TE \u00bc 100 ms, slice thickness \u00bc 3 mm), and oblique axial three-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo (flip angle \u00bc 30 , TR \u00bc 21 ms, TE \u00bc 8 ms, slice thickness \u00bc 1.5 mm) images from the vertex to the skull base parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) plane. Total brain white matter hyperintensity volumes were computed based on a machine learning methodology previously described, validated and deployed in several imaging studies (Lao et al., 2008; Launer et al., 2011) .\n2.2.1. ADNI 2.2.1.1. ADNI database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations. Its primary goal was to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment could be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. From over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada, in its first phase ADNI (ADNI-1) recruited 819 participants, aged 55-90 years, including 229 cognitively normal (CN) individuals to be followed for 3 years, 398 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 192 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years. For up-to-date information about the cohort, see www.adni-info.org.\n2.2.1.2. MRI data. In this work, we used ADNI baseline structural MRI data from 359 Caucasians (Casanova et al., 2013 ) (See Table S1 ). Of those, 188 were CN (86 women) and 171 had AD (76 women) (Petersen et al., 2010) . Baseline 1.5 T T1-weighted MRI scans were collected using 3D MPRAGE sequences, as described in the ADNI acquisition protocol (Hua et al., 2008; Jack et al., 2008) . The ADNI protocol acquires 2 repeated scans of structural MRI data at each visit that are rated for image quality and artifacts by ADNI investigators. To enhance standardization across sites and platforms, the best dataset undergoes additional pre-processing, including corrections for gradient non-linearity and intensity non-uniformity."}, {"section_title": "ADNI and WHIMS-MRI image processing.", "text": "The open source package Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) was used to process the MRI images. Its capabilities include diffeomorphic transformations for image warping that preserve topology. These are based on symmetric normalization algorithms (Avants et al., 2008; Avants et al., 2011a) , which are among the top-performing image warping approaches in large comparative studies (Klein et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2011) . A more detailed description of the ANTs pipeline components is in Tustison et al. (Tustison et al., 2014) . All the necessary preprocessing steps consist of previously published algorithms for bias correction (Tustison et al., 2010) , brain extraction, n-tissue segmentation (Avants et al., 2011b) , template construction , and image normalization (Avants et al., 2011a) . Further details of the MRI image processing and its implementation can be found in the appendix.\n2.2.1.4. Cognitive assessment. Participants underwent annual cognitive assessments during their in-person clinic visits to evaluate global cognitive function in the first phase of WHIMS (years 1-10), as described previously (Shumaker et al., 1998) . Briefly, the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) (Teng and Chui, 1987) was administered to all participants. Age and education specific cut points determined which participants were referred for an extensive clinical evaluation, which involved additional cognitive testing and questionnaires, a physical exam by an experienced physician and proxy interviews (Shumaker et al., 1998) . All data were submitted to a central adjudication panel of expert clinicians who classified each case as no impairment, MCI using Petersen's criteria (Petersen et al., 1999; Petersen et al., 2001) or probable dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) . Beginning in 2007, WHI clinic visits ceased and WHIMS transitioned to a telephone-based cognitive assessment battery (Rapp et al., 2012) , questionnaires, proxy interviews and central adjudication of cognitive impairment as in the initial phase of WHIMS. The telephone battery included the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m), (Brandt et al., 1988; Plassman et al., 1994; Welsh et al., 1993) , a measure of global cognitive function and tests of memory, verbal fluency, attention, working memory and executive function; questionnaires assessing depression and sleep; and the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ) (Kawas et al., 1994) , a standardized interview assessing cognitive and behavioral changes and medical events related to dementia and MCI administered to a proxy informant. The DQ was administered when TICS-m scores fell below 31 points. All data were forwarded for central adjudication. Following central adjudication of dementia, each adjudicator was required to subtype the classification using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's, Vascular and Other dementias. Disagreements were resolved in regular consensus conferences.\n2.2.1.5. Estimation of the GM AD-PS scores in the WHIMS-MRI cohort. Once ADNI and WHIMS-MRI were aligned into a template (see appendix A), we used high-dimensional machine learning methods to estimate GM AD-PS scores in the WHIMS-MRI cohort. The general approach followed is depicted in Fig. 1 . Details of the machine learning algorithms were published previously (Casanova et al., 2012 (Casanova et al., , 2013 and also can be found in appendix B. An elastic net regularized logistic regression (EN-RLR) classifier was estimated using the GM probability maps (described above) from CN and AD participants in ADNI. The weights b \u03b2 estimated after solving the optimization problem associated with the EN-RLR classifier (Casanova et al., 2013; Friedman et al., 2009) are used to estimate the conditional probabilities. These were computed as the median values of 5 repetitions of the computations, to account for variability due to random partitioning of cross-validation that occurred during model estimation (Casanova et al., 2013) . The scores for WHIMS-MRI participants were estimated by providing the corresponding baseline and follow-up GM probability maps to the classifiers. Discriminative maps (voxels with coefficients different from zero) pinpointing the GM areas involved in discrimination of AD patients from CN participants were generated. For simplicity from now on we will refer to the GM AD-PS scores as AD-PS scores.\n2.2.1.6. Analyses. The cross-sectional relationships of AD-PS scores of baseline WHIMS-MRI participants and three risk factors for cognitive impairment (age at MRI, most proximal cognitive function test score, and abnormal white matter volumes) were assessed with linear regression with covariate adjustment for age, education, race and hormone therapy assignment. Relationships between longitudinal changes in AD-PS scores and changes in age and WM SVID volumes were assessed with linear models.\nWhen the initial MRIs were collected, the clinic-based cognitive assessment protocol of WHIMS was ongoing. When repeat MRIs were collected in a subset of women, global cognitive function assessment had transitioned to telephone-based TICS. To obtain a measure of relative change in global cognitive function over time, we standardized 3MS (administered in person) and TICS scores by subtracting them from the cohort-wide mean and dividing this by the cohort-wide standard deviation. We used the difference between the standardized 3MS and TICS scores as a measure of relative change, using the scores most proximal to the initial and repeat MRI. Linear models were then used to assess relationships between changes in AD-PS scores and changes in standardized cognitive function scores. Survival analyses, using proportional hazards regression, were performed to investigate associations of the AD-PS scores with time to diagnosis of cognitive impairment (Cox and D, 1984) as MCI, probable dementia, and MCI/probable dementia adjusted for age, education, HT treatment assignment and race/ethnicity, using the 27 cases of probable dementia and 33 cases of MCI that were observed among the 1365 women between their initial MRI through January 2010 (when follow-up MRIs began). Associations that changes in AD-PS scores between the initial and follow-up MRI (in 712 women) had with subsequent cognitive impairment was based on 54 cases of probable dementia and 37 cases of MCI that occurred during later follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for age, education, race and HT treatment assignment.\nBoxplots, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) estimates were generated for baseline, follow-up, and longitudinal changes in AD-PS scores to evaluate their sensitivity to cognitive status. To generate confidence intervals for AUC we used the R package pROC (Robin et al., 2011) . When generating these plots for the baseline AD-PS scores, we used only participants who were CN at baseline MRI and with date of last cognitive assessment in 2010 or afterwards (4.5 years on average) or whose cognitive impairment was diagnosed between baseline MRI and January 1st, 2010 (Total N \u00bc 834). Of those, Fig. 1 . -General approach to estimate Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity (AD-PS) scores for the WHIMS-MRI cohort once the images from both datasets have been processed. 733 remained stable in that time period as CN, 33 converted to MCI and 28 to probable dementia, including 12 cases adjudicated as AD. For follow up AD-PS scores and change plots, we also used participants who were CN at baseline MRI, who had both scans and with date of last cognitive assessment in 2010 or afterwards or whose cognitive impairment was diagnosed at any point during the follow up (N \u00bc 571). Of those, 455 remained stable as CN until 2009, 53 converted to MCI and 63 to probable dementia including 6 cases adjudicated as AD."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Women who had only a baseline MRI scan in WHIMS-MRI were older, more likely to be minority, hypertensive and diabetic, and had lower 3MS scores compared with women who had both baseline and follow-up MRI scans (p < 0.05) ( Table 1) . Baseline AD-PS scores were significantly higher for the 653 women who only had baseline MRIs compared with the 712 who had baseline and repeat MRIs (mean AE SD: 0.39 AE 0.25 versus 0.28 AE 0.20; p \u00bc 0.0002). This is consistent with a previous report by WHIMS-MRI researchers indicating that women who had both MRI scans had greater hippocampal and brain volumes than those who had only the baseline scan (Coker et al., 2014) . For participants who had both scans, follow-up scores were significantly higher than baseline scores when adjusted by age, education, race and hormone therapy treatment (0.44 AE 0.26; p < 0.0001).\nAD-PS scores were significantly associated with age at baseline MRI, 3MS scores, and WM SVID volume after adjusting for age, education, race and hormone therapy treatment assignment (p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). In participants who had baseline and follow-up MRIs, changes in AD-PS scores were also significantly related to changes in age, cognitive function, and abnormal white matter volumes. At baseline, women assigned to hormone therapy had slightly, but not significantly, higher mean (standard error) AD-PS scores compared to the placebo group (0.337 AE 0.008 versus 0.320 AE 0.008; p \u00bc 0.14). There was no difference in mean changes in AD-PS scores over time between intervention groups. Fig. 2 shows the values of the AD-PS scores at Scan 1, Scan 2 and their longitudinal change for a subset of WHIMS-MRI participants CN at baseline and with cognitive follow-up until 2010 or afterwards, or whose cognitive impairment was diagnosed during follow-up. In all cases the scores and their longitudinal change increased with the severity of the cognitive impairment. Additional plots of the scores can be found in Figs. S2-S3 in supplementary materials. ROC curves evaluating discrimination of the cognitive impaired groups' AD-PS scores relative to the CN are presented in Fig. 3 . Each panel evaluates discrimination of the data from the corresponding panel of Fig. 2 . The level of discrimination according to the estimated AUC increases as the severity of the cognitive impairment increases.\nBaseline AD-PS scores and change sin AD-PS scores over time were both significantly (p < 0.0001) associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment (Table 3) . For baseline (Scan 1) scores, hazard ratios per 0.1 greater score were 1.84, 1.29 and 1.50 for probable dementia, MCI and MCI/probable dementia respectively. For the longitudinal changes in scores, hazard ratios per 0.1 increases of the AD-PS scores were 1.63, 1.38 and 1.51 for probable dementia, MCI and MCI/probable dementia respectively. Fig. 4 shows a discriminative map indicating the areas involved in discrimination of AD from CN, derived from the elastic net regularization constraints. In addition, in the supplementary materials, Fig. S3 shows a mask to indicate the location identified by the elastic net algorithm as relevant. The map includes many regions thought to be involved in AD (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, bilateral inferior temporal lobe areas) (Braak and Braak, 1991; Mu and Gage, 2011; Poulin et al., 2011; Zanchi et al., 2017) , but others less reported as well (e.g. midbrain) (Lee et al., 2015) . This part of the midbrain corresponds to substantia nigra which is formed by dopaminergic neurons. Very likely few voxel-based machine learning studies (or none) have included this area in the parameter space which is part of the GM segmentation provided by ANTS. There are some groups that promote the idea of early involvement of the brainstem in AD (Simic et al., 2009) . There is also a growing literature that suggests midbrain and dopamine involvement in AD (D'Amelio and Nistico, 2018; D'Amelio et al., 2018; Koch et al., 2014; Martorana and Koch, 2014; Nobili et al., 2017; Uematsu et al., 2018) . However, it should be kept in mind that possibility that the maps could be affected by noise coming from errors in the segmentation, normalization process or other causes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "WHIMS is a cohort where AD biomarkers (e.g. amyloid PET, blood or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, etc.) are not available however MRI scans are available for a relatively large number of participants. The long term goal of this work is to provide the WHIMS-MRI database with a metric (AD-PS scores) based on MRI that can be used by WHIMS investigators as an anatomical AD risk factor to address research questions. This is part of an ongoing work aiming at validating the AD-PS scores in the WHIMS-MRI cohort. Here we develop further our previous work (Casanova et al., 2013) by estimating the AD-PS scores in a second cohort, the WHIMS-MRI study. The scores characterize how similar an individual's patterns of atrophy are to those of AD patients. Previously in ADNI we found the scores to be associated with age, cognitive status, time to conversion from MCI to AD and physical function as assessed by the functional assessment questionnaire (Casanova et al., 2013) . In addition, a recent report of our group (Espeland et al., 2018) found the AD-PS scores to be associated with trajectories of cognitive function tests scores in WHIMS-MRI. Women were grouped into five clusters of trajectories using a latent class approach (Jones and DS, 2007) . AD-PS scores varied significantly among clusters of trajectories with relationships that were more strong and consistent than those for other traditional risk factors (education, diabetes, and APOE-e4 genotype).\nIn this work we further investigated the constructive validity of the WHIMS-MRI AD-PS scores founding that the WHIMS-MRI AD-PS scores had significant cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships with known risk factors and cognitive status. After adjustment, the AD-PS scores were Fig. 2 . The upper panel shows the baseline (Scan 1) AD-PS scores for only participants who were cognitively normal at baseline MRI and with date of last cognitive assessment in 2010 (4.5 years in average) or afterwards. The abbreviation PrD stands for probable dementia. Of those 733 remained stable as CN in that time period, 33 converted to MCI and 28 converted to probable dementia including 12 cases adjudicated as AD. For the follow up AD-PS scores and change plots we also used only participants who were CN at baseline MRI with date of last cognitive assessment in 2010 or afterwards whose cognitive impairment was diagnosed at any point during the follow up (N \u00bc 571). Of those 455 remained stable as CN until 2009, 53 converted to MCI and 57 converted to probable dementia including 6 cases adjudicated as AD during follow up. associated with age, cognitive scores, and WM SVID volumes at baseline. At follow-up, greater age, poorer cognitive test scores, and greater WM SVID volume were associated with higher AD-PS scores. The scores were correlated with age, as expected. However, distinguishing between effects attributable to normal aging versus AD could be challenging. In our case the strong association of the scores with incident impairment and the observation that including AD-PS scores in our survival analyses rendered non-significant the associations of age and other covariates suggest that the AD-PS scores are a stronger risk factor than age. There is growing evidence (Brickman et al., 2009; Prins et al., 2004 ) that increased burden of WM small vessel disease increases the risk of AD. Furthermore, several studies have reported associations of GM tissue atrophy with WM lesion burden in older adults. Bilello et al. investigated the correlation of brain atrophy and white matter lesions with cognitive decline in CN, MCI and AD subjects finding that both were associated with cognitive decline (Bilello et al., 2015) . Three City Study researchers, using data from 1792 adults free of dementia, reported negative associations between WM lesion volumes with GM and hippocampal volumes (Godin et al., 2009) . In a cohort of 740 cognitive normal older adults, GM and WM lesions were found to be inversely correlated (Raji et al., 2012) . Crane et al. reported association between increased WM lesion burden and GM volume losses in several brain areas, including the hippocampus (Crane et al., 2015) . Recent work by Habes and colleagues supports the hypothesis that white matter hyperintensities also contribute to brain atrophy patterns in regions related to Alzheimer's disease (Habes et al., 2016a) . In this context our work provides further support to this hypothesis based on a large cohort of older women with available baseline and follow-up MRI data. However, we should notice that we did not take any measure to mask out the WM hyperintensities from the images which could be a source of confound in our analyses. Higher baseline AD-PS scores predicted which CN women would transition to poorer cognition. Changes of the AD-PS scores in time (Scan 2 -Scan 1) were also associated with changes in cognitive scores: increases in the AD-PS scores predicted decreases in cognitive scores and increases in WM SVID volume. The scores were also strongly associated with incident cognitive impairment. An increase of 0.1 units in AD-PS scores between MRI scans increased the hazard for cognitive impairment (combined group of MCI/probable dementia cases) was associated to a hazard ratio of 1.51 (1.31-1.75) (see Table 3 ). There are a few other studies that investigated value of MRI measures to investigate the progression of CN individuals to MCI and AD. Csernansky et al. used hippocampal volume and shape to predict conversion to cognitive impairment in a cohort of 49 individuals followed for 4.9 years (Csernansky et al., 2005) . They reported both measures predicted time to conversion. Toledo et al. investigated in ADNI the risk of conversion from CN to MCI/AD based on combinations of biomarkers, using 326 subjects with 7 years of follow-up. They reported hazard ratios of 3.11 (1.84-5.25) and 1.46 (1.12-1.92) for hippocampal volume and SPARE-AD respectively (Toledo et al., 2014) . Albert et al. followed a cohort of 224 individuals cognitive normal individuals for an For baseline analyses 27, 33 and 60 cases of probable dementia, MCI and MCI/ probable dementia were available while 1132, 1099 and 1099 were censored respectively. For longitudinal change analyses (which spans the time from the second MRI until the end of follow-up) 54, 37 and 90 cases of probable dementia, MCI and MCI/probable dementia were available while 485, 448, and 448 were censored respectively. Analyses were adjusted by age, education and race and HT assignment.\naverage of 11 years (Albert et al., 2018) . The volumes of the right hippocampus and entorhinal cortex thickness derived from MRI scans were associated with MCI incidence with HRs of 0.728 (0.552-0.961) and 0.668 (0.492-0.905), respectively. In addition, other unadjusted results (Table 1 ) support further the constructive validity of the scores. Women who had only a baseline MRI scan in WHIMS-MRI were older, more likely to be minority, hypertensive and diabetic, and had lower 3MS scores compared with women who had both baseline and follow-up MRI scans. Baseline AD-PS scores were significantly higher for the 653 women who only had baseline MRIs compared with the 712 who had baseline and repeat MRIs. For participants who had both scans, follow-up scores were significantly higher than baseline scores when adjusted by age, education, race and hormone therapy treatment.\nWe did not attempt accurate classification according to cognitive status in WHIMS-MRI. There are several reasons why classification of participants may not align with the adjudication of probable dementia implemented in WHIMS-MRI. It presents an unbalanced classification problem. The overwhelming majority of WHIMS-MRI participants met study criteria for CN. This poses technical challenges because the overall accuracy is dominated by the intra-class accuracy of the majority group. A relatively large fraction of WHIMS-MRI women meeting study criteria for CN are miss-classified as AD, very likely because they present AD-like patterns but have not progressed sufficiently to meet study adjudication criteria based on cognitive testing. Also only women performing below a fixed threshold of the 3MS scores underwent adjudication process. Women above the threshold were presumed to be CN and not thoroughly tested which in addition could lead to the categorization as CN of MCI cases further confounding classification. Here instead we tackled successfully a less complex problem. Rather than an accurate classifier of cognitive status, in essence we derived a metric (AD-PS scores) in WHIMS-MRI that acts as a \"detector\" of AD-like patterns in the brain of WHIMS participants. Though we have shown significant statistical associations of the scores with cognitive status in WHIMS-MRI (among several other factors) these statistical associations across groups do not necessarily translate in accurate classification per class.\nWe used the Advanced Normalization Tools software to put both databases into a common coordinate system. This software warped all images into a customized ADNI template based on a subset of subjects.\nMany other strategies are possible, but testing all of them is a very timeand storage space-consuming exercise, which was well beyond our resources.\nThe AD-PS scores can potentially be used as an anatomical AD risk factor in research, since they seem to capture subtle spatial patterns of AD-related tissue atrophy. They could also help to select subjects for clinical trials of AD prevention or treatment (Weiner et al., 2013) or as a criterion to select participants more or less likely to progress to greater cognitive impairment. These strategies could increase statistical power while saving resources.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only the SPARE-AD index ) originally computed for the ADNI dataset has been estimated for one cohort with longitudinal data, BLSA. The SPARE-AD index was associated with age and could discriminate which CN subjects were more likely to convert to MCI or remain stable as CN. The approach presented here differs from that behind the SPARE-AD in several respects. Our classification method is not based on a support vector machine model, but on elastic net regularized logistic regression. We determined cognitive classifications directly in the voxel space (via GM probability maps) taking advantage of the sparsity properties of the elastic net regularization and the speed of the coordinate descent (Friedman et al., 2009) . We used a different image warping approach based on high-dimensional diffeomorphic transformation and cross-database alignment strategy. Finally, here we investigated the feasibility of using ADNI MRI data to estimate the AD-PS scores in WHIMS-MRI. ADNI is a clinical dataset designed for AD research, whereas WHIMS-MRI was a clinical trial focused on hormone therapy, with data collected across multiple sites with different MRI protocols. Our work further demonstrates the value of cross-database machine learning analyses aimed at AD applications, pioneered by others Kloppel et al., 2008) . It also demonstrates the feasibility of performing cross-database high-dimensional machine learning analyses at the voxel level using the elastic net regularization approach.\nOur study has several limitations. Although WHIMS-MRI includes only women, we used data from both women and men in ADNI to train our classifiers: this provided a larger sample size that would be expect to increase prediction performance. In addition, the classifiers were trained using MRI data from Caucasians ADNI participants. While the WHIMS-MRI cohort is overwhelmingly composed by Caucasian women (91% at Fig. 4 . Discriminative maps indicating the areas involved in discrimination of AD from CN derived from the elastic net regularization constraints are shown in neurological convention. Some of the pinpointed areas are amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, inferior temporal lobe areas and midbrain (all bilateral).\nbaseline and 93% at follow-up) there are still some participants of other race/ethnicities for whom generalization may be unwarranted until further validation. In WHIMS-MRI relatively few women had adjudicated MCI or dementia, and many women did not have a second MRI. These rates are in line with the full WHIMS cohort (Espeland et al., 2015) . This may be attributable to a healthy volunteer effect, i.e. the women who enrolled in WHIMS were healthier than more general cohorts. As we noted, the WHIMS study shifted to a telephone assessment of cognitive function, so not all data were collected in person."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this work we applied a high-dimensional machine learning approach to estimate the AD-PS scores based on GM for WHIMS-MRI study participants, using ADNI imaging data. To investigate the value of the scores as an AD anatomical risk factor we studied their associations with several AD risk factors using WHIMS-MRI data. The scores of AD risk showed associations with incident cognitive impairment, age, cognitive function, cognitive status and WM SVID volume. Our work lends additional support to the utility of this machine learning-derived score. Future work will aim at refinement of the machine learning methodology and its applications to other available imaging databases. "}, {"section_title": "Appendix A. Group template generation", "text": "Images from participants in both studies were aligned into a group template created using ADNI MRI images of female participants. Images of 50 CN women (mean age 76.8) from the ADNI study were selected at random to generate a group template. The template generation process consists of four main stages: (1) group template assembly, (2) brain extraction, (3) brain tissue labeling, and (4) generation of the prior probability images.\nGroup template assembly uses the antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction.sh ANTs script to build an anatomical template based on the input images (Avants et al., 2011a) . This script first creates an initial group template based on the average of the input images. The input images are then registered and warped to the initial group template. These warped images are then averaged again, creating a second group template image. The original input images are again registered and warped to the refined group template, and the cycle repeats for 16 iterations. The averaged image from the final iteration is the anatomical (T1 space), non-segmented group template.\nBrain extraction uses the antsBrainExtraction.sh script, which strips the skull from the group template image, producing a usable, skull-stripped group template. This procedure registers a brain extraction template (Tustison et al., 2017; Tustison et al., 2014) to the group template. The brain extraction template includes a brain extraction mask, which is warped to the group template. The mask is then applied to the group template to produce a skull-stripped version of the group template.\nBrain tissue segmentation uses a multi-atlas segmentation technique (Wang et al., 2013) via the antsJointLabelFusion.sh ANTs script. This script uses a set of 15 independent anatomical images (\"atlases\"), each of which is paired with an expert-segmented label image that identifies the tissue type of each voxel in the anatomical image (Tustison et al., 2014) . The atlas images are warped to the group template and the resulting deformations are applied to the label images, which are then combined using the joint label fusion technique referenced above. The atlas images used for brain template segmentation include six tissue types: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical gray matter, white matter, subcortical gray matter, brain stem, and cerebellum.\nThe group template segmentation is thus labeled with the same tissue types. Prior probability generation: Prior probability images depict the prior spatial probability of each voxel being of a particular tissue type. To obtain these from the segmented group template image, we combined two approaches. First, a set of prior probability images for each tissue type is obtained via the antsJointLabelFusion.sh script, which propagates labels from a set of expert-labeled atlases onto the skull-stripped template. Second, the antsCorticalThickness.sh script is used to produce a prior image for the CSF. This additional CSF prior probability image is subtracted from the other tissue type prior probability images to correct for a bias in differentiating between CSF and gray matter, wherein the latter is favored over the former (Tustison et al., 2014) .\nThe result is a set of prior probability images for the aforementioned tissue types. Several additional prior images are created from combinations of these six, by adding single-tissue prior probability images together using the ANTs ImageMath program. In this report, we use a GM prior probability image that combines cortical gray matter and deep gray matter structures."}, {"section_title": "Processing of the individual images", "text": "Once the ADNI group template was generated, all MRI images from both studies were segmented and warped into the ADNI template. We briefly describe the main steps. The antsCorticalThickness.sh script registers input images to the group template. This script consists of six stages: brain extraction; template registration; tissue segmentation; an optional, improved template registration; cortical thickness estimation; and quality control and summary measurements. To obtain a registration of input images to the group template image, only the first four stages are needed. These stages produce a number of output images and transform files. The output images are all in the space of the original input image; they include a brain extraction mask, an N4 bias field-corrected version of the input image, and segmented posterior probability images for the six tissue types previously described. The transforms include affine transformation matrices and high-dimensional deformation fields for transforming an image from the input subject's space to the group template space and vice-versa. The output images are warped to the group template space via the antsApplyTransforms program. Finally, we produce a Jacobian determinant image and a log-Jacobian image using the CreateJacobianDeterminantImage program on the high-dimensional deformation field. The GM posterior probability maps from all participants were used as input for the machine learning algorithms that generate the AD-PS scores. The images were thresholded using a mask derived from the group template GM prior probability map retaining voxels above 0.4. This generated a set of 441,678 features. The images were not modulated nor smoothed. Intracranial volume is estimated from the brain extraction mask in the space of the original input image. This mask is a binary image in which voxels corresponding to brain tissue are assigned a value of one and all other voxels are assigned a value of zero. Thus, the sum of all of the mask's voxels gives the number of voxels corresponding to brain tissue. Multiplying the number of brain tissue voxels by the image's voxel volume gives the total volume of brain tissue."}, {"section_title": "Implementation details", "text": "For these analyses, we used a cluster of over 1500 CPUs available at Wake Forest School of Medicine. ANTs provides support for several parallelization mechanisms (e.g. Sun Grid Engine, pexec, Apple Xgrid, and PBS/Torque); our cluster uses the SLURM resource scheduler, which was not supported by ANTs. However, because of the open source philosophy of the ANTs developers, we could adapt their code to support parallelization based on SLURM. These enhancements were contributed back to the core ANTs development team by way of a GitHub pull request, which was merged into the main code base (https://github.com/stnava/ANTs/pull/230). SLURM support is now available to the ANTs user community."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B. Machine learning methodology", "text": "The RLR method used here is based on the implementation provided by the GLMNET library (Friedman et al., 2010) , which uses a very efficient optimization technique called coordinate-wise descent technique (Friedman et al., 2007) . The general form of the optimization problem solved by the library is of the form: \nwhere x i 2 R p is the ith sample or feature vector containing the ith participant MRI data, pis the number of variables (voxels) entering the analysis,y i 2 f0; 1g is the ith label (0 for cognitively normal participants, 1 for participants with Alzheimer's disease),\u03b2 0 ; \u03b2 2 R p are the parameters of the model, and \u03bb is the regularization parameter. The regularization scheme described by Eq. (1) contains two terms: a loss term C\u00f0\u03b2 0 ; \u03b2; x; y\u00de and a penalty term P called elastic net penalty, which is given by Eq. (3). The regularization parameter \u03bbestablishes a trade-off between the two terms and it is determined from the data using cross-validation combined with grid search. Our software implementation is based on MATLAB, where the GLMNET library is called using a freely available MATLAB wrapper developed by Hui Jiang (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/glmnet-matlab/)."}, {"section_title": "Optimization of regularization parameters", "text": "To estimate the optimal values of the regularization parameters, we combined a three-way split of the data (training-validation-testing) with 10-fold cross-validations (CV) and grid search. This was done to avoid upward bias in the metrics of performance estimates (Casanova et al., 2011; Ryali et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) . We implemented an external K 1 -fold CV where at each step we leave one fold for testing and use the remaining K 1 -1 folds for training and validation. These last two procedures are implemented by using a nested K 2 -fold CV. We divided the K 1 -1 folds into K 2 folds and we left one fold for validation and K 2 -1 folds for training combined with a grid search to determine the optimal parameters. The grid we used in our analyses was\u03bb \u00bc 0:5;1; 5; 10; 11; 12:::98;99; 100; 200; 500; 1000. For the sMRI data, we fixed in advance one of the regularization parameters (\u03b1 \u00bc 0:001) and optimized the second. We have observed in practice working with high-dimensional imaging data that this choice works well, avoiding the heavier computational burden related to the optimization of both parameters while still producing a sparse solution (Casanova et al., 2012) . At each grid point, the classifier is trained and its performance is assessed using the fold left for validation by estimating the classification accuracy. We select the regularization parameters that produce maximum average accuracy across the K 2 folds of the internal CV procedure. The classifier is then retrained using the data in the K 1 -1 folds left for training and validation and the selected optimal regularization parameters. The classifier's generalization capability is then evaluated by computing the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using the fold originally left for testing in the external CV. This is repeated K 1 times and the average classification accuracy is reported. In our analyses we used K 1 \u00bc 10 and K 2 \u00bc 10."}]
