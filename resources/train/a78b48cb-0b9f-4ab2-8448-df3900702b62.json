[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Is the Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A) a viable degree option for those wishing a career in academe? The D.B.A. degree is often considered to be a professional degree, intended for business practitioners, while the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is portrayed as the degree for preparing college or university faculty. Conversely, many academic programs market their D.B.A. programs to future academicians. In this study, we investigated whether the D.B.A. is, in fact, a viable faculty credential by gathering data from university catalogs and doctoral program websites and handbooks from 427 graduate business and management programs to analyze the terminal degrees held by 6159 faculty. The analysis indicated that 173 institutions (just over 40% of the total) employed 372 faculty whose terminal degree was the D.B.A. This constituted just over 6% of the total number of faculty. Additionally, the program and faculty qualification standards of the six regional accrediting agencies and the three programmatic accrediting agencies for business programs (AACSB, IACBE, and ACBSP) were analyzed. Results indicated that all these accrediting agencies treated the D.B.A. and Ph.D. in business identically and that the D.B.A. was universally considered to be a valid credential for teaching business at the university level. Suggestions for future research are also offered."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to the Survey of Earned Doctorates--sponsored annually by six federal agencies--1,545 doctoral degrees in business management and administration were awarded in 2013, comprising 2.9% of total U.S. doctorates awarded that year (National Science Foundation, 2015) . With few exceptions, these degrees were either the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or the Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A.).\nThe Ph.D. in business has been available in the United States since the early 1920s (University of Chicago, 2015) . The newer D.B.A. was developed in 1953 at Harvard Business School as a more scholarly successor to its Doctor of Commercial Science degree. By the end of its first decade, the D.B.A. had become firmly established as Harvard's primary business doctorate (Harvard Business School, 2014a; Lockhart & Stablein, 2002) . Other U.S. universities would soon begin offering their own D.B.A. degrees. By the early 1990s, the DBA degree had begun to be adopted internationally (Banerjee & Morley, 2013) .\nIs the D.B.A. a viable degree option for those wishing a career in academe? The answer could be a critical one in the selection of a business doctoral program. The messages from websites and even from the schools themselves can be confusing, as some institutions will claim that the D.B.A. is designed primarily for business practitioners, while the Ph.D. is the proper degree for college and university faculty (e.g., Lewis, 2013) . While a number of studies from the U. K. and Australia have investigated the impact of \"professional doctorates\" (including the D.B.A.), comparatively little such research has been conducted among U.S. higher education institutions (Erwee, 2004; Fink, 2006; Gill & Hoppe, 2009 ).\nAn analysis of prior studies on the D.B.A. versus the Ph.D., the origin and history of professional doctorates (including the D.B.A.), and a comparison of D.B.A. and Ph.D. curriculum from over 100 doctoral programs in management has been done previously by the authors (Pi\u00f1a, MacLennan, Moran, & Hafford, 2016) . In this study, we will address the viability of the D.B.A. as a credential for business faculty by considering the following research questions: "}, {"section_title": "D.B.A. Granting Institutions", "text": "A review of the websites of U.S. institutions offering D.B.A. programs was performed to locate language indicating whether the program intended the degree to be used as an academic credential (Banerjee & Morley, 2013) . The programs reviewed included those delivered online and in the traditional classroom, regardless of accreditation. As indicated in Table 1 , 28 of the 36 websites, or 78% of those reviewed, provided some indication that the program intended to prepare graduates for careers in academe. "}, {"section_title": "Regional Accrediting Agencies", "text": "In order to determine whether the six regional agencies that accredit U.S. higher education institutions distinguish between the faculty qualifications of D.B.A. and Ph.D. holders, an analysis of accreditation resource manuals, faculty credentials guidelines, and websites of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE, 2009 (MSCHE, , 2011 , the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (CIHE, 2011) , the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (Higher Learning Commission, 2013 , the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU, 2013) , the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACSCOC, 2006 (SACSCOC, , 2012 , and Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC, 2013) .\nThe standards and guidelines put forth by regional accrediting agencies and the tasks performed by those serving on accreditation review teams tend to focus on the operations of the entire insti-tution, rather than the requirements of specific disciplines such as business and management. The process of gaining initial accreditation or pursuing substantive changes or reaffirmation of accreditation for all regional accreditation agencies requires institutions to verify that faculty are qualified to teach the courses that they teach. When degrees are mentioned in relation to faculty credentials, it is done by level (e.g., baccalaureate, master's, doctorate, graduate, terminal), as in these examples:\nFaculty teaching in graduate programs should hold the terminal degree determined by the discipline and have a record of research, scholarship or achievement appropriate for the graduate program (Higher Learning Commission, 2015, p. 3).\nFaculty teaching graduate and post-baccalaureate course work: earned doctorate/terminal degree in the teaching discipline or a related discipline (SACSCOC, 2006, p.1) .\nIn With the single exception noted in the previous paragraph, none of the accreditation documents, faculty credential documents, or websites from the six regional accrediting agencies distinguished between the various doctoral degree titles and none mentioned the D.B.A. at all. The primary concern of the regional accrediting agencies is whether or not a faculty member's degrees are terminal and whether or not they are in the teaching discipline or related areas."}, {"section_title": "Programmatic Accrediting Agencies", "text": "To determine which degrees are considered terminal and in the teaching discipline of business and management, we turned to the three accrediting agencies recognized by CHEA for business programs (Brink & Smith, 2012 ). An analysis of accreditation resource manuals, faculty credentials guidelines, and websites of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the International Assembly of Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), and the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) was undertaken to identify any distinction that these agencies make between the D.B.A. and Ph.D. in terms of qualifications for business faculty (AACSB, 2009 (AACSB, , 2011 (AACSB, , 2015 ACBSP, 2013 ACBSP, , 2015 IACBE, 2011 IACBE, , 2015 For AQ [Academically Qualified] faculty, a doctoral degree is normally expected representing\u2026completion of a degree program intended to produce scholars capable of creating scholarly contributions through advances in research or theory (AACSB, 2009, p. 4) In its document, Becoming a Business Professor (AACSB, 2007) , AACSB states that, \"In an earlier era of business education, the DBA was popularly regarded as providing a more general exposure to business topics geared towards practice, while the PhD was viewed as focusing more on research in a given business specialty. Over time, the distinction between these degrees has become blurred at many institutions\" (p. 1-2). An AACSB website indicates that \"The DBA (or Doctor of Business Administration) is designed to provide business executives with competencies needed to pursue business/public administration careers that require more advanced research skills and qualifications. Some DBA programs may also be pathways into careers in academia\" (AACSB, n.d., para. 3).\nIACBE considers faculty to be \"doctorally qualified,\" when they hold a doctoral degree in business or in the area of assigned teaching responsibilities (IACBE, 2011 (IACBE, , 2015 . Although ACBSP uses the term \"academically qualified,\" rather than \"doctorally qualified,\" the language for faculty qualifications is similar to IACBE and may reflect their common backgrounds (Green & Gash, 2010) . ACBSP also recognizes business and \"out of field\" doctorates and identifies the D.B.A. with the former category, not distinguishing it from the Ph.D. in business (ACBSP, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants included 6,159 management and general business faculty from 427 institutions in the U.S. offering graduate degrees in management and business. To be included in this study, institutions had to be regionally accredited and the management programs had to be both regionally and programmatically accredited by AACSB, IACBE, or ACBSP."}, {"section_title": "Procedure", "text": "Eligible institutions were identified by performing searches of member institutions lists on the AACSB, IACBE, and ACBSP websites and identifying those institutions that offered graduate degrees in management. The search yielded a pool of 486 possible candidates.\nData were gathered from sources made publicly available by the institutions. These sources included university and academic program websites, university catalogs, and program handbooks. Because no human subjects at the various institutions were contacted directly, an expedited IRB approval was sought and obtained. The data gathered were the number of program faculty, terminal degrees (Ph.D., D.B.A., Ed.D., J.D., D.M., D.P.A., D.Sc.) held by each faculty member, and, where available, the institution that awarded the degrees of faculty possessing the D.B.A. The majority of programs listed full-time faculty separately from adjunct faculty and the information for full-time faculty was included in this study. For the minority of programs that did not identify whether faculty were full-time or adjunct, all faculty in the program were included.\nFifty nine of the eligible institutions provided a list of faculty, but either did not include the terminal degrees of their faculty or did not indicate the specific program or discipline in which faculty members taught. These 59 institutions were excluded from this study, leaving 427 institutions from which data were gathered. Faculty members in related disciplines, including accounting, finance, operations/supply chain management, marketing and information technology management, were excluded from this study. The members of the research team did not receive com-pensation for the study; however, an institutional research grant was awarded to support the dissemination of the study's preliminary results at a national conference (Pi\u00f1a, Moran, Hafford, MacLennan & Kaelin, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Faculty with D.B.A. "}, {"section_title": "Institutions Granting D.B.A. Degrees", "text": "Most of the faculty listings accessed for this study also contained the names of the institutions from which the faculty members received their D.B.A. degrees. A total of 41 different institutions were listed. Eight institutions were responsible for awarded more than 70% of the D.B.A. degrees: Harvard University, Nova Southeastern University, Argosy University, Boston University, Louisiana Tech University, Indiana University, Mississippi State University, and Kent State University. A.] degree is more closely aligned with that of a traditional academic Ph.D\" (Gill & Hoppe, 2009, p. 32) .\nMoreover, our analysis of accreditation standards and requirements of the six regional accrediting agencies and the three programmatic accrediting agencies for business schools revealed that none of these bodies distinguish between the D.B.A. and Ph.D. for purposes of program or institutional accreditation. It was further shown that faculty members possessing the D.B.A. are considered by AACSB, IACBE, and ACBSP to be academically-qualified/doctorally-qualified to serve as business faculty and that the D.B.A. is classified as an inside-the-discipline degree for business teaching. This is in agreement with the observation of Lockhart and Stablein (2002) "}]
