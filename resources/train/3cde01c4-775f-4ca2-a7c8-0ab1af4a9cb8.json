Number and percentage of public schools reporting incidents of crime that occurred at school, the number of incidents, and the rate of incidents per 1,000 students, by incident type and selected school characteristics: School year 2009-10 ."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents findings on crime and violence in U.S. public schools, 1 using data from the 2009-10 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2010). First administered in school year 1999-2000 and repeated in school years 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10, SSOCS provides information on school crime-related topics from the perspective of schools. Developed and managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences and supported by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education, SSOCS asks public school principals about the frequency of incidents, such as physical attacks, robberies, and thefts, in their schools. Portions of this survey also focus on school programs, disciplinary actions, and the policies implemented to prevent and reduce crime in schools. SSOCS:2010 is based on a nationally representative stratified random sample of 3,476 U.S. public schools. Data collection began on February 24, 2010, when questionnaires were mailed to principals, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total of 2,648 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools provided usable questionnaires, yielding an unweighted response rate of approximately 77 percent. When the responding schools were weighted to account for their original sampling probabilities, the response rate increased to approximately 81 percent. A nonresponse bias analysis was performed because the weighted response rate was less than 85 percent, and the results suggest that nonresponse bias is not an issue for SSOCS:2010. For more information about the methodology and design of SSOCS, including how response rates were calculated and the details of the nonresponse bias analysis, please see Appendix B: Methodology and Technical Notes in this report. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are presented below. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using SSOCS:2010 data rather than to discuss all of the observed differences. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate crosstabulation procedures. All of the results are weighted to represent the population of U.S. public schools. Comparisons drawn in the bulleted items below have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistic to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant; thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are mentioned in the findings. More information about the SSOCS survey, publications, and data products can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs. During the 2009-10 school year, the rate of violent incidents 2 per 1,000 students was higher in middle schools (40 incidents) than in primary schools or high schools (21 incidents each) (table 1). Some 46 percent of schools reported at least one student threat of physical attack without a weapon, compared to 8 percent of schools reported such a threat with a weapon (table 2). Some 25 percent of schools reported at least one incident of the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, a higher percentage than that of the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (14 percent of schools) or prescription drugs (12 percent of schools) (table 3). Some 10 percent of city schools reported at least one gang-related crime, 3 a higher percentage than that reported by suburban (5 percent), town (4 percent), or rural schools (2 percent) (table 4). A higher percentage of middle schools reported that student bullying occurred at school daily or at least once a week 4 (39 percent) than did high schools or primary schools (20 percent each) (table 5). A lower percentage of schools with 50 percent or less White student enrollment reported that cyberbullying among students occurred daily or at least once a week (5 percent) than did schools with higher percentages of White student enrollment (7 to 13 percent) (table 6). For students involved in the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device at school, 40 percent of students received out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, 36 percent of students received other disciplinary actions (e.g., suspensions for less than 5 days, detention, etc.), 19 percent of students received transfers to specialized schools, and 6 percent of students received removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year (table 7). A lower percentage of schools with 1,000 or more students reported that more than 75 percent of students had a parent or guardian who attended regularly scheduled parent-teacher conferences (23 percent) than did schools with lower enrollments (53 to 56 percent) (table 8)."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "text": "A higher percentage of schools with 1,000 or more students involved students in resolving student conduct problems as a component of violence prevention programs (60 percent) than did schools with lower enrollments (39 to 49 percent) (table 9). Some 41 percent of schools reported having a written plan for the U.S. national threat level being changed to red (severe risk of terrorist attack) by the Department of Homeland Security, compared to 95 percent of schools that reported having a written plan for natural disasters and 94 percent of schools that reported having a written plan for bomb threats or incidents (table 10). A higher percentage of suburban schools drilled students on a written plan describing procedures to be performed during a shooting (58 percent) than did city schools or rural schools (49 and 48 percent, respectively). The percentage of town schools (53 percent) that drilled students on this type of plan was not measurably different from the percentage of suburban schools (table 11). Among the factors that were reported to limit schools' efforts to reduce or prevent crime \"in a major way,\" three were more likely to be reported than others: inadequate funds (25 percent); a lack of, or inadequate, alternative placements or programs for disruptive students (21 percent); and federal, state, or district policies on disciplining special education students (16 percent) (table 12)."}, {"section_title": "Estimate Tables", "text": "This page is intentionally left blank Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Serious violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.\nWeapon was defined for respondents as \"any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill.

SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools.

The SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools in the United States and the District of Columbia (including charter schools). The objectives of the SSOCS sampling design are twofold: to obtain overall crosssectional and subgroup estimates of important indicators of school crime and safety and to yield precise estimates of change in these indicators between 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10. To attain these objectives, a stratified sample of 3,476 regular public schools was drawn for SSOCS:2010 using the same general sampling design as in the previous survey administrations for stratification variables, number of strata, method of sample allocation, and sorting of variables before selection. 1 The initial goal of SSOCS:2010 was to collect data from at least 2,550 schools, taking anticipated nonresponse into account. Because the majority of school violence is reported in middle and high schools, a larger proportion of the target sample of 2,550 schools was allocated to middle and high schools. The target sample was allocated to the four instructional levels as follows: 640 primary schools, 895 middle schools, 915 high schools, and 100 combined schools. Three variables that have been shown to be associated with school crime were used to create strata in SSOCS:2010. The population of schools was stratified (i.e., grouped) into four school levels, 2 four locales, 3,4 and four enrollment size categories. 5 1 Adopting the same basic design for all survey administrations increases the precision of the estimates of change. (Chen and 2 The four school levels are primary, middle, high school, and combined."}, {"section_title": "B-4", "text": "Weikart 2008; Langbein and Bess 2002;Miller 2004). The sample of schools in each school level was allocated to each of the 16 cells formed by the cross-classification of the four categories of enrollment size and four locales. The sample was allocated to each stratum in proportion to the sum of the square roots of the total student enrollment in each school in that stratum. The effective sample size within each stratum was then inflated to account for anticipated nonresponse. The subgroups were sorted by region 6 and percent White enrollment, 7 and an initial sample of 3,476 schools was selected.

Four months before the onset of data collection, NCES began working with the school districts of sampled schools that required prior approval to participate in the survey. On February 16-17, 2010, school administrators of sampled schools were sent advance letters that included the date of the first questionnaire mailing and a toll-free number to call with any questions. On February 24-25, 2010, questionnaires were sent via private delivery service directly to the principals of the sampled schools, with a cover letter describing the importance of the survey and a promotional SSOCS pen. See appendix D for a copy of the questionnaire. Three weeks after the initial mailout, a reminder telephone operation began. The primary objective of the reminder operation was to follow up with the principal or school contact to determine the status of the questionnaire; however, the interviewer could complete the SSOCS interview over the phone at the respondent's request. Returned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. Where necessary, telephone follow-up was used to resolve discrepancies or missing data identified during editing. Questionnaires that did not meet established completion criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the SSOCS:2010 data file. If a questionnaire that was considered to be complete at the end of data collection contained missing values, imputation was used to resolve the missing values.

Because of the complex nature of the SSOCS:2010 sample design, weights are necessary to obtain population-based estimates, to minimize bias arising from differences between responding and nonresponding schools, and to calibrate the data to known population characteristics in a way that reduces sampling error. The procedures used to create the SSOCS sampling weights are described below. An initial (base) weight was first determined within each stratum by calculating the ratio of the number of schools available in the sampling frame to the number of schools selected. Differences between respondents and nonrespondents were found in school level, school enrollment size, locale, percent White enrollment, number of FTE teaching staff, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, thus weighting adjustments were conducted using a CHAID analysis (chi-square automatic interaction detector). The CHAID analysis was conducted to inform the nonresponse adjustments that were applied to the base weights so that the weighted distribution of the responding schools resembled the initial distribution of the total sample (see section on nonresponse bias analysis). The variables which contributed to the weighting adjustment cells based on the results of the CHAID analysis were school level, locale, enrollment size, percent White enrollment, and the number of full-time equivalent teachers The nonresponse-adjusted weights were then post-stratified and raked using school level, school enrollment size and school locale to agree with known population counts obtained from the sampling frame to reduce bias in the estimates due to undercoverage.

Unit response rates are traditionally reported because they reflect the potential effects of nonsampling error and indicate whether portions of the population are underrepresented due to nonresponse. In order to calculate any of these measures, it is first necessary to know the disposition (outcome) of each sampled case. Table B-1 shows the dispositions of the 3,476 cases initially selected for participation in SSOCS:2010, as well as the unweighted and weighted unit response rates by selected school characteristics. 8 The overall weighted 9 unit response rate was 81 percent. 8 While it is reasonable to assume that the ineligible rate among nonrespondents is not zero, a zero ineligibility rate was assumed when calculating the unweighted and weighted response rates.

Comparisons of the sample and target population, respondents and nonrespondents, and relative response probability across frame variable categories were examined to identify potential sources of bias using school level, locale, region, enrollment size, percent White enrollment, student-to-teacher ratio, percentage of students eligible for free-or reduced-price lunch, and number of fulltime equivalent teachers as predictor variables. A CHAID analysis was also conducted to inform the selection of weighting classes to be used to produce nonresponse adjusted weights.

This analysis was done because differences between the schools that did and did not respond to an item can lead to bias in estimates. The magnitude of item nonresponse bias is determined by factors including the level of item response, the differences between item respondents and item nonrespondents on a survey item, and the distribution of item responses across categories of auxiliary variables. Based on an analysis of extreme assumptions it was determined that one item with a response rate below 85 percent (C0326) had little potential for nonresponse bias.

Completed SSOCS:2010 surveys contained some level of item nonresponse after the conclusion of the data collection phase, and imputation procedures were used to create values for all questionnaire items with missing information. The imputation methods utilized in SSOCS:2010 were tailored to the nature of the survey item. Three methods were used: aggregate proportions, best match, and clerical.
