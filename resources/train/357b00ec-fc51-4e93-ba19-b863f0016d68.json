[{"section_title": "", "text": ". Overall, the 2000 data suggests that fathers spent 64.7% as much time with children as did mothers. Data from the [2003][2004] American Time Use Survey based on a representative national sample indicates that father's interactive engagement time with children had increased from the 1965 level of 1.3 hours per week to 3.0 hours per week (Wang & Bianich, 2009). Father-child interaction has been linked to positive outcomes for children (Paquette, Coyl-Shepherd, & Newland, 2012). A 2008 review of 24 longitudinal studies revealed that 21 of the studies documented positive impact of father involvement on children's cognitive development and on behavior problems for boys and psychological adjustment for girls (Sarkardi, Kristianson, Oberklaid, & Bremberg, 2008 proposed that theory linking father-child interaction to children's outcomes be reconceptualized to include three main components: positive engagement activities, warmth and responsiveness, and control (Pleck, 2010). In the U.S., fathers tend to spend a greater proportion of their time spent interacting with children engaging in play activities, whereas mothers are more likely to engage in care taking activities (Lamb, 2010). Not only do fathers spend a greater proportion of time than mothers engaging in play activities, the quality of play between fathers and young children differs from that between mothers and young children. Mothers are more likely to engage in pretense play with both boys and girls, whereas fathers are more likely to engage in physical play with boys (Lindsey, Mize, & Pettit, 1997). Physical play with fathers has been linked to children's competence with peers (Lindsey, Mize, & Pettit, 1997;MacDonald & Parke, 1984). Because interaction with fathers is often more physical and emotionally arousing (Fletcher, St. George, & Freeman, 2012), interaction with fathers may provide children opportunities to practice and develop self-regulation skills (Meece & Mize, 2011). Self-regulation skills, in turn, may be associated with greater peer competence (Meece & Mize, 2009). For example, focusing exclusively on father-child rough and tumble play, Flanders and colleagues (2010) have proposed and evaluated a model in which rough-and-tumble play with fathers is associated with lower levels of aggression during the preschool years, and this association is mediated by children's emotion regulation (Flanders, Leo, Paquette, Phil, & S\u00e9guin, 2009). Results from this Father-child Interaction Page 5 group (Flanders, Simard, Paquette, Parent, Vitaro, Phil, & S\u00e9guin, 2010) indicate that the linkage between rough-and-tumble father-child play, children's emotion regulation, and children's aggression is moderated by the father's dominance in the play; for fathers who are less dominant, rough-and-tumble play was associated with lower levels of emotion regulation and higher levels of aggression. However, for fathers who were more dominant during play, there was no association between rough and tumble play and later emotional regulation and aggression. Because the quantity and quality of interaction between fathers and young children differs from that between mothers and young children, father-child interaction may play a unique role in children's development (Meece & Mize, 2010). The current investigation examined continuity from 9-months to 4-years of age in father-child interaction in instrumental child care activities, as well as enrichment and play activities, using data collected from residential fathers in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Additionally, social and pre-academic outcomes at age four were examined as potential correlates of father-child interaction. Because these variables may interact differently for boys and girls, associations were examined separately for each sex."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The ECLS-B is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 14,000 children. Data were collected when the children were approximately 9-months, Father-child Interaction Page 6 2-years, and 4-years. The current study uses data only from cases that included a residential father at 9-months, resulting in 8,450 children (4100 girls, 4350 boys) representing diverse backgrounds (49.1% white, non-Hispanic; 8.2% African American, non-Hispanic; 19.6% Hispanic; 12.1% Asian, non-Hispanic; 3% Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; 7.9% more than one race). The vast majority (8,300 or 98.2%) of the residential fathers at 9-months was the children's birth father; the fathers ranged in age from 15 to 75 years (mean = 32.1). At the 2-year follow-up, data were collected from the residential fathers of 7,800 children (3800 girls; 48.8% white, non-Hispanic). At the 4-year follow-up, data were collected from residential fathers of 7,050 children (3,450 girls; 48.3% white, non-Hispanic). Of this group, 4,550 of the children (2,200 girls; 51.3% white, non-Hispanic) had sufficient data for preschool caregiver measures.

This study is limited by reliance on an existing data set, and so only measures that were originally included in the ECLS-B investigation could be utilized. Thus, as with all studies involving secondary analysis of data, the validity of the measures is jeopardized. However, this study benefits from the large, representative sample made available by the ECLS-B, which benefits the generalizability of findings. Further research is necessary to document linkages between residential father involvement and children's peer-based behavior, particularly the mechanisms that may account for such linkages.
