The system is based on dynamically coupled CH3D and SWAN models and can use a variety of modules to provide different input forcing, boundary and initial conditions. The system is completely automated and operates unattended at pre-scheduled intervals as well as in event-triggered mode in response to Atlantic-basin tropical cyclone advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center. The system provides up to 72-h forecasts forward depending on the input dataset duration. Spatially, the system spans the entire Florida coastline by employing four high-resolution domains with resolutions as fine as 10-30 m in the near-shore and overland to allow the system to resolve fine estuarine details such as in the Intracoastal Waterway and minor tributaries. The system has been validated in both hindcast and nowcast/forecast modes using water level and salinity data from a variety of sources and has been found to run robustly during the test periods. Low level products (e.g., raw output datasets) are disseminated using THREDDS while a custom defined web-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for high level access."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coastal zones in the U.S. and throughout the world are subject to increasing hazards including storms and storm surge, sea level rise, and harmful algal bloom. Tropical cyclones and associated surge and inundation along the southeastern US coastline area major concern for coastal communities and their economies. Coastal waters in the southeastern US support ecologically and economically significant ecosystems, providing tourism, boating, fishing, and other recreational opportunities with an annual economic benefit of $675+ billion. With 73.5% of the population living in the coastal zone and 77.1% of GDP coming from shore-adjacent counties, this concern about tropical cyclones is particularly important to the State of Florida as it ranks in the top five of US states in the total ocean economy for its reliance on coastal tourism, recreation, and transportation sectors for employment [1, 2] . Florida's battle with tropical cyclones is notorious as it has been affected by more hurricanes than any other state. For example, between 1900 and 2010, Monroe County, located along the southwest Florida coast was affected by 32 hurricanes, which is more than any other county in the United States [3] .\nManagement of the Floridian coastal environment is a challenging task for several state and local agencies including Florida Department of Environment Protection, Florida Division of Emergency Management, Water Management Districts, and coastal counties as well as local governments. The work of these agencies is heavily dependent on information made available by such federal agencies as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), etc. Within NOAA (the primary agency associated with surge and inundation hazards), the National Weather Service (NWS), National Ocean Service (NOS), in the horizontal direction and a terrain-following sigma grid in the vertical direction. As such, the model can accurately represent complex shoreline and geometries in coastal regions. It uses a robust turbulence closure model to represent vertical turbulent mixing [15] and a Smagorinsky type model for horizontal turbulent mixing. The model uses bathymetry and topography which are referenced to the NAVD88 vertical datum for all domains to accurately simulate the coastal inundation. CH3D has been applied to such water bodies as Charlotte Harbor, Biscayne Bay, Apalachicola Bay, Florida Bay, Indian River Lagoon, Lake Okeechobee, Lake Apopka, Sarasota Bay, St. Johns River, Tampa Bay, Naples Bay, and Rookery Bay in Florida, as well as Chesapeake Bay, New York Bight, Long Island Sound, and the Gulf of Mexico."}, {"section_title": "CH3D-IMS", "text": "CH3D has been coupled to models of wave, sediment transport, water quality, light attenuation, and sea grass dynamics to produce CH3D-IMS [16] , an Integrated Modeling System for simulating the response of estuarine and coastal ecosystems to anthropogenic (e.g., increased nutrient loading) and natural (e.g., sea level rise) changes."}, {"section_title": "CH3D-SSMS", "text": "CH3D-SSMS (Storm Surge Modeling System) is a modeling suite that features coupled CH3D and SWAN models for coastal dynamics and large scale surge-wave models that are used to extract boundary conditions for the coastal model [11, 17] , which has been used extensively to simulate storm surge and inundation due to various tropical cyclones including Hurricanes Charley [11] [12] [13] [17] [18] [19] . Details of the CH3D model, including equations of motion and boundary and initial conditions, are described in [11] . CH3D-SSMS contains a robust flooding and drying scheme which is an extension of that developed by Davis and Sheng [20] .\nIn a regional storm surge and coastal inundation model Testbed [21] , CH3D-SSMS was compared with ADCIRC [5] , CMEPS [22] , FVCOM [23] , and SLOSH [4] . Detailed comparisons of models were made in terms of simulated storm surges during historic storms as well as coastal inundation maps including the surge atlas and the 1% annual chance coastal inundation maps which is also known as the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the US [24] . The results of CH3D-SSMS were found to compare well with observed water level data and was as accurate as other models. The computational efficiency of CH3D-SSMS is only inferior to the extremely efficient SLOSH model which uses a very coarse grid (~1 km) and has simpler physics. The model Testbed results demonstrated that, to obtain accurate model results efficiently, it is feasible to use a highly efficient coastal surge-wave model, e.g., CH3D-SWAN, with high resolution in the coastal region, and couple it to large-scale surge-wave models with coarser resolution in the offshore region. Alternatively, one can use an unstructured grid surge-wave model for the coastal and offshore domains with a single grid, but a high-resolution grid in the coastal region often results in stringent computational time step limitation and requires dramatically more computational resources.\nCH3D suites continue to be improved as new research enables incorporation of more dynamic features, e.g., vegetation effects on storm surge, into the models. For example, Lapetina and Sheng [25] recently used the vegetation-resolving ACMS to simulate the effects of vegetation, three-dimensionality, and onshore sediment transport on complex storm surge dynamics during Hurricane Ike which inflicted major damage to the Texas coast in 2009. Results of the 3D model are found to be more accurate than 2D model results."}, {"section_title": "ACMS", "text": "The cornerstone of the ACMS modeling system includes the CH3D (shallow water hydrodynamics) and SWAN (wave) models, running on four domains (Figure 1 ) that span the entire Florida coast.

Despite the coarseness of the grid, ADCIRC produces satisfactory results along the offshore CH3D boundary and runs very quickly to allow syncing with the CH3D model. This implementation is event-triggered by NHC tropical cyclone advisories. ACMS downloads NHC advisories and, whenever it contains forecasted tropical cyclone track coming within 100 miles of a CH3D domain, creates a model instance for that advisory. This implementation is used to quickly forecast storm surge and inundation during tropical storms. Not only do 2D model simulations complete quicker, but all the inputs required for the model are also contained in the advisory, because the surge and wave models are driven by a synthetic parametric model for atmospheric wind and pressure. In most cases, the amount of time between the advisory time stamp and prediction is less than two hours. 2.\n3D Implementation-The 3D baroclinic CH3D model is coupled with SWAN, and CH3D receives boundary conditions from a large-scale HYCOM or ROMS model, while SWAN receives open boundary condition from WWIII. The model runs four times a day at 6-h intervals starting at 00:00 UTC. This implementation is intended to provide more comprehensive forecasts including water levels, waves, baroclinic circulation, and salinity. However, this increased fidelity comes at a cost: not only the model runtime increases to 4-6 h (depending on domain and conditions such as networking and transfer speeds, etc.), but the time required to fetch all the inputs (including open boundary conditions from HYCOM or ROMS, atmospheric predictions from NAM, and river flows, etc.) can be twice as long. The model has the capability to simulate temperature, however, due to limited data available for boundary conditions and verification, current forecasting implementation does not include temperature simulation."}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric Forcing", "text": "Atmospheric forcing in ACMS includes atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation.

The 3D implementation of the model uses the formulation by Mellor [39] as it was found to produce more accurate results [38] .\nThe time step used for CH3D simulation is 60 s and time step used for SWAN simulation is 5 min, which is when the two models exchange information."}, {"section_title": "Coastal-Offshore Coupling", "text": "Both coastal CH3D and SWAN models use the same non-orthogonal curvilinear model grid and are dependent upon open boundary conditions provided by larger scale ocean models.

Large-scale SWAN model produces boundary conditions for the coastal SWAN model.\nIn the 3D implementation, CH3D obtains open boundary conditions (vertically varying currents and salinity) from a HYCOM, while SWAN derives its boundary conditions either from a WWIII model or a large-scale SWAN model."}, {"section_title": "ACMS Model Domains and Forecast Cycles", "text": "The four domains used by ACMS span the entire Florida coastline (Figure 1) and extend 50-100 km offshore ( Table 1 ). The forecasts range from 48 h up to 72 h, depending on the configuration and available input. Each cycle is initialized from the previous cycle, and a 6-h nowcasting is performed to fill the 6-h gap between cycles, followed by a forecast.\nACMS model domains use NAVD88 as a vertical datum of choice, which makes computing surge, inundation, and flooding a simple and transparent process since all the topography data is generally referenced to NAVD88. The 3D implementation of the model typically uses six equally spaced sigma layers in vertical-this number was determined by comparing simulations obtained with 4, 6, 8, 16 layers, which found that 6 layers were sufficient to resolve the pycnocline and that going from 6 to 8+ layers provides negligible differences in simulation results.

These tidal constituents were determined to be important for the Florida coast based on the NOAA tidal gauge data, while other constituents generally are estimated to have an amplitude of less than 1 cm. The constituents at the open boundary are developed via an iterative process in which phases and amplitudes at the open boundary are adjusted during tide-only simulations to provide the best possible fit with observed tides at the coastal stations. Salinity at the open ocean boundary is interpolated from a 1/12 degree HYCOM or ROMS (provided at 6-h intervals).\nOpen boundary conditions for SWAN are wave height and period obtained from the results of a 0.25 degree WWIII model.\nRiver flow measurements/forecasts and salinity measurements are gathered from a variety of sources such as NOAA Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, Florida DEP, Florida Water Management Districts, and National Estuarine Research Reserves. These data serve as boundary conditions for flow and salinity upstream of rivers and creeks and are crucial to accurate predictions of currents and salinity in estuaries, inlets, and near-shore zone. River flow and salinity data used for boundary conditions in estuaries are extrapolated in time based on the trend identified in previous data for stations where flow forecasts are unavailable or the forecasted period is shorter than the length of ACMS forecast. The extrapolation is based on identifying a linear trend during the last 7 days and using it to extrapolate the flow (subject to a maximum increase/decrease of 2 ppt in a 7-day period).

Hurricane Wilma (Figure 15 ) was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. In the U.S. it made landfall near Cape Romano, Florida with winds of 120 mph [46] and quickly crossed Florida emerging on the east coast just 5 h later. There is significant amount of data available for Wilma, including over 20 storm gauges that were installed along the west coast of Florida by the USGS.

"}, {"section_title": "Computational Efficiency and Timing", "text": "One notable feature of ACMS is its computational efficiency. Currently, model codes run in parallel (implemented via OpenMP) on Intel-based machines running Red Hat Linux (RHEL6/7) with quad-core CPUs (Intel i5-4690 CPU @ 3.50 GHz). Computers are not shared by simulations of different domains or with any other resource-intensive tasks (i.e., each simulation is assigned to a dedicated quad-core machine). The wall times for the full ACMS setup described earlier in this paper for each domain are shown in Table 3 .\nAs noted previously, given the computational efficiency of ACMS provides good balance between the provided accuracy and required resources. In order to run in real time, ACMS needs only 1-4 processing cores, compared to other systems which often require a high-performance computing system with hundreds or thousands of processors. Current ACMS setup uses a single quad-core system (as described above) per model domain. The codes within the system are effectively parallelized and the wall time can be reduced by using more CPU cores. For example, using 32 CPU cores yields approximately 30-40 min wall times (Table 3) . As such, the 2D and 3D implementations of ACMS differ significantly in wall time required to perform the model simulations, however, this difference only slightly affects the total forecast cycle time. The amount of data required and time needed to fetch these data is significantly different for the 2D and 3D implementations. It can take up to 12 h to obtain all the required boundary conditions for the 3D implementation. The only external data required for the 2D model is a hurricane track as it uses a synthetic parametric wind model to generate wind and pressure fields, which generally takes only minutes to obtain. Pre/post-processing steps take 2-5 min and hence the entire forecast cycle using a 2D model can be completed in less than two hours using the current computational setup."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Future Work", "text": "This paper details how the ACMS was setup, tested, and validated in tidal and hindcast scenarios. The system is shown to be robust and results match well with data for hindcasting. Simulated water levels and salinity for hindcasted periods match well with data and 24-h forecasts that were performed during the 2015 hurricane season are within acceptable limits for most stations. RMS errors for water levels are found to vary between 4 cm and 12 cm. Additional efforts will be undertaken to analyze the sources of error for stations that do not satisfy the criteria (e.g., two stations located upstream the St. Johns River: Racy Point and Red Bay Point) and attempt will be made to reduce the errors. The computational performance of the system is also discussed. Model efficiency allows the production of robust forecasts in a limited-resource environment and choice of NetCDF-based data standards gives flexibility in distributing the data using a THREDDS server and derived products using in-house web-based user interface. The system will be tested in operational settings (completely unattended) and operational performance, uptime, etc. will be a subject of a future publication.\nData availability and its accuracy significantly affect the results of simulations. It is especially important for salinity, as missing river flow or salinity boundary conditions can drastically change the quality of predictions inside an estuary. Additional quality control and data extrapolation methods will be explored along with an option to include a watershed model into ACMS suite for more robust predictions of upstream river flows and subsequently salinity inside estuaries. Temperature is another important variable. While ACMS is capable of simulating temperature, such simulations are currently in the preliminary phase. Feasibility of accurate temperature predictions constrained by limited data is being explored. The key to this is data availability with very little data available for use as boundary conditions and for validation. Efforts will be made to obtain such data, and setup and validate the temperature model.\nForecasting results from the 2016 hurricane season will be analyzed using more statistical categories and NOS criteria, including maximum duration of positive and negative outliers and worst case outlier frequency, as well as timing of maximums and minimums.\nSheng et al. [52, 53] developed a vegetation model which incorporates the effects of vegetation on mean flow and turbulence in the water column. The vegetation resolving model showed that, during hurricanes, total inundation volume can be reduced by up to 40% due to the presence of vegetation. The reduction of storm surge and coastal inundation depends on the characteristics (type, distribution, height, and density, etc.) of vegetation as well as hurricane characteristics (intensity and forward speed, etc.). The vegetation module will be added to the ACMS, however, additional efforts are needed to optimize the algorithms and ensure that this addition does not hinder the efficiency of ACMS."}]
