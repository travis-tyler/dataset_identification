[{"section_title": "Collection of Specimens ::: Detection of Viral RNA", "text": "Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 differ in various types of clinical specimens. RT-PCR detection\nof SARS-CoV-2 in eight types of clinical specimens were compared: bronchoalveolar lavage\nfluid, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, sputum, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, stool,\nblood, and urine.22 The highest positive rates (93%) were observed for\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid, followed by sputum (72%), nasal swab (63%),\nfibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), stool (29%), blood (1%), and\nurine (0%). Thus, respiratory specimens are generally collected to detect\nSARS-CoV-2.23\u221225 Recent\nstudies23,26,27 have revealed that viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory\nspecimens reach peaks soon after symptom onset and decline with time after 1 week. The\nviral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to that of influenza, which is present at\nhigh levels at around the time of symptom onset. In contrast, the viral loads of SARS-CoV\nand MERS-CoV reach peaks at around 10 days and 14 days, respectively.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal\nswabs, and nasopharyngeal or endotracheal washes as upper respiratory specimens in\nambulatory patients.14 Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are usually\ncollected because this method of collection is relatively less invasive. Lower respiratory\nspecimens include sputum, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Sputum\nproduction relies on productive coughs from patients. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic\npatients may be unable to produce sputum. One challenge of collecting lower respiratory\nspecimens is the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for personnel collecting specimens because\nof the requirement for close-contact with potential COVID-19 patients and irritation of\nrespiratory airways during sampling. When requesting patients to produce sputum or probing\nwith nasopharyngeal swabs, the sampling process could cause sneezing or coughing and the\nproduction of aerosols.\nThe WHO recommends using Dacron or polyester flocked swabs for collecting nasopharyngeal\nand oropharyngeal specimens and sterile containers for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal\nwashes, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.28 After collection, samples must be packaged appropriately and transported\nto the laboratory as soon as possible. Specimens should be shipped and stored at\n2\u20138 \u00b0C until testing. The maximum storage time is 2 days for nasopharyngeal or\noropharyngeal washes, sputum, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage and 5 days\nfor nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, serum, and whole blood.14\nSpecimens that must be stored for longer than these recommended times should be kept at\n\u221270 \u00b0C. It is also important to ensure the adherence of adequate safety\nprocedures during specimen collection, packaging, storage, and transport."}, {"section_title": "Release of Viral RNA ::: Detection of Viral RNA", "text": "Because the genomic RNA is encased within the nucleocapsid of virions, the first step in\nthe detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens is to extract high-quality viral RNA. RNA\nis extremely sensitive to degradation by ribonucleases (RNases). Improper RNA extraction\ncausing loss or degradation of viral RNA contributes to poor clinical sensitivity.29 Moreover, the RNA extraction process is time-consuming and requires\nlaboratory equipment and trained personnel.\nTable S3 (Supporting Information) lists the commercially available RNA\nextraction kits, their operational principles, and the length of time required for their\nuse. RNA is conventionally extracted using organic solvents. One type of organic\nextraction uses phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate (GITC), which is capable of rapidly\ndenaturing nucleases and stabilizing RNA. However, this method of RNA extraction is\nmanually intensive, time-consuming, and requires the caustic GITC reagent. Residual salts\nand organic solvents also contaminate the extracted RNA. These contaminants, such as\ndivalent cations, can inhibit downstream RT-PCR. RNA purification using magnetic particles\nand spin columns removes organic solvents and contaminants and is amenable for automation.\nRNA extraction/purification robotics and kits have been successfully developed with some\nbeing recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).21,29\u221231 However, the\nincreasing demand for RNA extraction kits stresses supply chains and manufacturers\nworldwide, which hinders the capacity of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.\nExtraction-free techniques, such as those that lyse viral particles to release RNA for\nsubsequent detection, are easier to perform and amenable for point-of-care (POC) testing.\nHowever, the development of techniques that do not require RNA extraction and purification\nmust address issues of efficiency and matrix effects, such as the influence of complex\nspecimen matrixes that can inhibit the downstream amplification process. For example,\ndetergents added during sample treatment to deactivate viruses can inhibit PCR\nreaction.32 Another challenge is the difficulty in accessing the\nviral RNA because it is packaged by viral proteins. One solution is to preheat samples to\ndenature the viral proteins and release the RNA. Preheating of specimens followed by\nRT-PCR amplification and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been successfully applied\nto nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples. However, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2\ndetection using RT-PCR in specimens pretreated with a heating step is poorer relative to\nthose treated with RNA extraction kits but better than untreated samples.33 A recent study by Pan et al.34 has suggested that heat\ntreatment to release RNA may adversely impact the ability of RT-PCR to detect specimens\ncontaining low viral loads, which can contribute to the number of false negatives."}, {"section_title": "Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Assays ::: Detection of Viral RNA", "text": "Targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 include the genes encoding for the N, E, and S\nproteins, the open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab), and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)\ngene, which is located within Orf1ab31,35 (Figure 2). The\nchoice of targets affects the analytical specificity of RT-PCR assays. The E gene is\nhighly conserved among all beta coronaviruses, and the N gene may cross-react with other\ncoronaviruses.13 The RdRP gene can be used to differentiate\nSARS-CoV-2 from the SARS-CoV virus.2 The S gene is also useful for\ndifferentiating SARS-CoV-2 because it is highly divergent from other coronaviruses.2 At the time of the outbreak, the WHO quickly made available seven RT-PCR\nassays for diagnosis of COVID-19 developed by scientists from around the world (Figure 2). These protocols provide access to standard\ntechnical guidelines for viral RNA detection. The protocols from Germany of the first\nreal-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RdRP, E, and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 were published on\nJanuary 23, 2020.21 Their RT-PCR assay targeting the RdRP gene resulted\nin the highest analytical sensitivity (3.6 RNA copies/reaction at 95% detection\nprobability).21 In assays developed later, the use of the N gene as\nthe RT-PCR target resulted in SARS-CoV-2 detection that was 10 times more sensitive than\nwhen the Orf1b gene was used.31 Since then, the Foundation for the\nInnovation of Research Diagnostics (FIND), a WHO collaborating center, has collated\ncommercially available tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.36 Researchers can\nchoose different targets or multiple targets of RT-PCR assays according to their\nneeds.\nFigure 3 depicts typical processes of RT-PCR\nassays for SARS-CoV-2. The reverse transcription reaction converts the viral RNA to\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA). PCR exponentially amplifies the cDNA, and the amplified DNA is\ndetected in real time using fluorescence probes. As a new strand of DNA is synthesized, a\nhybridized reporter probe (e.g., TaqMan probe) is cleaved by the 5\u2032 exonuclease\nactivity of the polymerase and the quencher is removed from the fluorophore, resulting in\nthe generation of fluorescence. Thus, the fluorescence intensity reflects real-time\namplification of the DNA sequences and is used for quantitative detection of the target\nDNA. Another common strategy to produce fluorescence is to use double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)\nbinding dyes (e.g., SYBR Green). TaqMan probes provide higher specificity than SYBR Green\nbecause hybridization of the TaqMan probes with specific target sequences is required to\nproduce the fluorescence signal whereas SYBR Green is intercalated in any sequence of\ndsDNA.\nProgress in RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been made very quickly,\nwith many versions of RT-PCR assays and kits developed in-house or commercialized. As of\nearly April 2020, 25 of the 28 products (89%) that were issued emergency use authorization\n(EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are RT-PCR test kits\n(Table S4).38 However, several limitations and issues\nrequire further research. First, the positive detection rate was reported to be as low as\nonly 30\u201360%, suggesting a high rate of false negatives.35,39,40 Several\nfactors were speculated to result in this high false negative rate, such as errors in\nsampling and inappropriate selection of clinical specimens,41\nindividual variations in viral load,42 and the differences in the\noperation procedure and the limit of detection (LOD) of various RT-PCR kits.33 False negative results can also arise from PCR inhibitors present in\nimproperly treated samples or extracts. Second, PCR requires controlled temperature\ncycling, refrigerated reagent storage, and professionally trained operators. These\nresources may not be widely accessible."}, {"section_title": "Isothermal Amplification Techniques with Point-of-Care (POC) Potential ::: Detection of Viral RNA", "text": "Although RT-PCR is the gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of\nCOVID-19,3,21,43 its requirement of a thermal cycler is not ideal for POC applications.\nAlternative exponential amplification techniques, such as loop-mediated isothermal\namplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), rolling circle\namplification (RCA), exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR), and exponential strand\ndisplacement amplification (E-SDA), can each be performed at a single temperature. Without\nrequiring thermal cycling, these exponential amplification techniques have potential for\nPOC applications. LAMP and RPA provide similar sensitivity achievable by PCR for detecting\nlow copy number of nucleic acids, while other isothermal amplification techniques are\nunable to achieve the same level of sensitivity.44\nRPA uses a recombinase-primer complex to open dsDNA targets, facilitating the primer to\nbind to its complementary sequence within the target, thereby circumventing the heat\ndenaturing step typically required in PCR. Polymerase-dependent elongation of the primer\nuses the target dsDNA as templates to produce multiple copies of the original target. As\nthe new copy is being synthesized, the double-stranded DNA template downstream is\nseparated to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through the strand displacement activity of the\npolymerase. An ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) present in the RPA reagent cocktail temporarily\nbinds to the ssDNA and prevents it from hybridizing back to dsDNA.45\nRPA can be completed in 10 min at a reaction temperature of 37\u201342 \u00b0C and is\ntherefore amenable for the development of POC assays.\nAlso suitable for POC settings, LAMP typically operates at 60\u201365 \u00b0C to\nachieve exponential amplification of nucleic acid targets without requiring temperature\ncycling.46 LAMP uses three pairs of primers:47 two\ninner primers, two outer primers, and two loop primers. The inner and outer primers bind\nwith the target and their extension produces a dumbbell structure composed of two\nstem-loops on either end. The loop and inner primers hybridize to the loop region of the\ndumbbell to initiate DNA amplification. The newly formed amplified DNA is double-stranded.\nThe intrinsic strand-displacement activity of the polymerase enables multiple cycles of\namplification by separating the dsDNA into ssDNA.47\nSeveral RT-LAMP assays have been developed to target different gene regions of\nSARS-CoV-2,48,49\nwith fluorescence49 or colorimetric48,50 readouts. One strategy to produce fluorescence\nis to use Calcein, a fluorescein complex.51 The fluorescence of Calcein\nis initially quenched when Calcein is bound to manganese. The pyrophosphates generated\nfrom the DNA amplification reactions sequester the manganese and release the Calcein. Free\nCalcein can bind to magnesium ions, increasing the intensity of its fluorescence emission.\nUsing Calcein, Yan et al.49 developed an RT-LAMP assay for the visual\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2. They correctly identified 58/58 positive and 72/72 negative\npatients, confirmed with parallel RT-PCR testing. This RT-LAMP assay of the\npatients\u2019 RNA sample extracts only required a 60 min incubation at 63 \u00b0C.\nColorimetric readouts for amplification techniques using enzymatic polymerization can\nalso be achieved using pH indicators. During DNA polymerization, each addition of a dNTP\n(deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate) releases a hydrogen ion which decreases the pH of the\nsolution. The decrease in pH corresponds to the extent of DNA polymerization. For visual\nreadout of their RT-LAMP, Baek et al.50 used phenol red, which changes\ncolor from pink (pH 8.8) to yellow (pH < 8.0), to indicate the occurrence of\namplification. After a 30 min amplification at 65 \u00b0C, RT-LAMP achieved detection of\n200 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted from COVID-19 patient samples.\nA drawback of the use of Calcein or pH indicators for detection in RT-LAMP is the risk of\nfalse positive results. This issue arises because any nonspecific amplification, such as\nthat caused by nontarget sequences or primer\u2013primer binding (primer dimers), also\ngenerates detectable signals. A solution to this problem is to detect the specific\nsequences of the amplification products. A successful approach is exemplified by the\nincorporation of LAMP or RT-LAMP with the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short\nPalindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology."}, {"section_title": "Isothermal Amplification Incorporated with CRISPR Technology ::: Detection of Viral RNA", "text": "CRISPR-based diagnostics arose from the discovery of microbial CRISPR and\nCRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. Two types of Cas proteins, Cas12 and\nCas13,52,53 are\nparticularly useful for analytical applications. The Cas12 or Cas13 protein is guided by a\nCRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target a specific nucleic acid sequence, while the single-stranded\nregion of the crRNA is complementary to the target (Figure 4). The functions of Cas12 and Cas13 are different. Cas12 targets\nssDNA,53 while Cas13 targets ssRNA.52 The\ntargeting sequences (\u223c17 nt) of Cas12 are chosen to be next to a protospacer\nadjacent motif (PAM) (e.g., 5\u2032-TTTV). PAM facilitates the unwinding of dsDNA\ntargets and the binding between crRNA and DNA targets. This binding induces a\nconformational change of Cas12 and activates its collateral cleavage activity to cleave\nany ssDNA indiscriminately. However, Cas13 targets ssRNA,53 and its\noperation does not need a PAM sequence. Cas13 only has some preference of the first\nnucleotide next to the 3\u2032 end of the targeting sequence (\u223c28 nt). Upon\ntargeting, Cas13 cleaves ssRNA nonspecifically.\nCRISPR techniques, using both Cas12 and Cas13, have been incorporated into isothermal\namplification approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-254,55 (Figure 4). The CRISPR targeting sequence must be considered and determined when\ndesigning primers for the amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The CRISPR targeting sequence\nis within the amplicon and in between the primers. The crRNA-Cas complex scans amplicons\nand specifically binds to those with the complementary target sequence. Upon targeting,\nCas proteins are activated to perform their known collateral cleavage activity, the\nnonspecific cleavage of multiple ssRNA substrates by Cas13 or ssDNA substrates by\nCas12.\nSignaling reporters, which are short, single-stranded nucleic acids dually labeled with a\nfluorophore and quencher, can be used as substrates.55,56 The cleavage of the signaling reporter\nseparates the quencher from the fluorophore and restores fluorescence signals that can be\nmonitored in real time or visualized under LED light. Alternatively, substrates dually\nlabeled with a biotin and a fluorescein amidite (FAM) probe can be used for detection on\ntest strips.55 Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the lateral flow strip are\ncoated with anti-FAM antibodies to capture FAM. In the absence of the target, the\nreporters remain intact and are captured by streptavidin on the control line, resulting in\nan accumulation of AuNPs which generates a red band, indicating a negative test. In the\npresence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA target, the amplicons activate the Cas protein to cleave\nsignal reporters which allows the freed FAM and attached AuNPs to travel to the test line,\nproducing another red band indicating a positive test. The signaling reporters are in\nexcess; so, in a positive test, excess intact reporters are captured at the control line\nas well.\nCRISPR-based detection checks the sequences of the products from isothermal amplification\nand only produces signals when the correct sequences exist, which provides a higher\nanalytical specificity than using nonspecific fluorescent dyes or pH indicators. On the\nother hand, an assay using Cas12 or Cas13 alone is not sensitive enough to detect the\nviral RNA in specimens.56 Isothermal amplification achieves exponential\namplification in a short period of time, which overcomes this limitation of CRISPR\ntechnology in terms of analytical sensitivity.\nOne of the pioneer CRISPR diagnostic platforms, DETECTR (DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR\ntrans reporter),53 has been used with LAMP.55\nBroughton et al.55 posted a protocol using DETECTR for SARS-CoV-2\ntesting on February 15, 2020. They used RT-LAMP to amplify extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA,\nleading to the generation of dsDNA products. The dsDNA products were detected using the\ncollateral cleavage of reporters by Cas12. Lateral flow strips were then used to produce\nreadout signals. The method was able to detect 10 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per microliter\nof RNA extract. The amplification and detection can be achieved within 30 min, which is\nparticularly valuable for POC testing and on-site analysis.\nRPA is compatible with CRISPR technology because both require similar optimal reaction\ntemperatures. Zhang and co-workers previously developed an RPA-Cas13-mediated CRISPR\nplatform, named SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking),56 and demonstrated its application to the detection of dengue and Zika\nviruses. They recently released a SHERLOCK protocol54 for the detection\nof SARS-CoV-2. After the extraction of RNA from SARS-CoV-2, they used reverse\ntranscription RPA to exponentially amplify SARS-CoV-2 RNA, generating dsDNA products.\nAfter the RPA reaction at 42 \u00b0C for 25 min, an aliquot of the RPA solution was used\nfor the detection of dsDNA products using Cas13. Because Cas13 can only detect RNA\ntargets, they added a step to transcribe dsDNA to RNA using T7 RNA polymerase. Through\ncollateral cleavage, Cas13 then cleaved a lateral-flow reporter, which allowed the use of\nthe lateral flow strip to generate final readout signals. The detection of 10\ncopy/\u03bcL was demonstrated using the extracted RNA samples. The amplification and\ndetection can be completed within about 1 h.\nAlthough the compatibility of RPA and CRISPR technology has been proven by using the\nDETECTR platform for one-step detection of human papillomavirus (HPV),53 a similar single-tube RT-RPA-Cas assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection has not been reported\nin a peer-reviewed journal. A single-tube method would simplify the operation procedures,\nmaking the method more suitable for on-site detection. Single-tube methods would also\nshorten the turnaround time and eliminate the amplicon contamination from the working\nenvironment. However, each step involved in the assay, including the reverse\ntranscription, isothermal amplification, and CRISPR-mediated detection, requires at least\none enzyme. The main challenge of achieving all reactions in a single tube is to find a\ncompromise in the conditions that allow all enzymes to work efficiently. We have designed\nan RT-RPA-Cas12 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All the reactions take place in\na single tube and under an isothermal condition. First, the target RNA is reverse\ntranscribed into cDNA which is then amplified by RPA. CRISPR/Cas12 scans the dsDNA copies\nproduced by RPA and specifically binds to a predesigned sequence complementary to the\ncrRNA. This binding activates Cas12 to cleave single-stranded signaling reporters which\ngenerates fluorescence. We are able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA within 30 min.\nRecent research has shown that the CRISPR technology has great potential in POC detection\nof SARS-CoV-2, although it has not yet been used for clinical diagnosis. Only a few\nCRISPR-based methods have been applied to the analysis of human samples. Analyses of\nextracted RNA from 78 respiratory samples (36 COVID-19 confirmed positives) using\nSARS-CoV-2 DETECTR have achieved a 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity.55 More validation is required before using CRISPR-based techniques for\ndiagnosis of COVID-19. On-site and POC tests also require instrument-free sample treatment\ntechniques to be compatible with the CRISPR diagnostics."}, {"section_title": "Detection of Viral Proteins", "text": "In addition to the detection of viral nucleic acids in a patient sample, the detection of\nviral proteins can provide complementary information to confirm the presence of the virus.\nUnlike exponential amplification of nucleic acids that can produce false positives arising\nfrom unintended amplification of contaminants, proteins cannot be directly amplified which\nreduces the risk of false positives. Conversely, because proteins cannot be directly\namplified, the detection of minute amounts of proteins challenges analytical chemistry,\ndemanding ultrasensitive detection techniques.\nA total of 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are known, including 4 structural proteins (E, M, N,\nand S) and 25 nonstructural proteins. High-abundance proteins are ideal targets for the\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2. Two possible viral protein targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nare the N and S proteins. The N protein of SARS-CoV, which has a high degree of homology to\nSARS-CoV-2,57 was shown to be produced in high amounts in SARS-CoV\ninfections.58,59\nAlthough the nucleocapsid is an internal structural protein of the virus, it is found to be\npresent in serum samples of SARS-CoV patients.60 There is no\npeer-reviewed report showing the presence of nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 in human sera\ndespite the similarity of nucleocapsids of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.61 Analysis of the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 shows that the transcript for\nthe N protein forms a large proportion and may suggest that the N protein is also in high\nabundance in SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, there are no direct quantitative analyses of\nthe proteome of SARS-CoV-2 as yet. On the other hand, the S protein is the preferred target\nfor the diagnosis of COVID-19 because it is required for viral entry into host cells and\ntherefore contributes directly to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.62 Although\nthe presence of these proteins do not necessarily indicate active infection, Li et\nal.60 was able to detect the N antigen of SARS-CoV in as long as 25\ndays after the onset of symptoms.\nCurrently, there are some affinity ligands available for both the S and N proteins.\nMonoclonal antibodies against the S1 subunit of the S protein63 and\nagainst the N protein64,65 of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) kit is available for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens.66 The kit was reported to successfully detect recombinant N protein added to human serum\nwith an LOD of 1 ng/mL. The N protein of SARS-CoV has been detected in human serum at a\nconcentration of around 3 ng/mL.67\nA major challenge when developing techniques that detect viral proteins is the lack of\navailable antibodies against each of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. One solution is to develop\nalternative affinity ligands, other than antibodies. Song et al. recently released a\npreprint describing selection of aptamers that recognize the receptor binding domain (RBD)\nof the S protein.68 The authors discovered two DNA aptamers of 51 nt\n(Kd = 5.8 nM) and 67 nt (Kd = 19.9\nnM) in length. Zhang et al. developed a peptide blocker that binds strongly\n(Kd = 47 nM) to RBD of the S protein.69\nBoth the aptamers and the peptide can be biotinylated, which is conducive to their potential\nuse as affinity ligands to develop diagnostic assays. The quicker production of aptamers and\nsynthetic peptides relative to the production of antibodies could allow improved\naccessibility. Aptamers targeting the N protein of SARS-CoV have been modified to detect the\nN protein of SARS-CoV-2.70 Although the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and\nSARS-CoV are 90% identical (Table S5), the cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV may not be a major issue because\nthere are no new SARS-CoV cases.\nThe S, E, M, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share 70\u201395% sequence identity with those\nof SARS-CoV and 30\u201350% sequence identity with those of MERS-CoV (Table S5).71 Epitopes specific to each virus can be\ncarefully chosen to reduce cross-reactivity of assays for specific proteins.71"}, {"section_title": "Issues of False Negatives from Testing of Viral RNA ::: Challenges and Research Needs", "text": "False negative results of actual COVID-19 patients could lead to detrimental effects,\nsuch as delayed care for severely ill patients and increased risk of transmission. The WHO\ndetailed several specific reasons that cause false negative results.28\nIn general, both the analysis of a patient\u2019s sample and the sample itself can be\nthe source of a false negative result.\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 tends to initiate infection and viral entry in the oral or nasal\ncavities, during active infection the virus spreads to the lower respiratory system where\nit establishes and replicates. The viral load in a specimen varies with the time of\ninfection and the site from which the specimen is collected. For example, viral load\nvaries between nasal and oral swabs depending on collection date after onset of\nsymptoms.23 Upper respiratory viral titers are reported to be higher\nearlier in infection but change over time.72 The dynamic viral loads in\ndifferent sites during the progression of the disease complicate the specimen collection,\ncontributing to false negative results.\nA number of factors relating to sample handling and treatment can also contribute to\nfalse negative results. These may include improper collection of specimens, loss or\ndegradation of the target RNA during shipping and storage of specimens, inefficient\nextraction of RNA from the specimens (e.g., nasal swabs), inadequate purification of RNA,\nand inefficient removal of sample matrix and impurities. Collection, storage, handling,\nand treatment of samples are critical for accurate and meaningful diagnosis of\nCOVID-19.\nAlthough positive RT-PCR results are indicative of active infection with SARS-CoV-2,\nnegative results do not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molecular diagnosis should be used\nin combination with other diagnostic information, including clinical observation, patient\nhistory of exposure, and epidemiological tracing information. For example, a combination\nof computed tomography (CT) X-ray scan of the chest, and RT-PCR analysis was recommended\nfor clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. The combined use of chest CT scan with RT-PCR analysis\nimproved clinical sensitivity to 97% (580/601).29\nAs recommended by the WHO, the most commonly collected and analyzed upper respiratory\nspecimens are nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. However, testing other specimens may\nprovide complementary molecular information. For example, if saliva samples provide valid\ndiagnostic values,73,74\nanalysis of saliva could open new opportunities for POC testing. Processing and analysis\nof saliva samples are less challenging than the processes for nasopharyngeal and\noropharyngeal swabs, particularly for POC testing and at resource-limited settings."}, {"section_title": "Needs for Identifying the Virus and Its Mutations ::: Challenges and Research Needs", "text": "Genome sequencing played a crucial role in the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as\nthe causative agent of COVID-19. There are more than 100 pathogens causing\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, and among these 30% are viruses.75 Common\nsymptoms, such as fever and cough, and conventional diagnostics, such as chest CT imaging,\ncannot identify or differentiate the causative agents. Traditional microbiological methods\nof separation and culture of microorganisms from patients\u2019 specimens are slow and\ntedious.

If necessary, the sequences of\nprimers and probes for RT-PCR can be adjusted accordingly. The Global Initiative on\nSharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)20 and the China Biological\nInformation Center (CNCB)80 (Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences) have released more than 46 000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences by\nmid-June.

One example of new platforms is droplet digital RT-PCR.82 Droplet digital RT-PCR uses the same primers, probes, and reagents as\nconventional RT-PCR, except that the bulk reaction solution is divided into thousands of\nnanoliter-sized microdroplets or partitions. The formation of the partitions is designed\nsuch that each partition contains either one or no target sequence. Amplification occurs\nin each partition that has a target. Counting the number of positive partitions provides\nresults of the total number of copies of the target present in the original sample. The\ndigital format follows Poisson\u2019s statistics. Motivation for the development and\nfurther refinement of droplet digital RT-PCR comes from two of its attractive features.\nFirst, the partitions efficiently reduce template competition for primers. Second, the\nnanoliter volume of the isolated droplet reactors dramatically increases the local\neffective concentration of the target, favoring reaction kinetics and efficiency. Both of\nthese features can lead to lower detection limits.83\nRT-PCR assays are typically complete within 1\u20133 h. However, most of the RT-PCR\nassays require extraction of the RNA from patient\u2019s samples in combination with a\npurification step to concentrate the RNA and remove the excess solvents and sample matrix.\nAlthough the extraction and purification procedures are usually automated, they are\ntime-consuming and require that an automated instrument be available to conduct them,\nwhich constrains the capacity of widespread testing. Confronting these challenges requires\nmodifications and improvements of RT-PCR methods to be amenable for direct sample analysis\nwithout any extraction or with only minimal sample treatment. Alternative methods are also\nneeded to ease the global demands for the same testing reagents.\nDetection of viral nucleic acids without extraction procedures is exemplified in\nalternative techniques to RT-PCR, such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification\n(NASBA),84 RT-LAMP,85 and CRISPR. To circumvent\nextraction, researchers typically heat samples in the presence of reagents that minimize\nthe loss or degradation of the targets. For example, Heating Unextracted Diagnostic\nSamples to Obliterate Nucleases (HUDSON),86 uses heat and chemical\ntreatments to inactivate RNases in clinical specimens for the direct detection of viral\nnucleic acids. HUDSON was used in combination with CRISPR-based diagnostics for the\ndetection of Zika virus in saliva down to 0.9 aM. SARS-CoV-2 has also been directly\ndetected in nasal and pharyngeal swab samples as described in a recent report.85 The specimens were placed in Universal Transport Media supplemented with\nproteinase K, and the solution was subjected to a 5 min heat treatment at 95 \u00b0C. RNA\nin the solution was subsequently amplified for detection using RT-LAMP. However, a recent\nstudy34 has suggested that heat treatment to release RNA may\nadversely impact the ability of RT-PCR to detect specimens containing low viral loads,\nwhich can contribute to high false negative rates."}, {"section_title": "Needs for Improvement and Validation of POC Diagnostics of Viral RNA ::: Challenges and Research Needs", "text": "Urgent demand for rapid and large-scale testing for COVID-19 requires new diagnostic\ntools that are suitable for POC settings. Development of POC tests must confront the\nfollowing challenges commonly faced by on-site detection in a resource-limited setting:\n(1) only minute amounts of the target RNA may be present in individual samples, which\nrequires significant signal amplification; (2) lack of sophisticated instrumentation or\ntemperature control limits the amplification techniques to be preferably isothermal; (3)\nsignals generated from the amplification reactions must be readily detectable; (4)\nspecimen handling must be minimal to avoid operator exposure to the virus, which means\nthat the assay is best performed in a single tube or in a closed compartment without the\nneed for repeated opening; (5) the tests should be easily performed by personnel without\nextensive training; (6) time of analysis should be reasonably short; and (7) validation of\nthe POC assays should be vigorously conducted with the analyses of actual clinical\nspecimens. Ultimately, POC protocols should be simple so that nonlaboratory staff or even\npatients can perform the tests in less controlled testing environments rather than in\nanalytical laboratories.16\nA notable example using isothermal amplification is ID NOW-COVID-19 (Abbott), which\nreceived Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval from the United States FDA. According\nto the manufacturer, the technique requires only 5\u201313 min to generate positive\nresults from samples of COVID-19 patients. However, concerns have been raised over the\naccuracy of ID NOW-COVID-19 for practical use.87 The false negative\nrate is significantly increased for the analysis of patient samples stored in viral\ntransport media, and the cause is still under investigation. A few studies have also shown\nthat ID NOW-COVID-19 generated high false-negative results when the viral loads in samples\nare low.88\u221290 A comparison between ID\nNOW-COVID-19 and RT-PCR (Xpert Xpress) showed that the positive detection rate of ID NOW\nwas less than 55% when the RT-PCR threshold cycles for detecting N2 using Xpert Xpress\nwere higher than 33.7 cycles.88\nThe most exciting and promising recent developments come from applications of isothermal\namplification strategies and their incorporation with CRISPR techniques to achieve POC\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2. Isothermal amplification enables rapid (10\u201360 min)\namplification of nucleic acids at a constant temperature (e.g., 37\u201365 \u00b0C)\nwithout the requirement of thermal cycling. These features make isothermal amplification\ntechniques suitable for POC testing.\nRT-LAMP and RT-RPA, as alternatives to RT-PCR, have been developed to achieve similar\nlevels of detection for viral RNA. Incorporation with CRISPR techniques, such as SHERLOCK\nand DETECTR, improves the specificity and sensitivity of the isothermal amplification\nassays. We anticipate an integration of these complementary techniques into a format in\nwhich the various reactions take place in a single tube/device. A simple format of\n\u201csample in and answer out\u201d is desirable for POC testing.\nThere are opportunities to develop POC colorimetric assays for the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2. Colorimetric assays using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have previously been\ndeveloped to facilitate CRISPR-based detection of hepatitis B virus.91\nAuNPs are simple to synthesize,92 and the AuNP surface can be modified\nwith hundreds of nucleic acids.93\u221295 A color\nchange resulting from aggregation of AuNPs is a simple readout and can be incorporated\nwith both isothermal amplification and CRISPR techniques to achieve POC testing. This\nsingle-tube reaction format would minimize operation error and avoid\ncross-contamination."}, {"section_title": "Requirement for Biosafety ::: Challenges and Research Needs", "text": "One major challenge in developing diagnostic assays for COVID-19 is the necessity to work\ndirectly with SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore,\nexpressing the S protein on mammalian cells is difficult due to its high degree of\nglycosylation.97 To solve these logistical issues, Nie et al.98 developed a pseudovirus consisting of a vesicular stomatitis virus that\nexpressed the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on its surface.
