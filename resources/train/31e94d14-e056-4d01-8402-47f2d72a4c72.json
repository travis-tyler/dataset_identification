Federal funding of industrial R&D was $22.5 billion in 1999 compared with $24.2 billion in 1998. After adjusting for inflation, total industrial R&D rose 7 percent, company-funded R&D rose 9 percent, and federally funded R&D fell 8 percent. Domestic net sales of companies that performed R&D in the United States rose from $4.7 1 In this Data Brief, and in NSF industrial R&D statistics, \"company\" is defined as a business organization of one or more establishments under common ownership or control. 2 The 1998 and 1999 samples were designed to produce coefficients of variation (CVs) of 2 percent for industries in which there is a large amount of R&D expenditures and 5 percent for industries in which there is a moderate amount of R&D expenditures. For industries in which there is little expenditure for R&D, the CVs typically are larger. It is unlikely that year-to-year percentage changes larger than the targets are produced by sampling error, but sampling error can exaggerate them. In addition to sampling error, year-to-year changes may be influenced by companies with large R&D expenditures that change industry classifications because of payroll composition, mergers, or acquisitions, or companies that change size classifications. 3 \"Company funding\" refers to funds provided by all sources except the Federal Government for industrial R&D performed within the company's domestic facilities. The funds are predominantly the company's own, but also include funds from such outside organizations as other companies, research institutions, universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and state governments. trillion in 1998 to $5.9 trillion in 1999. 4 Domestic employment by companies that performed R&D in the United States rose from 18.3 million people in 1998 to 22.9 million in 1999. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) scientists and engineers who performed industrial R&D remained unchanged, about 1.0 million in both years.

However, in more detailed tables produced from the survey, the industry categories differ from those produced from the survey's 1998 and earlier cycles. For 1999, early release tables are available at http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/ srs01410/start.htm. Among those tables classified by industry, statistics from the 1997 and 1998 cycles of the survey which were previously classified using the SIC system have been reclassified using the new NAICS codes. This has been done to provide a bridge for users who want to make year-to-year comparisons beyond the aggregate comparisons made here."}, {"section_title": "Size of Business Classifications", "text": "Another survey enhancement beginning with the 1999 cycle is an increase in the number of size of company categories used to classify survey statistics. The original 6 categories have been expanded to 10 to emphasize the role of small companies in R&D performance. During 1998, companies with fewer than 500 employees spent $30.2 billion on industrial R&D performed in the United States. During 1999, they spent $34.1 billion. Of this amount, as shown in table 1, 21 percent ($7.0 billion) was spent by the smallest companies (those with at least 5 but fewer than 25 employees). The statistics further show that there was more growth in the amount of R&D performed by smaller companies than in the amount performed by larger companies. The more detailed business size information also facilitates better international comparisons. Generally, statistics produced by foreign countries that measure their industrial R&D enterprise are reported with more detailed company size classifications at the lower end of the scale than U.S. industrial R&D statistics traditionally have been. 7 The new classifications of the U.S. statistics will enable more direct comparisons with other countries' statistics."}, {"section_title": "Notes on Survey Methodology", "text": "Statistics resulting from the 1999 cycle of the survey benefit from recent efforts to strengthen statistics for industries that perform the greatest amounts of R&D while lessening coverage of industries that perform little or no R&D. Specifically, beginning with the 1998 survey, a new sampling approach was used for companies in industries that do not conduct large amounts of R&D. These companies were sampled at much lower rates than in prior surveys allowing companies that conduct relatively large amounts of R&D to be sampled at higher rates. This has shifted emphasis toward those industries crucial in developing strong, representative estimates of industrial R&D spending. This sampling approach and its effect on the resulting statistics are"}]
