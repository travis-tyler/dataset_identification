The recent growth in the development of putative neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood biomarkers for AD pathology provides increasing impetus for studies of people at risk for AD, because biomarkers may allow models of AD risk to be tested without waiting for cognition and behavior to deteriorate to allow clinical classification of AD. Consequently, there is now substantial international effort to study prospectively relationships between clinical characteristics and putative AD biomarkers in groups who carry different risk factors for AD. Some of these studies focus on genetic risk factors (Reiman et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2012) ; however, studies such as the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have examined cohorts of individuals aged over 60 years who possess varying risk factors for AD.\nThe AIBL study is a prospective study of a large group (1,112) of individuals aged over 60 years who are either classified as cognitively healthy, or meet clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, and who have agreed to reassessment every 18 months. Assessment comprises extensive study of cognitive function, neuroimaging, blood biomarkers, and lifestyle (diet and exercise) characteristics (Ellis et al., 2009) . By combining these investigations in a prospective fashion, the AIBL study contributes to the understanding of the development and progression of AD through the prodromal, preclinical, and clinical stages of the disease. While data for clinical and pathological markers are continually being communicated in subsamples of the AIBL cohort, it is crucial that the clinical and cognitive characteristics of the entire AIBL cohort be reported as the study advances, especially as current clinical models of early AD are based almost entirely on the objective identification of subtle cognitive impairment.\nCareful reporting of the clinical and cognitive status of the individuals at risk for AD who are enrolled in large prospective studies of relationships between biomarkers and clinical status is important because this will provide estimates of the rate and nature of progression of AD that have been derived from carefully characterized samples. Second, such reports provide important information about the nature and magnitude of cognitive impairment at different stages of disease progression and third, they set the context for any clinical-pathological relationships observed in sub-samples of the cohort. The first aim of this study was to describe the clinical status of the AIBL cohort at the 18-month reassessment, and in particular, the rate at which there was an emergence of cognitive impairment in the healthy cohort and progression of disease in the MCI cohort. The second aim of the study was to describe the nature and magnitude of change in cognitive function that accompanied change in clinical status from healthy to MCI and from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We sought to reassess the baseline cohort of 1,112 individuals, 18 months after their enrollment and initial assessment in AIBL, from the following baseline groups: (1) 211 individuals with AD as defined by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) ; (2) 133 individuals with MCI -MCI is a clinical syndrome describing impaired cognitive performance (often involving memory), in the absence of frank dementia, which represents a high-risk state for the development of AD (Petersen et al., 1999; Winblad et al., 2004) ; (3) 768 healthy individuals without cognitive impairment (HC).\nAt the 18-month follow-up, individuals underwent cognitive and clinical assessment and the data collected were assessed by a clinical review panel (chaired by DA), before allocation of each participant into one of five diagnostic groups: AD by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, MCI, HC reporting subjective memory concern (SMC), HC reporting no subjective memory concern (non-SMC), and other (e.g. non-AD dementia, psychiatric disorder other than dementia, etc.), details of which are outlined below. Subjective memory concern status was determined by the subject's \"yes\" or \"no\" response to the single question \"Do you have difficulty with your memory,\" and this same question was asked at both baseline and 18-month follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Ethics approval", "text": "The AIBL study, including the 18-month follow-up protocol, was approved by the institutional ethics committees of Austin Health, St Vincent's Health, Hollywood Private Hospital and Edith Cowan University, and all volunteers gave written informed consent before participating in the study."}, {"section_title": "Attendance for AIBL reassessment", "text": "Assessments took place at three locations in Melbourne and at two locations in Perth, depending on whether the participants were to undergo brain imaging and where they lived. A very small number of participants (particularly some affected by AD) were assessed by AIBL staff at their home.\nAll assessments were conducted in the mornings, after an overnight fast. Weight, height, abdominal girth, sitting blood pressure, and pulse were measured, and 80 ml of blood drawn. Participants were then provided with breakfast, following which their cognition and mood were assessed, as described below."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive and mood assessment", "text": "The AIBL cognitive and mood assessment has been described previously (Ellis et al., 2009) . Cognitive and mood tests were performed by trained staff, most of whom were qualified neuropsychologists and all of whom had undergone extensive training in the assessment techniques. The full assessment battery comprised the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) , California Verbal Learning Test -Second Edition (CVLT-II; Delis et al., 2000) , Logical Memory I and II (WMS; Story 1 only; Wechsler, 1945) , D-KEFS verbal fluency (Delis et al., 2001) , 30-item Boston Naming Test (BNT; Saxton et al., 2000) , Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, 2001) , Digit Span and Digit Symbol-Coding subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleThird Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997) , the Stroop task (Victoria version; Strauss et al., 2006) , and the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT; Meyers and Meyers, 1995) . Participants also completed the computerized CogState battery (www.cogstate. com) and for all CogState tasks, speed (reaction time in milliseconds) and accuracy (number of correct responses made) of each performance were recorded. The length of a typical assessment was between one and two hours. For a more comprehensive account of the cognitive battery and the rationale behind the selection of individual tests, readers are referred to our baseline cohort paper (Ellis et al., 2009) .\nBoth the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15; Sheik and Yesavage, 1986 ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983; Snaith and Zigmond, 1986) were completed at the followup visit. For participants with a diagnosis of AD or MCI, and for some HC participants where decline was suspected (e.g. a decline of 1.5 SD over 18 months on one or more cognitive domains), we sought to contact an informant if such a person was available and if the participant consented to this contact. These informants were asked to provide additional information about the functional performance of the research participants, and to complete the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline (IQCODE -Short Form; Jorm and Jacomb, 1989) .\nDementia severity was rated for all participants using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Morris, 1993) on the basis of information obtained from cognitive testing, direct questioning of the participant, and information from an informant and/or from the participant's treating clinician (for those diagnosed with AD or MCI). Both an overall CDR score (range 0-3) and a \"sum of boxes\" score (range 0-18) were generated. All CDR ratings were reviewed in detail by one person (DA) to ensure consistency."}, {"section_title": "Blood samples and lifestyle questionnaires", "text": "The 80 ml blood samples taken on arrival were processed and analyzed as detailed in our earlier baseline report (Ellis et al., 2009) and the findings of these 18-month repeat blood analyses will be reported in future publications.

This latter group included participants who demonstrated any of the following: MMSE score <28/30, failure on the Logical Memory test (as per ADNI criteria, as described previously in Ellis et al., 2009) , other evidence of possibly significant cognitive difficulty on neuropsychological testing (i.e. a score of 1.5 SD below the relevant normative mean on any neuropsychological measure), a CDR score of 0.5 or greater, medical history suggestive of the presence of illnesses likely to impair cognitive function, informant or personal history suggestive of impaired cognitive function, or the consumption of medications or other substances in quantities that could influence cognition. A consensus diagnosis was assigned for each such participant, using internationally agreed diagnostic criteria according to both DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1992) . Where appropriate, ICD-10 dementia severity rating (World Health Organization, 1992) , NINCDS-ADRDA AD diagnosis (probable or possible), and MCI classifications were applied (see below). The clinical review panel comprised old age psychiatrists (DA, NL), neurologists (DD and CS), a geriatrician (MW) and psychologists (KE, GS), and other staff members who attended from time to time in order to provide information about individual subjects and their assessments. A quorum was formed by three members, and included at least one medically qualified member and at least one psychologist member. The panel conferred by telephone conference and five or more panel members attended all meetings, with all but one of the follow-up review conferences being chaired by DA (the other was chaired by NL). Diagnoses were made blind to the results of AIBL neuroimaging data, but were often informed by structural brain imaging that had been conducted for independent clinical reasons. Summary neuropsychological, mood, and informant data for both baseline and 18-month follow-up testing were available to the diagnostic panel.\nAs at baseline, MCI diagnoses were made according to a protocol based on the criteria of Winblad et al. (2004) , which are informed by the criteria of Petersen et al. (1999) . Consistent with Winblad criteria, all the participants classified with MCI had either personally, or through an informant, reported memory difficulties at followup. Participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis of MCI were required to demonstrate the following at reassessment in order to be retained in the MCI category: (1) a score 1.5 SDs or more below the relevant normative mean on at least one neuropsychological test, and (2) a current report of subjective memory concern either from the individual or from an informant. Participants who were classified as HCs at baseline had to fulfill the more stringent criterion of impairment on two or more cognitive tests at a level at least 1.5 SDs below the normative mean, in addition to reporting subjective memory concern, to be classified as MCI. The greater stringency applied to allocating individuals presenting as HCs to the MCI category was decided upon after extensive discussion, is justified by the acknowledged mutability of MCI diagnoses, and replicates our practice when diagnosing MCI at baseline. All participants with MCI manifested substantially intact activities of daily living, exhibited no clear evidence of significant impairment in their social or occupational functioning, and did not fulfill ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for dementia."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "For participants presenting for reassessment, the proportion of those transitioning from HC to MCI and MCI to AD over 18 months was calculated. Two-sample t-tests and tests of differences in proportions were used to investigate baseline differences between transitioning and non-transitioning groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to look for differences in cognition between HCs with and without a memory complaint. For both HC at baseline and MCI at baseline, a series of linear model (LM) analyses were conducted to examine cognitive change (18 months minus baseline assessment) between transition groups and stable groups (i.e. HC stable vs. HC to MCI transition; MCI stable vs. MCI to AD transition). All LM analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and APOE \u03b54 status. The magnitude of the difference in adjusted means between the transition group and the stable group for each performance measured at the 18-month assessment was expressed using Cohen's d. Figure 1 shows the total numbers of volunteers reassessed after 18 months and both the initial category to which each volunteer was assigned at baseline and the category of allocation after the 18-month reassessment and clinical review. Of the 1,112 participants in the inception cohort, followup data were collected for 89.9% (1,000) at 18 months (972 participants were reassessed and 28 had died) and a further 112 did not return for reassessment.

Accounting for baseline MCI cases lost to followup, a transition rate of 30.5% from MCI to AD was observed over 18 months. The rate of HCs progressing to MCI classification at 18 months was 2.5%, and 13 of these 17 incident MCI cases had been in the SMC category at baseline. There was considerable fluctuation in the status of reported subjective memory concern over 18 months. Thirty percent of baseline non-SMC (114 cases) reported memory difficulty at 18 months. In contrast, 25% of baseline SMC (97 cases) had no reported memory difficulty at 18-month reassessment.

In terms of cohort retention, the AIBL investigators have been successful in reassessing the great majority of AIBL participants (89.9%). Approximately 30% of MCI participants in this cohort met criteria for AD dementia at follow-up, and this rate of transition to AD over 18 months is slightly higher than the reports of around 15% conversion per annum in carefully assessed clinically derived samples of MCI participants from North America and Europe (Kurz and Lautenschlager, 2010) . It is likely that this higher transition rate reflects the fact that the AIBL baseline MCI cohort was recruited primarily from memory clinics and the private practices of geriatricians, neurologists, and psychiatrists specializing in the assessment and management of memory disorder, and reflected a group who were already close to transitioning to an AD diagnosis. That seven subjects initially classified as fulfilling criteria for MCI were reclassified as HCs after 18 months is also consistent with previous research experience and the mutability of MCI diagnoses.\nAt both baseline and 18 months, more than half of the HC volunteers reported a subjective memory complaint, which is within the range observed in Australian population samples (Slavin et al., 2010; Mewton et al., 2013) . There was considerable instability in the report of subjective memory concern over the two assessments. This may reflect reassurance of some worried participants at their adequate performance on baseline testing, sensitization of some previously sanguine participants to subtle failures on complex and difficult tests, and the metric crudeness of assessing memory complaints on the basis of one single question. For this reason, a much more detailed assessment of memory concerns and perceptions of memory function has been undertaken at the 18-month and subsequent follow-ups, including administration of the Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), a brief measure of subjective memory complaint in people with normal cognitive function. Our current findings did suggest that affective factors play some role in the determination of memory complaint status, with lower depression and anxiety scores associated with a lack of memory complaint at baseline (Buckley et al., 2013) , however these factors were not related to change in cognition over 18 months. This does not mean that individuals who have concerns about their memory should not be thoroughly assessed and then followed to detect actual or emergent cognitive impairment, but it does imply that they should also be assessed for the presence of any potentially treatable affective disorder.\nThere were a significantly higher proportion of participants with subjective memory concern in the group that converted to MCI over 18 months. However, the fact that 13/17 HCs who converted to MCI at follow-up reported difficulty with memory at baseline might merely reflect the diagnostic criterion of concern expressed about memory, which forms one essential element of the standard MCI diagnostic criteria (Winblad et al., 2004) . Once we complete analysis of three-year follow-up data on the entire cohort, and more participants have undergone diagnostic transition, we intend to explore the effect of varying the criteria for MCI (e.g. adjusting the number of low cognitive performance measures required for classification and exploring the result of omitting the memory complaint criterion from the diagnostic algorithm) on transition rates and progression to AD.\nEpisodic memory deficits were greater both for those transitioning from HC to MCI than for those who remained classified as HC, as well as for those transitioning from MCI to AD compared to stable MCI volunteers. The salience of difficulties in retaining newly learned information as a very early indicator of cognitive decline has been inferred from previous research (for a review, see Savage, 2010) , and is reinforced by our findings. The magnitude of decline in episodic memory was larger in the HC to MCI transition than in the MCI to AD transition, and this likely reflects the fact that transition from MCI to AD is related more to changes on functional measures than episodic memory performance. Indeed, those MCI cases that transitioned to AD showed a significantly higher increase in CDR sum of box than stable MCI over 18 months. In terms of demographic characteristics, transitioners and stable cases did not differ significantly in age or gender (both for the HCs at baseline and MCI at baseline). However, the MCI to AD transition group included a significantly higher proportion of participants carrying an APOE \u03b54 allele, consistent with evidence that this allele is a strong risk factor for development of AD.\nIt is important to note that the AIBL sample is by design a convenience sample, drawn mainly from motivated volunteers and clinical populations, and is therefore unlikely to be truly representative of the Australian general population. Convenience sampling of cognitively healthy participants is vulnerable to self-selection bias, with convenience samples tending to be younger and better educated than population samples, while clinically referred samples (e.g. a vast majority of the MCI and AD cases within AIBL) are likely to include people who have better access to health care due to socioeconomic factors. Indeed, the AIBL population is observed to be highly educated, and with higher than average estimated IQ. As a result, there are limitations to the generalizability of the transition rates and cognitive effect size changes in this sample, with these data not directly comparable to population study rates, but rather forming an important comparison point for other large cohort studies (i.e. ADNI), which have established cohorts with varying risk factor profiles to examine AD pathology and early diagnosis.\nNo individual diagnosed with AD dementia at baseline and who was still alive and could be reassessed at 18 months failed to meet diagnostic criteria for AD at 18 months, indicating a high degree of rigor and accuracy in the baseline diagnostic process. The outcome for this group at 18 months has already been reported in detail (Sona et al., 2012) , with rapid decline (greater than 5 MMSE points lost in 18 months) being predicted by baseline CDR (both total score and sum of box score) and the prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitor at baseline. The relationship between prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors and rapid cognitive decline has also been observed within the ADNI study cohort (Schneider, 2011) .\nCognitive decline with age is not a rapid process for most people, and 18 months is a fairly short period over which to detect emergent decline or transition to clinically diagnosable MCI or AD among previously healthy individuals. Nevertheless, the detailed cognitive data collected in the AIBL study give us the best possible opportunity of detecting such changes that, after future waves of follow-up are complete, may allow us to make a major contribution to determining factors that may be predictive of future cognitive decline in older individuals who are cognitively healthy at present."}, {"section_title": "Conflict of interest", "text": "NL is editor and DA is a former editor of International Psychogeriatrics.
