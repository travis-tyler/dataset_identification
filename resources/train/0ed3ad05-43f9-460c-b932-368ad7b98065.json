[{"section_title": "Japanese Teachers Noted Throughout the World", "text": "An international academic ability survey found Japanese children to have high academic abilities. Since 1995, Japan has participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which measures academic achievement in math and science at the primary and middle/junior high school levels, and has generally ranked within the top five participating countries. Japan has also participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) since 2000 and has scored generally within the top ten in literacy, mathematical literacy, and science literacy. In the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which measures literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving abilities using technology among men and women age 16 to 65, Japan was generally one of the top scorers, showing that the academic abilities of Japanese adults are among the highest in the world.\nWhy is the quality of Japanese education so high? One important factor may be the high quality of teachers. It is believed that the quality of Japanese teachers is so high because there is a set standard and there are no differences in quality by region. Therefore, this paper hypothesizes about why there are no regional gaps in the quality of Japanese teachers and aims to investigate that hypothesis. Particularly, it focuses on the factors that support the quality of Japanese teachers and considers the fact that there are no regional gaps in these factors to be an important element in maintaining the high quality of teachers."}, {"section_title": "The Professional Development of Japanese Teachers", "text": "What experiences do Japanese teachers have, and what have they done to improve their own quality and thus support the quality of education? To clarify this, we should investigate what they find significant and whether they have increased their own competencies.\nAmong studies on Japanese teachers, the study \u00abThe Life Course of Teachers\u00bb begun by Tadahiko Inagaki et al. analysed and discussed the professional professional development in Foro de Educaci\u00f3n, v. 14, n. 20, enero-junio 2016, pp. 453-466.\ne-ISSN: 1698-7802 development of teachers from a historical viewpoint looking at social conditions and trends in education policies 2 . These researchers targeted a cohort of teachers who graduated in 1931 from a normal school in Nagano prefecture and discussed the impact that the history of the Sh\u014dwa period had on these teachers 3 . This research showed that the things which teachers believed to be most important in supporting their practices and raising competency were \u00abresearch activity at school\u00bb, \u00abmeetings at school with exceptional senior teachers and leaders\u00bb, followed by \u00abexperience in educational practices\u00bb, \u00abappointments to schools that have personal meaning\u00bb and \u00abmeeting exceptional people outside of school\u00bb (Inagaki et al., 1988, pp. 72-96) .\nJunji Yamazaki, in a study related to Inagaki's life-course research, targeted teachers who graduated from the national teacher-training department and became primary and middle/junior high school teachers in prefectural schools. Between 1984 and 2004 , he conducted five continuous surveys, each time clarifying the characteristics and changes of the professional development of teachers 4 . All five surveys showed that most teachers, regardless of generation, indicated that the things significant to improving the quality of practices were \u00abtraining in affiliated schools\u00bb, \u00abworkplace atmosphere and human relations\u00bb and \u00abone's own motivation and effort\u00bb. A higher percentage of the younger generation also indicated \u00abpersonal advice from senior teachers and colleagues\u00bb and \u00abchanges in interactions with children\u00bb (Yamazaki, 2002, pp. 204-234) .\nThese studies targeted specific eras in Japanese history and teachers in a specific region. Therefore, it remains unclear what all generations of teachers performing modern educational practices find significant in improving the quality of practices and whether the same things would be found significant in a survey targeting teachers outside a specific region.\nOne survey that clarifies some of what is significant in improving the quality of teaching practices among Japanese teachers is the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS). In this survey, compared to teachers from other 2 Inagaki (1988) got the idea of a life course for teachers from Elder's (1974) . 3 Sh\u014dwa (25 December 1926 -7 January 1989 ) is the name of the era of the Sh\u014dwa Emperor, known outside of Japan as Emperor Hirohito. The subjects of this particular survey were public primary school teachers during this Sh\u014dwa period. When they were young teachers, many teachers in Nagano prefecture were arrested for participating in leftist movements. Then, as mid-career teachers, they experienced World War II. After the war they practised progressive education while continuing to teach under the conservativization of educational policies. They experienced the changes in the Japanese educational environment brought on by the period of high economic growth and the rise of the ratio of students who go on to the next stages of education. Most of them retired from primary school teaching and administration in the 1970's (Inagaki et al., 1988, pp. 5-12) . 4 Yamazaki et al. Mochizuki et al., 2011ab) focused on the teachers of the younger generation and conducted the sixth survey in 2010.\nForo de Educaci\u00f3n, v. 14, n. 20, enero-junio 2016, pp. 453-466.\ne-ISSN: countries participating in the survey, many Japanese middle school and junior high school teachers indicated the following to be significant: 1) When many people receive guidance from the principal of their school, school management team members, and leaders within the organization; 2) Classroom visits to other schools are actively carried out; 3) Feedback from teachers is given in multiple forms; and 4) Many teachers feel their competency improving as a result of the feedback.\nHowever, TALIS does not show just how significant the guidance from other teachers is, nor what kind of feedback is significant. In addition, since this survey targeted middle/junior high school teachers, it does not shed light on primary school teachers, and it is difficult to say that it can determine what underlies the quality of Japanese primary and middle/junior high school teachers.\nTherefore, this paper will clarify what types of things in their everyday teaching life modern Japanese primary and middle/junior high school teachers feel are significant in improving the quality of their practices. Additionally, it will make a comparison by region and verify the hypothesis that there are no differences by region in factors that support teacher quality and that these factors are homogenous."}, {"section_title": "Research Targets and Methods", "text": "The targeted regions, where Yamazaki conducts his survey studies, were B prefecture in the Chubu region, which has an accumulation of quantitative data on teacher competency formation, as well as A prefecture in the Kansai region and C prefecture in the Kanto region, which have geography, population and educational environments similar to B prefecture. B prefecture is located in the periphery of a metropolitan area and is in a region with a population over the three million mark of major cities. Prefectures A and C have similar regional characteristics. They also have similar trends in educational environments based on national academic ability survey results"}, {"section_title": "5", "text": ". The survey subjects were public primary and middle/junior high school teachers in these three prefectures.\nAfter performing random sampling for primary and middle/junior high school teachers in each prefecture, a school survey sheet (1) and teacher questionnaires (multiple) 6 were distributed via postal mail. Each school that conduct-professional development in 2011-12\nForo de Educaci\u00f3n, v. 14, n. 20, enero-junio 2016, pp. 453-466.\ne-ISSN: 1698-7802 ed the survey was requested to return the survey sheet and the recovered questionnaires all together. Survey results are shown in Table 1 . This paper targeted full-time employees and excluded management and part-time lecturers from the recovered questionnaires. In addition, taking into consideration the life cycle and history of the teachers, those age 50 or older were labelled \u00abveteran teachers\u00bb, those in their 30's and 40's were labelled \u00abmid-level teachers\u00bb, and those in their 20's were labelled \u00abyoung teachers\u00bb. The sample overview is shown in Table 2 .\nThe more senior teachers entered the teaching profession during the early 1970's to the early 1980's, when a period of high economic growth ended and Japan entered a period of low economic growth. During this period, a large number of teachers who had been hired after the war were retiring, and children of the World War II baby boom, who had gone through school, were being employed in large numbers. As this generation entered the workforce, social problems such as school dropouts, school violence, and bullying began to take shape, and society's trust in schools was declining. From the beginning of their tenure to the mid-level of their careers, the nature of school education came under question.\nLater, in their veteran years, not only were these teachers devoted to their educational practices, but they also wanted to be actively involved in school management. This was also a period during which instilling in children a zest for living and strengthening basic academic skills were being strongly demanded through educational reforms. In addition, teacher-related reforms were put forth, such as the teacher evaluation system and the teacher's license renewal system, and these teachers, in the final stages of their teaching lives, were required to respond to changing circumstances.\nMid-level teachers were hired from the mid-1980's to the early 2000's, when education problems became social problems and there was distrust towards schools. It was also a time when the number of teachers being hired was decreasing, and it was becoming difficult to get a teaching job. Currently, these teachers are in mid-level positions within schools and are mainly performing acts that are required by educational reforms.\nYoung teachers entered the teaching profession from the mid-2000's onward. During this time, the number of teachers being hired, especially in metropolitan areas, was rising, and educational reform was settling down. Their experience has been of various educational policies surrounding schools and teachers.\nquestionnaires was calculated. "}, {"section_title": "Analysis Results", "text": "To start, I confirmed human relations and individual experiences that are significant in improving the quality of modern educational practices for teachers (Table 3) . First, the items \u00abinteractions with children\u00bb, \u00abworkplace atmosphere and human relations\u00bb and \u00abpersonal motivation and effort\u00bb were considered significant by both primary and middle/junior high school teachers, receiving 2.5 points or more. This suggests that for teachers carrying out daily educational practices, the people closest to them and their immediate circumstances are important.\nThe next items considered significant were \u00abhaving a partner to confide troubles in and seek guidance from\u00bb, \u00abobserving colleagues' classrooms and vice versaz and \u00abpersonal advice from senior teachers and teacher colleagues\u00bb. Thus, we understand that opportunities to receive detailed suggestions and people's presence are important for issues related to one's own educational practices.\nAlthough some regional differences were found in a regional comparison of the aforementioned significant human relations and opportunities, for teachers within a region, significance was ranked at the same level as teachers from other regions. Almost no regional differences were found for other items. Thus, we can infer that recognition of the significance of human relations and individual experiences to modern teachers is homogenized and that teachers have similar experiences of educational practices and related everyday experiences.\nWhat about institutions and organizations? (Table 4) . Generally, items related to institutions and organizations received lower points than items on human relations and individual experiences and did not seem to be as significant in raising current educational practices.\nCloser examination reveals that practices such as \u00abtrainings sponsored by the board of education\u00bb and \u00abteacher evaluations\u00bb and participation in organizations such as \u00abprivate education and research organizations and voluntary clubs\u00bb and \u00abunion activities\u00bb were significant to teachers and remained within about 1.7-2.0 points. They seem to feel that voluntary commitment to national institutions and organizations is strongly beneficial.\nOn the other hand, involvement at the school with which one is affiliated, such as \u00abtrainings at affiliated school\u00bb, \u00abgrade-level meetings and subject meetings at affiliated school\u00bb, and \u00abresearch activities and the research framework of the entire school\u00bb, as well as participation in related research groups at other schools, such as \u00abparticipation in other schools' research workshops\u00bb and \u00abother districts' research groups by grade level, subject and area\u00bb had about 1.5-1.9 points. It seems that to teachers, external institutions and organizations are more professional development in 2011-12\nForo de Educaci\u00f3n, v. 14, n. 20, enero-junio 2016, pp. 453-466.\ne-ISSN: 1698-7802 significant than their own immediate institution and organizations.\nResults of the comparison among regions showed that for both primary and middle/junior high school teachers, there were not really any places with significant differences. In other words, for both primary and middle/junior high school teachers, awareness of institutions and organizations related to improving the quality of educational practices is homogenous. Thus, we can deduce that that there is a certain level of formal and informal research taking place in each region.\nThus far, analysis indicates that teachers find relationships with colleagues to be extremely significant in improving educational practices. Therefore, we now focus on this point and confirm how teachers are commonly interacting with their colleagues (Table 5) .\nThe item that received high points among both primary and middle/junior high school teachers of all generations was \u00abtalking with colleagues about children and education\u00bb (about 1.9-2.3 points). It appears that teachers often have conversations with colleagues regarding children and education.\n\u00abBeing actively involved with grade-level and school management\u00bb also received high points (about 1.8-2.1). Regardless of generation, teachers are firmly committed to school management and being an active member of the organization. Taking into consideration that the response \u00abpracticing as you think you should, without worrying about other colleagues or classes\u00bb is also over 1 point, this further suggests that primary and middle/junior high school teachers are strongly committed to school management.\nOne item suggesting a difference between primary and middle/junior high school teachers in how they communicate is the response to \u00abexchanging advice among colleagues about practices\u00bb. Among primary school teachers, this received about 1.8-1.9 points, indicating that it happens often, while among middle/ junior high school teachers, this received about 1.5-1.8 points, indicating that exchanges of advice on practices are not as extensive among middle/junior high school teachers. Another item that speaks to this relationship between colleagues is the response \u00abconsulting with colleagues for guidance on practices\u00bb. Since primary schools have the homeroom system, challenges regarding practices are likely to be shared among many teachers; however, in middle/junior high schools, there is the subject-teacher system, and the number of teachers who share similar challenges is thus smaller. These items show a difference between primary and middle/junior high school teachers in communication density.\nFor the response \u00abconsulting with colleagues for guidance on practices\u00bb, it appears that as generations increase in age, communication decreases. As teachers gain experience, competence increases, and they can resolve problems regarding practices without consulting colleagues. We can presume that this is why the density of guidance among veteran teachers is lower.\nNext, when checking for regional differences by generation, regional disparities were not found among responses, including the aforementioned. In other words, we can conclude that the way teachers interact among colleagues is homogenized."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The results above indicate that interactions among Japanese primary and middle/junior high school teacher colleagues are homogenous and that the quality of experience related to professional development as a teacher is constant. In other words, the professional development environment is standardized, and the hypothesis put forth in this paper has been proved. The teachers of each generation in each region maintain a similar awareness and have homogenous behaviour, regardless of the region in which their school is located and of differences in the jurisdiction of boards of education. Although each generation of teachers has its own characteristics due to the eras through which they lived, the education they received, and different number of years of experience, the similarities of each generation extending beyond regions were also confirmed. Thus we can posit that there is a certain level of teacher competence regardless of region. The standardization of the environment of professional development of teachers and teacher competence can be cited as characteristics of the Japanese teaching profession. If this is the case, Japanese children are guaranteed a uniform level of education and academic achievement regardless of the region in which they live. This is presumably one reason why Japan achieves high scores on international academic ability surveys.\nOur findings show that teachers feel \u00abtrainings sponsored by the board of education\u00bb are significant for the standardization of the professional development environment of teachers and teacher competency. To this end, each region's board of education creates government-regulated training programs based on notices from the Ministry of Education, Culture Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). In addition, as we saw from the findings on interactions among colleagues, teachers are actively committed to school management on a daily basis, and this may be related to the fact that through close interactions with colleagues, they feel they are reaching a certain level of consensus as a member of the organization.\nHowever, this analysis cannot reject the existence of differences between individual teachers in each region. Research on Japanese teachers has indicated that there is a culture of cooperative pacing (Nagai, 1977; Kawamura, 2014) . In other words, Japanese teachers are interested in how other teachers run their classrooms and educational activities and then institute similar practices to keep pace with those other teachers. We can surmise that because of this, the quality of teachers in a region has also been standardized to a certain extent.\nAs mentioned above, the creation of a structure to support the quality of Japanese teachers can be cited as a proven effectiveness of national policies. However, it is essential to note that if teachers blindly follow government-determined standards and goals, they will be in danger of no longer thinking autonomously about what is essential for the education of the children with whom they come into contact every day and of how the future Japanese society should be.\nFuture topics include a further investigation on the characteristics of Japanese teachers indicated in this paper. First, it is necessary to study whether the environment of teacher competence formation and the standardization of teacher competence share commonalities in both metropolitan and rural areas of Japan. International comparative research should also be performed to determine if standardization is common among teachers from countries with high academic abilities, and if this standardization is unique to Japanese teachers or if it is common within the teaching profession in other countries, too.
