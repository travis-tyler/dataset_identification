[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronavirdiae, and subfamily\nCoronavirinae (1) . The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus, named as 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) genus of the subfamily Coronavirinae. The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome with a size of around 29.9 kilobases (2) . The genomes of coronaviruses are among the longest RNA viruses (3) . The reverse transcription of the genome is needed after the viral entry into the host cell for further replication, which is performed by the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme of the viruses. Although coronavirus' RdRp have a proofreading function, single-stranded RNA genomes have a higher mutation rate than double-stranded DNA viruses (4) . Another cause of mutation of the viral genome is the driving force to evade the defences of the immune system of the host. These factors make mutant variants of various viral proteins, which help the virus in evading the defences. Consequently, the fitting variants prevail in any geographical region/population over time.\nThe change in nucleotide/amino acid sequences may have the consequences of changes in the viral infectivity, poor efficiency of molecular diagnosis and escape from antibody recognition.\nConsequently, the failure of the vaccine and the development of drug-resistant viral strains could arise. Furthermore, the mutational changes in viral receptor binding proteins would result in change in tropism that might bring expanded host range or zoonotic transfer.\nThe mutational changes in the viral genome may lead to sequence changes in untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as changes in amino acid sequences of structural and functional proteins of the viruses. Being the RNA virus, the SARS-CoV-2 is mutating; several rare and common mutations in UTR/ORFs in the genome have been already reported (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The D614G mutation in spike protein has got special attention among the SARS-CoV-2 virologist for becoming dominant around the world (11) and the mutation also correlated with a higher mortality rate in COVID-19 patients (12) . It is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 may have more mutations like D614G, which may affect the viral infectivity and clinical outcome of the infection drastically that needs to be explored more thoroughly.\nOur aim was to analyse the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences derived from patients of all continents and to investigate whether the virus mutate in similar pattern globally or has specific pattern in any given populations. In the present, study we analysed 15,120 full length SARS-CoV-2 genomes, derived from symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients from all six continents, submitted to NCBI Database (13). We further investigated an additional 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, derived from Australia, China, India, KSA, Egypt, Italy, Spain, USA, Mexico and Brazil and submitted to GISAID (14)."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences", "text": "In the present study, we analysed 15,120 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes (global set), derived from symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

Large number of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases have been reported from these countries.

Next, we used a sequencing tool, Minimap2 (16) , which is designed for long-read sequences with a larger number of samples to be aligned. Using Minimap2, once aligned with a reference sequence (accession number NC_045512) (17) , the duplicate sequences were removed more aggressively and that gave us 400 genome sequences with mutations (Workflow: Step A). Although the MiniMap2 is suited for longer sequences and large number of samples, it has the disadvantage of showing the most common mutations only and hence we had to utilize another approach to find less common mutations.\nTo analyse the 1000 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, derived from every abovementioned country, we have designed a software tool, Fragmentation Tool_Version-1.0, for fragmentation of nucleotide sequences, (Supplementary Tool. 1). This tool helped us to fragment the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences into 5000 base sections. We have used MultAlin online tool (18) for alignment of fragmented genome sequences with the reference viral strain sequence mentioned above. We have taken care of not to miss part of the genome sequences by having 100 bases long overlapping sequences in each fragment. We considered variation as true mutation if variations from reference sequence were identified in more than one instances.\nThe same practice was applied with the genome sequence samples of all six countries (Workflow:\nStep B).

We report novel mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome resulting in change in 5'-UTR or translational change, and subsequently altered proteins. The virus appears to be mutating across the globe and some of these mutations are arising independently across various populations and locations.\nWe detected mutations in every gene except ORF 7b, 10 and 3'-UTR. The possible reason for conserved regions in these three genes maybe the small size, or that these ORFs/UTR may not tolerate the changes which may be deleterious to the virus.\nMany of the mutations we found are common in samples derived from more than one country or continent, shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 . We found three mutations in 5\u00b4-UTR one of which is very common (C241T) and previously reported (8) to European derived samples (10), however, our findings indicate that these mutations are spreading in all six continents in quite significant numbers of samples over time (Table 2 and   Supplementary table 1) .\nAlthough, some of the mutations are common in all samples, the frequency of majority of the mutations in all 10 countries vary. While many other mutations have different locations in the genome that indicate the virus is using a different strategy to adapt in different populations.\nThe A23403G mutation is translating into D614G in ORF-S, which has been observed globally (11) and correlated with mortality rate in COVID-19 patients (12) . The frequency of the D614G mutation in ORF-S, was found to be more than 80% in 7 out of 10 countries, except\nChina, USA, and Spain, where it is 3%, 40% and 60%, respectively. The close resemblance in the occurrence pattern of the mutations C241T and A23403G, two mutations at the opposite ends of the genome, in all countries is important to note, with no published record correlating the mortality rate with C241T mutation or A23403G mutation.\nOut of the 313 mutations observed, the majority (169) are non-synonymous mutations.\nThese non-synonymous mutations were found in all ORFs (except ORF 7b, 10 and 3'-UTR) and thus highly likely to affect the infection and pathogenesis of the virus profoundly (11, 12, 19) .\nThe insertion mutation identified in NSP6 protein, which has 7 putative trans-membrane helices (20) , binds to TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and suppresses the phosphorylation of "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We identified a total of 313 synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome across the globe. Several of these mutations were common in majority of the genome samples irrespective of geographical locations, while many other mutations were specific to a specific population. In the present study, we confirmed a link between reduced Interferon and SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and report previously unknown mutations. Two of the reported mutations appear highly linked to the location of the virus and implicate region specific mutations as a response to host environment. With the use of statistical models, such as those described by Cilia et al (27) , and machine learning techniques where input from known mutations is essential, it will become possible to predict hotspots for future mutations and thus prediction of efficacy of any potential vaccines. With the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of any potential vaccines being rendered ineffective against the new strains, it is imperative that the structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein and genome are studied in depth in order, to enable identification of areas of the genome with a higher susceptibility to mutations.
