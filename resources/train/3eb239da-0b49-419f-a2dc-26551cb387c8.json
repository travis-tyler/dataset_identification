[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study is informed by research on debt accumulation and financial well-being but focuses instead on rapid loan repayment. This term describes a subgroup of borrowers, identified in two nationally-representative samples, who repaid their cumulative undergraduate loan debt in half the time of the expected repayment cycle (10 years). The purpose of this study is threefold: It delineates the analytic framework employed to identify rapid loan repayers, examines whether rapid loan repayment is associated with financial benefits in terms of salary, home-ownership, and non-poverty-level, and explores how these rapid loan repayers differ from their non-rapid loan repayer and non-borrower counterparts. Results point to salary benefits associated with rapid loan repayment and indicate that among rapid loan repayers, cumulative loan debt did not surpass $15,000. As such, policy-makers may consider the adoption of shorter repayment plans with clear eligibility cut-off amounts as an alternative to the more common 10-year fixed plan."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "use of two comparison groups is strategic as it allows one to fully test for potential benefits associated with rapid full-loan repayment that have not been examined in the loan-debt literature.\nThe term rapid full-loan repayment is adopted in this study as the group of participants who repaid their debt in full did so within a median time period of 4.5 years, half the repayment cycle reported by Looney and Yannelis (2015) . These authors indicate that the median time observed by borrowers at the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s was 10 years (see Looney & Yannelis, 2015, p. 35) . Notably, the rapid-loan-repayment behavior analyzed herein took place naturally, that is, there was no program or policy change that served as an incentive for participants to repay faster than the national norm. For example, the most popular repayment plan (standard 10-year repayment plan with fixed payments) has consistently enrolled over 50% of the 21 million borrowers since 2013, therefore leading to repayment times similar to those reported by Looney and Yannelis (2015) . In this view, the observational nature of the participants included in this study indicates that researchers must account for self-selection into rapid-loan repayment behaviors before making inferential-claims about the effect of rapid-loan-repayment. Considering these two points just described, the present study is unique in that it identified a subset of the student-borrower population that paid debt off in half of the time compared to the national average. In this view, knowledge about who these participants are and whether their decision to repay debt quickly translated into short-term financial gains merits analysis from policy-and decision-making perspectives.\nThe study of rapid loan repayment is timely and relevant, considering that never before has the number of students facing debt been greater (Baum, 2015) and that these students, sooner or later, will also have to make important decisions about how, and when, is best to repay this debt in full. In this respect, by addressing the question of whether a student should try to repay debt as soon as possible rather than finance his/her loan over a longer period of time, the results of this study have important and direct implications in the lives of indebted students. From a policy-and decision-making perspective, this emphasis on repayment is also relevant. The assumed issue with the student loan situation in the U.S. is based on the negative effects of outstanding debt that could lead to delinquency and default, regardless of actual loan amount (Cunningham & Kienzl, 2011; Dynarski & Kreisman, 2013) . Accordingly, it may be expected that students who completely repay their student loan debt fare better in terms of socioeconomic and financial outcomes as they are free from \"payment burdens that can prevent [them] from attaining financial independence and stability. . . leading to financial distress and damaged credit records and rapidly rising balances\" (Dynarski & Kreisman, 2013, p. 6) . In a similar vein, but moving beyond the individual level, students who repay their loans also contribute to the decrease in a level of debt that could place the new U.S. workforce generation's economy at risk. Consequently, the potential benefits associated with loan repayment make its study a policy-appealing endeavor, especially given recent claims regarding a U.S. student loan \"repayment crisis\" (Dynarski & Kreisman, 2013, p. 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this study is threefold. The first purpose is to propose an analytic framework that, by highlighting the complexity involved in modeling the effects of loan repayment, offers clarity in the methodological steps used to account for systematic differences among students who fully repay their loan debt rapidly and those who do not. The second purpose is to comprehensively evaluate any potential benefits of loan repayment by comparing the outcomes of students who fully repaid loan debt rapidly with the outcomes of students who did not rely on loan debt and those of students who relied on student loans and did not repay them within 10 years after college enrollment. Considering the scarcity of empirical evidence about the characteristics associated with rapid student loan debt repayment, the third purpose of this study is to compare the baseline characteristics of study participants conditional on repayment status. This comparison will allow for a better understanding of the best predictors of rapid loan repayment. Special emphasis will be placed on examining differences in amounts borrowed by students who repaid and did not repay this debt rapidly, and differences in predictor variables across all comparison groups, including individual-, institutional-, and state-level characteristics that may affect repaying status, typically employed in college outcomes and institutional effects literature (see Doyle, 2009; Leigh & Gill, 2003; Long & Kurlaender, 2009; Melguizo & Dowd, 2009; Reynolds & DesJardins, 2009; Stephan, Rosenbaum, & Person, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Background, Previous Studies, and Conceptual Framework", "text": "An important line of loan-debt inquiry has focused on its effects on financial hardship. In this line of inquiry, researchers have used likelihood of owning a home or having a mortgage, salary, and sector of employment as outcomes of consideration (Akers, 2014; American Student Assistance, 2013; Cho et al., 2015; Elliott et al., 2013a Elliott et al., , 2013b Elliott et al., , 2013c Field, 2006; Houle & Berger, 2014; Rothstein & Rouse, 2007) . In a recent study, Akers (2014) found that there is not a strong positive relationship between student debt and financial hardship. One of the main conclusions reached by Akers (2014) is that the highest rates of financial hardship are found among households with relatively little outstanding student loan debt. Although the author did not control for baseline differences, this study has important implications. Akers argues that discouraging borrowing by implementing restrictive limits on federal borrowing may have negative implications across those students who need this form of aid to finance college.\nSomewhat similar to Akers (2014) , Rothstein and Rouse (2007) found that compared to students who received grants and did not borrow to meet financial need at a highly selective private college, borrowers were actually located in higher-salary jobs. In contrast to this conclusion, Elliott et al., in a series of interrelated papers (2013a; 2013b; 2013c) , found that households with a member who finished a four-year degree while incurring student loan debt are significantly less likely to have retirement savings, own a home, and accumulate assets when compared to households with a member who graduated from college without having to incur student loan debt. These apparently contradictory findings may be due to the differences in samples used by Rothstein and Rouse (2007) and Elliott et al. (2013a; 2013b; 2013c) . Rothstein and Rouse (2007) estimated their models using data that is perhaps not truly representative of the typical student population that faces debt -students enrolled in a prestigious and highly selective college. Elliott et al. relied on the 2007 Elliott et al. relied on the -2009 Survey of Consumer Finances longitudinal data, which seeks representativeness by selecting the approximate 6,500 participating families randomly. An interesting point is that both Elliott et al. and Akers (2014) relied on the same source of data, yet their results do not perfectly align with one another. Specifically, Elliott et al. found negative effects of debt, a sign of potential financial distress, which is the same outcome variable used by Akers. Surprisingly, Akers found little evidence of a relationship between debt and financial distress (or hardship). One possible reason for this apparent contradiction is that Elliott et al. compared borrowers versus non-borrowers, whereas Akers compared different debt amounts among borrowers only and estimated the effect of those amounts on financial hardship.\nThe relevance of studying issues related to this fourth line of research is delineated by Dynarski and Kreisman (2013) who stated that \"payment burdens can prevent young workers from attaining financial independence and stability [. . . ] , leading to financial distress and damaged credit records and rapidly rising balances, all of which increase the costs of borrowing for a home, a car, and may also lead to lost employment opportunities\" (2013, p. 6) . In this sense, it follows that repayment should positively impact the financial well-being of those students who make the effort to repay their student loans. Nonetheless, the current state of the literature indicates that this conclusion remains an empirical question yet to be addressed. Accordingly, offering an estimation of the benefit associated with repayment is a worthwhile endeavor, especially for those students and households who can choose between repaying as quickly as possible or relying on lengthier financial approaches to deal with student loan debt. Moreover, simply knowing which characteristics are associated with repayment is important given the scarcity of knowledge about these students. If Dynarski and Kreisman (2013) are correct in saying we do not have a debt crisis but rather a repayment crisis, then shifting the focus to repayment issues is an appealing approach given the policy-and decision-making implications resulting from this line of research."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "As stated in the introductory section, this study analyses whether rapid full-loan repayment is associated with financial benefits. Considering that the median time to full-repayment observed in the analytic samples is about half of the time reported by Looney and Yannelis (2015, p. 35) , these unique groups of rapid re-payers may be systematically different from their non-borrowers and non-full-repayers counterparts. This situation requires the use of conceptual lenses that model a multidimensional set of observed and unobserved factors that may influence participants' 'rational' decisions. Given that these decisions are affected by each participant's set of economic and social sources of support and ways of seeing and experiencing the world, this study relies on social stratification theory (Bourdieu, 1986) and merges it with human capital principles (G. Becker, 1962; Mincer, 1958) as follows. Under social stratification theory (see Marx, 1887 Marx, , 2000 , it is clear that access to monetary, social, and cultural resources matter in that groups of people, institutions, and organizations that are able to place themselves closer to these resources will increase their overall probabilities of success in maintaining their privilege and expanding their resources. Indeed, economists have agreed that the rates of return to investment in human capital, such as education and training, may be unequal and even skewed to favor some groups over others, often based on characteristics like gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (G. Becker, 1962; Mincer, 1958) . It is clear, then, that the merger of these conceptual frameworks acknowledges that not everybody can afford to invest in human capital as this investment requires economic, social, and cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1986) .\nIndeed, human capital and social stratification theory inform this study by recognizing that students may have access to different forms of capital and have other unobserved reasons for incurring, repaying, or not relying on debt to finance college. Ignoring these differences would likely lead to biased conclusions. Accordingly, the analytic techniques employed herein account for these observed and unobserved factors that in addition to driving rapid-loan repayment decisions may be driving the variation in the outcomes of interest as detailed in the analytic techniques section. At the heart of the conceptual and analytic frameworks of this study lies the identification of predictors of rapid-loan repayment. The strategy used to identify these theoretically and empirically relevant variables relied on the higher education literature dealing with non-random assignment issues, specifically college-choice and sector effects (Doyle, 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez Canch\u00e9, 2012 Hillman, 2014; Leigh & Gill, 2003; Long & Kurlaender, 2009; Melguizo & Dowd, 2009; Stephan et al., 2009) . The sets of predictors of rapid-loan repayment utilized in this study aim at capturing a multidimensional spectrum of indicators that ideally dismantle baseline differences between treated (students who rapidly-repaid) and comparison participants (students who did not rapidly repay in full and those who did not borrow). These variables are presented in Table 1 and their corresponding summary statistics are included in the on-line appendix in Tables 2 and 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methodological Conceptualization", "text": "This study relies on the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework (Lewis, 1973; Rubin, 2005) to account for students' empirical systematic differences across repayment status before making any inferential claims. More specifically, the potential outcomes framework indicates that if researchers could observe the same student i in two different scenarios (for example, fully repaying loan debt rapidly and not fully repaying loan debt rapidly) with some non-zero probability of occurrence, then they would simply need to observe the outcome difference from each scenario in order to evaluate which decision rendered better results (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008; Holland, 1986; Reynolds & DesJardins, 2009; Rubin, 2005) . This individual causal effect (ICE) estimation, however, is impossible to obtain, (Holland, 1986; Rubin, 2005) and researchers are constrained to comparing the outcomes of students who repaid rapidly with the outcomes of students did not. The issue with this approach is that, as described in the conceptual framework section, borrowing and repayment decisions do not happen on a level playing field. Specifically, differences in levels of access to financial resources across borrowing behaviors may be the actual driver of financial well-being indicators rather than rapid-loan repayment status itself. This issue justifies the implementation of analytic techniques (propensity score weighting and Heckman control function used herein) that deal with systematic individual differences."}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Model Specification and Analytic Framework", "text": "There are at least two reasons for the lack of studies on the benefits of loan repayment. One is the assumed lack of available official longitudinal data that captures all college-related debt amounts disbursed to and repaid by a nationally representative sample of college students (Bricker, Brown, Hannon, & Pence, August 7, 2015) . This need is met by data contained in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS: 1988 (NELS: -2000 and the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS: 2002 (ELS: :2012 nationally-representative studies. Both of these studies contain official loan data, gathered directly from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) using participants' social security numbers, that measured all disbursements and repayments for each loan a student was granted over a ten-year period (August of 1990 to June of 2000 and July 2002 to May 2013, for NELS and ELS, respectively). Thus, these datasets offer an ideal scenario for conducting longitudinal analyses that allow enough time to measure loan disbursement, repayment, and potential benefits associated with such repayments while covering over two decades of evidence on this issue.\nThe second reason for the scarcity of studies on the benefits of loan repayment is based on the complexity of modeling this phenomenon. For example, as mentioned above, students who repaid loan debt rapidly may be systematically different from students who did not repay in full, but also from those who did not borrow. Accordingly, analytic strategies must account for, and model, the differences that any observed or unobserved baseline characteristics signal before fitting the final outcome models or making inferential claims. In addition to accounting for baseline differences, the modeling framework employed ensured that outcomes were temporarily exogenous (Wooldridge, 2010) Figure 2 ) before outcomes are measured. During this second period, students must face an adjustment period during which loan amounts are due for repayment and a group of students will begin and perhaps complete repayment of their student loans. Following the restriction applied for college enrollment, the observed post-college transition period in both the NELS and ELS samples lasted 4.5 years, on average, before the measuring of financial outcomes took place. This last period is referred to as \"the outcomes period\" and took place during the last wave of data gathering in NELS and ELS samples. During this period, the outcomes of interest are measured and compared employing models that assess the effects of repayment on students' outcomes as comprehensively as possible. The outcomes of students who rapidly repaid their student loan debt will be compared against the outcomes of (a) students who borrowed but did not repay rapidly, and (b) students who did not borrow at all. This second set of methodological steps is operationalized in Figure 3 . ELS participants who attended college at some point and for at least one academic year were included in the analytic samples (this was done in order to establish a minimum common ground in time of enrollment across participants). Figure 3 shows that not all of the students who satisfied the selection criteria necessarily requested loans. Furthermore, from the group of students who requested loans, only a subset of them decided or were able to repay rapidly in full the amount disbursed. This renders three mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups: (a) students who did not rely on loans to finance their education [group 1 (G1) in Figure 3 ], (b) students who relied on student loans and had repaid this debt [group 2 (G2) in Figure 3 ], and (c) students who relied on loans and had not fully repaid these amounts [group 3 (G3) in Figure 3 ]. For comparison purposes, these three groups can be classified into two different subgroups of students: debt-free and borrowers. The debt-free group is comprised of students in groups G1 and G2. The borrowers group contains students who belong to groups G2 and G3. Note that G2 belongs to both comparison groups, thus creating an ideal test-case scenario for whether or not loan repayment has any positive, differentiable effects when comparing the outcomes of repayment with those of two comparison groups (G1 and G3) that represent two ends of the spectrum of loan-debt disbursement. This strategy provides policy-and decision-makers with the strongest evidence of any potential benefit associated with rapid loan repayment in terms of non-experimental data.\nThe second half of Figure 3 further stresses the complexity of measuring potential benefits associated with loan repayment. Following the counterfactual framework principles, before comparing the outcomes associated with each of the two proposed comparison groups (G1 Vs G2 and G2 Vs G3), it is necessary to identify counter-factual participants whose only observable difference is treatment status. Taking G2 versus G3 as an example, before comparing the outcomes of students who borrowed and rapidly repaid (G2) and students who borrowed but did not rapidly repay in full (G3) we have to ensure we are comparing students who are as similar as possible in terms of other characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and level of education attainment (S. Becker & Ichino, 2002; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) and that the models are accounting for unobservables that may be influencing the variation of the outcomes of interest (Heckman, 1979; Heckman, LaLonde, & Smith, 1999) . These procedures are important given that students who repaid their loans may have done so due to their wealthier backgrounds, for instance, while the opposite may be true for students who failed to repay their debt. If this is true, any disparity in the outcomes will more likely be due to their difference in backgrounds and unobservables rather than on repayment of loan debt. This rationale also applies to G1 versus G2 comparisons.\nFinally, in addition to the procedures summarized in Figures 2 and 3 , a set of models will be estimated for participants with four-year degrees and a different set will be estimated for participants without four-year degrees. This disaggregation is important for at least two reasons.\nFirst, student loan debt amounts will most likely vary conditional on the attainment of a four-year degree. That is, students who persisted until eventual graduation will have longer enrollment times than, for example, students who dropped out of college during their second year.\nConsequently, it can be said that the longer the enrollment time, the greater the resources needed to sustain this investment, and the potential greater reliance on student loans as a form of aid to finance college attendance. Second, four-year degree attainment may also affect students' repayment behaviors and outcomes of interest. A given student who did not repay and did attain a four-year degree may have different financial outcomes than a student who did not repay but was able to finish a four-year degree. Failing to account for these differences would also represent a source of bias as the financial outcomes would be confounded by college degree attainment rather than by repayment status."}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "The restricted versions of NELS and ELS employed in this study contain data provided by the U.S. Department of Education's NSLDS. This system includes student financial aid records for the last follow-up waves of NELS and ELS. In the case of NELS the fourth wave accounts for students who enrolled in post-secondary education at any time between 1991 to the first half of the year 2000. The last wave of ELS accounts for participants who enrolled in post-secondary education at any time between 2001 to 2012. Both datasets offer access to official data on student loan debt that followed the records of two national cohorts of high school graduates over time and across institutions. The purpose of using two nationally representative samples in the current study is threefold. First, neither of the samples have been examined using the analytic framework proposed. Second, in addition to assessing whether there have been changes in repayment benefits across decades, the comparison of the results will provide a robustness check for the models implemented. Finally, rarely do researchers have the opportunity to test their models using two completely different samples, and this study takes advantage of the investment made by National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to collect this wealth of information.\nThe loan debt variables analyzed in this study were restricted to undergraduate loan disbursements that took place up to December of 1998 and 2010 for the NELS and ELS samples, respectively. This restriction was feasible given that both NELS and ELS studies have a variable called \"F4ELMY\" and \"F3A12\" that registered the \"Year/month [a participant] last attended postsecondary school\" in NELS and ELS, respectively. In addition, the official loan data contained in both surveys have a variable \"BEGDATE\" that captured the \"[l]oan period begin date.\" Given the college enrollment period restriction, there were: (a) no loan disbursement information after December of 1998 and 2010 available for eligible participants and (b) no participants enrolled in graduate education. Consequently, the computation of loan debt disbursed and number of loans received was naturally constrained to the undergraduate college enrollment period. All the information on amounts repaid and outstanding amounts registered after December 31 of 1998 and 2010 were included in the computations of loan repayment during the post-college transition period presented in Figure 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Outcome Variables", "text": "Consistent with the literature on the effects of loan debt on financial hardship described earlier, this study relies on three outcome variables to capture financial stability. Each of these outcomes was measured in the last wave of NELS and ELS with a mean time after college enrollment of 4.5 years across cohorts given the restriction explained in Figure 2 . The first outcome is annual income. To make the analyses and amounts comparable across decades, dollar amounts were adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015) and are represented in 2015 dollars. The second outcome measures whether participants owed a house or had a mortgage by the last wave of data collection. As in previous studies, information about homeownership was provided by the National Association of Realtors, which additionally indicated that the average age of first-home purchase is the same as the average age of participants in the two surveys employed in this study, approximately thirty years old. The third outcome measures likelihood of living below the poverty threshold or whether a given respondent has had to rely on public assistance as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Techniques", "text": "The analytic techniques employed in this study were designed to minimize the risk that the variation in outcomes of interest is driven by students' greater initial observable sources of support (by relying on PSW, Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) and/or self-selection issues based on unobservables (by relying on Heckman control function, Heckman, 1979) , rather than by repayment status. These steps were taken in order to create truly comparable groups so that researchers are in a better position to inform families, policy-and decision-makers about the most likely outcome resulting from each repayment status.\nPropensity Score Modeling (PSM) and the Use of Observables. PSM assumes that treatment assignment and selection are fundamentally based on observables (Reynolds & DesJardins, 2009; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) . These observables are conceptualized as the factors and covariates that are influential in determining participants' probabilities of receiving treatment (i.e., having repaid debt in full rapidly). The standard procedures to obtain this probability are probit or logit estimators, which render close to identical estimates of the probability of receiving treatment. Considering that the Heckman procedure relies on the probit approach, the following lines depict this procedure in the PSM framework. "}, {"section_title": "(x). Note that b(x) is a theoretical", "text": "construct that is only approximated by e(x) if the researcher has access to truly influential covariates that explain treatment assignment and allow for the identification of counter-factual cases (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) . When all observable predictors x s i are balanced across treated (rapid in-full repayers ) and control units (non-borrowers and non-in-full repayers), this approach is assumed to have statistically recreated natural treatment and control groups whose counter-factual outcomes can be compared.\nGiven that b(x) can take an infinite value, one method to create balance units across treatment and control statuses is to rely on matching mechanisms (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) where, conditional on b(x) values, the covariates x i become balanced (see S. Becker & Ichino, 2002 , for a survey of the most frequently used balancing mechanisms). Another use of b (x) consists of using it as a weight to create a balanced sample. The main advantage of this weighting method is that weights can be used in a similar form to survey sampling weights, thus allowing researchers to use them in different statistical approaches, including doubly robust procedures, to adjust for covariates that were not balanced or that were captured after the treatment assignment took place (Ridgeway, McCaffrey, Morral, Burgette, & Griffin, 2013) . For example, if treatment is defined as two-versus four-year enrollment and the outcome is probability of four-year degree attainment, one can balance on pre-college indicators to estimate the propensity to two-year enrollment, and then use college-enrollment indicators (institutional size, financial aid, major, etc)\nin the outcome equation to account for indicators that may have further affected a given student's likelihood of four-year graduation above and beyond her or his propensity to two-year enrollment.\nThe treatment effect of interest is the ATT, or average treatment effect for the treated, which captures the effect of debt repayment and is mathematically expressed as\nwhere Y (1) is the outcome realized by repayers, Y (0) is the salary received by non-repayers and non-borrowers, and Z=1 is repayment status. The propensity score weights (PSWs) for the ATT are defined as follows:\n, where b(x) is the propensity (or assumed balancing) score described above and K is a normalization constant, used to reduce any probability function to a probability density function with total probability of one, that will cancel out in the outcomes analysis (Ridgeway et al., 2013, p. 27) . The most important performance tests for PSW (model specification, covariate balance, and common support) are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 4 (located in the on-line appendix), all of which are described in the findings section.\nHeckman Two-Stage Selection on Unobservables. Propensity score weighting (PSW) assumes that there are not unobservables in the models affecting the probability of receiving treatment and/or outcome variation. One way to test this assumption is to utilize the Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis (Keele, 2010) , which assesses whether the treatment effect changes as a function of an increase in the probability of receiving treatment. Another way to test this assumption is to \"rely on information about the functional form of the selection and outcome processes, such as the distribution of the disturbance terms\" (Toomet & Henningsen, 2008, p. 2) .\nConveniently, the first stage of this procedure is also shown in equation (1). This estimation procedure utilizes the residuals of that equation to estimate the inverse Mills ratio, which is represented with \u03bb i . Heckman describes \u03bb i as \"a monotone decreasing function of the probability that an observation is selected into the sample\" (1979, p. 156 ). Mathematically, Heckman shows\n, where \u03c6 and \u03a6 are the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function, respectively, for a standard normal variable. Notably, e(x) is the propensity score obtained from the implementation of equation (1). From a practical standpoint, if analysts have enough information to capture probabilities of receiving treatment, then they can estimate \u03bb i using the following procedure: (a) use probit analysis for the full sample to estimate the parameters of the probability of repayment in full, (b) estimate \u03bb i using these probabilities (see Heckman, 1979) , and (c) use the estimated value of \u03bb i as a regressor in the final model of the outcome of interest.\nThe outcome equation is represented as follows:\nwhere \u03b7 i is a new disturbance term. In sum, the outcome equations will be similar in the PSW and\nHeckman specifications except that in the former w(x) are used to balance on x s i , whereas in the latter, \u03bb i is included as an additional predictor.\nMissing Data. Tables 2 and 3 show the variables used in the estimation of the propensity scores. A total of 18 of the variables taken from NELS presented problems with missing data which resulted in the loss of several hundred cases. In the case of ELS this problem was present in 13 of the variables utilized. Due to the theoretical relevance of the covariates chosen, rather than dropping missing cases, methods of multiple imputation using chained equations (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) were employed. 1 The PSM and Heckman models were fitted both with and without the imputed datasets. 2 Due to space limitations, this study is focused on the results using the imputed datasets of NELS and ELS. The analyses without imputations rendered similar inferences and are available upon request."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "The samples across cohorts were comparable in size. The number of eligible participants was 3,960 for NELS and 4,370 for ELS. 3 The application of the selection criteria to obtain the analytic samples of interest indicated that the total number of NELS and ELS participants who relied on student loans during undergraduate education was 1,870 and 2,580 (47.2% and 59%), respectively. Among these students, 19% of NELS and 21% ELS participants rapidly repaid debt in-full (treated status). The total number of participants who are part of the debt-free categories (G1 and G2 in Figure 3 ) was 2,450 and 2,340 in the NELS and ELS samples, 14.7% and 23.5% of whom rapidly repaid debt in the NELS and ELS samples, respectively. Tables 2 and 3 in the on-line appendix serve a dual function. They contain the summary statistics of the covariates and factors utilized to account for baseline differences between the two comparison groups across samples (G1 Vs G2 and G2 Vs G3 shown in Figure 3 ). These tables also test whether the proposed set of covariates were useful in predicting the propensity to receiving treatment (rapid loan repayment) and whether the weighting procedures reduced these baseline differences when creating counter-factual scenarios across analytic samples. Each table consists of eight columns.\nThe column \"repaid\" corresponds to G2 in Figure 3 and contains the raw distribution of the variables for the treated group. Since the distribution of the indicators configuring the column \"repaid\" is the same across comparison groups, this column is presented only once in Tables 2 and 3 .\nThe raw distributions of the comparison groups are presented in columns \"NB uwt\" and \"NR uwt.\" Where NB indicates non-borrowers and NR indicates non-repayers, and uwt is the unweighted or raw distribution of the predictors of debt repayment. The tables show that raw baseline distributions present statistically significant differences within the comparison groups -represented by asterisks (.05*, .01**, .001***). These differences empirically validate the rationale followed in the conceptual and analytic frameworks that some form of adjustment needs to be made in order to compare these groups. Moreover, in accordance with the quasi-experimental designs employed, after weighting, the expectation is that these significant differences disappear. To test whether these differences dissipated, the matched or weighted covariates of the comparison groups (columns \"NB wt\" and \"NR wt\") were compared against the Table 4 present the debt situation among non-repayers disaggregated by four-year degree status.\n[Insert Table 4 about here]\nInfluential Predictors of Repayment. The findings discussed here are taken from Tables   2 and 3 in the on-line appendix. It is worth noting that the PSW results indicate that after using the PS weights, all comparison samples are balanced. This section, however, discusses differences across treatment statuses before balancing took place. The models across cohorts show that socioeconomic (SES) status in high school is an important indicator of borrowing behavior.\nStudents who did not borrow came from significantly more affluent backgrounds (as measured by their SES) than students who borrowed, both those who repaid rapidly and those who did not.\nNotably, the borrowers group comparisons show that students who borrowed and had not repaid came from similar SES backgrounds as students who borrowed and repaid, thus indicating that repaying is not a function of SES and that there are other factors in place that influence this decision, such as total amount borrowed (e.g., about $10,000 and $25,000 greater across four-year degree holders in the NELS and ELS samples, respectively). Another example of these differences indicates that borrower students (including those who did and did not repay) placed a greater importance on the availability of financial aid in their college-going decisions, whereas students who did not borrow were significantly less concerned about such availability.\nIn terms of sector of first attendance note that, overall, the most common sector of first post-secondary enrollment across samples and comparison groups was four-year public institutions (around 45%) located in the state where students graduated from high school (roughly 80% of this subset). Note that across samples, more than 90% of the students enrolled full-time during their first enrollment in college. The second and third most prevalent sectors were four-year private not-for-profit and community college institutions (around 25% in each sector across samples). Interestingly, in both NELS and ELS samples, students who did not borrow were more likely to have started in the community college sector (37% in the NELS and 36% in the ELS samples). With respect to sector of last attendance, the most popular choice was once again the public four-year sector with over 40% of enrollment.\nStudents who repaid had 4.05 and 5.14 years since last college enrollment, on average, in the NELS and ELS samples, respectively. These numbers were 4.33 and 3.96 years on average for non-borrowers and non-repayers in the NELS sample. The corresponding average number of years in the ELS sample was 5.02 and 4.99, respectively. Having established that all participants had been out of college for a similar number of years, another relevant indicator for repayment is degree or credential attainment. Note that, overall, students who repaid and students with outstanding debt were equally as likely to have attained a four-year degree or more in both NELS and ELS samples (about 60%). Students who did not request a loan were, in both samples, less likely to have attained a four-year degree, a finding that again justifies estimating separate models for bachelor's degree holders and non-bachelor's degree holders.\nThe institutional-level variables indicate that repayers and non-borrowers had similar estimated disbursements in tuition and fees and attended college 4 in states with similar levels of college access as measured by the proportion of college-age state residents enrolled in any form of college. Non-repayers consistently had the lowest amounts disbursed to cover tuition and fees across cohorts and groups and attended institutions located in states with less access to college."}, {"section_title": "Quasi-experimental Estimates", "text": "Tables 5 through 7 contain the quasi-experimental estimates for the outcome variables of interest. Although Tables 2 and 3 reflect systematic differences in the participants' baseline indicators, thus justifying the need to rely on quasi-experimental techniques, each set of models contains a \"na\u00efve regression\" specification that does not account for potential endogeneity for comparison purposes. Following the analytic framework presented in Figures 2 and 3 , the three financial outcomes tested correspond to the three broad categories contained in this section: (a) repayment effects on income variations (Table 5) , (b) repayment effects on probabilities of owning a home (Table 6) , and (c) repayment effects on probabilities of receiving public assistance ( Table 7 ). Note that each Table (5 through 7) contains four sets of models. The first two sets of models correspond to four-year degree holders. The first model compares repayers' and non-repayers' outcomes (G2 Vs G3 in Figure 3 ) while the second compares repayers' and non-borrowers' outcomes (G2 Vs G1 in Figure 3 ). The second two sets of models correspond to non-four-year degree holders, with the same comparisons, G2 Vs G3 and G2 Vs G1, respectively.\nAverage Treatment Effects of Repayment on Annual Income in 2015 dollars. In both NELS and ELS samples the direction of the treatment effect was positive and statistically significant. This indicates that among four-year degree holders, having rapidly repaid student loan debt is positively associated with higher salary by the age of 30 across cohorts and comparison groups. It is noteworthy that the observed magnitude of the effect of having repaid debt was larger in the comparison between repayers and non-borrowers. The Heckman models in both NELS and ELS samples comparing non-borrowers and repayers show that the coefficient associated with \u03bb was statistically significant and negative, signaling that unobserved factors that affect the probability of loan repayment status tend to be associated with decreases in annual salary. This finding indicates that the treatment coefficients of these Heckman models may be more precise compared to the PSW estimations due to the need to control for such unobserved factors. The \u03bb in the comparisons between non-repayers and repayers were non-significant and the treatment coefficients found in the Heckman and PSW models were practically the same.\n[Insert Table 5 about here]\nThe last two sets of models shown in Table 5 correspond to the samples in which participants did not attain a four-year degree. Although the coefficient associated with debt repayment was consistently positive, significant differences were only reached in one comparison:\nELS participants who did not attain a four-year degree but repaid earned about $6,100 more than non-borrowers, and the magnitude of this coefficient was consistent in both the PSW and Heckman estimations. It is important to note that non-borrowers came from higher SES backgrounds than repayers, which indicates that rapid repayment is indeed associated with positive variations in salary, as discussed in the final section.\nAverage Treatment Effects of Repayment on Probabilities of Owning a Home. The results presented in Table 6 consistently indicate that debt repayment is not associated with changes in the probability of owning a home. The quasi-experimental models reflect only one instance where results reached statistical significance. The PSW estimate shows that, among non-four-year degree holders, treated participants were 13 percentage points more likely to own a house than non-borrowers in the NELS sample. Nonetheless, considering that (a) the treatment effect utilizing the Heckman estimator had a insignificant magnitude of 8% in this same estimate and (b) \u03bb was statistically significant and negative (signaling that unobserved factors that affect the probability of loan repayment status tend to be associated with decreases in likelihood of home ownership), the PSW estimate may be biased upwardly and must be treated with caution.\n[Insert Table 6 about here]"}, {"section_title": "Average Treatment Effects of Repayment on Probabilities of Living Below the Poverty", "text": "Level. Results consistently indicated that repayment status was not associated with variation in likelihood of living below poverty level. Only the PSW estimations in the ELS sample comparing repayers and non-borrowers showed marginally significant differences indicating that repayment status was associated with a 5 percentage point decrease in the probabilities of being classified as poor. In this case, however, the result obtained from the Heckman procedure showed the same magnitude 5 and \u03bb was not significant, thus suggesting that the PSW coefficient estimate is not affected by unobservables and can be trusted.\n[Insert Table 7 about here]"}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Although this study employed two quasi-experimental techniques and relied on two different datasets for model specification, several limitations are present. The directionality of the association between loan repayment and salary increase assumes that it is repayment that drives the variation in salary across comparison groups. It may be possible that, as suggested by Rothstein and Rouse (2007) , students with debt burden were compelled to take high paying jobs -assuming they were able to do so-in order to repay debt. This scenario would suggest that higher salaries enable faster repayment rather than repayment itself leading to higher salaries.\nEven if this were the case, the benefits of loan repayment associated with salary variations would still hold as students motivated by the desire of repayment were driven to take jobs associated with higher salary which allowed them to repay their loans in half the expected time. Additionally, the models fitted restricted the samples to two years before the last wave of data gathering took place.\nAlthough a higher number of years between last enrollment and outcome measurement would be optimal, data limitations impeded this approach. Nonetheless, students in the samples analyzed had already completed college enrollment on average 4.5 years before outcomes were measured, therefore alleviating this potential time-censoring constraint to a great extent. Finally, the results of this study correspond to a subset of the population that has remained unstudied, students who repaid loan debt fast, about five years below the national trend of 10 years. This limitation does not allow one to make inferences about the entire population of national borrowers, but does enable analysis of benefits of rapid-loan repayment, a contribution in and of itself."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One of the purposes of this study aimed at identifying differences among students who rapidly repaid loan debt and their counterparts who did not request or did not repay loans accrued during undergraduate college enrollment. An important set of findings in both samples is that students who did not request loans came from higher socioeconomic backgrounds than students who borrowed. Interestingly, non-borrowers had lower expectations of attaining a four-year degree, tended to enroll in public two-year institutions more often than borrowers, and were less likely to hold a four-year degree. These differences justified the need to fit a set of models that included only four-year degree holders and a different set that included non-four-year degree holders.\nIn terms of financial benefits associated with loan repayment, the most straightforward positively associated outcome is annual salary, wherein participants who attained a four-year degree and repaid quickly realized about 8% more in annual earnings than their non-borrower and non-repayer counterparts. Participants who did not attain a four-year degree but repaid quickly realized about 15% more in annual earnings than their respective counterparts (yet these estimates did not reach statistical significance). Expanding the discussion beyond salaries, overall, the quasi-experimental models rendered consistent results, suggesting there is no evidence indicating that rapid in-full debt repayment is associated with greater likelihood of home ownership. The cross-decade comparison indicated that NELS participants had lower probabilities of living below the poverty level (3%) than ELS students (9.5%). This increase in the proportion of participants living below the poverty level over time helps explain the 5% decrease in likelihood of living below the poverty level for rapid repayers without four-year degrees in the ELS sample. This finding is relevant given that repaying seems to ameliorate the likelihood of being classified as living in poverty for a sub-group of participants, even in the absence of attainment of a four-year degree."}, {"section_title": "Implications and Closing Remarks", "text": "Considering these findings, and given the importance of starting salary in future salary increases, the question that emerges from this research is whether someone should be advised to repay loan debt as soon as possible after college or to use other strategies to finance loan debt. In this respect, considering that another set of important benefits associated with loan repayment include (a) avoiding the distress associated with facing outstanding debt (Akers, 2014; Cunningham & Kienzl, 2011; Dynarski & Kreisman, 2013) , (b) having a credit history in good standing, which may enable rapid repayers to qualify more easily for a mortgage or car loan, and (c) avoiding amounts of accrued interest, which in the long run leads to more asset accumulation, then when facing loan debt, the best strategy is to repay loan debt as soon as possible. This recommendation, however, only applies to borrowers with no graduate or professional degree enrollment (i.e., participants in this study) and whose average cumulative undergraduate loan debt is below $15,000, a consistent amount found among repayers in both analytic samples.\nParticipants with higher debt accumulation (e.g., above $24,000) may be better served by enrolling in standard 10-year repayment plans. That is, participants with loan amounts accrued surpassing the average amounts found across datasets, who try to repay this debt quickly, may be diverted from investment in other goods or services.\nThe lack of effects of loan repayment on home-ownership prospects may be due to the shorter average time after college enrollment of participants (4.5 years across cohorts). It is possible that although these participants' age (30 years) represents the median age of home ownership and that none of the participants were officially enrolled in college, the effects of repayment on owning a home may be reflected in later years. Indeed, it is possible that the financial effort required to repay debt did not allow these participants to invest in buying a house.\nOther datasets with longer follow-up periods may implement the analytic model proposed in this study to address whether allowing for more time to pass after loan repayment produces models that indicate that repayment does, in fact, significantly influence home-ownership prospects.\nAs stated at the beginning of this study, the most common repayment plan since 2013 is a 10-year repayment plan with fixed payments. As the analytic sample of this study showed, there exists a sub-group of borrowers who were able to repay in half the normal time. This finding in and of itself indicates that in terms of \"who repays?\" there is \"heterogeneity\" that merits future exploration. That is, while the \"heterogeneity among borrowers\" is well researched, the analysis of the distribution of \"who repays?\" represents a line for future research regardless of whether repaying affects other outcomes.\nIn closing, it is worth highlighting a recent report in which Dynarski (2016) shows that only about 18% of students who owe more than $100,000 default while 34% of those owing less than $5,000 do so. In considering the cases of students with no four-year degree and outstanding debt, policy-makers may contemplate the insulation of this at-risk group of students from paying interest up to a given cut-off point of $5,000 (following findings reported by Dynarski (2016) ) as part of their debt-repayment plan -a provision absent from currently available repayment plans.\nThis strategy would not only be a strong incentive toward loan repayment for these students, but would also prevent them from accruing interest amounts toward their current debt that eventually translate into longer time-to-repayment and increased risk of loan default. This increased risk of default is informed by the findings of this study. Specifically, Table 4 shows that although 50% of non-four-year degree holders attained a degree or credential, they still received the lowest salary amounts, on average, across all comparison groups. The extra provision proposed (waiving interest accrual) equates to providing these students with more opportunities for financial upward mobility. Finally, although more research on rapid loan repayment is required, a common estimate across decades indicated that rapid repayers accrued below $15,000 dollars, cumulative loan debt on average. This finding may serve to guide future policies or programs aimed to implement shorter repayment plans (e.g., 5-year period) with specific eligibility cut-off points up to $15,000. This program may also consider offering borrowers in this debt category lower fixed interest rates. Two common characteristics of these two strategies (waiving interest accumulation given low loan amounts accrued and shorter repayment plans) are (a) emphasis placed on well-delineated eligibility cut-off points absent from standard repayment plans currently available and (b) the goal of reducing debt burden for students who may be at greater risk of defaulting."}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "1 Data points were assumed to be missing at random.
