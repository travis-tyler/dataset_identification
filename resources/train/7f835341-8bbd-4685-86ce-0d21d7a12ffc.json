Scientists have stated with 95% certainty that human activity and greenhouse gases are extremely likely to be the cause of global warming (IPCC, 2014). The effects of global warming include sea level rise, increasing periods of drought, extreme weather conditions, and more extreme tropical storms and hurricanes. Experts warn that in the U.S., Florida and Texas are especially vulnerable to the effects of global warming (IPCC, 2014). Florida has experienced exponential growth over the last 40 years. The population increased by more than 195% from 1970 to 2010 (Florida Department of Health, 2012). It is well understood that the most significant disaster risk for the state is from hurricanes. The state is also vulnerable to sea-level rise, particularly in Miami-Dade County, which is considered one of the most vulnerable locations in the country (Revi et al., 2014, p. 555;Beatley, 2009). This study takes a closer look at how disaster recovery and housing policy affected affordable housing development in Florida after the 2004 hurricane season, specifically multifamily housing produced using Low Income Housing Tax Credits."}, {"section_title": "DISASTER IN THE COASTAL URBAN ENVIRONMENT", "text": "The threat of disaster poses special challenges for coastal communities, particularly in the multifamily housing sector. Programs and policies that effect outcomes for community redevelopment after disaster typically favor homeowners and economic development projects favored by community leaders and their constituents (Comerio, 1988;Fischer and Sard, 2006;Peacock, Dash and Zhang, 2007). A constituent could include business leaders, advocacy groups, or any other group that has access to power (Rehfeld, 2005). When thinking about local and regional projects promoted by those who control the purse strings within a community, the constituency generally includes participants within the business community that favor allocation of funds to a diverse range of redevelopment options (Comerio, 1988;Fothergill and Peek, 2004). One subset of redevelopment is affordable housing. This research focuses on redevelopment of affordable housing during disaster recovery using the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Since 1996, the LIHTC program has been the predominant mechanism for funding affordable multifamily housing production across the U.S. In spite of developer participation in LIHTC, affordable multifamily housing shortages continue to be problematic, especially after disaster. The intent of this study was to understand how LIHTC preferences influenced affordable housing development after the Florida 2004 hurricane season by examining perceived risk in the context of disaster recovery."}, {"section_title": "Growth and Development in Coastal Communities", "text": "Since 1970, an exploding U.S. population has migrated to the coast. Population on the coast has generally followed national trends. The problem, however, is coastal population is concentrated within a limited land area (Crossett et al., 2004). A densely populated coast places a significant burden on local and state governments who need to assess environmental and economic challenges imposed by potential hurricane damage. Hurricanes are the most common natural hazard in east coast communities, regardless of climate change (Pielke et al., 2008). The effects of climate change are expected to intensify hazardous conditions. Growth in coastal communities is driven by economic activity related to recreation, tourism, water-reliant industry and commerce, and employment (The Heinz Center, 2000;Crosset et al., 2004;U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, 2004). Economic activity along the coast supports not only the year round coastal population, but also the more than 180 million seasonal visitors to coastal regions each year. Tax revenue from tourist activities alone encourages policies that support even more growth. Commercial activities surrounding natural resources in coastal areas generate billions of dollars each year (Marlowe, 1999;U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, 2005). Fisheries generate more than $32 billion in income and over 1 million jobs in the U.S. (National Marine Fisheries Service, 2014). In 2010, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that coastal shoreline counties generated 45% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the U.S (NOAA, 2013b). Shoreline counties generate over 54% of GDP for coastal states. More than 50 million jobs and $2.7 trillion in wages were generated in coastal shoreline counties, including the Great Lakes Region (NOAA, 2013b). All of this robust economic activity encourages even more development that in turn contributes to a continuing migration to coastal communities. Population density in coastal areas has been expanding at a rapid pace for nearly half a century. In 2010, population density for the U.S. was 87 persons per square mile (NOAA, 2013a, p. 3). During the forty years between 1970 and 2010, the U.S. added 36 persons per square mile overall (Crowell et al, 2010;NOAA, 2013a, p. 3). In contrast, coastal shoreline counties added 125 persons per square mile during the same forty year period resulting in a density of 446 persons per square mile in coastal counties (NOAA, 2013a, 3;Crossett et al., 2004). Population density of this magnitude puts more pressure on the natural resources and economic stability essential to a sustainable existence. The current U.S. coastal population is estimated at 123.3 million or 39% of the national population and growing (Crowell et al, 2010;NOAA, 2013, p. 5). Coastal population growth is expected to increase another 8%, meaning that by 2020, another 10 million people will reside on or near the coast (NOAA, 2013, p. 4). Coastal counties encompass roughly 10% of land area in the United States, excluding Alaska. Population density of this scale imposes significant risks on those that live, work, and operate businesses on the coast, particularly when disaster strikes. The effect of disaster places an even greater burden on coastal states that must allocate limited resources while attempting to project the potential impact of coastal disaster on housing and essential services."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change and Disaster in Coastal Communities", "text": "Climate change is predicted to affect the intensity of natural coastal hazards in the coming years. Sea level rise is likely to increase in more than 95% of the ocean causing a twenty percent increase in mean sea level in 70% of coastal areas worldwide (IPCC, 2013(IPCC, , p. 1140. The U.S. will not be immune to the effects of climate change. Rising sea levels will contribute to higher storm surges, causing more extreme flooding and storm damage from even minor coastal storms. Climate change also contributes to warming oceans which in turn causes more intense and destructive hurricanes. Over the past 30 years, the duration and wind speed of hurricanes have shown an increase in the destructive power in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Emanuel, 2005). There has also been an increase in the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, correlating with rising ocean temperatures (Webster et al., 2005). Future storm models suggest that storms are likely to become even more intense with an average rainfall increase of 18% over the next eight years (Knutson and Tuleya, 2004;IPCC, 2014). Storm modeling trends are impeded by limited availability of storm data creating uncertainty in the literature (Knutson et al., 2010). Regardless, most scholars agree that climate change will cause tropical storms and hurricanes to intensify in frequency, strength, and damage potential while the frequency of less intense storms will decline (Knutson and Tuleya, 2004;Knutson et al., 2010;IPCC, 2014). Hurricanes can cause significant damages when they strike. Property owners are susceptible to damages from wind, flooding, and storm surge. Social and economic costs associated with these damages can be significant and devastating to individuals, business and communities. Blake et al. (2011) found the greatest number of deaths from hurricanes occurred in 1900 when 8,000 people were killed after a Category 4 hurricane struck Galveston, Texas. Since then, deaths from hurricanes have declined in part because of more advanced early warning systems allowing coastal inhabitants to evacuate or take precautions. However these systems have not been perfect. The most significant U.S. death toll from a hurricane occurred in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast. As many as 1,833 people died from causes related to Hurricane Katrina. Disaster can also have a devastating effect on the social and economic fabric of coastal communities. Increased development along the coast costs millions in taxpayer dollars after disaster as shown from federal flood insurance claims and disaster assistance programs (Godschalk et al., 1989). Between 1980 and 1999, economic damages from hurricanes totaled more than $68 billion in the U.S. (Davidson and Lambert, 2001 quoting NOAA, 2000). Beven et al. (2008) found even higher costs during 2005, the most active hurricane season on record since 1969. The economic cost of the 2005 hurricane season included over $100 billion in damages (Beven et al., 2008). Pielke and colleagues (2008) found the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season caused more than $150 billion in damage averaging $75 billion over the two year period. Normalized damage estimates of hurricanes from 1900-2005 found the decade between 1996 and 2005 as the second most costly decade after the ten year period of 1926-1935. The Great Miami Storm of 1926, which struck during the Florida land boom of the 1920's, was the single most damaging storm during the period, causing between $140-157 billion in normalized damages (Pielke et al., 2008). While deaths from hurricanes have declined, economic costs continue to rise, arguably as a result from coastal development. Hurricanes since 2000 have exposed the disparity that exists between homeowners and renters, wealth and poverty, and the upper and lower classes of American society. Like with renters, programs and policies that favor homeowners and commercial interests during recovery do not always extend to multifamily housing developers. Investors in affordable and low-income multifamily housing often struggle post-disaster because recovery programs do not meet their financial needs (Wu and Lindell, 2003). Programs and policies tend to favor economic development geared toward infrastructure, commercial businesses, and homeowners (Comerio et al., 1994;Quarentelli, 1999;Mueller et al., 2011). In spite of numerous programs in place to address housing needs for low-income households after Katrina, sufficient incentives for investors failed to meet the needs of displaced renter households resulting in housing disparity and affordable housing shortages. McCarthy and Hanson (2008) found the ratio of permits for damaged single-family units were issued more often than for multifamily units. After Katrina, housing units with less severe damage were more likely to be issued permits quicker than those with extensive damages, contributing to the overall reduction in available low-income rental housing during recovery (McCarthy and Hanson, 2008;Unity, 2010). Vuk (2008) suggests this view is misleading stating that vouchers offset claims of insufficient available housing. Vouchers are used to rent single or multifamily housing and are recognized by some as a more viable alternative to affordable housing than government incentivized housing production (Savas, 1987;Savas, 2000). Much like affordable rental housing, which often has long waiting lists and barriers to access, vouchers are also limited and taken alone cannot rectify affordable housing shortages. "}, {"section_title": "PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "The motivation behind this study came from the realization that affordable housing programs have had little success in providing enough affordable housing for the households that need assistance. This is especially true after disaster even though billions of dollars are spent on redevelopment. The goal of this study is to understand the influences that motivate multifamily development during disaster recovery. The aim is to understand how LIHTC developers' perceptions of risk influenced development decisions. Numerous studies have analyzed the impact of disaster on low-income households. Struggling low-income populations in disaster areas are more likely to fall behind during recovery and often fail to reap the benefits of new investment (Cutter and Emrich, 2006;Fischer and Sard, 2006;Fothergill and Peek, 2004;Popkin et al., 2006;Finch et al., 2010). Communities struggle continuously with poverty, particularly the lack of affordable housing. After a disaster occurs, recovery provides an opportunity to address affordable housing issues, which are often magnified as a result of disaster (Fothergill and Peek, 2004). Unfortunately, the recovery process often increases disparity and decreases accessibility to affordable housing (Cutter and Emrich, 2006). Several federal housing programs exist that communities depend on to support housing and are also used to address post-disaster housing needs (Table 1- Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. These programs can be combined or used in conjunction with disaster programs to jumpstart economic recovery and redevelopment, including housing production and restoration. In spite of the availability of these and other local initiatives, funding for affordable housing can fall short of the amount necessary to shelter those in need. The loss of more than 51,000 rental units in New Orleans after Katrina very likely contributed to a doubling of the homeless population once recovery was well underway (Unity, 2010). Prior to Katrina, 51 percent of renters paid more than 30% of their income in rent and utilities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines housing affordability as rent and utilities at 30% or less of gross household income. As of 2012, the number of renters exceeding this amount had increased to sixty-three percent (Plyler, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Table 1-1: Funding Resources for Disaster Recovery", "text": "Program Purpose"}, {"section_title": "Supplemental LIHTC", "text": "Supplemental LIHTC were granted by Congress after Hurricane Katrina.

Very few studies concentrate on multifamily development after hurricane disaster. Those that do exist focus on programs that favor homeowners and economic development and expose the disparity experienced by multifamily developers. Researchers studied CDBG allocations after Katrina. Galster et al. (2004) found that low-income neighborhoods did generally improve. However, about 62% of CDBG funds were allocated to homeowners and only 18% were directed to rental units during recovery (GAO, 2010). This resulted in fewer low-income units overall."}, {"section_title": "SBA Loans", "text": "Affordable housing also takes a back seat to economic development. Louisiana and Mississippi were criticized because tax dollars funded the rebuilding of fewer lowincome units than were in place prior to the disaster. Gotham and Greenburg (2008) found that fewer units were produced because of waivers of CDBG low-income housing requirements in favor of other economic interests. Congress and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have often approved increases or advances in the amount of allocated tax credits to facilitate redevelopment of affordable housing. The LIHTC program, Supplemental Tax Credits, and New Market Tax Credits were earmarked for affordable and low-income housing after Katrina encouraging the development of owner-occupied and rental housing. As a result, the Gulf Opportunity Act of 2005 instituted the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) tax program (GAO, 2010). The Government Accountability Office study stated that homeowner allocations were quicker and easier to distribute. Owners of rental properties were expected to access other programs, such as Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and tax credits (p. 19). Small Rental Assistance programs created more barriers than access for investors and developers because of regulatory requirements. Environmental review assessments were required and were costly for investors and owners who had limited ability to increase rents, often the case with affordable and low-income housing (p. 19). Multifamily owners and developers are also subject to capital markets and credit availability, and even when those markets are in balance, the feasibility of taking on additional debt can curtail development plans (p. 39). Debt affects operating and development costs which have to be weighed against allowable rents. Developers in general, including LIHTC developers, are unlikely to invest in projects that may pose greater financial risks, whether those risks are a result of location, funding, or operational costs. Risks imposed by potential hurricanes in coastal counties would seem to impede affordable multifamily housing development. However this study found no evidence that location imposes fewer LIHTC developed in coastal areas in spite of the greater risks associated with coastal hazards. The research that is the subject of this work is a revelatory case study that seeks to understand the preferences of LIHTC developers during the recovery process. This study examines the influence of risk perceptions that affect LIHTC developers' decisions during disaster recovery by analyzing the outcomes of LIHTC multi-family housing production during disaster recovery. For this study, developers include professionals involved in the production of LIHTC multifamily housing, including syndicators, bankers, builders, managers, and investors."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE STATEMENT AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS", "text": "This purpose of this research was to reveal how developer preference influences LIHTC multifamily housing production after disaster, and specifically, how risk perception influences development decisions during recovery.

Car (1932) was the first to sequence disaster in relation to cultural protections by defining disaster in the context of consequences within an urban environment. Dombrowsky (1981) viewed disaster as a natural or man-made event that causes substantial negative effects. These are the simplified understandings of the concept that others have expanded upon."}, {"section_title": "Defining Disaster", "text": "The study of disaster began in earnest shortly after the end of World War II. Along with physical damage studies, scientists also sought to understand the affect of bombing on the human population in Europe and Japan. During what Perry (2007) has coined the Classical Period of disaster research, disaster was defined as a \"catalyst for what would now be described as a failure of the social system to deliver reasonable conditions of life\" (p. 8). More than 50 years ago, Charles Fritz (1961), a major pioneer in disaster research, defined disaster as: \"Actual or threatened accidental or uncontrollable events that are concentrated in time and space, in which society, or a relatively selfsufficient subdivision of society undergoes severe damage, and incurs such losses to its members and physical appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of the society, or its subdivision, is prevented\" (p. 655). Fischer (2003), acknowledging Fritz's earlier definition, pointed to sociologists that studied social change under disaster conditions, which is noted in the work of those who search for meaning and clarification in the social condition of disaster survivors (Cutter, 1995;Enarson, 1998;Enarson, Fothergill, and Peek, 2006). In the field of anthropology, disaster is defined as an event \"involving a combination of potentially destructive agent(s) from the natural and/or technological environment and a population in a socially and technologically produced condition of environment vulnerability\" (Oliver- Smith, 1996, p. 305). According to Comerio (1998) disaster in the urban environment is an unintended consequence of development in hazard-prone areas. Hurricanes, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes that occur in non-populated areas are merely natural hazards (See Table 1-2). Disasters occur when natural hazards take place in densely populated areas (Comerio, 1998). Fischer (1998) sought to differentiate between disaster and emergency and the associated degree of impact and response at federal, state and local levels. For instance, the 1991 tornado that destroyed the homes of 1,000 households in Andover, one-fifth of the community, was declared a federal disaster area. A year later, Hurricane Andrew devastated Homestead, Florida, a community of roughly 100 square miles. Differences in the size and scope of disaster and disaster response have a direct bearing on the needs and resources allocated to a community. These differences are consistent with Fritz's earlier definition that identified the scope of disaster within the subdivision of a community as opposed to large scale disaster areas. Fritz's definition remains the most comprehensive definition among researchers and has mostly been adopted unchanged (Perry, 2007). Nuances have been added to clarify specific studies while embracing the basic tenets of the original. Buckle (2005, p. 179) includes the \"need for long term recovery\" among the significant and irreversible losses characteristic of disaster. Smith (2005, p. 301) added that disaster events cause \"considerable social, political and economic disruptions\" in the wake of death and destruction. Stallings (1998Stallings ( , 2005 defined disaster as a disruption of nature that interrupts social routines. Disasters have also been defined from a geological perspective, which Perry coins the Hazards-Disaster Tradition. Within this system, a disaster is an extreme event that arises when the source, or agent, of disaster collides with a human social system (Perry, 2007). Shadowing the view of Comerio, without human systems in the way disaster would not occur. Mileti (1999) pointed to an overlap between physical, built, and social environments as an encroachment on the natural landscape and subject to the inevitable impact of a disaster event. Cutter (2005) emphasizes human vulnerability and resiliency more so than the disaster event itself. In lieu of definitions found in the literature, emergency managers are guided by the technical definition contained in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which reads: \"Any natural catastrophe including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought, or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion  Communities faced with the consequences of disaster seek federal aid during the recovery and redevelopment process. The federal definition is significant to this study because this definition establishes the qualifications a community must meet in order to qualify for federal disaster resources. The disaster declaration process for federal assistance is initiated with a determination of damages by the state (See Figure 1.1). Additional preliminary damage assessments are requested that involve a joint preliminary damage assessment (PDA) process between federal and state agencies. When the PDA is complete, the state determines which counties require assistance and the type of assistance needed. A request from the governor for a Presidential Declaration of Disaster (PDD) is submitted to the regional Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who reviews and adds additional recommendations before forwarding the request to the national office. The PDD request package is then sent to the President for approval and a signature."}, {"section_title": "What is Disaster Recovery?", "text": "Disaster life cycles are ongoing cyclical progressions that emergency managers distinguish in four to six phases. Disaster recovery is but one phase of the cycle. FEMA has identified four phases of the disaster cycle for emergency management purposes. These phases are mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Recovery is a unique experience for each community and is influenced by the economic base, extent of losses, and the types of disaster assistance available. The multidisciplinary nature of disaster in academia and in practice poses challenges to the meaning of words and phrases. This section explores the disaster life cycle in order to clarify the meaning of disaster recovery in the context of this study. The concept of disaster recovery has evolved from the linear process of the mid-1970s to a dynamic phenomenon that responds to the characteristics of the impacted community. The linear process described by Haas and colleagues (1977) posed a static four-stage model that identified the major activities in each stage of the post-disaster period. Disaster is now recognized as a fluid process that is circular in nature. Each stage is also a dynamic course of action with decision-making processes that are related and interactive across stages (Mileti, 1999;Berke and Beatley, 1997;Berke et al, 1993;Rubin, 1985). Fischer (2008) describes a five phase life cycle of disaster: the pre-impact period, the impact period, the immediate post-impact period, the recovery period, and the longterm reconstruction period. The recovery period is defined as the period in which debris has been cleared, essential services are restored, insurance claims are filed and preliminary reconstruction plans are made. The long-term reconstruction period can extend for years depending on the severity of the disaster event. Long-term reconstruction includes the rebuilding period for housing needs. Hurricane Hugo hit South Carolina in 1989 causing destruction or damage to 108,658 housing units (Rubin and Popkin, 1990). Nearly 17% of all housing units destroyed or damaged by Hugo were multifamily housing units. After ten months, recovery and reconstruction was barely underway (Fischer, 1998). The recovery process was noted as politically charged with competing interests and demands. Recovery after Hugo was consistent with earlier reflections of Dynes and Quarantelli (1989) who suggested that recovery is often characterized by \"conflicting priorities, by issues of equity and inattention\" (p. 3). Another example of long-term reconstruction took place after Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida. According to Fischer (1998), estimates for the timeframe to complete reconstruction after Hurricane Andrew ranged from ten to fifteen years. Keim (2011) studied disaster within the field of public health. His research recognized the five phases of disaster within a pre-impact and post-impact cycle. The pre-impact phase includes prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. Post-impact actions include response and recovery. Response and recovery were defined by Keim as \"actions undertaken to minimize loss of life and damage to return to a pre-event status\" (p. 143). Others define recovery as a period of restoration and repair of the built environment within the short and long term phases of disaster (Rubin and Barbee, 1985;Schwab et al, 1998). Nigg (1995) characterized recovery as a social process influenced by pre-disaster conditions and post-disaster response. Smith and Wenger (2007) adopted a narrative that merged recovery and restoration as conceived by Fischer defining disaster recovery as \"the differential process of restoring, rebuilding, and reshaping the physical, social, economic, and natural environment through pre-event planning and post-event actions\" (p. 238). This conceptual definition accounts for the technical and social factors that shape disaster recovery (Nakagawa and Shaw, 2004;Nigg, 1995). Recognizing the fluid nature of disaster recovery and reconstruction, the concept of recovery assumes that insurance and recovery funds are applied for and reconstruction is underway. This, combined with Smith and Wenger, form the conceptual definition of disaster recovery that will be used in the context of this research."}, {"section_title": "Affordable Housing", "text": "The most accepted definition of affordable housing comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and is a reflection of the ability of a household to afford the cost of shelter, including rent or mortgage and utilities. According to HUD, housing is considered affordable if a household pays no more than thirty percent of its annual income toward housing costs (Nguyen, 2005). The idea of rent affordability is straight forward and includes rent and utilities. Affordability for homeowners is more difficult to ascertain because of mortgage interest deductions, real estate tax deductions, and capital gains (Schwartz, 2014). This study focused on rental housing rather than home ownership except to point out programs that favor owners during recovery rather than supporting multifamily housing restoration and production Other terms, such as below-market or low-income have been suggested as better alternatives to affordable housing, but these terms also have their limitations. For example, Section 8 voucher recipients do not necessarily rent below-market housing units. Their units tend to be rented at market and vouchers are used to subsidize rent based on the tenants' income, usually capped at thirty percent. Tenants pay the difference between the voucher and the landlord's market rent. The term low-income is also problematic because it requires some sort of threshold or cutoff. Some have argued for more sophisticated measurements of housing affordability, such as a sliding scale that accounts for the number of people in the household as well as their income (Stone 1993;Stone, 2006). Working definitions of affordable housing have been attempted by others (Freeman et al., 1997;Chaplin and Freeman, 1999) but there is no generally applicable definition since the term \"affordable housing\" might mean different things to different interests (Miles et al., 2000). Affordability is typically defined by the relationship between a household's expenditure for housing costs, including utilities, and income. A large number of communities are experiencing a shortage of affordable housing, often as a result of the disinvestment in public housing or low income growth in the macro economy. Lack of affordability becomes a larger problem for many communities even after disaster recovery and housing reinvestment. The problems of affordability often escalate after disaster, becoming even more widespread during recovery as housing shortages develop (Comerio, 1998;Levine et al, 2007). Affordable housing can also be thought of as physically adequate housing that is made available to those who could not afford the rent for such housing without some special intervention by government or special arrangement by housing suppliers (Field, 1997). Special interventions include rent subsidies through Section 8 vouchers, sliding scale rents based on income, income and rent caps, such as with rental housing constructed using Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), or other arrangements that subsidize or reduce conventional rents found in the marketplace. In addition to subsidies provided to renters, developers can also apply for incentives to reduce construction costs. These incentives include creative financing, waivers of land use requirements, or special exceptions to building regulations. Homeowners are also given special interventions such as favorable lending terms or financial assistance for reconstruction. The Center for Housing Policy found that 24.5% of renters and 18.6% of homeowners were severely cost burdened, meaning more than half of household income is spent on housing costs (Viveiros and Sturtevant, 2014). A severe cost burden means that more than half of household income is committed to the cost of housing. Cost burdened renters also have an affordability crisis. Thirty-two percent of moderate income households are cost burdened, paying more than thirty percent of household income on housing (Hickey et al., 2012). For the purposes of this study, affordable housing was defined using the standards most often cited in the literature and accepted by most government agencies. Housing is considered affordable when rent and utilities are no greater than 30% of area median income (Salama and Alshuwaikhat, 2006;Somerville and Mayer, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "The Low Income Housing Tax Credit", "text": "This study was specifically interested in how participants of LIHTC respond to risk during disaster recovery. Participants include developers, financiers, managers, or others involved with the production of affordable housing under the program. Established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the LIHTC program has become the \"single largest subsidy for the production of low-income rental housing\" in the country (Schwartz, 2014, p.135). The program provides tax credits as an incentive for private investor participation in the production of low-income rental housing. LIHTC is included in the tax code of the Internal Revenue Service and, as of 2011, has been directly responsible for more than 2.5 million housing units. Other programs exist that are also used for affordable housing production. Development (HUD). The CP is a statewide five-year plan that guides general long term strategy to meet expected housing needs using a market centered, data driven framework. The goal of the CP is to identify housing priorities and is required by HUD when state housing authorities allocate CDBG and HOME funding. LIHTC relies on a Qualified Action Plan (QAP) to set out housing preferences of the state, usually through the state housing authority. The QAP often uses a scoring system or sets thresholds based on the priorities of the state specifically for LIHTC developments. CDBG and HOME funds are not tied to LIHTC or the QAP, however the housing authority as the issuing agency may include provisions that allow for or encourage the use of CDBG and HOME funds. During disaster recovery, additional funding sources may be offered at federal, state, and local levels to facilitate the recovery effort. Some of these sources include disaster mitigation grants, SBA loans, and federal disaster loans. Tax credits are allocated to housing authorities by the IRS on a per capita basis. Housing needs are generally reflected in the QAP which informs housing producers of state priorities for LIHTC developments. Points are used to score applications received developers who compete with others for tax credits during the annual application period. There are a limited number of tax credits available and the application process and paperwork requirements are expensive and time consuming. In spite of the complexity of the annual application process, it is not uncommon for there to be more developers interested in the program than the available number of tax credits can accommodate. For this reason, housing authorities are likely to award credits to developers that provide the greatest number of housing units meeting the priorities expressed in the QAP. Some states incorporate flexibility in their decision-making while others make decisions based on score totals."}, {"section_title": "Investor Participation in LIHTC", "text": "Tax credits are distributed annually by the IRS on a per capital basis (See Figure   1-3  "}, {"section_title": "Risk in Context", "text": "The scholarly work in the field of risk is extensive and encompasses many fields. Early studies in the 1950s were developed from the concerns associated with early industrial technologies in engineering, chemicals, and nuclear power (Lofstedt and Boholm, 2009). Initial risk research identified public perception of risk and has since evolved to the study of underlying issues that address equity, trust and power (Slovic, 2000). Risk literature comes from a wide range of fields including toxicology and health, public policy, and technology among others (Slovic, 2000). The literature for this study focuses on risk in the context of natural hazards in the field of social science. In the social sciences, Gilbert White initiated risk studies in the context of natural hazards with his 1945 study, Human Adjustment to Floods. White argued that modifying human behavior is a more effective means of mitigating risk from disaster than engineering solutions (p.188). Risk is often studied in the context of hazards, and by default, disaster (Smith, 2013). Smith defines risk as \"the actual exposure of something of human value to a hazard and is often measured as the product of probability and loss\" (p. 11). When a hazard, which Smith defines as \"a potential threat to humans and their welfare arising from a dangerous phenomenon or substance that may cause loss of life, injury, property damage, and other community loss or damage,\" is combined with risk, the definition becomes more precise. A hazardous risk is defined as the \"combination of the probability of a hazardous event and its negative consequences\" ( p. 11). The intent of this study was to understand how a segment of real estate developers, those participating in the LIHTC program, perceive risk associated with disaster recovery in coastal communities and how risk perception influences development decisions. Variables of risk were identified in the literature and from a survey of multifamily housing professionals who participated in the LIHTC program in Florida between 2000 and 2010. Perceived risks have been categorized and ranked according to stated preferences from the LIHTC developer community and are discussed more fully in Chapter 5."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2 CONNECTING HOUSING, DISASTER, AND POLICY WHY AFFORDABLE HOUSING?", "text": "Current U.S. housing policy has failed to alleviate the housing cost burden faced by middle and low income households. Failure on the part of the U.S. housing safety net often has severe consequences. Within any given 24 hour period, over 610,000 people experience homelessness (Henry et al., 2013). Households who struggle with rent experience more stress resulting in high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety. Lowincome households often occupy low-quality housing exposing children and adults to potential allergens, lead paint, and unsafe conditions (Cohen, 2011). In 2013, the U.S. Census reported that 14.5% of the population lives at or below poverty (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor, 2014). The federal government measures poverty using poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines. Poverty thresholds are updated annually by the Census Bureau and are the original measure of poverty used mainly for statistical purposes. Poverty guidelines are issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and are published annually in the Federal Register. Poverty guidelines are a simplified analysis of poverty thresholds and are used to determine financial eligibility for federal programs, including housing subsidies. Guidelines are calculated using the published weighted average poverty thresholds and the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Three sets of poverty guidelines are issued. One set includes guidelines for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington D.C., one set is issued for Hawaii, and one set is issued for Alaska. In the contiguous states and Washington D.C., 2013 poverty guidelines indicate that a single adult earning $11,490 or less is considered to live in poverty. An annual income of $23,550 is considered poverty for a family of four (HHS, 2013). These figures are higher in Alaska and Hawaii. In 2013, more than 45 million people, or 14.5% of the population, lived below the poverty level. Poverty has a direct effect on housing affordability and is linked to housing cost burdens causing distress for 13% of the population."}, {"section_title": "Cost Burden and Housing Affordability", "text": "Housing affordability is discussed in terms of housing cost burden. A housing cost burden is defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as paying more than 30% of household income on costs for shelter including utilities. A severe cost burden occurs when households pay more than fifty percent of gross income on housing costs. According to Schwartz (2015), housing affordability is a bigger problem than inadequate or overcrowded housing. In the past, overcrowding and inadequate housing were a major concern. Today, fewer than 2% of households reside in inadequate housing (Schwartz, 2015, p. 32). Overcrowding accounts for less than four percent of households. In contrast, more than 18% of households spend at least half of their income on the cost of housing (p. 32). Thirty-five percent are renters and 27% of these spend more than half their income on rent (JCHS, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Multifamily Housing in the US", "text": "Multi-family housing accounts for 26% of all housing units.

There were 3,375,747 apartments constructed between 1990 and 2011. Forty-two percent of the households in these newer properties have an annual income below $20,000 per year. The National Multifamily Housing Council estimates over 16 million apartments exist nationwide. According to HUD, nearly two and a half million units have been built with LIHTC since 1987. This accounts for between 12% and 15% of new and rehabilitated apartment units throughout the country 1 . More than 12% of the U.S. population lives in multifamily housing. The greatest percentage of apartment dwellers lives in the District of Columbia followed by New York. In Florida, more than 12.4% of the population, or 2,380,131 residents, live in an apartment (NMHC, 2013). Florida has the 13 th highest number of residents living in multifamily housing."}, {"section_title": "Understanding LIHTC", "text": "The LIHTC program was created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and has become the nation's primary program for financing affordable rental housing (Wallace, 1995). The goal of the program is to provide an incentive for private investment in affordable housing intended for households earning less than 50% or 60% of area median income (AMI). The program supplements existing appropriations for public housing and rental assistance programs that are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). LIHTC is the only production program for affordable and low-income housing in the country. Since its inception, the program has supported private funding for the construction of more than 2.4 million multifamily housing units (HUD, 2015). Tax credits are purchased by investors at a reduced rate as an incentive to fund LIHTC development. Tax credits can then be used to reduce annual income dollarfor-dollar in an amount equal to the initial investment divided equally over a ten-year period. To qualify for the tax credit, LIHTC owners commit to setting aside at least 20% of all units for households that earn 50% of area median income (AMI) or 40% of units are set aside for households earning 60% of AMI. This is referred to as the 20/50 and 40/60 rule. Rents are targeted to not be more than 30% of household income however rent is based on AMI rather than household income. Tenants often find that because rent is not income based, housing costs exceed the targeted percentage for affordability. Units must continue to remain affordable for a 15 year compliance period, and since 1990, for an additional 15 years 2 or investors will forfeit earned tax credits retroactively by recapture. The penalty is intended to be severe in order to enforce compliance. The LITHC program has been criticized by the private sector for its complexity and high transaction costs. In the few years after the program was initiated, Clancy (1990) wrote the bureaucracy within the program was complicated with extensive reporting requirements and procedures for documenting compliance was cumbersome. Stegman (1992) initially complained that underwriting was unnecessarily complicated and burdensome but later pointed to the efficiency of the program because of the portion of credit dollars going to the bricks and mortar of development rather than the administrative costs of syndication and managing investor returns (Stegman, 1991). Postyn (1994) noted that few incentives existed for developers to participate in mixedincome developments because of cumbersome regulatory requirements implying fewer affordable units available for low-income households. Recent studies have concentrated on cost burdens and the affordability of rent. Williamson (2011) examined 38,000 LIHTC households and found that 76.2% of LIHTC households were cost burdened and 15% were severely cost burdened. Households using vouchers in conjunction with LIHTC were also cost burdened although to a lesser degree. More than 35% of LIHTC households using vouchers were found to experience housing cost burdens, paying more 30% of household income for rent. These statistics demonstrate that LIHTC is not a guarantee of affordability and often fails to reach extremely low income households who often have the greatest need for affordable wishes to opt out, the state housing agency must be notified and given a year to find a qualified buyer. If a qualified buyer is not found, the owner may be released from future restrictions and obligations under LIHTC. housing. The program does not specifically target households with extremely low incomes nor are rents assessed on a sliding scale according to income. Regan and Horn (2013) found most LIHTC households have higher incomes relative to other affordable housing programs, but 45% of tenants had extremely low incomes, meaning income is at or below the federal poverty guidelines or is 30% below AMI 3 , whichever is greater. This number corroborated an earlier study by New York University that found 43% of LIHTC households had incomes below 30% AMI. According to Hollar (2014), over half of all LIHTC tenants pay less than 30% of their income on rent and three-fourths of tenants spent less than 40% of their income on rent. Severe cost burdens are experienced by 10% of LIHTC tenants who pay more than 50% of their income for rent. Developers often apply for additional subsidy programs to reduce development costs in order to serve lower income households. These efforts are credited for relieving cost burdens for 31% of extremely low income renters in the program (JCHS, 2013). Housing cost burdens for states are uneven. Some states, such as Rhode Island and Washington, have more than 80% of LIHTC households who are not cost burdened at all. On the other hand, 31.7% of LIHTC households in Oregon and 32.7% in Arizona pay more than 40% of income in rent. Severe cost burdens for these two states are 18% and 20.4% respectively (Hollar, 2014). In Florida, the subject of this study, 40.1% of LIHTC households pay less than 30% of household income on rent and are not experiencing cost burdens. There are 25.7% of households paying greater than 40% of income on rent. More than ten percent of these are severely cost burdened paying greater than 50% of household income on housing costs (p. 27). As mentioned earlier, rents in LIHTC units are capped at thirty percent of either 50% or 60% of AMI depending on the developer agreement. Rents often fluctuate with market conditions. Because rents do not fluctuate with tenant income, tenants who experience job loss or a reduction in income are obligated to pay the contract rent. Even though LIHTC households earning 50% to 60% of AMI are better able to avoid cost burdens (Williamson, 2011), evidence suggests that LIHTC does not alleviate the cost burden associated with rental housing. While the LIHTC program does produce additional affordable units, affordable housing shortages persist in many communities. According to the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness, the number of households living in poverty has increased while at the same time the number of affordable rental housing has declined. Higher income households occupied nearly 42% of all affordable housing units, pushing over half of low and extremely low-income families into unaffordable rental units 4 . The Joint Center for Housing Studies (2012) found that over the past decade, the gap between the supply and demand for low income rentals has widened over the past decade. Since the Great Recession of 2008, declining household income has increased demand for affordable rental housing for higher income tenants pushing the lowest income tenants into less desirable housing."}, {"section_title": "AFFORDABLE HOUSING, LIHTC AND DISASTER RECOVERY", "text": "The supply of low-income housing incurs additional production challenges in the face of disaster. The effectiveness of housing programs as a solution for problems caused by disaster has been examined by others. Gotham and Greenburg (2008) applied a comparative analysis of Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and local bonds after 9/11 and Katrina. Their analysis revealed the overwhelming influence of business interests that dominated the political discourse, and ultimately influencing rule changes that eliminated the 'public benefit' language previously contained in the provisions. Green and Olshansky (2012) studied the Road Home Program (RHP), one of the largest disaster programs implemented during Katrina, highlighting program volatility and implementation challenges. RHP was created in the wake of Katrina to provide aid to small rental properties and to offer homeowners a choice to sell out or rebuild. During the recovery period, redevelopment shadows economic development policies that currently encourage development of mixed use neighborhoods to dilute pockets of poverty associated with public housing. Other policies attempting to alleviate poverty have also prescribed location or development priorities. In the early 1990's, the Moving to Opportunity program and the HOPE VI program were introduced in an effort to disperse public housing residents into other neighborhoods so that impoverished families could integrate into more middle-class communities (Goetz, 2004). Efforts to de-concentrate poverty was also attempted by combining LIHTC with other federal assistance such as HOPE VI 5 , HOME, vouchers, and other low-income housing programs (Graham, 2012;Schwartz, 2010). According to Goetz (2004) Much of the literature related to disaster recovery and housing examines the impact on those who either receive housing services or are displaced due to shortages of available housing (Mueller et al., 2011;Tierney, 2006). Spangle (1991) primarily studied technical strategies for recovery, but recognized the disproportionate displacement of low-income households as a result of damaged housing and the subsequent increase in rents as a result of higher costs for code compliance during recovery. The evidence of an overall reduction in the number of low-income rental housing units during disaster recovery has been well documented (McCarthy and Hanson, 2008; Unity, 2010), however Vuk (2008) suggests that this view is misleading. His case study explored commentary from advocates of public housing preservation in the aftermath of Katrina. Vuk (2008) found that low-income households in New Orleans were misled about available housing. One of the reasons for his claim is the availability of vouchers. Housing choice vouchers are a demand subsidy provided to qualified households allowing them access to affordable housing from the private sector. Privatization proponents have long called for vouchers as a more viable alternative to housing lowincome populations as opposed to government incentivized housing (Savas, 1987;Savas, 2000). The experience of LIHTC housing providers participating in disaster recovery have not been given much attention. Most studies and essays bemoan the failure of LIHTC, and other housing programs, to reach those most in need (Hooks and Miller, 2006 (Richardson and Renner;. This study specifically examines the preferences of LIHTC professionals and the Florida State Finance Corporation (FHFC), the state housing authority administering housing programs in the state. Research on LIHTC multifamily housing development post-disaster fills a gap between the disaster experience of households and housing providers, particularly LIHTC developers and investors."}, {"section_title": "PREFERENCE THEORY, DECISION-MAKING, AND RISK", "text": "As stated in Chapter 2, risk as a social science was first explored by Gilbert White (Lofstedt and Frewer, 1998). White proposed a social construct that suggested modifying human behavior was a better solution to potential harm from natural disasters (White, 1945). Avoidance is one such measure. Risk avoidance is most often shown in areas with proximity to hurricane hazards, such as Florida, when communities mandate evacuations or have a no-development policy on barrier islands. Bradbury (1989) identified two concepts of risk that propose solutions to different problems. Technological risk uses a quantitative approach in risk analysis and presents facts from which decisions can be made. Most attention to property development risk focuses on measurable processes, largely feasibility analysis and cash flow analysis (Byrne, 1996;Cadman and Topping, 1995). Additional risk exposure for LIHTC projects (management risk, tax risk, and capital risk), are quantitative and fall within the technological risk category. A second concept of risk forms a theoretical basis for policy design from a social constructivist perspective (Bradbury, 1989, p. 380 (1987, p. 7). Often this is the case when disaster recovery is underway, yet social needs fail to be met. Disaccord is highly visible in the affordable housing realm, not only because of a chronic undersupply in general, but especially when disaster recovery fails to address the needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population-the elderly, disabled, and impoverished. Bradbury (1989) includes an ethical dimension to consider 'questions of values that inherently are embedded in judgments of the analyst ' (p. 382). Risk judgments between laypersons and experts will naturally have differing viewpoints because each class has varying experiences and expectations that contribute to understanding. Disagreements between experts and laypersons are not factually wrong per se but are from a different perspective (Fischcoff et al, 1983). The literature on disaster recovery reflects this discord with the majority of research focusing on the effects disaster places on the displaced and the disenfranchised. The conversation ultimately leads the charge for more assistance and more housing that is affordable for the poor and working classes, often to no avail. Research devoted to those who provide affordable housing fails to examine the problem from the producer's perspective. Developing an understanding from the perspective of one or another group provides the foundation for a two-way conversation that supports knowledge and mutual respect (Bradbury, 1989). This study bridges the gap between the perspective of the developer and the multiple studies that advocate for increased access to affordable housing by vulnerable households. Slovic et al (1979) found in an earlier study on hazards related risks that people who had faulty perceptions were likely to err in their understanding. That challenge is still prevalent today. Understanding barriers to the development of affordable housing as heard from those that produce housing with LIHTC will hopefully contribute to the discourse in the literature and in public policy."}, {"section_title": "LOCATION PREFERENCE AND DEVELOPER RISK", "text": "While some developers may consider the social benefits of their developments, for the most part, real estate developers are concerned with exposure to financial risk when making investment decisions. Empirical evidence identifies real estate risks as illiquidity (the inability to turn real estate into cash quickly), optimal holding period, price risk (Cheng, Lin & Liu, 2008); interest rate risk (Archer, Elmer, Harrison & Ling, 1998); credit and debt burden risks (Igan & Pinheiro, 2010); and risk associated with business cycles (Igan & Pinheiro, 2010). Traditional aspects of development risk, such as financing and interest rates, have been studied by Markham (2001) and Cameron (1990). Risk factors were categorized in the course of this study. Dullisear (2001) classified property development in four broad risk categories: commercial, construction, land, and social. Hargitay and Yu (1993)  The method is also known as ETPS, STEP, PEST, PESTLE, and STEEPLE. Various iterations of this business model consider other factors that influence decision-making, such as Legal (L), Political (P), Economic (E), Environmental (E), Technological (T), or Sociological (S).

The price of available land is basic to any investment decision. Oftentimes the least expensive land is located in the most vulnerable of places (Khadduri, 2013). Land in coastal communities often comes at a premium. Higher rent and higher stabilized occupancy rates offset high land costs in these areas (Bin and Kruse, 2006 "}, {"section_title": "Location Preferences and the Public Agency", "text": "Statute requires that state housing authorities (HFA) develop annual Qualified Action Plans (QAP) to encourage a wide variety of stated preferences for LIHTC development. The QAP is a federally required planning tool that HFA uses to explain how the LIHTC program will be administered, and to establish preferences and set-asides for tax credit awards (Hollar, 2014). Allocation criteria is determined by the state, however the statute specifically requires certain criteria to be considered, including location, which is the primary interest for this study. Other required features and conditions are shown in Table 2  with housing already relatively easy to obtain using vouchers (Eriksen and Rosenthal, 2010). Some studies suggest LIHTC developments often act as a substitute for market housing that would have been constructed without tax credits or other subsidy (Eriksen and Rosenthal, 2010;Malpezzi and Vandell, 2002). Given that developers are less likely to build LIHTC in areas with less demand, like extremely low-income communities, QAPs that award additional points or set-asides for these areas can result in LIHTC being developed in areas that already support low-income households considering that rents are relatively cheaper and landlords are likely more willing to accept vouchers (Baum-Snow and Marion, 2009). According to Khadduri (2013) developers actively communicate during the comment period for QAPs being commenced the following year to influence which projects will be fundable. Preferred locations established in the QAP do not necessarily insure developers will bring properties into the LIHTC competition (Khadduri, 2013 "}, {"section_title": "Revealed Preference Theory", "text": "The disaster cycle provides a unique opportunity for effected communities to engage in redevelopment with the intent of creating a modern community along with services and a landscape that enhances the lives and property of its inhabitants. Yet disaster recovery is a difficult process with limited funds available to bring an affected community or region back to normalcy. Housing is but a small segment of the recovery process, albeit one of the most essential, particularly when a large portion of existing housing is damaged. The reality of having limited resources available to assist communities in recovery efforts lends itself well to the theory of preference. Pioneered by Paul Samuelson, revealed preference theory is a means of analyzing choice by observing behavior. Revealed preference theory arose from theories of choice and utility rooted from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries pioneered by Georg Cantor and Ragnar Frisch. Revealed preference was proposed by Samuelson as an alternative to ordinal utility theory (Samuelson, 1950) and promoted the idea that any good or service is preferred over an alternative choice. Samuelson (1948) initially studied individual preferences using an indifference map based on observations. This study analyses the stated and revealed preferences of stakeholders of LIHTC in the context of disaster recovery. Bockstael and McConnell (2007)  interviews for a large scale contingent valuation study that identified stated willingness-to-pay by households to assess the harm associated with the disaster. Stated preferences were also used when attempting to value the damages associated with the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The researchers used direct interviews as opposed to observations of behavior because revealed preferences were difficult to obtain and indecisive (Bockstael and McConnell, 2007). Others studies have combined stated and revealed preference methods as a means of comparison. Valuing environmental amenities was the subject of a study that compared revealed and stated preference models (Adamowicz et al., 1994 "}, {"section_title": "DISASTER THEORY", "text": "According to Smith and Wenger (2007), the recovery phase of disaster is little understood among researchers and practitioners. Communities are challenged to rebuild basic services, infrastructure, and the local economy. Individuals are faced with rebuilding homes and lives. Business owners are faced with determining the feasibility of whether to restore or not. Housing providers, within the context of a business model, have to factor in risk and financial constraints to determine if, where, and when rebuilding and restoration will occur. Policy makers focus on reconstructing a sustainable community using limited resources. Decisions are made about who will be winners and losers when available funding is weighed against social, economic, and environmental needs; needs which far outweigh available resources. In addition to basic economic realities, stakeholders and decision-makers are faced with contradictory policies, complex interconnections between participants, and limited understanding of how all of these complexities impact the effectiveness of public and private systems for supplying a sufficient number of affordable housing units. The community leans toward the restoration of a familiar place while at the same time striving to reconstruct a safer and more equitable society (Kates et al., 2006, p. 14656). New sustainable development potentially replaces old and run-down buildings, depending on political will and the struggle between available resources and competing interests of who benefits from recovery and restoration (p. 14656). This paradox was seen in action after Hurricane Katrina nearly devastated the Lower Ninth Ward in Orleans Parish, Bernard Parish and Jefferson Parish. Over 51% of white-occupied homes and 67% of black occupied homes were damaged or destroyed in these areas. Yet redevelopment was criticized for being inefficient and for straining public services (Simunovich, 2008). Urban redevelopment programs were heavily criticized for failing to house low-income households while building a new community that highlighted the economic revitalization of the area, leaving many lifelong residents behind. Ultimately, disaster planning requires that stakeholders participate in a dialogue that guides redevelopment during recovery. LIHTC developers, as the primary provider of affordable multifamily housing, can contribute expertise to housing recovery policy by identifying the programs most effective for affordable housing production during disaster recovery. Researchers from many disciplines have studied disaster in the context of their fields, but ultimately there are five bodies of theory in the literature on the disaster recovery process. These are the social, institutional, environmental, economic, and physical theories of study. These areas contribute to disaster theory through the construct of competing choices. What these bodies of knowledge reveal about disaster recovery is that the process is circuitous and complex. Multiple sectors of society have a role in the recovery effort but lack understanding of how each sector affects outcomes (Alesch, 2005). Quick decision-making is undertaken under political and social pressures which inhibits the process of integrating and learning from past experiences. These are the realities that converge in the emerging theory of disaster recovery (Alesch, 2005). It is a goal of this research to contribute to that emerging theory. There are several theories that emerge in the literature that encompass various disciplines in the study of housing and disaster recovery. Much of the research surrounding disaster recovery and low-income housing is grounded in the theories of environmental justice and social justice from the legal and sociological disciplines respectively. The plight of disadvantaged populations fits well within these areas of focus because of the concern for human rights and the social functions of society."}, {"section_title": "THE THEORETICAL DOMAIN OF DISASTER RECOVERY", "text": "Privatization evolves from economic theory and seeks to implement market mechanisms to improve efficiency in government programs through public/private partnerships, tax credits, and vouchers (Savas, 2000). The public housing model has coalesced into a modified public-private partnership model where private developers are incentivized through tax breaks or subsidies to provide low-income housing to those in need. During disaster, incentives and government aid is expected to expedite recovery so a sense of normalcy and economic activity can return, ideally to a better than pre-disaster condition, even if the poor are excluded. The provision of low-income housing during recovery also has roots in public choice theory attributable to public discourse and political response. Public choice theory was developed by Buchanan and Tullock (1962)   The perception of risk in hazardous areas may influence the development decision-making process. In economic literature, risk is typically conceptualized as uncertainty over future outcomes (Bodie, Kane and Markus, 1993). Knight (1921) defined risk as measurable as opposed to uncertainty which is \"not susceptible to measurement.\" This study identifies risk and uncertainty, merging the two into what is conceptualized as perceived risk. For the purpose of this study, perceived risk is defined as the stated actions and motivations that stem from social, economic, environmental, and political experiences. Expectations of risk, whether perceived or quantified, should influence decisions about where LIHTC projects will ultimately be developed. For this study, temporal changes in demonstrated location preferences were expected as the disaster event became a distant memory. Temporal changes were examined in the course of this study to compare revealed preferences with stated preferences. This analysis sought to extract variables of risk from a comparison of stated and revealed preferences. The study also sought to make note of variations in site choices over time. An embedded revelatory case study approach was used to determine the reasonableness of the variables developed from the literature. A survey of LIHTC professionals ranked each of the variables by order of preferences. In the analysis, variables presented were interpreted in terms of risk.

When the United States Public Housing Authority was enacted, the declaration stated the purpose of the act was to help States ease unemployment first, and then to improve housing for low income families. In 1940, the Lanham Act allowed federal funds to be used to produce public housing as a part of the war effort to house defense industry workers. This was followed by legislation to exercise rent control under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 to curtail rent inflation after the war. Katz et al (2003) analyzed seventy years of housing policies at the state and local level and found only two that directly addressed affordable and decent housing. It was not until 1949, under President Harry Truman, that the Housing Act authorized the construction of a large number of public housing units. While 810,000 units were authorized to be built by 1955, only 125,000 were actually constructed. Urban renewal and slum clearance projects undertaken under the act actually destroyed more housing than was replaced (Thomas, 1997;Rusk, 1999;Teaford, 2000), a charge that would be repeated during the recovery phase of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Campanella, 2006). office to encourage the private sector to produce low-income rental housing for the poor, elderly and disabled. Other than Section 515, which subsidizes rural housing development, the grants and programs from this period did not produce additional public housing but relied on existing stock or the private sector. According to the Section 8 contract database that is maintained and publicly available through hud.gov, as of 2012, the Section 8 program provided rent subsidies for 1,034,445 households.

Kingsley (2009) asserts that the percentage of replacement public housing is closer to 81% because as much as a third of public housing units scheduled for demolition through HOPE VI were vacant units.

Two types of LIHTC are available for investors, the 4% credit and the 9% credit. A 4% credit is typically taken for rehabilitation or new construction supplemented with tax-exempt bonds. The credit is taken in annual installments over a ten-year period (Table 3-1). A 4% credit is intended to deliver 30% of the qualified basis for a LIHTC project. The 9% credit works the same way only it is intended to deliver 70% of the qualified basis for the project. Projects that do not use any other federal subsidies are supported with the 9% tax credit. Both the 4% and 9% credits fluctuate because they are tied to market interest rates. According to the US Department of Revenue, the 9% rate has historically ranged from as low as 7.35% to 9.27%.

Florida was chosen for this research because of its geographic location and susceptibility to the effects of hurricanes. Future studies will compare other states with similar hazards for common variables based on disaster type, severity, types of programs and policy preferences influencing recovery. Disaster recovery policies that reshape the community are often driven by economic development. The literature is replete with evidence that demonstrate how renters suffer displacement to a higher degree than homeowners. Developers of multifamily housing experience a similar degree of disparity during recovery. Multifamily developers are less likely to have access to disaster recovery assistance as compared to homeowners and other community business interests (Comerio et al., 1994;Quarentelli, 1999;Wu and Lindell, 2003;Mueller et al., 2011).

This study expected to identify certain risks associated with investment or disinvestment decisions by producers of affordable housing. However, inferences to relationships identified within the statistical analysis may be associated or related, but not causal. The sampling frame was the LIHTC database. The survey population was limited to professionals in the Florida LIHTC community chosen from the contact data in the HUD LIHTC database. The LIHTC program was legislated into existence in 1986. The pilot study identified participants of LIHTC in South Carolina using counties impacted by Hurricane Hugo as the case study area. During the pilot, it was determined that early developers in the program were often no longer active in the profession due to retirement, a change in profession, and in at least one occasion, was deceased. For this study, the sample population was chosen from those professionals who were active in the profession from 2000 to 2011. The LIHTC database is the most comprehensive collection of LIHTC projects available. Data collection for the database has evolved but data is incomplete, usually because states leave fields blank or some data unknown. Updates are completed annually by HUD who provides statistics for general reliability of the database. Between 2004 and 2010, approximately 8.7% to 15.1% of projects placed in service had missing addresses. This was overcome by manually inputting an address found by an independent Internet search to verify location. Only one Florida property in Palm Beach County was discovered to have an erroneous address in the course of this study. Owner contact records were missing in 7.5% to 12.1% of the time, however many participants are included multiple times in the database. Typically LIHTC participants are involved with multiple properties therefore missing contact information was easily identified from other entries in the database. The \"number of units\" fields were missing data 6.4% to 14.1% of the time. The LIHTC database includes projects that may no longer be bound by LIHTC restrictions. The first wave of LIHTC eligible to leave the program was constructed between 1987 and 1994. This study made no attempt to determine which LIHTC were no longer in compliance. Khadduri, Climaco, and Burnett (2012) studied LIHTC properties that were eligible to leave the program and found that most continue to be affordable after the compliance period ends. The majority of owners recapitalize with new tax credits for rehabilitation. Others reposition themselves with market rate leases. Repositioning was found to occur most often when housing markets are strong. Since 1990, federal law requires a 15-year compliance period and an additional 15 year affordability period. While rental housing markets have improved since 2008, the number of LIHTC eligible to leave the program is unlikely to threaten the validity of this study. The GIS analysis could overstate or understate the number of total developments units because of properties that have dropped out of the program or because of missing data. This study provides general data derived from the database in order to allow the reader to understand the scope of the problem. The primary focus of GIS analysis was to reveal location preferences for LIHTC development after the 2004 hurricane season. Non-compliant properties should not affect these results since developments coming out of compliance in 2004 were placed in service at the beginning of the program, and regulatory changes in 1990 insured the majority of LIHTC will remain compliant until 2020. General data regarding the number of LIHTC located in the boundaries of potential storm surge could vary depending on a number of variables including wind direction, wind speed, and intensity. This study used preset MEOWs developed in the SLOSH model for Florida basins."}, {"section_title": "External Validity", "text": "The greatest threat to external validity is in establishing a way for findings to be generalized. Generalization for case studies is analytical in nature and developed in theory with which to compare empirical results (Rowley, 2002). Replication can be claimed when theory is supported by two or more cases. In a single case study such as this, generalization is less certain because of the unique characteristics of the case. In the course of this research, state programs and the impact of disaster vary with each incident and with each state. This study aims to create a baseline of perceived risk and development patterns post-disaster with the expectation that comparisons could be made from future case studies."}, {"section_title": "Reliability", "text": "According to Yin (2009), case study reliability requires that data collection procedures and a chain of evidence be documented and maintained. Record-keeping has been organized and is maintained in a case-study database. Hard copies of field notes are maintained and all documentation is being catalogued for easy access within the case study database. Reliability was also considered in the conduct of the survey. During the pilot study, it was discovered that earlier participants in LIHTC had left the business. It was also realized that many participants are involved with multiple developments each year. The selection process for identifying the sample of survey participants was changed to reflect these circumstances. The population was chosen from active participants in LIHTC from 2000 to 2010. Duplicate entries were removed. Potential respondents were then verified through web research to insure that they were still active in the LIHTC industry. Phone calls were made to potential respondents to request participation and validate an email address so a link to the survey could be sent. Multiple emails were sent to respondents to further boost participation. When a GIS analysis was conducted of C5H storm surge, it was discovered that some properties were duplicated based on the varying degree of storm surge affecting a single development. Storm surge was classified in equally divided segments based on the total range of feet. One development could be impacted by storm surge in two ranges. In each case, multiple entries were randomly assigned one representative for that development. This eliminated duplicate counts of units for that development and avoided overstating damage estimates."}, {"section_title": "Construct Validity", "text": "This study identified risks associated with LIHTC development during disaster recovery.

Risk variables were identified and ranked in order of preference using a mean score. Risk was also measured and ranked using the total number of LIHTC units placed in high hazard areas placed in service annually between 2004 and 2010 within Category 3 and Category 5 storm surges. Location was analyzed using measurements of storm surge risk in feet and location based on the number of LIHTC units located within potential storm surge using the SLOSH model.

This research focused on documents that influence LIHTC developer decisionmaking. The document most relevant to the research questions, and targeted to the LIHTC industry, is the Qualified Action Plan (QAP). This document sets the protocol for State housing needs and dictates how federal tax credits will be prioritized. QAPs examined during the South Carolina pilot study had points and thresholds that identified preferences. This language communicated location preferences by establishing quantitative measures to gauge priority. During disaster recovery, supplemental QAPs may also be issued to encourage housing recovery efforts. During Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana issued multiple QAP supplements as policy changes and additional housing recovery strategies were implemented. However this was not the case in Florida which issued a single QAP each year through the study period. Florida QAPs differed from those issued during Katrina and those analyzed during the pilot study. Preferences were communicated using the words targeted, threshold or set-aside rather than a quantifiable scoring method. Florida QAPs were collected and analyzed from 2004 to 2010. The initial review of QAPs included a search for points, set-asides, or thresholds that gave preferences for location. Some states use a point system to establish preferences within the QAP. Such was the case of South Carolina during the pilot study. Florida does not use this system. In Florida, points were applied in the Universal Application (UA) for LIHTC, and while this study did not examine UAs, a preliminary review of several UAs was completed and findings indicated that points were most often applied to design features of units or property amenities as opposed to geographical preferences. Geographic set-asides were also distributed between large, medium, and small counties based on the state's most recent market study. Market studies are completed in conjunction with a Consolidated Plan required by HUD for the allocation of HOME funds or CDBG. While not required for LIHTC allocations per se, the Consolidated Plan is often instrumental in the creation of Qualified Action Plans so that available sources of funding can be directed to the most pressing housing needs within the state. Set-asides are \"pools of tax-credit funds within which applicants compete only against other properties qualifying for the set-aside\" (Khadduri, 2013). Geographic setasides were established for Florida Keys communities, Rural Development, and Front Porch Florida Communities. Set-asides in the QAPs examined for this study were not applied to locations specifically impacted by the 2004 hurricanes. Thresholds are another means of stating public preferences in the QAP. Thresholds establish a minimum baseline that can have the effect of excluding properties from the bidding process altogether (Khadduri, 2013). Thresholds were not explicitly established in the documents examined for this study, but were referred to as minimums to be met in accordance with the UA. For instance, threshold requirements for Rural Development, Florida Keys, and Front Porch Communities were geographical threshold requirements ranked in the UA, however specific points were not applied making it difficult to determine the priority of a specific location. Thresholds were also noted for developments that received additional funding through tax-exempt bonds. Future studies are needed to dissect scoring and threshold priorities of Florida UAs as they relate to hurricane prone properties. Since points are not applied for every category of the UA, selection appears to be subjective. Given the subjective nature of the UA, future studies would also benefit from interviews with a representative of the public housing authority to understand how scoring and LIHTC selection are accomplished in Florida.

Respondents were asked which funding source was most likely to incentivize LIHTC development in an impact zone. A program that was likely to encourage development was identified as a low risk whereas a funding source that was very unlikely to incentivize development was considered high risk.

This same inferential analysis could be applied to other questions in the survey to gain a more comprehensive interpretation of the results.

Of the non-profits represented, 28% were 501(c)3 organizations. Sixty percent of non-profits were Community Development Corporations (CDC). A CDC is a nonprofit, community-based organization that focuses on a number of initiatives promoting community development, including affordable housing. CDCs typically support or participate in projects at the local level. states. Slightly more than 20% developed LIHTC in a single county, and 13.8% operated in multiple counties within the state. Over 82% of participants indicated involvement with projects other than LIHTC. The same percentage, 82%, owned LIHTC in coastal counties. More than 39% of respondents had experienced damages to LIHTC units as a result of a hurricane, and of those, all of them had more than 20 units damaged as a result. This study was not specifically interested in the numbers of units damaged as a result of a hurricane but was interested in the preferences associated with development. It is obvious from the number of respondents selecting the highest category available for damaged units that in future surveys, twenty units or above should be in the lower range of categories for understanding the extent of damages."}, {"section_title": "Ranking Preferences", "text": "The next few questions asked respondents to rank a series of preferences. The first question asked respondents to rank the importance of five general categories of risk discussed in Chapter 2. Risk categories were identified in the development literature and included risk variables like credit, debt burdens, interest rates, policy, funding, and hazards. These variables were categorized based on a modified STEEP analysis for real estate development built from the work of Khumpaisal and Ross (2007) and Morrison (2007). The categories were social, technical, economic, environmental, and government ( Figure 5-4). Social factors included public sentiment and advocacy. Environmental factors included proximity to the coast, impact areas, and events related to hurricanes. Both of these categories had the least influence on development decisions.  Respondents were asked to rank each category from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating low risk and 10 indicating high risk. Technical, economic, and government categories each scored above seven. Economic factors presented the greatest risks that were most likely to derail an affordable housing project. These elements included sources needed to fund development. Social factors, such as the level of community support for development, were least likely to influence the decision to develop. All categories scored greater than neutral significance for influencing a development decision except the Social category. Development decisions were most influenced by economic forces, government and political influences, and the technical requirements needed for project profitability."}, {"section_title": "Funding Preferences", "text": "Government funding was the primary factor in the economic category. Funding from government sources is often essential for feasibility of affordable housing production. Developers rely on funding assistance during the recovery and redevelopment phase of disaster because of the limitations and constraints on rent increases. The LIHTC database revealed very little about project funding. Most of the fields for HOME and CDBG funds were blank. Only five percent of projects in the database received HOME funding and even fewer, no more than one percent, included CDBG funds (Table 5-5). The data means little considering that nearly 80% of LIHTC fields for two programs were blank. Tax exempt bonds, typically state sponsored disaster bond programs such as Liberty Bonds, or Go Zone, were used in 31% of Florida LIHTC with only 21% of fields being reported as blank.

Supplemental LIHTC was most preferred program for development in an impact zone. Supplemental LIHTC ranked 6.2 on a scale of 1 to 7 with a standard deviation of 0.88, indicating the program was the most significant for mitigated risk among respondents. The HOME program is often used in conjunction with LIHTC and has many of the same restrictions. HOME funds were the second most important funding source according the respondents. Loan programs of all types were predictably less attractive. Federal disaster loans outranked traditional financing, likely because of traditionally lower interest rates for this type of funding. Grants were the next category of funding preferences with Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) outweighing Federal Disaster Grants. Mitigation Grants were the least preferred in the Grant category. Other funding options that were not included in funding options were contributed by one or more respondents.

As in the previous question, Supplemental LIHTC was the most favored response with a mean score of 7.63 ( Figure 5-6). This was followed by HOME funds and Federal Disaster Grants.

As stated earlier, an impact zone is an area that withstands the greatest degree of physical damage, and in the case of coastal hurricanes, is most likely to be in a coastal county. The statistical analysis conducted for this study did not indicate causality, but there was correlation between some variables. Phase I revealed that the public agency, or housing authorities, had a preference for coastal areas subject to hurricane impact or to areas directly hit by one or more of four hurricanes in 2004. Descriptive statistical analysis revealed that Supplemental LIHTC was the most preferred funding program when compared to the mean of all other programs. The initial phase of statistical analysis looked at the mean between two groups, the for-profit developer and the non-profit developer. The mean of combined for-profit and non-profit developers was 6.19 on a scale of 1 to 7. Federal Disaster Grants, HOME and CDBG programs were the next highest ranking programs with mean scores of 5.06, 5.06, and 5.10 respectively.

Location risk between the combined for-profit and non-profit groups indicated a preference for site locations greater than 10 miles from the coast. A mean score of 7.6 among respondents show a greater preference for sites more than 25 miles from the coast. Respondents had a mean score of 7.3 for sites not within a storm surge boundary. A site not in a coastal county had a mean score of 7.0.

P-values < .05 indicate some kind of relationship between programs. Some correlation exists between both loan and grant programs associated with disaster with significance at the .01 level and the .05 level, indicating some relationship between funding types. According to Tabachnick and Fidell (2007), the correlation matrix should be examined for correlation coefficients greater than 0.30. There were 27 pairs of variables with correlations between .30 and .763 indicating high correlations between variables (Table 5-8). Pearson's Correlation was also calculated to determine if there was a linear relationship between six location preferences. P-values < .05 indicate some kind of relationship between programs. The results indicate that correlation exists between locations with significance at the .01 level. There were 11 pairs of variables with correlations between .545 and .714 indicating a high correlation between location variables (Table 5-9). There was a significant positive correlation (.703) between a site located in a coastal county and a site located in a non-coastal county. These opposing variables would be expected to have a negative correlation, meaning when preferences for coastal counties increases, preferences for non-coastal counties decrease. However this was not the case. The results suggest that sites in coastal counties positively correlate with sites in non-coastal counties. One explanation could be that the wording of statement choices could have resulted in confusion among the respondents. The question intentionally had elements of contrast that could have created confusion in the interpretation of results. For instance, a response choice stating a preferred site would be in a storm surge boundary was followed by a response choice stating a preferred site was not in a storm surge boundary. Predictably, flooding and damages from storm surge were not significantly correlated with sites not located within storm surge boundaries. The findings do suggest that location in coastal counties and inland counties is highly correlated with the perception of risk associated with storm surge and flooding hazards as opposed to strictly being in a coastal county or not highlighting an awareness of risk associated with proximity to flooding and storm surge events, particularly when adjacent sites have experienced damages from these hazards. High positive correlations between sites within a storm surge boundary, flooding or with potential for storm surge damages reflect the risk of proximity to previous flooding or storm surge events. 8 Cross tabulations is another way of analyzing relationships between two or more variables. The pilot study analyzed a survey among real estate students and LIHTC stakeholders using this method. Crosstabs developed during the pilot were analyzed at the county level in relation to storm surge and flood zone. The final survey was more comprehensive and asked respondents as series of questions relating to preferences for subsidies and development decision-making. Cross tabulations were extracted with data that included funding and location variables on either a 7-point Likert scale or a 10-point sliding scale. For each data set the expected cell count was <5 signaling that the statistic was not valid. For instance, crosstabs on funding preferences and location by company type (for-profit/non-profit) resulted in 18 cells that had expected counts that are <5 indicating no relationship between non-profit and for-profit groups.

One respondent According to recent studies (Greene, 1992;Comerio et al., 1994;Finch et al., 2010) (Fritz et al., 2008).  On average, 3,000 units per year were placed in service in coastal counties between 2006 and 2010.  In Phase II, developers stated a preference to develop LIHTC away from the coast and hazards associated with storm surge. Coastal population in the U.S. has outpaced inland population growth with the expectation that growth will continue for the foreseeable future (Crowell et al, 2010). The hazards of coastal development are documented in Chapter 1, and Phase II reiterated an understanding of the potential hazards to LIHTC.

Charlotte County is at risk for fewer units, but the 1,399 units at risk are 94% of the total LIHTC stock in the county (Figure 5-13).

This study undertook LIHTC risk from a social constructivist paradigm that reflects the experience and expertise of multiple stakeholders. This study recognizes the risks to people who live in LIHTC units subject to storm surge hazards by identifying the number of people at risk in Category 3 and Category 5 hurricanes. Others have identified those groups most at risk within the characteristics related to economic, gender, race, and age (Cutter and Emrich, 2006;Fothergill and Peek, 2004). These are among the households that rely on the affordable rents available through the LIHTC program. Many of the solutions provided in the context of this research address the LIHTC industry specifically as well as steps that can be taken to protect those households living in LIHTC situated in storm surge boundaries. This purpose of this chapter is to present some concluding thoughts and recommendations for stakeholders of affordable housing in general, and specifically for disaster recovery."}, {"section_title": "6-1: Comparison of Phases I, II and III", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A BRIEF REVIEW", "text": "In Chapter 2, the concept of risk as a social science was introduced. According to Bradbury (1989), this is where cooperative decision-making occurs. The affordable housing literature amplifies the voices of the low and moderate income population. We know that people who suffer in poverty suffer more during disaster recovery. We know that housing cost burdens plague owners and renters alike regardless of income. We are aware that nearly 35% of households are renters, and many of these spend more than half their income on rent (JCHS, 2013). Over 12% of the population lives in multifamily housing. Less than 15% of these developments are funded using the LIHTC. Even though most LIHTC households have higher incomes relative to those in other subsidized housing, nearly half the tenants have extremely low incomes and pay more than 30% of their income on rent. In spite of a developer's ability to acquire additional incentives for development, the program does little to offset cost burdens for most households. Disaster exacerbates affordability, especially when affordable housing shortages existed prior to a disaster event (Comerio, 1997;Levine et al, 2007;Reece et al, 2011). Recovery is well understood to perpetuate rental housing shortages as redevelopment brings an influx of workers. Development costs increase when land, labor and material are in greater demand. Redevelopment brings the promise of a better community with better technology. However, limited resources require that choices must be made. Affordable housing advocates argue that poverty solutions, such as HOPE VI and mixed income development, fail to provide sufficient quantities of affordable housing (Geotz, 2004;McCarthy and Hanson, 2008;Unity, 2010). Others point to private market solutions, such as vouchers, to suggest otherwise (Vuk, 2008). LIHTC has faced criticism for its failure to provide housing for extremely low income households in general and during disaster recovery (Hooks and Miller, 2006). This study began by recognizing the inability of multifamily owners to bring affordable properties online and sought to ask the question 'why'. The following sections discuss these questions and the broader implications of the study on the industry, policy, and disaster theory. The framework identified multiple stakeholders from four areas: housing producers (LIHTC for this study), advocacy groups speaking for tenants and low-income households, public policy identified through QAP analysis, and the merging of housing policy and disaster recovery in the wake of the 2004 hurricane season in Florida. The following sets of questions were selected to guide the research: Chapter 5 identified studies of storm surge effects for specific areas (Fritz, 2008) and applying values to estimate potential losses (CoreLogic, 2011 This study does not presume to be a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, but does attempt to place an estimate of value on LIHTC at risk. Over $123 million was allocated for coastal LIHTC from 2008 to 2010 accounting for 85% of total allocations across the state. The estimated value of coastal LIHTC within a Category 3 storm surge is more than $900 million. A Category 5 storm puts nearly $2 billion in LIHTC at risk. Either one of these events has the potential to wipe out taxpayer supported affordable housing investment. It would seem that implementing a system to identify storm surge properties is a cost effective policy that could effectively reduce potential damages during disaster benefiting property owners, taxpayers, insurance companies, and tenants. Future studies are needed for a more robust valuation of LIHTC units. In summary, developers stated a preference for development on non-hazardous sites but Phase III results revealed the majority of LIHTC continue to be developed on the coast. Population growth is a major driver for coastal development, so it is inevitable that more LIHTC or other affordable housing will be needed in coastal counties. Policy drives development, which means it will be up to policymakers at all levels of government to control development in hazardous storm surge areas."}, {"section_title": "POLICY IMPLICATIONS", "text": "The findings of this research suggest that policy drives LIHTC development. Market forces also influence where LIHTC development is needed due to economic development and coastal population trends. Coastal population is expected to continue in an upward growth for the foreseeable future which means that policy and market forces are likely to support LIHTC growth in hazardous coastal communities. Potential costs for at risk development suggest that an assessment should be undertaken to identify solutions to mitigate risks for public and private interests. As more is learned about the impact of climate change on coastal systems, it has become obvious that a concerted effort should be made to identify risks and adopt policies for adaptation and risk reduction techniques. Studies for adaptation and mitigation come primarily from the climate change literature. For the most part, the literature is largely conceptual. However recent studies are beginning to identify specific techniques and policy ideas. Disaster risk reduction is defined by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) as \"the conceptual framework of elements considered with the possibilities to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development.\" Risk reduction identified in this study includes development in low hazard areas, low cost grants and loans for production, and additional tax credits to aid in production. Policy measures can be tied to these programs to implement adaptation and mitigation techniques for existing and new LIHTC development. According to the Stockholm Environment Institute, adaptation is an ongoing, reiterative six stage process that includes \"information development, awareness raising, planning, design, implementation, and monitoring\" (Dougherty and Fencl, 2008, p. 38). Adaptation is \"anything that reduces the negative effects of climate change\" including minimizing exposure (Langis, 2013 quoting Warren andEgginton, 2008, p. 6). Adaptation and risk reduction are methods toward resiliency (Hamin and Gurran, 2009). Tol et al. (2008) define adaptation as \"the planned or unplanned, reactive or anticipatory, successful or unsuccessful response of a system to a change in its environment\" (p. 432). Adaptation has evolved from the initial idea that mitigation would be sufficient to curtail the impact of climate change. Early literature focused on hard-and soft-structural techniques such as barricades and seawalls, beach nourishment, and strategic retreat (London and Volont\u00e9, 1991). Klein et al (1999) stressed the importance of coastal adaptation through an iterative four-step process that includes data collection and raising awareness, identifying planning and design strategies, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The first decade of 2000 saw increased calls for using technology to educate multiple stakeholders about the need to reduce coastal vulnerability to the effects of climate change (Klein et al, 2001;Adger et al, 2005). Since then more attention has been given to the benefit of regional cooperation and identifying specific techniques for adaptation and risk reduction. Specific tools to enhance resilience include taking action at local and regional scales and avoid incentives that increase hazardous conditions (Adger et al., 2005). Jacob, Gornitz and Rosenzweig (2007) identified structural and non-structural solutions to reduce risk. Structural solutions such as constructing artificial barriers and other physical defenses continue to be put forward. Non-structural solutions involve policy initiatives to curtail growth in hazardous sites. Some of these solutions address impending sea-level rise, but are also useful for reducing risk associated coastal hazards in general. The remainder of this chapter will offer recommendations stemming from this study to address risks for existing and proposed LIHTC development."}, {"section_title": "ADDRESSING LIHTC FUNDING AND STORM SURGE HAZARDS", "text": "This study suggested that policy influences development decisions. Policy will be the driving force to mitigate hazardous effects with adaptation and risk reduction techniques. Technical guidelines presented by the IPCC have been accused of providing little usable information for policy makers, questioning the capacity to adapt given available resources and political will (Carter, et al, 1994). Tol et al. (2008) suggest that vulnerability is determined by the capacity to adapt (p.434). Options for adaptation are of little consequence if the capacity to employ them is out of reach. Recommendations for adaptive and risk reduction measures resulting from this study attempt to be cognizant of the adaptive capacity for implementation specific to industry, and policies at local, state, and federal levels."}, {"section_title": "LIHTC Risk Reduction -Industry", "text": "The LIHTC industry has a responsibility to identify and promote strategies to reduce risk for existing building stock and mitigate risk for future development. In the case of LIHTC, there is also the human factor and responsibility for those being served under the program. This study identified stated preferences of LIHTC professionals acknowledging location risk relative to the coast and storm surge. Revealed preferences identified a significant number of LIHTC units in storm surge areas. Three steps are recommended at the industry level to address LIHTC risk reduction: 1) Identify LIHTC inventory situated in storm surge boundaries in order to determine existing risk. 2) Mitigate potential damages by purchasing flood insurance for existing properties located in storm surge areas. 3) Analyze proposed sites for storm surge hazards during the pre-construction phase of development. These three steps require the industry to take proactive steps to insure LIHTC developments are located in areas less vulnerable to flooding associated with storm surge.

It is this level of government that faces the immediate threat to its population and existing development. Policy measures and adequate enforcement from local government are essential for implementing actions that support risk reduction. Three recommendations for risk reduction from local government include: 1) Provide public access to storm surge models in county geographic information systems. 2) When considering approval for a local LIHTC development, require that the extent of storm surge hazard related to the proposed site be identified. 3) Develop inter-agency policies addressing site risk of developments within storm surge areas. As stated in Chapter 3, local government is required to approve a specific LIHTC development before an application is filed with the housing authority. This places some responsibility for hazard mitigation in the lap of local government. 2) Create disaster bonds targeted for LIHTC as an additional subsidy for LIHTC development in non-hazardous areas."}, {"section_title": "LIHTC Risk Reduction -Federal Government", "text": "The federal government has relinquished much of its capacity for action to the state level in recent years.

Affordable housing is just one of the many disciplines that contribute to this emerging theory. The findings from this study point to the significance of policy in decision-making for private production of affordable multifamily housing.

Additional research is needed to determine the per unit value of LIHTC units. Current valuation studies are formulated from national sales through private companies, only one of which was utilized in this work (Tax Credit Group, 2014). A more robust study of LIHTC valuations is needed to understand the scope of potential losses at local, state, regional and national levels. The study of LIHTC and disaster could also benefit from an expansion of the survey used in this study after some modifications. While surveys could be conducted on a state by state basis, this practice is impractical because of the number of national companies participating in the field. The survey used in this study is not designed for other disaster types. Any future survey should focus on disaster recovery associated with hurricanes in coastal states. This study did little to identify similarities and differences between for profit and non-profit LIHTC producers. Additional research can utilize the methods from this study to identify how for-profit and non-profit companies are influenced by risk in their development decisions. In the future, the survey can be revised to allow for cross tabulations between for-profit and non-profit LIHTC. Statistical analysis using GIS also has the capability of categorizing risk by for-profit and non-profit entities. These steps are important to understand how business structure affects risk taking and if partnerships between the two types of entities results in less risk to LIHTC units and the households that inhabit them."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study was built from a concern for the failure of disaster recovery to solve affordable housing problems during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery is a redevelopment opportunity that incorporates competing needs given available resources. Unfortunately, just as renters fall behind homeowners in disaster assistance, affordable multifamily housing owners also find it difficult to obtain sufficient funding to participate fully in recovery. This study focused specifically on the LIHTC industry which faces fewer barriers to recovery, but is influenced by policy. Policy drives the LIHTC industry by driving competition through limiting tax credits available at the federal level. State and local level preferences impact funding and location. LIHTC producers are well informed of coastal risks and have indicated a preference to avoid hazardous conditions. LIHTC placed in service between 2004 and 2010 are predominantly in coastal areas in Florida, and some developments are located within hazardous storm surge boundaries. The financial risks associated with these properties are significant and warrant consideration of efforts to adapt and improve resiliency. This study specifically identified risks for LIHTC in Florida and does not pretend to be significant to any other coastal state. More in depth studies are needed to identify specific risks to each county within the state. Case studies for other coastal states can begin the process of identifying storm surge hazards affecting affordable housing of all types at local, state, and regional levels so that adaptive management can effectively respond in case of disaster. This study provides a foundation for policy makers, affordable housing advocates and producers to identify and support measures that will provide sufficient numbers of affordable housing in safer areas on the coast not only during disaster recovery, but in the general sphere of affordable housing and coastal development.
