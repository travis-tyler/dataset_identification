If novel successful therapeutic approaches do not become available, the number of patients with AD is expected to rise from 4.5 million in 2000 to 13.2 million in 2050 in the United States alone (Cummings, 2004; Hebert et al., 2003) . The annual cost of care for AD patients worldwide is estimated at $83.9 billion (in 1996 US dollars) and will continue to increase with the rising prevalence of AD (Cummings, 2004; Wimo and Winblad, 2001) . The predictions of significant limitations in healthcare resources for elderly care in the near future underscore the pressing need for understanding the pathophysiology of AD and more effective therapies.\nThe rare variants of early-onset familial AD have been attributed to autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein genes, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 (Bertram and Tanzi, 2008) . The genetics of late onset, sporadic AD are much less clear. Family history is the second greatest risk factor for sporadic AD after age (Tanzi and Bertram, 2001) . Having a first-degree relative with AD increases one's risk for AD 4 -10 fold (Cupples et al., 2004; Green et al., 2002; Mosconi et al., 2009; Silverman et al., 2005) suggesting a significant genetic component to the sporadic form of the disease. The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene has repeatedly demonstrated a strong association with late onset AD, but its prevalence of 40%-70% in the AD population suggests that additional genetic risk factors will be discovered (Bertram and Tanzi, 2009; Seripa et al., 2009; Slooter et al., 1998) . Several genome-wide association studies have reported other candidate AD-associated genes that warrant further exploration (Bertram and Tanzi, 2009; Li et al., 2006; Rogaeva et al., 2007; Sundar et al., 2007) . At the same time, epidemiologic studies have suggested that subjects with maternal history of AD have increased risk of developing the disease (Edland et al., 1996; Ehrenkrantz et al., 1999; Green et al., 2002) . The Framingham Offspring study reported that middle-aged individuals with AD-affected mothers show deficient neuropsychological test performance compared with those with AD-affected fathers and those lacking parental history of AD (Wolf et al., 2005) . Recently Mosconi et al. reported that relative to subjects with no paternal history of AD those with maternal history of AD not only show decreased glucose uptake in ADvulnerable regions on positron emission tomography (PET) examination cross-sectionally (Mosconi et al., 2007) but also exhibit progressive decline in glucose uptake in these regions over time ). In addition, two recent structural MRI studies examined the effect of parental history of dementia on hippocampal and total brain volume (Debette et al., 2009 ) and gray matter volume (Honea et al., 2010) . The larger study (Debette et al., 2009 ) reported no effect of history of parental dementia on hippocampal and total brain volume at baseline, or on total brain volume and hippocampal atrophy rates, in cognitively normal subjects. No significant associations were detected after stratification for ApoE4 status as well as for maternal/ paternal history of dementia. The smaller study (Honea et al., 2010) likewise studied the effect of maternal and paternal history of AD on brain structure in cognitively normal elderly. They found significantly smaller inferior frontal, middle frontal, inferior temporal, and precuneal gray matter volumes, but no effect on hippocampal volume.\nHere we wanted to further explore the effect of maternal history of dementia on the hippocampus, an area affected early by AD pathology. We hypothesized that maternal history of dementia would be associated with greater hippocampal atrophy relative to that seen in groups of subjects with paternal or no parental history of dementia."}, {"section_title": "List of important abbreviations", "text": "\"MH\" denotes maternal history. \"PH\" denotes paternal history. \"MH\u03e9/PHany\" denotes positive maternal history of dementia (including subjects with positive and negative paternal history of dementia).\n\"MHany/PH\u03e9\" denotes positive paternal history of dementia (including subjects with positive and negative maternal history of dementia). \"MH\u03ea/PHany\" denotes negative maternal history of dementia (including subjects with positive and negative paternal history of dementia). \"MHany/PH\u03ea\" denotes negative paternal history of dementia (including subjects with positive and negative maternal history of dementia). \"MH\u03e9/PH\u03e9\" denotes positive maternal and paternal history of dementia. \"MH\u03e9/PH\u03ea\" denotes positive maternal and negative paternal history of dementia. \"MH\u03ea/PH\u03ea\" denotes no maternal and no paternal history of dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Intitiative (ADNI) is a large scale multi-site longitudinal study collecting detailed clinical, imaging, and laboratory data from 200 normal control (NC), 400 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 200 AD subjects at multiple time points over a 4-year period (Mueller et al., 2005) (also see http://www. loni.ucla.edu/ADNI and ADNI-info.org). ADNI's goal is to establish risk factors associated with cognitive decline from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD, as well as to assist the development of sensitive disease-specific biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of effective therapeutic agents for AD. All ADNI participants were 55-90 years old at the time of enrollment. Subjects were excluded if they had any significant neurologic disease other than AD, abnormal baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or contraindications to MRI, psychiatric disorder, alcohol or substance abuse or dependency within the last 2 years, and medical illnesses that could affect cognition or protocol compliance. Other grounds for exclusion were residence in a skilled nursing facility, use of psychoactive medications other then certain antidepressants, warfarin, or investigational agents.

Subjects with MCI had memory complaints and scored below age-and education-adjusted norms on Logical Memory II subscale from Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. The MMSE scores of MCI subjects at baseline were between 24 and 30 and their global CDR was 0.5. General cognition and sufficiently preserved activities of daily living precluding diagnosis of AD were also required for the diagnosis of MCI. ADNI enrolled mildly affected AD subjects who met the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984) . AD subjects had MMSE scores between 20 and 26 and CDR of 0.5 or 1.\nThe present study used ADNI baseline and 1-year follow-up cognitive and imaging data of 243 amnestic MCI, 96 AD, and 145 NC subjects. Subjects were stratified based on their family history of dementia collected through self-report. Out of 484 subjects, 68 (14%) reported paternal (MHany/PH\u03e9) and 167 (35%) maternal history (MH\u03e9/PHany) of dementia. One hundred fortynine subjects had maternal but not paternal history of dementia (MH\u03e9/PH\u03ea). Fifty subjects had paternal but not maternal history of dementia (MH\u03ea/PH\u03e9). Eighteen subjects had both maternal and paternal history of dementia (MH\u03e9/PH\u03e9) and 267 had neither maternal nor paternal history of dementia (MH\u03ea/PH\u03ea)."}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition and preprocessing", "text": "All subjects were scanned at 1.5 T magnetic field strength, on scanners from 1 of 3 manufacturers (General Electric Healthcare, Siemens Medical Solutions, and Philips Medical Systems) with a scanner-specific standardized MRI protocol (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/ index.shtml) Leow et al., 2006) . The TE/TR/TI (echo, repetition, and inversion time) parameters were set of optimize contrast with noise in a feasible acquisition time.

The ADNI MRI quality control center reviewed each scan (including T2-weighted and proton density scans) for structural abnormalities such as cortical or subcortical strokes, significant white matter ischemic changes, focal lesions, etc. Subjects in whom structural abnormalities were found were excluded from participation.

The AdaBoost segmentation method is a machine learning algorithm that applies a pattern recognition approach to a training dataset consisting of a small number of manually traced structures of interest to develop a set of segmentation rules for extracting the structures of interest (in our case the hippocampi) from unfamiliar images while minimizing global error. AdaBoost iteratively develops and tests a set of rules for combining thousands of voxel-wise imaging features, such as intensity, stereotaxic positions, tissue classification, local curvatures, gradients, and filters into a segmentation algorithm that can optimally segment the training dataset and ultimately unknown images. Our training dataset consisted of the manual hippocampal traces of 21 randomly chosen ADNI subjects (7 NC, 7 MCI, and 7 AD) created by a single human expert (AEG, intrarater reliability Cronbach's alpha \u03ed 0.98) following a widely used and extensively validated hippocampal tracing protocol (Narr et al., 2004) . The final AdaBoost classification algorithm was then applied to the full imaging dataset consisting of 484 baseline and 484 follow-up scans. AdaBoost has been previously validated and its segmentation output agrees with human raters as well as human raters agree with each other (Morra et al., 2008a) .\nAfter hippocampal segmentation the left and right hippocampal volumes were computed and retained for future statistical analyses. Hippocampal segmentations were converted into 3-dimensional (3D) parametric meshes.

In a follow-up study, the authors demonstrated progressive decline in posterior cortical glucose uptake in those with a maternal history of AD ). The authors hypothesized that the observed differences may potentially reflect increased AD vulnerability in the offspring of female AD subjects. This theory can be tested only after prospective follow-up of large cohorts of subjects with and without parental history of AD and after assessing progression to AD. Other approaches using pre-existing longitudinal datasets such as the ADNI data as we have done here can examine evidence to support or refute this hypothesis.\nHippocampal atrophy is a well-established early imaging marker of AD (Apostolova et al., 2006a (Apostolova et al., , 2006b De Leon et al., 1997; Henneman et al., 2009; Jack et al., 1998 Jack et al., , 2000 . The factors that determine the rate of hippocampal atrophy are not yet completely understood. Recently several computational anatomy techniques have been successfully employed in predicting and tracking AD progression in vivo Apostolova et al., 2006b Apostolova et al., , 2009 Csernansky et al., 2000; Morra et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003) . Here we used the radial distance mapping technique and conventional volumetric analyses to investigate the effects of MH and PH on hippocampal atrophy in a large ADNI cohort spanning the spectrum from normal aging to mild AD. As hypothesized, MH was associated with greater hippocampal atrophy in both the volumetric and 3D radial distance analyses independently of ApoE4 genotype and PH. As others have reported, we found no effect of maternal history of dementia on hippocampal volume in NC (Debette et al., 2009; Honea et al., 2010) . PH showed no effect on hippocampal volume or radial distance. In agreement with previous reports we also found significant independent effects of ApoE4 genotype on hippocampal volume in MCI and AD (Fleisher et al., 2005; Mueller and Weiner, 2009; Mueller et al., 2008; van de Pol et al., 2007) .\nWe observed a negative MH effect in the pooled sample, and in MCI, but not in AD and NC. Others have also found no effect of maternal history of dementia on hippocampal volume in NC (Debette et al., 2009; Honea et al., 2010 ), yet metabolic differences have been seen in the NC stage (Mosconi et al., 2007 . It is now well accepted that metabolic changes generally precede structural ones (Jack et al., 2010) . The fact that we observe no effect in the AD group may be a true observation but it may also result from the smaller sample size of AD subjects (AD n \u03ed 96 as opposed to MCI n \u03ed 243). The latter possibility is also supported by the fact that absolute differences of approximately the same magnitude are present in AD subjects both at baseline and at follow-up, as demonstrated by the percentage maps in Fig. 2 .\nOur findings suggest that MH indirectly influences brain structure and that this effect is independent of PH and ApoE4 genotype. This unique predisposition may be mediated by X chromosome (Kehoe et al., 1999; Zubenko et al., 1998) or mitochondrial DNA susceptibility genes (Mancuso et al., 2008; Onyango et al., 2006; Schapira, 2006) . The theory of causative mitochondrial DNA alterations is especially compelling as a decline in mitochondrial respiratory function invariably leads to metabolic disruption, increased generation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced apopotosis (Lin and Beal, 2006) , cell loss, and brain atrophy, all of which occur in AD (Markesbery, 1997) .\nAlthough the main effect of MH on hippocampal volume was in the negative direction, the 3D maps showed some areas with positive association. 3D hippocampal mapping is an advanced method that allows us to examine disease effects in far greater detail than hippocampal volumetry and has the capability of demonstrating subtle regional effects. Diseases, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, etc., can affect the hippocampal subregions differentially and can show an anterior/posterior effect gradient (reflecting the very complex hippocampal structure and connectivity). Such complex interactions cannot be visualized with simple volumetric measures but are easily discernible with more complex imaging protocols.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of parental history affecting hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD subjects. Several strengths and limitations of our study need to be recognized. The strengths include the selection of a well-established, large, prospectively collected and exceptionally well-characterized longitudinal subject sample for our analyses and the use of an advanced hippocampal ana- Fig. 2 .

Several limitations of the study should be considered. First, in ADNI, parental history of dementia is provided by subject self-report. This ascertainment method is inferior to definite neuropathologic diagnosis, although more practical to perform. Prevalence rates recorded via self-report are frequently lower than the true prevalence due to poor recollection, uncertainty about parental medical history, denial, or data censoring due to early parental death. We chose to use the parental history of dementia variable as opposed to the parental history of AD variable, as in many instances the etiology of parental dementia was never recorded. This likely led to the inclusion of some subjects with parental non-AD dementia, such as vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson's disease dementia. Both limitations may have influenced our analyses by reducing our power to detect the presence or true extent of the parental history effect in AD. It could be argued that focusing on history of AD might give clearer and more interpretable results than combining people at risk for different dementia subtypes, including forms of dementia not so strongly associated with hippocampal atrophy. For example, there might be a grouping bias, as men tend to develop strokes, vascular damage, and atherosclerosis more frequently than women, which may lead to PH more frequently reflecting vascular dementia than MH. If this were the case, then the lack of PH effects on hippocampal atrophy may be considered a false negative attributable to groupings based on nonspecific risk factors. Even so, the rationale for using \"family history of dementia\" instead of \"family history of AD\" was based on the number of subjects with available positive parental history in each diagnostic group. For example, in the MCI category there were 35 subjects with paternal history of dementia but only 16 with paternal history of AD. Similarly there were 81 MCI subjects with maternal history of dementia but only 46 with maternal history of AD. In our center, and perhaps in general, the variable parental diagnosis of AD is marked as positive only when the diagnosis has been pathologically ascertained. As AD is the most common dementia etiology-found in about 3/4 of dementia subjects post mortem-we would estimate that around 26 out of 35 subjects' fathers with dementia, and 61 out of 81 subjects' mothers with dementia would have AD pathology. As such, the \"family history of dementia\" variable allows us to develop a sample large enough to have sufficient statistical power, based on potentially more reliable information. This is because the level of ascertainment (pathological validation vs. diagnosis rendered by neurologist/ geriatric psychiatrist/geriatrician vs. diagnosis rendered by internal medicine/family practice clinician) is likely highly variable for multicenter data.\nAs only a portion of MCI patients have underlying AD as the cause of their cognitive impairment it remains to be determined if those MCI patients with a maternal history of dementia are more likely to progress to AD. The documented parentally determined difference in AD predisposition in offspring of parents with AD is interesting and warrants further exploration."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no potential financial or personal conflicts of interest including relationships with other people or organizations within 3 years of beginning the work submitted that could inappropriately influence their work."}]
