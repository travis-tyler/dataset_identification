[{"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "Levee failure due to scouring has been a prominent occurrence among intense storm surges and waves, giving rise to the implementation of various scour protection measures over the years. Several experiments were performed on a model levee on either bare levee soil or with a scour protection measure covering the soil. The purpose of this study is to breakdown the dynamics of levee scour due to overtopping waves and suggest efficient methods in reducing the amount of scour. The levee soil was made up of a sandclay mixture and placed in a laboratory wave tank that created a constant wave overtopping simulation that mimics the field. The scour length was found to reach equilibrium before scour depth. Parameterizations were developed for values of maximum scour depth and scour length while reaching equilibrium and at equilibrium. From these equations, the maximum scour depth and scour length in the field can be calculated with knowledge of the densimetric Froude Number value. The riprap cover layer proved to be more effective than the coreloc cover layer. The presence of an underlayer proved to take precedence, however, on the overall effectiveness of the both protection measure types. It is recommended that the placement and size distribution of the underlayer be adjusted in the field to take advantage of its efficiency and receive economical advantages. iii Since having the privilege to be advised and guided by him throughout my graduate studies, I have been positively pushed to learn more and seek answers for natural disaster problems that arise throughout the world. His knowledge on coastal protection structures gave a major contribution to my understanding the purpose and direction of this thesis. I would also like to thank my co-advisor Dr. Nadarajah Ravichandran. He was also a large contributor to my undergraduate coursework. He was one of the main teachers that pushed me to think about why engineering principles work like they do. His constant gift of asking unique questions to the student did wonders for me in my graduate research. His expertise in the geotechnical field gave me an advantage in understanding the physical makeup of levee soil and the dynamics of scour. Another acknowledgement goes to Dr. Paul Zielenski for his help in the laboratory and for his contribution from his knowledge of levees and their presence in coastal protection matters. Another acknowledgement is for John Schooler for his daily help in the laboratory and his constant encouragement. Constructing the levee and the experiments in the wave tank were a two-man job, and he went above and beyond to see that accomplished our goal.    Marcos et al., 2011;Bengtsson et al., 1996;Elsner, 1999). Goldenberg et al., (2001) states that this intensification trend will continue to increase for approximately the next 10-40 years, at the least. This increase has been recorded in areas other than the United States (Irish et al., 2010;Karim and Mimura, 2008). One of the most well-known failures of coastal protection structures occurred in the 2005 Hurricane Katrina storm surge in New Orleans, Louisiana (Briaud et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Sieve analysis of the riprap covering", "text": "During a storm surge there is greater likelihood of extreme flooding in coastal areas. This phenomenon is exacerbated when the storm surge coincides with normal high tide, resulting in storm tides reaching up to 6 meters or more in some cases (NOAA, 2010). These pose a great threat to human life, property damage, ecosystems, and economic stability of a land mass near coastal areas. Floodwall overtopping is a root component that can lead to levee breaching and eventual failure. During the overtopping process the wave is in turbulent motion, which is fundamental cause of the high velocities and sporadic flow regime (Xiao, 2009). The geometry, amplitude and frequency, of overtopping waves in the field during an entire storm is not yet practical to predict. This is partly due to wave reflection, wind and pressure differences, and rainfall fluctuations. Through numerical simulations, Briaud et al. (2008) found that the wave velocity and shear stress reaches its highest values on the landward-side of a levee during overtopping. For this reason, there is significant scour potential on the levee soil directly landward of the floodwall. Sediment scour around protective coastal structures is the primary component that attributes to the weakening of that structure, and sometimes failure over time. Scour among various types of obstructions is a widely researched topic, with some of the first studies of scouring, at piers and spur-dikes, dating back to Ahmad (1953), Garde et al. (1961), and Gill (1972). During a storm surge event, high velocity flows can erode material from the sea-side or land-side of the levee, which may lead to instability and failure. Erosion can occur at once, or over time, depending on the storm characteristics. Scour geometry varies according to the intensity of the waves both in the absence of and in the presence of a storm surge. Other parameters include the structure's height, emerged length of the structure, the flow depth, and the sediment characteristics (Elawady et al., 2001;Young and Testik, 2009). Levee failure may be precipitated by structural failure, underseepage, piping, surface erosion, and/or overtopping scour (Seed et al., 2006;IPET, 2006). This research focuses solely on scour due to floodwall overtopping waves on the landside of the leveefloodwall structure. Levee scour by overtopping has recently been the subject of research projects; including laboratory tests using wave tanks, real-situation field tests, and numerical simulations. In an analysis of the New Orleans levee failures (Sills et al., 2008), it was noted that the extent of breaching and overtopping scour was a function of soil type and compaction effort applied to the levee fill material, as well as the intensity of the storm surge, wave action, and overtopping. When the overtopping waves impact the ground surface on the protected side, an eddy forms. Scouring occurs from each wave impact until an equilibrium depth is reached (Setia, 2008;Laursen and Toch, 1956;Hanson and Cook, 2004). The formation of an eddy, from overtopping, contributes to the high velocity and shear stress (Xiao et al., 2009) that eventually lifts the sediment particles causing scour. When the shear stresses are higher than the critical shear stress for the soils, scour holes begin to form at the toe of the landward side of the levee. Though scour protection measures are particularly important for robust levee designs and retrofitting, many of those thus far developed have been either more costly or more labor intensive than the ideal design. For example, when concrete is used to cover levee soil it protects the soil better than the soil itself. It is also however, more costly and less aesthetically pleasing. Though T-Walls are an alternative type for a floodwall structure, they are also more costly. Some protection measures (not specific for levees) consisting of armoring units, vegetation, scour mats, and geotextile bags, however, have proven to be remarkably efficient. Armoring units currently in use include riprap, corelocs, tetrapods, cable-tied blocks, grout and/or sand filled bags, concrete mattresses, and concrete aprons. Vegetation methods entail the use of certain natural grass types, reinforced grass systems, and geosynthetic grass layers."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The objectives of this study of scour due to overtopping were to (1) characterize the scour evolution dynamics and equilibrium scour characteristics for predictive capabilities and (2) accurately assess the relative effectiveness of two distinct protective armoring-unit types and altering them with a gravel-sized underlayer to form a total of four different protection measures. The four protection measures were riprap with and without an underlayer, and corelocs with and without an underlayer."}, {"section_title": "Thesis Outline", "text": "This thesis begins with a literature review, in Chapter 2, that breakdowns the different aspects of a storm surge, overtopping waves and levee scour.

The chapter is split into components that are tied to these coastal structures. Levees are coastal, or river, embankments that regulate water levels and prevent flooding, by overflow, during a storm surge. They are usually found in low-lying areas and in many coastal cities. The size of a levee varies according to the level of storms the area receives. This chapter will address the different types of failures that are attributed to levees; explaining how, when, and why failure occurs. When working properly, levees allow coastal communities to work more efficiently without fear of flooding."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "In coastal matters, a storm surge poses as the greatest threat to human life, property damage, ecosystems, and economic stability from a hurricane. Since much of the United States' densely populated Atlantic and Gulf Coast coastlines are less than 3meters above sea level, the danger from a possible storm surge is overwhelming. Since 2004, the United States has experienced some of its highest hurricane surges on record by Hurricanes Ike, Ivan, and Katrina, and Rita (Irish et al., 2010). With an extremely high storm surge and energetic waves, Hurricane Katrina reached a maximum surge height of 8.5meters in some areas (National Hurricane Center, 2005). In turn, there were an estimated 1,836 fatalities and $156 billion in damages (Burton and Hicks, 2005). This literature review focuses on the impacts of storm surges on levee overtopping, sediment scour, and eventual foundation and structural failure, followed by countermeasures. A storm surge is the beginning factor that must be looked into in order to better understand and to reduce the effects of overtopping and, eventually, levee scour.\nIn the presence of a storm surge there needs to be a protective structure in place to resist the chances of disaster flooding. Throughout history, human life and communities living near water has been a natural and repeated occurrence (Grey and Sadoff, 2006). transitions (Griffis, 2007 andASCE, 2009). An example of a usual levee system is seen in Figure 2  In spite of billions of dollars invested in flood alleviation projects, particularly levees, the maintenance and safety efficiency has not been what it is perceived to be. This skewed perception has population growth and infrastructure behind levees at high flood risks. FEMA estimates that forty-three percent of the U.S. population lives in counties with levees (FEMA, 2006). In the case of a storm surge disaster, a great number of lives are at risk. In  \nCoastal protection failure has been a prominent occurrence among intense storm surges and can date back for many years. Under the failure of coastal protection systems, there lies great potential for life loss and catastrophic community and property damage. The scale at which the effect that failure has on the surrounding community depends on the intensity of the storm surge, the strength of the levee or other coastal structure, and the type of levee failure occurred. The consequences of intense storm surges have been better recorded in recent years due to improved technological methods, recording devices, and computerized simulations. In this section of the literature review, case histories will be given of various floodwall and levee failures in the United States.\nAs mentioned in the two preceding chapters, overtopping is the root component that leads to levee breaching and eventual failure. For years, wave overtopping in sea defenses has been a major research topic in the field of coastal engineering, with studies dating back to a study on the effect of wind-generated surface waves on the accuracy of flow measurements (Gibson, 1930). In recent years, sea levels have risen and wind speeds have increased causing there to be a need for either sea defenses to be strengthened or Taskforce, or IPET, which identified the causes of the system's poor performance during the storm. It was concluded that no levee failure occurred without overtopping (IPET, 2006). If the overtopping reduction ability of the HPS was equipped better than it was prior to the hurricane, a majority of the recovery efforts would have been reduced and the damage would have been limited.\nSediment scour around protective coastal structures is the main component that attributes to the weakening of that structure, and sometimes failure, over time. Scour among various types of obstructions has been an avid research topic and can date back many years. Studies of scouring at piers and spur-dikes date back to contributions made by Ahmad (1953), Garde (1961), and Gill (1972). Studies of scouring at bridge abutments date back to research done by Laursen and Sutherland (1960) and Melville (1988). Slightly more recent studies were performed for breakwater scouring by Irie and Nadaoka (1984) and Hsu et al. (1987). In the past, studies of levee scour have not been as prominent in engineering concerns. However, in recent years, partly due to the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, studies of levee scour have increased in number, as seen with studies by Smith and P\u00e9rez-Arlucea (2008) and Briaud et al. (2008). Experience has shown that scouring can progressively weaken the foundation of protective coastal structures. Numerous studies have been performed in effort to better understand the principles and analysis of scouring and its various parameters. With more of this knowledge gained, more sustainable protection measures can be utilized and better resilient structures can be built.\nScour protection measures and their importance in coastal studies are just as important as studying the process of scouring itself. Some of the methods found thus far have been proven costly or require more work than ideally desired when employing them. Some methods, however, have proven a good level of efficiency. In spite of numerous investigations by many researchers, the problem of scouring has not been completely and effectively resolved as yet."}, {"section_title": "Definition", "text": "A storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas, particularly when the storm surge coincides with normal high tide, resulting in storm tides reaching up to 6meters or more in some cases (NOAA, 2010). This phenomenon happens primarily when a hurricane approaches land. Some hurricanes have winds that reach up to 160 kilometers per hour. They have the intensity needed to push large amounts of water towards the coastline, causing it to pile up to a new, elevated water level (Figure 2.1). \nDuring a storm surge event, high velocity flows can erode material from the sea-side or land-side of the levee, which may lead to instability and failure. Erosion can occur at once, or over time, as a function of the storm cycle and the scale of the peak storms. Briaud et al. (2008) go even deeper in the definition of scour, putting it in terms of the erodibility of a soil. Briaud defines it as the relationship between the erosion rate and the hydraulic shear stress applied by the wave at the water-soil boundary area. He found a trend of increasing erosion rate in accordance to increased shear stress. In the same study, Briaud performed 24 tests for a large scale correlation, splitting the erodibility up into different productivity levels (Figure). It can be seen, in Figure 2.10, that the levees that  "}, {"section_title": "Components", "text": "A storm surge can be split and examined into five different components or effects (Harris, 1963): \u2022 The pressure effect \u2022 The direct wind effect \u2022 The effect of the Earth's rotation \u2022 The effect of waves \u2022 The rainfall effect During a storm event, as in a hurricane for instance, the low pressure areas cause a rise in sea level beneath the storm. In the areas of high pressure the sea level decreases ( Figure   2.2). This rise and fall causes the total pressure to remain constant as long as there is no restriction to the flow of water into the low-pressure region. The wind component causes an effect known as the Ekman Spiral (Ekman, 1905) to occur due to surface currents being perpendicular to the wind direction. The Ekman Spiral is inversely proportional to the total depth. Lastly, the wind stresses from the winds cause the water levels to increase at the \"head\" of the storm and decrease at the upwind shore, a process referred to as the wind set-up. This entire effect can also be seen in  The wind generates waves that have the ability to carry large amounts of water onshore during wave breaking. This ability increases with the more parallel the waves are to the shore. In turn, the water reaches high momentum levels and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking. Hurricanes may dump as much as 30cm of rainfall in 24 hours over large areas, and even more over areas of a few square miles. The rainfall effect is experienced mostly in estuaries. As a result, watersheds can quickly surge water into the rivers that drain them and increase the water level near the head of the tidal estuaries."}, {"section_title": "Factors", "text": "The maximum potential storm surge for a particular location depends on a number of factors. During the duration of a storm surge there is sensitivity to any change in storm intensity, forward speed, wind size, angle of approach to the coast, central pressure (minimal contribution in comparison to the wind), and the shape and characteristics of coastal features such as bays and estuaries. Other factors that can impact storm surge are the width and slope of the continental shelf. The shallower the slope the greater the storm surge and vice versa for a steep slope."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change", "text": "Recent catastrophic hurricanes have raised the question of the effects that climate change has on storm surges. There is understanding that climate change contributes to the possible sea level rise and intensification of hurricanes that can lead to increased hurricane flooding and damages. There has been much debate on this topic, both scientifically and politically. Scientists and researchers believe that the recent hurricane activity increase is simply due to variations to natural climate fluctuations (Goldenberg et al., 2001;Emanuel et al., 2008;Chan and Shi, 1996).   The black curve represents the 90% confidence interval. The red and green curves are the error bars denoting the 90% confidence interval.

However, there is potential barrier island degradation with sea level rise (Irish et al., 2010 SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a hurricane, storm size, the hurricane's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds (Jelesnianski et al., 1992). This model can be used in pre-impact planning and for use in evacuation purposes under a serious storm event.

Since historians began keeping records in 602 B.C., the river has changed its course 26 times and produced 1,500 floods that have killed millions of people. Periodically, people in the area experience catastrophic floods levels due to the banks being overflown. Large loads of silty sediment are constantly being transported throughout the river. Most of the sediment remains in the sea while the rest sticks to the river beds; which, in turn, causes the level of the river to rise. In 1887, the river topped 20-meter high levees and eventually traveled to the East China Sea and the Yangtze River (Hyndman and Hyndman, 2009). The flood and resultant famine caused over 1 million deaths. The government's focus since 1947 has been to control possible flooding by using dams and artificial levees.

The Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico has periodically inundated into the city and can date back to the 1700s. Therefore, flood protection has always been a major priority for the city. In 1965, after Hurricane Betsy, Congress authorized a flood protection plan submitted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, there was no major, disastrous storm event since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. In turn, the self-assurance of the city grew and they began to lack initiative in their degree of protection (Griffis, 2007). Both levee and floodwalls were overtopped during the Katrina storm surge. The storm surge exceeded the design height of the levee system. The lack of barrier islands and wetlands lessoned the ability of a natural resistance to take effect against the forces of the surge. Three breaches of the floodwall system at the Inter Harbor Navigation Channel were due to overtopping, according to the Independent Performance Evaluation Team (IPET, 2006), which caused scour to occur on the protected side. For the breached levees, it was found that 13% came from a result of overtopping during the storm event and the pumps not functioning well. The levees used in the New Orleans Hurricane Protection System were, in many places, constructed by filling them with hydraulic dredged materials that consisted of sand and shell material. This material proved to be easily eroded from the levee foundation during the storm surge. Some levee failure came from two different types of scour: scour on the channel-side and scour on the protected-side of the levee. Scour on the protected side formed gaps in the levee foundation that weakened the floodwalls, which were primarily I-wall structures. Formation of the gap increased the load on the wall, and also increased seepage rates. One task force of the IPET thoroughly examined six separate I-wall breaches and found that they failed before overtopping occurred. Therefore, it can be concluded that the failure came from scouring on the canal-side of the levee. The second type of scouring that occurred was scour due to overtopping, which occurred on the protected-side of the levee. An example of this is shown in Figure 2.8. Sixty-six percent of the levee and floodwall breaches were estimated to be a resultant of the scouring. The extent of erosion and scour, in comparing the floodwalls and levees, was similar in that the degree of erosion was controlled by the soil type and compaction of the soil material used against with the overtopping intensity.

The act of overtopping occurs when any amount of water passes over the crest of the protective structure that is in place. During the overtopping process the wave is in turbulent motion, which is fundamental cause of the high velocities and sporadic flow regime (Xiao, 2009). The 2011 (Akkerman et al., 2007). With this simulator, the overtopping discharge can be controlled and varied with different rates, along with the volumes, distributions, velocities, and flow depths (Van der Meer, 2006). This overtopping simulation breakthrough has been very beneficial in better understanding of the aspects of erosion at various overtopping rates."}, {"section_title": "Geometry and Components", "text": "As previously stated, the process of overtopping has a turbulent motion. The geometry of overtopping waves, as in their amplitude and frequency, during an entire storm is not yet practical to predict due to its sequencing irregularity. This irregularity is partly due to wave reflection. However, it was found, through numerical simulations, that the wave velocity and shear stress is at its highest values on the landward-side of a levee during overtopping (Briaud et al., 2008). As an overtopping wave passes over the crest onto the landward-side slope, it has a shape similar to that of a triangle. The discharge distribution throughout the wave is at a maximum value at the leading edge of the triangle and is several times greater than the time-averaged discharge. The resulting outcome is sediment erosion behind the protective structure. There are three types of levee overtopping that can occur during a storm surge: (1) irregular and unsteady-occurring overtopping of waves caused by the wind, while the SWL in beneath the levee crest; (2) storm surge overflow when the water level is above the levee crest; and (3) a combination of storm surge and wave overtopping when the SWL is above the levee crest. Overflow and overtopping are two different entities in that the overflow has a more steady motion and overtopping, as previously stated, has very unsteady tendencies. The combination of these two components creates the greatest damage to protective structures of the three types of overtopping."}, {"section_title": "Overtopping Process", "text": "During a storm surge, the overtopping process can be split into phases based on the overall time of its occurance. Figure 2.9 shows eight different phases, A-H, of the overtopping of a levee during a general storm surge. Phase A occurs towards the beginning of a storm when the SWL rises to the levee height elevation. As the storm continues, a single wave is formed and increases in height without breaking, as seen in Phase A and C. Eventually, the single wave will reach a level where it breaks and overtops the levee, as shown in Phase D. Figure 2.9: The history of an overtopping process using ADCIRC Program (courtesy Xiao et al., 2009) Phases E-H display the phenomenon that engineers desire to avoid. At this point the wave is at its highest velocity during the overtopping process up until it hits the ground with great intensity. When the wave impacts with the ground it diverts into different directions causing a swirling motion, known as an eddy in fluid dynamics. This high energy motion causes sediment scour in the area, leading to a gap behind the levee. This gap leads to breaching, causing even more overtopping."}, {"section_title": "Scour", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Geometry", "text": "The geometry of a scour hole due to floodwall overtopping consists of a U-shape scour evolution.

This diagnosis was for both levees and floodwalls that failed during the storm surge. Failure is known to first begin to occur on the land-side of an overtopped levee and gradually regresses toward the canal-side. Numerical simulations prove this fact in showing that the highest velocities and highest shear stresses are on the land-side of the levee during overtopping (Briaud et al., 2008). This high velocity forms an eddy, further explained in Chapter 3 (see Figure 3.1). The formation of this eddy contributes to the high velocity and shear stress that eventually lifts the sediment particles causing scour. Figure 2.12, given from Chen and Yu (2006) shows the shear stress distribution along a levee surface over time using CHEN3D (Chen, 2002), a 3-dimensional numerical computer program used to predict the level of erosion behavior of levees. The shear stresses upstream are shown to be extremely lower than those downstream of the levee due to the high water velocity and shallow water depth affected by the gravitational forces. When the shear stresses are higher than the critical shear stress for the soils, scour holes begin to occur at the toe of the downstream levee.

Several varied parameters can be used to describe the behavior of cohesive sediment, including shear stress, plasticity index, and bulk density.

A frequently accepted engineering method to deals with this damage is placing riprap stones around the foundation (Figure 2.15). Riprap is a rock, or another similar material, used to armor shorelines, streambeds, bridge abutments, and pilings. Riprap works by absorbing and deflecting the impact of a wave before the wave reaches the defended structure. The size and mass of the riprap material absorbs the impact energy of waves, while the gaps between the rocks trap and slow the flow of water, lessening its ability to erode soil used with a structure (CIRIA, 2007). The size of the rock should be large enough that it withstands the forces of wind and water directed at the slope. Geotextile soft mattresses, also seen in Figure 2.15, are sometimes used in accompanying riprap around spur-dikes (Yang et al., 2009). Geotextile material used with riprap allows water movement while preventing movement of soil particles. The geotextile supports tensile forces acting on it, making up for the fact that the soils and rocks would not be able to carry it. This is because the soil and rocks are only efficient in taking in and withstanding the comprehensive loadings of fluid action. There are several types of failure modes for riprap. This includes particle erosion, translation slide, and slump failure. Some reasons for these failures may be an inadequate size of riprap, internal slump failure, riprap with a high percentage of fines causing washing out of the fines, or the presence of excess hydrostatic (pore) pressure (Brice et al., 1978).

The falling head test validated that this ratio would be appropriate in minimizing the amount of seepage that a levee soil can legally permit (USACE 1999).

The still water level, SWL, was raised to the top of the floodwall. The levee soil was initially covered and prevented from being impacted by the waves at the beginning of each test. This was done because the first 30 seconds of waves are not greatly affected by reflection forces, causing a higher wave height than desired. After 30 seconds, reflection forces affected on the waves for the rest of the test, resulting in the desired wave heights. This was checked and confirmed by the wave gages. Sump pumps were used during the tests offshore of the levee to recirculate overtopped water back to the canalside of the levee so that the mean water level remained constant during the test. There were a total of seven different wave characteristics used.

Then, a given equilibrium scour characteristic can be expressed as follows.  , where w is the vertical velocity at the point of impact with the ground. Additionally, to analyze the time evolution of the scour characteristics, dimensionless time, t/t*, can be formed. Here, t* is the characteristic time for equilibrium scour formation (Voropayev et al. 2003) and is a function of wave frequency, \u03c9. Scaling is applied to undertake a laboratory study of the levee scour. The dimensions of the levee, the height of the floodwall, and the heights of the waves were reduced by a factor of 20 based upon the space available in the flume. The protection measures were also scaled on a 1:20 ratio based upon diameter. As shown in Section 4.  Figure 3.7 displays the armoring scour protection measures used in our experiments. In the field, riprap has been a prominent erosion/scour protection measure used on levees, breakwaters, dikes, revetments, bridge piers and other coastal structures (Chiew, 1995 andPister, 2007). Corelocs are usually placed on breakwaters and revetments (Melito andMelby, 2002 andHoltzhausen, 1998). An armoring underlayer is usually placed underneath both types of protection measures. The selection for the riprap size was chosen on a very conservative basis. This analysis was performed by assuming the average riprap was a single, spherical, semi-submerged stone on a horizontal bed with horizontal flow. The drag force, P, created by the horizontal flow due to overtopping waves and the friction force, F, provided by an individual riprap are given in Equations 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. For the drag force calculation, it was assumed conservatively that the horizontal flow velocity is equal to the resultant velocity at impact.

These equations yielded a value that was scaled down, on a 1/20 scaling, to a 4.09cm diameter size for model riprap.

CHAPTER 4"}, {"section_title": "SCOUR FORMATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Evolution Dynamics", "text": "Scour due to overtopping can be defined in three phases: Three-dimensional (3D) scour, transient two-dimensional (2D) scour, and steady two-dimensional (2D) scour. Threedimensional scour occurs at the beginning of the overtopping and ends when the scour becomes two-dimensional. At the beginning of the scouring process, the threshold of the critical boundary stress of the cohesive soil starts to be exceeded, yielding uplifting movement. Due to the velocity distribution of the overtopping wave not being perfectly uniform, the threshold is surpassed at different times after overtopping begins. Therefore, the initial scour of the levee soil is not uniform along the width affected from the impacting nappe. This lack of uniformity causes the a 3D scour. At this stage, within seconds of overtopping, arbitrary sections of soil are scoured when impacted by the overtopping nappe. After a capricious short time period, the inconsistency of the scour eventually becomes less varied and evolves into the 2D scour phase. The two-dimensional transient phase of scouring consists of the main development of the scour depth and scour length. As the overtopping process occurs, the rate at which the scouring occurs is the highest, but decreases over time. In this phase the scour hole starts to hold a volume of water that increases as the scour hole further develops. With a volume of water being impacted by the overtopping nappe, there becomes an ability for an eddy to be formed.   the results may be used in designing scour countermeasures and as a launching pad for further research. A thorough discussion of this research includes qualitative observations that may be useful in further work on the subject, design recommendations for protection measures, and suggestions for further research. As with many natural phenomena, the scour evolution's logarithmic increase with time may be effectively predicted for controlled laboratory conditions. Difficulty arises, however, when trying to apply these results perfectly to a situation of actual flooding, in which there would be a period of waves overtopping before the mean water surface level reached the floodwall peak, potentially strong wind, non two-dimensional overtopping, the potential for canal-side scour to affect the floodwall's stability, and other unpredictable variables. Even with those difficulties, the results of this project may still provide important information in the form of qualitative observations, comparisons, and relative quantitative measures. By comparing Figure 2.11 and Figure 4.2a, it can visually be seen that both have a very similar 2D scour hole, validating the laboratory tests' ability to simulate the field.

The scour evolution and equilibrium depth were similar for the 3 tests that were held at a 16.5cm floodwall height with different wave characteristics. This phenomenon occurred because the densimetric Froude Number values, from Equation 4.1, were close for each test set (Table 4.2)."}, {"section_title": "S(t)", "text": "x y  Table 4.2: Dimensionless parameter values for each corresponding wave characteristic A typical plot of the scour depth evolution with time can be seen in Figure 4.4a. As the overtopping process occurs, the rate at which the scouring occurs begins at a fast rate but then decreases over time. As mentioned earlier in Chapter 4, the scour hole starts to hold a volume of water that increases in volume as the scour hole further develops. Each test set yielded a similar trend for their respective scour evolution. The impacting force from the overtopping waves for each test set yielded similar scour rates. This phenomenon occurred due to the predominance of the effects that the accumulated volume of water has on the forces from the overtopping waves. The impact and shear forces cause the loose soil in the scour hole to have enough energy to exit the scour profile. The energy decreases over time as the scour depth and length increase, until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium was reached within 10-13min of testing for each wave characteristic. It can be seen that the scour depth began to reach an equilibrium around 9-10minutes for      Table 3.2. The equilibrium scour depth can be seen to be approximately 7.2cm. The scour profile that is in the positive area is due to soil pile up caused by the eroded soil. In order to consider the time dependence of scour, the results from the measurements of each wave parameters were plotted, separately, in dimensionless form; Figure 4.4b displays an example of this for Test Set 1. The maximum scour depth, S(t), and scour length, L(t), at a given time is normalized by the measured maximum equilibrium scour depth value, S*, and length value, L*, for the given experimental conditions, and time, t, is normalized by the characteristic time (t* for scour depth and t** for scour length). where \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T -wave frequency, T = wave period, C* and C** = empirical constants.

CHAPTER 5"}, {"section_title": "SCOUR PROTECTION MEASURES", "text": "The efficiency of the selected scour protection measures were tested for three different  Table 2 (H 0 =4cm and T=3s). The placement of the protection measures was randomized in order to mimic the field layout. Each protection measure began on the landside directly after the floodwall and was spread to cover the entire land-side levee crest. The scour protection measures were tested for a time period of (with t = 10-13min for the tests with scour protection, shown in Table 2; and 3t*=9.9min). For a given experimental Fr d value (i.e., floodwall height) the tests with all of the protection measures were run at the same experimental time for consistency. Figure 5.1 shows the scour profiles with each of the four protection measures and also without a protection measure for the same flow conditions. Each protection method proved to reduce the amount of scour compared to the unprotected case. The scour profile shape, with protection measures in place, were less defined as the typical U-shape; shown in Figure 2.11. For better accuracy, the scour profiles were collected in two separate places across the levee crest. For tests without an underlayer, the levee soil directly landward of the scour hole was eroded due to the increased shear forces from the overflow of water across the crest. The absence of an armoring cover layer allowed the water from the overtopping waves to run across the levee more smoothly. The presence of an armoring cover layer, however, resulted in a more turbulent flow through the voids t > 3t * of the armoring units, resulting in an increase in shear forces that in time causes erosion. Table 4.1 shows the tabulated data of the protection measures alongside the results without scour protection, the results of which are discussed in the next section. Figure 5.1: Scour profile, with and without protection measures in place, for a wave height of 4cm, wave period of 3s, and floodwall height of 12cm, Test Set 4 in Table 3.2. The effectiveness of the protection measures primarily focuses on their ability to dissipate jet energy before it hits the ground and/or their ability to decrease the velocity of the water as it flows along the crest away from the floodwall reduces the scour depth. The amount of reduction, however, varied according to the type of protection. An observation of importance is that the jet energy dissipation was not entirely due to the faces of the protection measure. A large part of the dissipation was due to the standing water created by slow water evacuation, shown in to have a larger effect when a protection measure is in place; due to an even slower water evacuation. This effect may not have been observed had the protection measures only been placed in the impact zone. Instead, their presence on the entire crest increased flow resistance, causing a higher amount of water to be held as an additional barrier to scour. This standing water was measured to reach a maximum height of approximately 2cm. This was 1/3 the height of both the layer of corelocs and the riprap thickness. The riprap cover layer proved to be more effective than the coreloc cover layer. When both types were used without an underlayer, the scour depth and length reduced by approximately an average of 25% and 13% more, respectively, for the riprap than the coreloc covering. Due to the physical shape and weight of both armoring layer types, the depth the maximum scour, S(t), was more scattered throughout the scour profile width (sometimes having the efficiency of no recorded scour depth in some places). The average reduction in scour depth and length, respectively, are as follows: R=32%, 23.9%; RU=88%, 83%; C=25.5%, 13.2%; CU=71.3%, 62.3%. A major factor contributing to the success of the riprap was its gradation. A well-graded riprap is expected to perform better than a riprap of a single size because of the reduction of void space achieved with different size stones. The riprap is believed to improve scour protection because it contains a well-graded size distribution. This allows for the air voids in the cover layer to be smaller, which causes (1) a decrease in the impact force from the overtopping waves to the levee soil, (2) a decrease in the open space available for the loose sediment to escape the eroded area, and (3) a new, extra armor layer consisting of the eroded cohesive loose soil still attached to the compacted levee soil increased the resistance to scour and sediment erosion for the soil underneath. As corelocs possess a uniform size distribution, they create larger air voids when used in this coastal configuration. Nevertheless, their ability to dissipate energy makes them proven scour reducers. When there is an underlayer present for both protection measures, approximately the same reduction trend of the amount of scour occurs. The results for the percent reduction show a similar large jump in effectiveness for both corelocs and riprap when an underlayer is present. The results yielded show that the presence of the underlayer, or lack thereof, has a greater effect on the scour amount than the type of the cover armor used. The maximum scour depth and length drastically decreases with an armoring underlayer in place, having values approximately 70-90% lower than the corresponding maximum scour without protection. The scour lengths decrease approximately up to 30% when an underlayer is used. If the location area of a levee receives generally weak storm wave overtopping, it may be more economical to only use a cover armor layer so as to dissipate the overtopping waves enough to prevent an amount of failure causing scour. In locations with longer, stronger storm surges and overtopping waves, an underlayer can drastically increase the overall resiliency of the levee's soil. Because the Fr d values in the laboratory are either near or within the range of expected Fr d values in the field, the laboratory results should provide some guidance when designing protection for the field and what results to expect. With sufficient dissipation of jet energy, the levee exhibited similarities to that of a stream bed in that the water flowed horizontally, a concept that explains the drastic difference in scour depth for the cases with and without an underlayer. Even as the larger rocks or corelocs greatly dampened the impact force of the waves, the water still removed sediment horizontally as it evacuated the crest. The presence of an underlayer prevented the removal of sediment horizontally because its pores were small enough to trap sediment. Without an underlayer in place, loose sediment was able to easily escape coreloc and riprap layers, eroding holes throughout the crest."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Laboratory experiments were conducted to study (1) transient scour dynamics, 2equilibrium scour characteristics and 3 Our experiments delving into the transient scour characteristics showed that the maximum scour depth and scour length approach equilibrium values exponentially with the scour length reaching the equilibrium faster than the maximum scour depth. Semiempirical parameterizations were proposed to predict the values of these transient characteristics. Riprap armoring showed a superior performance compared to the coreloc armoring. Furthermore, riprap armoring implemented with an underlayer proved to best reduce the amount of scour for the tested scour protection measures for given model storm waves."}]
