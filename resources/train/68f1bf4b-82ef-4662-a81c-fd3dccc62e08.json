[{"section_title": "introduction", "text": "Policymakers across education systems are interested in ensuring a quality education for all students; however, years of research have shown that students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer educational outcomes than their more affluent peers (Coleman et al., 1966;Crane, 1996;Sirin, 2005;Sutton & Soderstrom, 1999). These students lack the benefits afforded by the greater educational resources or higher family income, education, and occupational status of some of their peers, and thus may face an uphill battle to achieve. This association between socioeconomic disadvantage and academic performance holds true around the world, in all core subjects (i.e., reading, mathematics, and science), and across grades from primary to upper secondary education (Martin et al., 2012;Mullis et al., 2012;OECD, 2011;Sandoval-Hernandez & Cortes, 2012). Over the last 20 years, however, there has been an increasing focus on students who succeed educationally against the odds (Borman & Overman, 2004;Finn & Rock, 1997;Martin & Marsh, 2006). Such students are considered \"academically resilient,\" and related studies typically have focused on identifying and examining the factors that set these students apart from their disadvantaged peers who are less successful, or not resilient. In other words, these studies have asked: \"What appears to make a difference for academically resilient students?\" In doing so, they have explored the role that students' attitudes and behaviors-as well as family, school, and/or community factors-may play in fostering academic achievement (Borman & Overman, 2004;OECD, 2011;Sandoval-Hernandez & Cortes, 2012;Waxman & Huang, 1996). The results from these types of studies have the potential to assist policymakers in developing, testing, and implementing interventions targeted to disadvantaged students and supporting them in improving their academic performance. This brief has two purposes. The first is to explore the prevalence of academic resilience, identifying examples of education systems in which high percentages of disadvantaged students succeed academically. The second is to explore what factors are associated with academic resilience within and across education systems-again, what may make a difference for these students. This analysis can help policymakers understand the factors that may contribute to disadvantaged students-regardless of how prevalent they are in an education systembeing able to overcome the obstacles associated with their backgrounds. For each of the diverse education systems in the study, this brief can be suggestive of policy development and provide the basis for further research, particularly at the national level. This policy brief uses eighth-grade mathematics data from the 2011 cycle of the IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Administered every four years since 1995, TIMSS is a large-scale, cross-national assessment of fourth-and eighth-grade students' mathematics and science achievement. It also collects extensive background information on the participating students and their schools and teachers. We use student achievement data as well as data from the student and school questionnaires both to identify the subgroup of academically resilient students in each education system and to analyze factors that may contribute to academic resilience. Of the 47 education systems whose data are available in the TIMSS 2011 International Database at the eighth grade level, we include the 28 education systems for which there were sufficient numbers of academically resilient students for analysis. These 28 education systems represent a variety of geographical regions and levels of economic development."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Policy implications (contd.) Policies to increase academic resilience should take into account education system contexts. The results showed that the factors examined did not have the same associations in all education systems, and all education systems had different sets of factors that were associated with students' academic resilience. Policymakers will need to examine which factors are predictive in their individual systems and what policies or approaches for addressing these factors might be appropriate for their contexts. Moreover, even though the data we used are highly reliable and our study uses sound statistical analyses, policymakers should be aware that these results describe associations rather than causal relationships. Academically resilient students are those who are academically successful despite their disadvantaged circumstances. For this analysis, we define students who are academically successful as those who score at or above the TIMSS 2011 Intermediate International Benchmark in mathematics (475). We chose this international measure of successrather than a nationally-relative one-because it is standardized across education systems and allows us to reference a benchmark that is definable in terms of specific skills and abilities 1 . We also chose an international definition for \"disadvantaged students,\" whom we define as those classified in the \"few resources\" category of the Home Educational Resources (HER) index, which is a composite measure in the TIMSS 2011 International Database. These students, on average, reported that they had 25 or fewer books in the home, they had neither of two home study supports (their own room nor an internet connection), and neither parent had gone beyond upper-secondary education. Academically resilient students are thus disadvantaged students who are successful in mathematics; they are a subset of disadvantaged students as a whole. 2 Exhibit 1 shows, for each of the 28 education systems, the percentages of eighth-grade students who fall under our definition of disadvantaged students and, among them, the percentages who are academically resilient. The exhibit also shows the mean mathematics score for all eighth-grade students in each education system. As the exhibit shows, education systems vary widely in the percentages of both disadvantaged students and academically resilient students. The percentage of disadvantaged students ranges from 4 percent in the how prevalent are academically resilient students? Republic of Korea to 62 percent in Ghana, and the percentage of academically resilient students ranges from 4 percent in Ghana to 55 percent in Japan. Generally, education systems with lower percentages of disadvantaged students had larger percentages of academically resilient students and vice versa. There are some exceptions, however. For example, both Hong Kong SAR and Romania have 19 percent of students who are disadvantaged, but in Hong Kong SAR 54 percent of them are academically resilient compared to 16 percent in Romania. At the same time, Turkey has a fairly high percentage of disadvantaged students (54 percent), but a relatively higher percentage of them are academically resilient (27 percent). Another pattern shown in Exhibit 1 is that the education systems with the largest percentages of academically resilient students tend to be those with higher mean scores overall, although again there are exceptions. Despite not being among the top performing education systems, Kazakhstan has one of the largest percentages of academically resilient students (45 percent) among the disadvantaged students. Turkey and Thailand also have relatively larger percentages of academically resilient students (27 and 20 percent, respectively) despite more than half of the student population being disadvantaged (54 and 52 percent, respectively) and not being among top performing education systems. Thus, while having a larger percentage of disadvantaged students in general appears to be a challenge to the performance of those students and for the education system overall, there are cases where this challenge is overcome. The next section explores those factors that may contribute to academic resilience. 1 Disadvantaged students are those in the \"few resources\" category of the Home Educational Resources (HER) index, which is a composite measure in the TIMSS 2011 International Database. These students reported that they had 25 or fewer books in the home, they had neither of two home study supports (their own room and an internet connection), and neither parent had gone beyond upper-secondary education, on average. 2 Academically resilient students (ARS) are defined as disadvantaged students who performed at or above the TIMSS 2011 Intermediate International Mathematics Benchmark (475). In six education systems, denoted by a single dagger ( \u2020), the mean mathematics score for disadvantaged students was higher than this benchmark. In these cases, the mean score for disadvantaged students (instead of the benchmark) was used to identify the ARS."}, {"section_title": "Percent of Disadvantaged Students Percent of ARS among Disadvantaged Students", "text": "Based on our review of academic literature and of the TIMSS 2011 questionnaires, we identified eight factors to explore as possible predictors of academic resilience and four factors to use as controls. 3 Exhibit 2 presents these factors. We conducted logistic regression analyses for each of the 28 education systems, which allowed us to compute odds ratios that describe the odds of disadvantaged students being academically resilient based on each selected factor (controlling for all other variables in the analysis). In our analysis, an odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that a student with that factor (e.g., valuing mathematics) has greater odds of being academically resilient than a student without that factor (e.g., not valuing mathematics); an odds ratio of 1 indicates equal odds and less than 1 indicates lesser odds. 4"}, {"section_title": "What factors are associated with academic resilience?", "text": "Exhibits 3 and 4 show the odds ratios for each of the student factors and school factors, respectively, for which the association between that factor and being academically resilient was statistically significant in the expected direction in at least two education systems. 5 In these two exhibits, odds ratios for which the relationship of the factor and academic resilience is statistically significant are shaded in dark blue. This brief focuses on those results. As shown in Exhibit 3, across education systems (and all the factors examined), the strongest and most consistent predictor of academic resilience appeared to be students' educational aspirations. In 20 education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 78 percent higher for disadvantaged students who aspired to obtain a master's degree or Ph.D. than for those who aspired to complete less than college. 6 Students' educational aspirations appeared to be an especially strong predictor in Chinese Taipei and Turkey, where the odds of being academically resilient were over seven or eight times higher for disadvantaged students aspiring to a master's degree or Ph.D. than for those aspiring to complete less than college. Two other student factors examined also emerged as predictors in multiple education systems. In six education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 56 percent higher for disadvantaged students who reported valuing mathematics (i.e., they agreed with statements about the importance and usefulness of the subject) than for those who reported not valuing mathematics and, at the upper end, the odds were more than three times as high in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. In six education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 38 percent higher for disadvantaged students who reported almost never being bullied than for those who reported being bullied about weekly; the odds of being academically resilient were more than four times higher in Romania.

For the three-category factors, the exhibit shows only the comparisons between students in the extreme categories (i.e., the \"base\" and \"upper\" categories, indicated by italics and bold text, respectively). Comparisons between the base and the middle category are not shown due to space constraints and because the findings are generally redundant with (and somewhat weaker than) those shown. Odds ratios that are shaded in dark blue indicate that there is a statistically significant (p < .05) positive relationship between the factor and the outcome variable (i.e., being ARS or not). note: Education systems are ordered alphabetically.

This association appeared to be particularly strong in Dubai, where the odds of academic resilience were over four times higher for disadvantaged students in schools with a smaller proportion of economically disadvantaged students compared to those in schools with a higher proportion of economically disadvantaged students. In four education systems, disadvantaged students whose principals thought the school put a high or very high emphasis on academic success (as indicated by teachers' high expectations for student achievement, effective teachers, students that desire to do well, and parental support) had at least 72 percent higher odds of being academically resilient than those whose principals thought there was only a moderate emphasis on academic success. As shown in Exhibit 4, the school factor that appeared to be the most consistent predictor of academic resilience was students' beliefs about their teachers' confidence in their abilities. In nine education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 75 percent higher for disadvantaged students who agreed that their teacher thought they could do well in mathematics with difficult material than for those who disagreed. Students' beliefs about their teachers' confidence in them appeared to be an especially strong predictor in Oman, where disadvantaged students who agreed that their teacher thought they could do well had over five times the odds of being academically resilient as those who disagreed. Two of the four other school factors examined also appeared to predict academic resilience in multiple education systems. In five education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 59 percent higher for disadvantaged students The proportion of academically resilient students was related both to the proportion of disadvantaged students and overall mean performance in mathematics. In general, education systems with lower percentages of disadvantaged students tended to produce larger percentages of academically resilient students among them and vice versa. However, there were exceptions, such as Romania and Hong Kong SAR, which both had 19 percent disadvantaged students, but the former had just 16 percent academically resilient students compared to the latter's 54 percent. The largest proportions of academically resilient students tended also to come from the highest performing education systems. Kazakhstan was an exception, having 45 percent academically resilient students despite not being a top-performing education system. This general finding suggests that disadvantaged students may benefit greatly from environments that support high overall achievement. Exceptions to the general pattern of findings, including Hong Kong SAR, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Thailand, may be worthy of further study."}, {"section_title": "Students' high educational aspirations", "text": "appear to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of academic resilience; other student factors appeared to be predictive in multiple education systems, as well. In 20 education systems, the odds of being academically resilient were at least 78 percent higher for disadvantaged students who aspired to obtain a master's degree or Ph.D. than for those who aspired to complete less than college; at the upper end, the odds were more than 7 or 8 times higher. The other student factors that had positive relationships with academic resilience in multiple education systems were students' valuing of mathematics and experiencing less frequent bullying. Policies could be targeted at helping students recognize the importance and usefulness of mathematics and higher education as well as improving both accessibility to higher education and students' perceptions about the accessibility of it. Recent research on \"grit,\" or individuals' tendency to maintain interest and focused effort on long-term goals, and \"growth mindset,\" or individuals' beliefs that intelligence and success can be developed through effort, may provide insights about related interventions (Blackwell et al., 2007;Duckworth & Gross, 2014;Dweck, 2010;Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). Interventions to reduce bullying in schools could be considered as well. 3. While not as consistent in predicting academic resilience as the student factors, school factors are also associated with academic resilience in multiple education systems. Three of the five school factors we examinedteachers' confidence in students doing well with difficult material in mathematics, as reported by the student; schools' emphasis on academic success as reported by the principal (and indicated by teachers' high expectations for student achievement, effective teachers, students that desire to do well, and parental support), and schools having a lower percentage of economically disadvantaged students, as reported by the principal-were positively associated with students' academic resilience in 9, 4, and 5 education systems, respectively. These results suggest that policymakers could explore interventions aimed at encouraging teachers to maintain positive attitudes about students' learning abilities, supporting principals to increase emphasis on academic success, and developing mechanisms with the potential to help alleviate the economically disadvantaged profile of schools' populations. 4. Policies to increase academic resilience should account for education system contexts. Our results showed that the factors examined did not have the same associations in all education systems and that all education systems had different sets of factors that were associated with students' academic resilience. While this in part reflects the design of the study-that is, the group of factors selected for analysis and the recoding decisions were those that best fit the set of education systems, rather than being customized for each education system-it does not take away from the broader point that there is not a onesize-fits-all solution. Policymakers in individual education systems will need to examine which factors are relevant in their individual systems and what policies or approaches for addressing these factors might be appropriate for their unique contexts. Moreover, even though the TIMSS data are highly reliable and our study uses sound statistical analyses, it should be noted that TIMSS is an observational study (which describes associations) and not a randomized experiment (which allows causal inferences to be drawn). Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with other findings in the literature reporting associations between disadvantaged students' achievement and factors related to the student and school contexts."}]
