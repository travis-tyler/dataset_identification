Overview of the bioinformatic workflow applied in this study. 46 SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a specific gene expression and pathway 47 signature in human cells 48 We wanted to identify genes that were differentially expressed across multiple SARS-CoV-2 infected 49 samples and not in samples infected with other respiratory viruses. As a primary dataset, we 50 selected GSE147507 [10] , which includes gene expression measurements from three cell lines derived 51 from the human respiratory system (NHBE, A549, Calu-3) infected either with SARS-CoV-2, 52 influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), 53 with different multiplicity of infection (MOI). We also analyzed an additional dataset GSE150316, 54 which includes RNA-seq extracted from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) histological 55 sections of lung biopsies from COVID-19 deceased patients and healthy individuals (see Figure 2A and Materials and Methods for further details). 57 Hence, we retrieved 41 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed significant and 58 consistent expression changes in at least three datasets from cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2, 59 and that were not significantly affected in cell lines infected with other viruses within the same 60 dataset (Supplementary Table 1A ). To these, we added 23 genes that showed significant and 61 consistent expression changes in two of four cell line datasets infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at least 62 "}, {"section_title": "3/25", "text": "Ferrarini & Lal et al., 2020\nComprehensive SARS-CoV-2 Computational Analyses one lung biopsy sample from a SARS-CoV-2 patient.

Other interesting up-regulated genes were the amidohydrolase VNN2, the 69 pro-fibrotic gene PDGFB, the beta-interferon regulator PRDM1 and the proinflammatory cytokines 70 CSF2 and IL-32. FKBP5, a known regulator of NF-kB activity, was among the consistently 71 downregulated genes. We also generated additional lists of DEGs that met different filtering criteria 72 (Supplementary Table 1B , see Supplementary File 1 for the complete DEG results for each dataset). 73 In order to better understand the underlying biological functions and molecular mechanisms 74 associated with the observed DEGs, we performed a hypergeometric test to detect statistically 75 significant overrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms among the DEGs having an absolute Log2FC 76 > 1 in each dataset separately.\n77 Table 1 .

Here we report a subset of non-redundant reduced terms consistently 87 enriched in more than one SARS-COV-2 cell line which were not detected in the other viruses' datasets. We added 88 generic categories of immunity, metabolism, cellular processes and signaling/epigeneitcs to the GO terms as colored 89 dots.

Thus, 91 DEIs also detected as DEGs by this analysis are depicted in blue. (D) The upper right diagram depicts different 92 manners by which TE family overexpression might be detected. While TEs may indeed be autonomously expressed, 93 the old age of most TEs detected points toward either being part of a gene (exonization or alternative promoter), or a 94 result of pervasive transcription. We report the functional enrichment for neighboring genes of differentially expressed 95 TEs (DETEs) specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 Calu-3 and A549 cells (MOI 2). The same categories used in 96 subfigure (B) were attributed to the GO terms reported here. Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 Computational Analyses Consistent with the findings of Blanco-Melo et al. [10] , GO enrichment analysis returned terms 98 associated with immune system processes, Pi3K/AKT signaling pathway, response to cytokine, 99 stress and virus, among others (see Supplementary File 2 for complete results). In addition, we 100 report 285 GO terms common to at least two cell line datasets infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 101 absent in the response to other viruses ( Figure 2B , Supplementary Table 2A) , including neutrophil 102 and granulocyte activation, interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway, proteolysis, and stress 103 activated signaling cascades."}, {"section_title": "104", "text": "Next, we wanted to pinpoint intracellular signaling pathways that may be modulated specifically 105 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A robust signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) enabled us to 106 identify 30 pathways, including many involved in the host immune response, that were significantly 107 enriched among differentially expressed genes in at least one virus-infected cell line dataset 108 (Supplementary Table 3 ). More importantly, we predicted four pathways to be specific to 109 SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that the significant pathways differed by cell type and 110 multiplicity of infection. The significant results included only one term common to A549 (MOI 0.2) 111 and Calu-3 cells (MOI 2), namely the interferon alpha/beta signaling. Additionally, we found the 112 amoebiasis (A549 cells, MOI 0.2), the p75(NTR)-mediated and the trka receptor signaling pathways 113 (A549 cells, MOI 2) as significantly impacted. 114 We also used a classic hypergeometric method as a complementary approach to our SPIA 115 pathway enrichment analysis. While there were generally higher numbers of significant results using 116 this method, we observed that the vast majority of enriched terms (FDR < 0.05) described 117 infections with various pathogens, innate immunity, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation Table 3 ). Interestingly, we were able to detect enriched KEGG pathways common to 119 at least two SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types and absent from the other virus-infected datasets Table 4 ).

We identified isoforms experiencing a switch in usage greater than or equal to 30% in 136 absolute value, and retrieved those with a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value less than 0.05. After 137 calculating the difference in isoform usage (dIF) per gene (in each condition), we performed 138 predictive functional consequence and alternative splicing analyses for all isoforms globally as well as 139 at the individual gene level.

These biological consequences may result from increased multiple 153 exon skipping events and alternative transcription start sites via alternative 5' acceptor sites 154 (Supplementary Figure 1B) . While not significant, these trends implicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus 155 may globally trigger host cell machinery to generate shorter isoforms that, while not shuttled for 156 degradation, either do not produce functional proteins or produce alternative aberrant proteins not 157 utilized in non-SARS-CoV-2 tissue conditions. MamRep137. Most of the TE families uncovered are ancient elements, incapable of transposing, or 197 harboring intrinsic regulatory sequences [37, 57, 70] . Eleven of the 16 TE families specifically 198 upregulated in SARS-COV-2 infected cells are long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, and include well 199 known TE immune regulators. For instance, the MER41B (primate specific TE family) is known to 200 contribute to Interferon gamma inducible binding sites (bound by STAT1 and/or IRF1) [14, 66] . 201 Other LTR elements are also enriched in STAT1 binding sites (MLT1L) [14] , or have been shown to 202 act as cellular gene enhancers (LTR13A [16, 32] )."}, {"section_title": "203", "text": "Given the propensity for the TE families detected to impact nearby gene expression, we further 204 investigated the functional enrichment of genes near upregulated TE families (+-5kb upstream, 1kb 205 downstream). We detected GO functional enrichment of several immunity-related terms (e.g. MHC 206 protein complex, antigen processing, regulation of dendritic cell differentiation, T-cell tolerance 207 induction), metabolism related terms (such as regulation of phospholipid catabolic process), and 208 more interestingly a specific human phenotype term called \"Progressive pulmonary function 209 impairment\" (Figure 2D ). Even though we did not limit our search only to neighboring genes which 210 were also DE, we found several similar (and very specific) enriched terms in both analyses, for 211 instance related to immune response, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, vitamin (cofactor) 212 metabolism, among others. This result supports the idea that some responses during infection could 213 be related to TE-mediated transcriptional regulation. Finally, when we searched for enriched terms 214 related to each one of the 16 families separately, we also detected immunity related enriched terms 215 such as regulation of interleukins, antigen processing, TGFB receptor binding and temperature Figure 2D )."}, {"section_title": "219", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome is enriched in binding motifs for 40 human 220 RBPs, most of them conserved across SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates 221 Our next aim was to predict whether any host RNA binding proteins interact with the viral genome. 222 To do so, we first filtered the AtTRACT database [23] to obtain a list of 102 human RBPs and 205 223 associated Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) describing the sequence binding preferences of these 224 proteins. We then scanned the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome sequence to identify potential binding 225 sites for these proteins. Figure 3 illustrates our analysis pipeline. 226 We identified 99 human RBPs with 11,897 potential binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 227 positive-sense genome. Since the SARS-CoV-2 genome produces negative-sense intermediates as part 228 of the replication process [36] , we also scanned the negative-sense molecule, where we found 11,333 229 potential binding sites for 96 RBPs (Supplementary Table 6 )."}, {"section_title": "230", "text": "To find RBPs whose binding sites occur in the SARS-CoV-2 genome more often than expected by 231 chance, we repeatedly scrambled the genome sequence to create 1,000 simulated genome sequences 232 with an identical nucleotide composition to the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (30% A, 18% C, 20% 233 G, 32% T). We used these 1,000 simulated genomes to determine a background distribution of the 234 number of binding sites found for a specific RBP. This allowed us to pinpoint RBPs with 235 significantly more or significantly fewer binding sites in the actual SARS-CoV-2 genome than 236 expected based on the background distribution (two-tailed z-test, FDR-corrected P < 0.01). To 237 retrieve RBPs whose motifs were enriched in specific genomic regions, we also repeated this analysis 238 independently for the SARS-CoV-2 5'UTR, 3'UTR, intergenic regions, and for the sequence from the 239 negative sense molecule. Motifs for 40 human RBPs were found to be enriched in at least one of the 240 tested genomic regions, while motifs for 23 human RBPs were found to be depleted in at least one of 241 the tested regions (Supplementary Table 7) . 242 We next examined whether any of the 6,936 putative binding sites for these 40 enriched RBPs 243 were conserved across SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We found that 6,581 putative binding sites, Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 Computational Analyses RBP binding sites in coding regions are likely to be conserved due to evolutionary pressure on 247 protein sequences rather than RBP binding ability. We therefore repeated this analysis focusing only 248 on putative RBP binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 UTRs and intergenic regions. We found 124 249 putative RBP binding sites for 21 enriched RBPs in the UTRs and intergenic regions. Of these, 50 250 putative RBP binding sites for 17 RBPs were conserved in >95% of the available genome sequences; 251 6 in the 5'UTR, 5 in the 3'UTR, and 39 in intergenic regions (Supplementary Table 8 Table 9 ). According to GTEx data [25] [25, 64] ), indicating that 263 9/25 they are present in cells that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next checked whether any 264 of these RBPs are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that human poly-A 265 binding proteins C1 and C4 (PABPC1 and PABPC4) bind to the viral N protein [24] . Thus, it is 266 conceivable that these RBPs interact with both the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins. Finally, we 267 combined these results with our analysis of differential gene expression to identify SARS-CoV-2 268 interacting RBPs that also show expression changes upon infection. The results of this analysis are 269 summarized for selected RBPs in Table 2 . Table 11 ), a bat coronavirus 279 with a genome that is 96% identical with that of SARS-CoV-2 [4, 88] . 280 We found that the pattern of enrichment and depletion of RBP binding motifs in SARS-CoV-2 is 281 different from that of the other two viruses. Specifically, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is uniquely 282 enriched for binding sites of CELF5 in its 5'UTR, PPIE on its 3'UTR, and ELAVL1 in the viral To test whether any viral sequence variants were associated with a change in disease severity in 290 human hosts, we analyzed 1,511 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes that had associated clinical 291 metadata. The FDR-corrected statistical results from this analysis revealed four nucleotide 292 variations that were significantly associated with a change in viral pathogenesis. Three of these 293 nucleotide changes resulted in non-synonymous variations at the amino acid level, while the last one 294 was silent at the amino acid level. The first position was a T \u2192 G (L37F) substitution located in the 295 Nsp6 coding region (p < 1.48E-5), the second position was a C \u2192 T (P323L) substitution located in 296 the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding region (p < 2.01E-4), the third position was an A \u2192 G 297 (D614G) substitution located in the spike coding region (p < 1.61E-4), and the fourth was a 298 synonymous C \u2192 T substitution located in the Nsp3 coding region (p < 1.77E-4). As a further 299 validation step, we performed the same analysis comparing viral sequence variants against potential 300 confounders, such as the biological sex or age group of the patients. These comparisons validated 301 that these four positions were only identified as significant in the results of the disease severity 302 analysis."}, {"section_title": "304", "text": "Airway epithelial cells are the primary entry points for respiratory viruses and therefore constitute 305 the first producers of inflammatory signals that, in addition to their antiviral activity, promote the 306 initiation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we report the results of a 307 complementary panel of analyses that enable a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions 308 which contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis in the human respiratory system. However, GM-CSF is considered more proinflammatory than other members of its family, such as 316 G-CSF, and is associated with tissue hyper-inflammation [52] . In accordance with our results, high 317 levels of GM-CSF were found in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients [84] , and several clinical 318 trials are planned using agents that either target GM-CSF or its receptor [53] . GM-CSF, together 319 with other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF, IFNg, IL-7 and IL-18, is associated with 320 the cytokine storm present in a hyperinflammatory disorder named hemophagocytic 321 lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which presents with organ failure [12] . Moreover, cytokines related to 322 cytokine release syndrome (such as IL-1A/B, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and TNFA), showed increased 323 positive association to the severity of the disease in the blood from COVID-19 patients [49] . Another 324 proinflammatory cytokine specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was IL-32, which 325 together with CSF2, promotes the release of TNF and IL-6 in a continuous positive loop and 326 therefore contribute to this cytokine storm [90] . Interestingly, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-18 were found to be 327 upregulated in two of the four data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Moreover, not only 328 upregulation, but also a shift in isoform usage of IL-6 was detected in NHBE and A549 infected 329 cells. A shift in 5' UTR usage in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 may be attributed to indirect host cell 330 signaling cascades that trigger changes in transcription and splicing activity, which could also 331 explain the overall increase in IL-6 expression. 332 SERPINA3, a gene coding for an essential enzyme in the regulation of leukocyte proteases, is also 333 induced by cytokines [28] . This was the only gene consistently upregulated in all cell line samples Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 Computational Analyses carried out to validate this hypothesis [13] . Another interesting candidate gene, which has not been 337 implicated experimentally in respiratory viral infections and was upregulated in our analysis, was 338 VNN2. Vanins are involved in proinflammatory and oxidative processes, and VNN2 plays a role in 339 neutrophil migration by regulating b2 integrin [56] . In contrast, the downregulated genes included 340 SNX8, which has been previously reported in RNA virus-triggered induction of antiviral 341 genes [13, 26] ; and FKBP5, a known regulator of NF-kB activity [27] . These results suggest that the 342 SARS-CoV-2 virus tends to indirectly target specific genes involved in genome replication and host 343 antiviral immune response without eliciting a global change in cellular transcript processing or 344 protein production. proinflammatory cytokines by other cell types [34] . Signaling pathway analysis showed that type I 359 IFN response was greatly impacted in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (A549 and Calu-3 cells at a MOI 360 of 0.2 and 2 respectively). In the same direction, a higher expression of PRDM1 (Blimp-1) that we 361 observed in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, could also contribute to the critical regulation of IFN 362 signaling cascades; interestingly, the TE family LTR13, which was also upregulated upon 363 SARS-CoV-2 infection, is enriched in PRDM1 binding sites [78] . Therefore, it is possible that 364 regulatory factors involved in IFN and immune response in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection 365 could also be attributed to TE transcriptional activation. In the same direction, we detected the 366 upregulation of several TE families in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells that have been previously 367 implicated in immune regulation. Moreover, 16 upregulated families were specific to SARS-CoV-2 368 infection in Calu-3 and A549 cell lines. The MER41B family, for instance, is known to contribute to 369 interferon gamma inducible binding sites (bound by STAT1 and/or IRF1) [14] . Functional 370 enrichment analysis of nearby genes were in accordance with these findings, since several immunity 371 related terms were enriched along with \"progressive pulmonary impairment\". In parallel, TEs seem 372 to be co-regulated with phospholipid metabolism, which directly affects the Pi3K/AKT signaling 373 pathway, central to the immune response and which were detected in our functional enrichment and 374 metabolism flux analyses."}, {"section_title": "375", "text": "RBPs are another example of host regulatory factors involved either in the response of human 376 cells to SARS-CoV-2 or in the manipulation of human machinery by the virus.

Five of 378 the proteins predicted to be interacting with the viral genome by our pipeline (EIF4B, hnRNPA1, 379 PABPC1, PABPC4, and YBX1) were experimentally shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an 380 infected human liver cell line, based on a recent preprint [67] ."}, {"section_title": "381", "text": "Among the RBPs whose potential binding sites were enriched and conserved within the 382 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes is the EIF4B, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein translation 383 could be EIF4B-dependent.

Moreover, this protein was predicted to interact specifically with the 386 intergenic region upstream of the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein, one of 387 four structural proteins from this virus."}, {"section_title": "388", "text": "Another conserved RBP, which was also upregulated in infected cells, is the Poly(A) Binding 389 Protein Cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), which has well described cellular roles in mRNA stability and 390 translation.

The activity of 391 PABPC1 is modulated to inhibit host protein transcript translation, promoting viral RNA access to 392 the host cell translational machinery [72] . Importantly, the 3' UTR region of SARS-CoV2 is also 393 enriched in binding sites of the PABPC1 and the PPIE RBPs, the latter of which is known to be 394 involved in multiple processes, including mRNA splicing [9, 33] . Interestingly, PABPC1 and PABPC4 395 interact with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which stabilizes the viral genome [24] . This raises the 396 possibility that the viral genome, N protein, and human PABP proteins may participate in a joint 397 protein-RNA complex that assists in viral genome stability, replication, and/or 398 translation [1, 59, 62, 71, 72] ."}, {"section_title": "399", "text": "An interesting result was that the binding motifs for hnRNPA1, which has been shown to 400 interact with other coronavirus genomes, were enriched specifically in the 3'UTR of SARS-CoV-2 401 even though they were depleted in the genome overall.

Next, the sequence 548 data and associated metadata were used as input to the meta-CATS algorithm to identify aligned 549 positions that contained significant differences in their base distribution between 2 or more disease 550 severities [61] .
