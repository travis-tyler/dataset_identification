These data provide evidence that family medicine clinicians should focus on culturally sensitive behavioral interventions and prevention techniques to reduce health disparities.\nHowever, they historically receive less medical care, and disparities in health exist on the bases of race and ethnicity even when problems of access and other SES conditions are factored out. 8 Family practice physicians care for a population of adults with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and impairments. It is well known that lifestyle behaviors can contribute to chronic disease, and overall information about health behaviors in minority groups is insufficient. The family practice office constitutes an important site for intervention and public health messages. A recent study showed no evidence of lower levels of preventive care in black patients compared to white patients in primary care practices 9 However, in the population as a whole, blacks receive less preventive care. Currently, no research has been reported that describes differences by race among patients with access to family practice care in North Carolina. The aim of this cross sectional study is to identify differences in healthrelated quality of life, health risk factors, and chronic diseases between African American and White patients in family practices in North Carolina. There is some evidence to show that African Americans get sicker at an earlier age, and we will also explore the differences in the distribution of disease among age categories between African Americans and Whites. We are interested in the cultural and societal implications of race and its consequences in health care particularly as they pertain to primary care practice and cause of disparities. This study provides descriptive data for use by clinicians in family practice settings and will assist   Completed and incomplete questionnaires were mailed to UNC on a weekly basis, and three assistants entered all data into an Access database. Random checks were conducted of the data entry process to ensure accuracy, and data were cleaned and converted to SAS files for analysis. The designation of rural or urban was based on the USDA rural-urban continuum codes for the county in which the practice was located. 10\nBody mass index (BMI) was computed for each participant based on selfreported height and weight. BMI =(weight in kilograms)/(height in metersl Of the sixteen chronic health problems asked about, six were selected for analysis. These six items were high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, depression, chronic back pain and diabetes. The conditions chosen for analysis were determined by high interest and prevalence in the family practice setting and low probability of misinterpretation. Rheumatoid arthritis was not used because of the suspicion of its interpretation as \"rheumatism.\" Osteoarthritis was chosen to represent joint pain/disease, and fibromyalgia was deleted because of probable misinterpretation. Liver disease and chronic shoulder pain had a low reported prevalence in this study and were not used in the analysis. Anemia/blood disease was believed to be misleading and omitted because of the confusion with \"high blood\" and \"low blood\" (terms used in this population to represent high blood pressure and anemia respectively). The questionnaire used in this study allowed respondents to check multiple categories when asked to self identify their race/ethnicity. We omitted the few participants who did not check \"black\" only or \"white\" only from our analysis. There were I 0 participants who checked both black and white. The numbers were too small for adequate analysis as a distinct group in this study. Educational attainment is used as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES). Educational attainment has been shown to be a reasonable and reliable surrogate Gillespie H.\nindicator of SES. 11 It was divided into three categories: less than a high school diploma, high school diploma and greater than a high school diploma, for these analyses.\nAmericans were currently working full time or part time, compared to 59% of Whites.\nThe odds of having high blood pressure for African Americans, compared to Whites, were 2.57 (95% CI 2.13-3.09), adjusted for age, gender, and education level. Significant differences also existed between African Americans and Whites in their odds of reporting that they smoked.\n\nA meta analysis of primary care-based physical intervention studies revealed that physical activity counseling is effective, with stronger results obtained from interventions that were brief (3-l 0 minutes), tailored to the participants characteristics and preferences, and included supplemental written materials. 15 Furthermore, literature about smoking cessation demonstrates that physician intervention can change patient behavior.\nbiases in such data. In this study, educational status is used as a proxy for SES. We are aware that this is a limitation, as education is an imperfect proxy for SES, but there is reasonable evidence of a sufficiently strong relationship to control for the effects of SES. 11 National data suggest that about 25% of all adults are completely sedentary (not physically active), and in blacks it is closer to 40%. Our percentage of \"no exercise\" responses may be higher than those reported for the general population because our question asks about \"exercise,\" which may be interpreted as strenuous activity, rather than \"physical activity.\" Compared to the statewide BRFSS data, our survey population had an increased incidence of specific health indicators and poorer quality of life. However, one would expect to find higher rates of disease and health risk factors in those seeking care and utilizing physician services than in the general population. It is well documented that there is a disparity in access to services between racial/ethnic groups.      "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the recent literature there has been a lot of interest in health disparities, especially related to race. Minority race and ethnicity are associated with poorer health and shortened survival, and the process and delivery of health care contribute to disparities in health outcomes. 1 \u2022 2 Membership in a minority racial/ethnic group has been shown to be a risk factor for lower quality and less intensive care? Among the best-documented disparities in the quality of care that African Americans receive compared to Whites are those in the area of cardiology. There is strong evidence that revascularization procedures may be underused in treating blacks with coronary disease--a difference that cannot be explained by the clinical features of their disease 4 Elderly blacks also receive less appropriate preventive care, including mammography and vaccinations. 5 Studies have shown that middle-aged (45-64) African American women are at greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, with almost 50% of the excess risk possibly related to modifiable risk factors. 6 Studies suggest several possible explanations for disparities in health. These include: socioeconomic status (SES), access, health related behavior, discrimination, and racism. Race and ethnicity are important determinants of health in the United States, whether they represent actual differences or a constellation of factors that affect health and health status. It has been shown that blacks have disproportionate health problems as demonstrated by a higher prevalence of many risk factors, associated illnesses, and levels of comorbidity. 7 Gillespie H."}, {"section_title": "Study Questionnaire:", "text": "Data for this study came from a four-page, self-administered questionnaire.

Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors that may contribute to excess disease risk suggests potential targets for prevention strategies. The findings of this study underscore the need for counseling patients about behavior changes in the primary care setting. The data suggest that there is opportunity for primary care physicians to have an impact on health disparities in racial minorities. There is some data describing behavior differences among blacks and whites that may be useful in tailoring behavior modification interventions in primary careB Many of the disparities documented in this study can be modified by lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity, nutrition, and smoking cessation. Patients look to their physicians for advice regarding preventive behavior, and the majority cite their physicians as their primary sources of information about health. 14 Behavior modification interventions can be of significant value in these patients, and literature has shown that primary care counseling is effective in altering patient behavior.

In counseling patients for behavior change, especially those from minority communities, it is important to be aware of existing barriers to practicing good health behaviors and the importance of tailoring interventions to the individual patient.
