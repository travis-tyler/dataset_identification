Biochemical criteria to define LOH have been proposed by different international societies, including the European Academy of Andrology, International Society of Andrology, International Society for the Study of the Aging Male, European Association of Urology, American Society of Andrology, International Society for the Sexual Medicine, Endocrine Society, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.

However, in Japan, it has been decided to recommend the free T level measurement as a LOH diagnostic examination, as specified in the \"Clinical Practice Manual for LOH Syndrome;\" 10 therefore, free T level measurements are widely used in Japan. 11, 12 Late-onset hypogonadism symptoms are logically associated with age-related T deficiencies, and therefore can be reversed by T administration. Such an androgen replacement therapy (ART) can be offered to men with LOH unless there are contraindications such as unstable cardiovascular disease, prostate cancer (PCa), or high hemoglobin levels; however, long-term treatment effects are uncertain. In recent decades, hypogonadism was thought to affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in aging men but was considered unlikely to affect morbidity or mortality. 13 However, recent studies revealed that hypogonadism predicts the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 14 metabolic syndrome (MetS), 15 cardiovascular events, [16] [17] [18] [19] mobility limitation, 20 frailty, 21 and mortality. [16] [17] [18] [19] Although several studies regarding ART efficacy for LOH have been conducted in Western countries, most were small-scale and short-term surveys. Only a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving > 100 patients and durations > 12 months have investigated ART efficacy for LOH. 22, 23 Accordingly, ART is widely used to treat LOH, but evidence-based information regarding its real benefits and short-and long-term risks is not yet available, and therefore whether ART improves HRQoL and conserves daily living activities remains controversial. In addition, no large-scale RCT has investigated ART efficacy for LOH in Asian populations. Because ethnicity may affect serum T levels, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] the results of a larger multicenter, long-term RCT conducted in Asia would be of great interest.\nThe present large-scale study was intended to assess the effects of a 52 weeks ART course with T enanthate on HRQoL in a Japanese population. We examined ART effects on MetS, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), muscular strength, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and sexual functioning in addition to the safety and tolerability of a 52 weeks ART course in this population."}, {"section_title": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "This large-scale, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, RCT was intended to determine ART effects on physical and mental health in patients with LOH.

The raw scores were transformed to a standardized scale ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better status. 29 The AMS score comprises 17 items scored on a five-point scale. The 17 items are distributed over three subdomains: five, seven, five questions address psychological factors, physical factors, and sexual function factors, respectively. The total AMS score defines symptom severity as \"no/little, \" (17-26 points) \"mild,\" (27-36 points) \"moderate,\" (37-49 points) or \"severe\" (\u2265 50 points). 30 Moreover, IPSS for LUTS and IIEF-5 for sexual function were also administered. IPSS contains seven symptom questions that assess weak urine stream, intermittency, and straining (voiding symptoms), frequency, urgency, and nocturia (storage symptoms), and incomplete bladder emptying feeling (postvoiding symptom). The response options range from \"not at all\" (0 points) to \"almost always\" (5 points), with a maximum total of 35 points. 31 The IIEF-5 score comprises only five questions, and each item is scored on a five-point ordinal scale wherein lower values indicate a poorer sexual function. The possible scores for IIEF-5 range from 1 to 25 points (1 question can receive a score from 1 to 5; all others can receive scores from 0 to 5); a score > 21 points is considered normal erectile function, whereas scores at or below this cut-off indicate erectile dysfunction."}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "Bone densitometry and body composition The lumbar vertebral (L2-L4 individually and together) BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the baseline and 52 weeks visits with a Lunar Prodigy instrument (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA).

BMI was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lower rib and iliac crest after normal expiration using a nonstretch measuring tape without placing pressure on the skin. All measurements were performed in duplicate, and the average was used as the value for each circumference; the results were rounded to the nearest 0.1 cm. The systolic and diastolic BPs were measured in duplicate with an automated and calibrated oscillometric device on the left arm with the participant in a seated position after 5 min of rest. The mean systolic and diastolic BPs were then calculated. The isometric hand-grip strength was measured in both the dominant and nondominant hands using a Smedley-type dynamometer (Smedley's Dynamometer TTM, Tokyo, Japan). The participants were instructed to stand with their shoulders adducted and neutrally rotated, their arm in a vertical position and their wrist in a neutral position. Subsequently, each participant squeezed the grip with maximal strength while alternating between the left and right hands. Each test was repeated at least 3 times until no further improvements were observed. The best value for each side was used for the analysis; the values were reported in kilogram-force units.\nAndrogen replacement therapy was associated with a significant decrease in the waist circumference from the baseline compared with the control (P = 0.002); however, no significant difference in the BMI was observed.

Moreover, we revealed ART effects on MetS, body composition, BMD, muscular strength, LUTS, and erectile function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Asian parallel-group RCT-based study on this subject. It is very important to examine whether in an Asian population, ART would exert LOH effects similar to those observed European and American populations because both ethnicity and body composition may affect the serum T levels. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The uncertainty surrounding LOH has resulted in the formulation of several recommendations for its diagnosis and treatment by panels of experts. 7, 9 The biochemical criteria for LOH definition vary somewhat according to the different international societies. In Japan, the Japanese Urological Association and Japanese Association of Men's Health recommend measuring the serum free T levels when diagnosing LOH. 10 Many studies conducted in Western countries did report age-related decreases in the serum total T level;\n1-4 in contrast, three major studies have shown that the total T levels do not decrease with age in the Japanese population.\n11,12,33 Therefore, the total T level cannot be used as a marker in Japan, despite its recommended use in European and American populations. Conversely, there is considerable controversy regarding the best free T measurement method. Although equilibrium dialysis is widely accepted as the \"gold standard\" for measuring free T, 9 it is considered laborious, slow, and expensive. 34 The analog-based free T measurement is a suitable and convenient biochemical LOH syndrome determinant in Japanese men. 12 Consequently, in the Japanese clinical practice manual, ART is recommended as the absolute first-line treatment when the free T level is < 8.5 pg ml \u22121 and should also be considered for men with free T levels < 11.8 pg ml \u22121 . Androgen replacement therapy is thought to exert multifarious effects on the mood, energy, and health. As such, there are many tools for evaluating HRQoL in LOH-affected populations, including generic measures: the SF-36 and the shorter version SF-12; the psychological general well-being index; the sickness impact profile; the 10-point visual analogue quality of life scale; and the Endicott quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), and disease-specific measures: AMS scale; St. Louis University androgen deficiency in aging males scale; and age-related hormone deficiency dependent quality of life questionnaire. 13 Although several RCTs have focused on ART effects on HRQoL, three trials demonstrated significant ART effects on QoL measures; one RCT incorporated the Q-LES-Q 35 and the others used the SF-36 scale. 36, 37 However, other trials have not shown significant ART effect on HRQoL, and therefore, these results remain controversial and imprecise. [38] [39] [40] [41] In a previous RCT that assessed ART effects on HRQoL and subthreshold depression (dysthymia or minor depression), Shores et al. reported that negative ART effects with respect to HRQoL may have been due to the use of insensitive HRQoL measures (SF-36 and Q-LES-Q). 41 A recent study also found no significant differences in the SF-36 and Questions on Life Satisfaction Module scores with the exception of an improvement in one hormone-related QoL section. 42 In contrast to the studies reporting negative ART effects on SF-36, our present study showed a moderate but significant improvement in the role physical subdomain of the SF-36 scale and a tendency toward improvement in the role emotional subdomain.\nThe AMS scale was designed to measure the severity of aging symptoms and their impact on HRQoL; 30 however, the relevance of this scale for LOH diagnosis remained unclear. 22 Most studies have failed to find an association between the total AMS scores and T levels, [43] [44] [45] and only weak correlations have been reported between the AMS scale subdomain scores (psychological, somatovegetative, sexual) and T levels. 45, 46 Moreover, the AMS scale validity, as an instrument for measuring clinical efficacy, is unknown because this tool has not been evaluated in an LOH-specific RCT, although the efficacy has been empirically demonstrated in open-label studies of truly hypogonadal men. 47, 48 In contrast, a recent double-blind RCT demonstrated that long-acting T treatment significantly improved the total AMS scores and psychological and somatovegetative domain scores. 49 In our study, no significant improvement in the ART group was found in total AMS score as well as three AMS sub-score when compared with the control group, which may be partially interpreted by the results of a previous cross-sectional study showing no association between AMS score and circulating T levels. 43 In our study population, the average AMS score at baseline ranged from 34 to 37 points and therefore indicated only \"mild-to-moderate\" severity. For this reason, there was little room for symptom improvement during treatment and again, the treatment response may have been better in patients with more severe symptoms.\nA number of clinical studies on ART effects on MetS and type 2 DM has increased, and a few RCTs were recently conducted to evaluate ART effectiveness in this regard. [50] [51] [52] Moreover, two meta-analyses of these RCTs suggested that ART improves both metabolic glycemic control and visceral obesity. 53, 54 However, no conclusions regarding significant improvements in MetS and type 2 DM could be drawn in studies involving small numbers of patients and short treatment durations. More recently, three cumulative registry studies suggested that long-term T treatment in the elder men with hypogonadism ameliorated type 2 DM and MetS components, 55-57 although these were not RCTs, but uncontrolled studies showing positive T effects without scientific reliable candor and rigor. Our RCT, which included 334 study patients and a treatment duration of 52 weeks, demonstrated that ART significantly reduced TG levels with a concomitant and significant reduction in the waist circumstance, whereas no significant differences were observed in the changes in the T-Chol and HDL-Chol levels between the two groups. In contrast to the positive results reported by previous RCTs, we did not observe improvements in either the hemoglobin A1c or fasting glucose levels in the ART group. It is possible that the reason for this discrepancy in glycemic control may be the characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study; most had a type 2 DM level that required treatment at our university hospital and would therefore have more severe disease compared with patients in previous RCTs.\nA recent meta-analysis revealed beneficial ART effects on the body composition, specifically a significant increase in the lean body mass (2.7 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6, 3.7) and a significant decrease in the fat mass (\u22122.0 kg; 95% CI, \u22123.1, \u22120.8) without a change in body weight. 7 This agrees with our finding that the whole-body muscle mass volume was significantly increased in the ART group. Furthermore, body fat percentage tended to decrease in the ART group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. As both fat loss and muscle gain occurred, there was no change in BMI. However, there was a significant decrease in the waist circumstance in the ART group, indicating reduced visceral obesity, 58 and the different BMI and waist circumstance outcomes are supported by previous studies in which visceral obesity, relative to other obesity subtypes, was more strongly and inversely related to the total and free T levels. 59, 60 Among obese men (BMI > 30), 20%-64% have T levels in the hypogonadal range, which mostly reflects the influence of visceral obesity. 2, 61 ART, however, reduces the waist-hip ratio and weight, 62 and therefore appears to counteract some components of the MetS phenotype. In contrast, a cumulative registry study of 255 men with hypogonadism suggested long-term T treatment produced a significant decrease in the body weight, waist circumstance, and BMI. 63 According to various reports, ART effects on muscle strength remain controversial. Several studies have reported greater improvements in grip strength with ART than with placebo, whereas other studies have reported no significant changes in grip strength. [64] [65] [66] Changes in the lower-extremity muscle strength and physical function measures have only been reported in a few studies with inconsistent results. Recent cross-sectional studies have shown that in aging men, positive correlations exist between the T level and upper and lower extremity muscle strength parameters as measured by the leg extensor and isometric hand grip strength. 67 Moreover, in a clinical review, Cunningham and Toma also mentioned that T effects on muscle strength were heterogeneous and tended toward improvements only in the leg/knee extension and dominant arm handgrip. 68 However, in the present study, there was no difference in the handgrip changes between the sides. One ART inclusion criteria in our study was a free-T level < 11.8 pg ml \u22121 ; dissimilarities in grip strength could be partly explained by differences in the baseline T levels in each study.\nLittle is known regarding whether or not ART has an effect on improvements in LUTS, mainly due to benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) in aging men. Few studies have investigated the relationship between T treatment and LUTS to date. One study identified hypogonadism in approximately 20% of elderly men with LUTS, with no impact on the symptom status. 69 Another found a correlation between symptoms of LUTS and plasma T concentrations. 70 If the severity of LUTS was dependent on declining T levels, ART could alleviate LUTS in men with LOH. Previously, we showed that ART improved LUTS in hypogonadal men, with mild BPH. 71 Recently, Yassin et al. 72 reported that T replacement was associated with amelioration of LUTS in men with LOH, showing a significant decrease in the mean IPSS with time following the initiation of exogenous T. In our study, the IPSS voiding subscore consisting of 3 questions was also significantly improved after 52 weeks of ART, suggesting an increase in the bladder muscle contractility and compliance by T administration.\nSeveral RCTs have shown the benefits of ART for hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction. 73 Recently, two meta-analyses reported that hypogonadal men received some benefits from ART, although the clinical effects were greater on sexual desire than on erectile function and highlighted the requirement for large-scale and long-term RCTs to clarify the ART effects on erectile dysfunction in hypogonadal men. 74, 75 In the present study, although the difference in the IIEF-5 total score change did not reach statistical significance, a significant difference in the change of the IIEF-5 second question score was observed. One reason for the insignificant change in the IIEF-5 total score may be that our study included men with nonsymptomatic hypogonadism who did not always present with erectile dysfunction. Similarly, there was no significant improvement in the AMS sexual subscore in our study. Recently, several clinical studies on ART in hypogonadal men demonstrated no significant improvements in the AMS sexual subscore, in agreement with our study. 22, 49, 76, 77 Prostate cancer incidence is among the greatest ART-related concerns. The prostate is an androgen-sensitive organ, and T administration has been reported to accelerate metastatic PCa progression. 78 Although T supports the growth of existing PCa, previous clinical studies have shown no increased PCa risk from ART. [79] [80] [81] However, recent meta-analyses have reported that the man-years of exposure were too limited to allow a reliable risk assessment. 82, 83 Recently, no correlation or association between T therapy and increased PCa risk, or increased aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis has been reported in a large cohort studies. 84, 85 Moreover, in a population-based observational study of T therapy in men, with a history of PCa, treatment was not colligated with increased overall or cancer-specific mortality. 86 Consequently, there is no clinically significant adverse impact on the PCa incidence and exacerbation by ART. In our 52 weeks study of 334 hypogonadal men, four men in the ART group discontinued T replacement because of rapid PSA elevation; however, we performed no prostate needle biopsies because the serum PSA levels remained within the safe range or decreased after discontinuation. No PCa was observed during our study.\nWe observed a trend toward a greater overall PSA increase in the ART group versus the control group at 28 weeks, although the difference was not significant; the level appeared to decrease in the ART group at 52 weeks. This transient PSA elevation may be explained by the prostate saturation theory, 87 which suggests that PSA and prostate tissue growth are sensitive to changes in serum T only if the serum T levels are low. At low levels, the prostate androgen receptor (AR) lacks bound T and is inactive, causing prostate shrinkage and decreased PSA levels. Conversely, at normal T levels, all available ARs are saturated and active, and further increases in T have no effect on the prostate size or PSA levels. A recent clinical study involving the prostate saturation theory compared serum T and PSA levels during a 12 months ART course in hypogonadal men with varying baseline T levels and found that the greatest PSA level was observed after 1 month of treatment and decreased thereafter, which agreed with our transient overall PSA elevation at 28 weeks. 88 The potential association between ART and cardiovascular events is of concern. Initially, ART was thought to increase cardiovascular disease risks. However, most epidemiological studies have reported no significant difference in the prevalence of cardiovascular events between hypogonadal and eugonadal men. 89 A recent population-based cohort study suggested that low T predicts cardiovascular disease mortality but not death due to other causes. 21 In a prospective population-based study of elderly Swedish men, higher serum T levels were associated with a reduced 5 years cardiovascular events risk. 90 Moreover, two meta-analyses showed that the cardiovascular event risk did not significantly differ between the ART and control groups. 82, 83 In our study, two men in the ART group had cardiovascular events during treatment. Because our study was not sufficiently powered to assess the cardiovascular event risk, this observation should be cautiously interpreted. Our short study duration precludes the drawing of conclusions regarding the cardiovascular event risk with ART. Therefore, large, multicenter, and long-term (several years) clinical studies are required to assess the potential cardiovascular event risk.\nThe limitations of the present study are as follows: (1) participants with LOH were not always symptomatic and most were undergoing medical treatment for type 2 DM; (2) the study design was not a double-blinded, placebo-controlled but a open-labeled, parallel-controlled RCT because no placebo injections correspond to T enanthate and the alternative long-term intramuscular injection of physiological saline was not permitted for ethical reasons; and (3) this RCT was not powered to assess cardiovascular risk debated in recent years. Given these limitations, we could draw conclusions regarding ART effect on Japanese LOH patients, including asymptomatic hypogonadal patients or DM patients receiving treatment, without serious difficulties."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, long-term T enanthate-based ART exerted beneficial effects on the physical role subdomain of the SF-36 scale, TG, waist circumstance, whole-body and leg muscle mass volumes, IPSS voiding subscore, and the second question of IIEF-5 in patients with LOH.\nHowever, there were no significant effects of ART on the other possible androgen-dependent parameters investigated, especially glycemic control, in the present study. Further studies are required to examine the psychological characteristics of patients with LOH, and we hope that our study will contribute to future developments in this area."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "HK, HS, TI, KS, MI, EK, and MN planned, coordinated, and conducted the study.
