While oysters can physiologically tolerate high salinity for extended periods of time, in such conditions they are more vulnerable to marine predators, disease, and parasitism. Tolerance of high or low salinity is significantly diminished at high temperatures, which oysters frequently encounter in Florida.

They improve water quality and clarity as they filter feed, lessen shoreline erosion, and provide a habitat or food source for a wide variety of birds, fish, and invertebrates. Oysters are commercially valuable as a harvested food source, and historically their shell has been mined extensively for construction material. The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is the only reef-building oyster in Florida and forms both subtidal and intertidal reefs. Numerous other species of non-reef-building oysters are less frequent. This report focuses primarily on the eastern oyster, because it is the most abundant oyster in Florida and because it is important as both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer. The survival of an oyster reef depends on its shell budget, which is its rate of shell deposition from new oyster growth relative to the rate of shell loss. The rate of growth is limited by basic biological functions of living oysters (rates of growth and reproduction), while the rate of loss is a function of both biotic (e.g., predation, competition) and abiotic (e.g., salinity, temperature, pH) factors that can affect both living oysters and the shells of deceased oysters.

Significant losses to oyster reefs have occurred due to anthropogenic activities including dredge-and-fill construction, harvesting without substrate replacement, and, in the past, shell mining. Oyster populations must also cope with water pollution, competition with invasive species, sedimentation, and accelerated erosion due to boat wakes. Many of these stressors are increasing as Florida's human population grows. The decline in the Florida oyster population has led to small and often isolated populations spread across Florida's estuaries. Although the long-term and large-scale ramifications of this decline are not well studied, the isolation of these small populations can limit genetic diversity and connectivity between estuaries. Oyster harvesting is permitted in Florida within designated shellfish harvesting areas. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) regulates the opening and closure of these harvesting areas based on health risks to consumers. Both FDACS and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) monitor the waters in these shellfish harvesting areas for bacteria, red tide, and chemical pollutants. FWC reports commercial harvesting yields, which have had mandatory reporting since 1986. Historically 90% of the state's harvests originated from Apalachicola Bay in Franklin County; however, harvests from Apalachicola Bay (and consequently statewide harvests) have declined significantly since the 2012-2013 collapse of the bay's fishery. Large-scale oyster reef mapping relies primarily on georeferenced multispectral or hyperspectral imagery with in situ ground truthing to verify mapping accuracy. Reefs are identified by patterns of color, texture, and shape, but reef identification can be confounded if oysters are intermixed with algae, mud, seagrass, or rubble. Oysters that grow on mangrove roots or seawalls are generally not included in mapping efforts because they are hard to see in aerial imagery. These oysters nevertheless contribute significantly to the oyster population in an estuary. Subtidal reefs can be mapped with side-scan or multibeam sonar or videography with simultaneous acquisition of global positioning system (GPS) data, but ground truthing is necessary to verify the presence of live oysters. Subtidal oyster mapping is complicated by murky water, variable water depth or shallow water, limited benthic relief, and oyster reefs co-occurring with multiple benthic habitats such as seagrass beds and hardbottom. Oyster maps in Florida generally focus on a specific region or estuary. FWC and the Oyster Integrated Mapping and Monitoring Program have compiled available oyster maps across the state, creating the most comprehensive map to date of oyster distribution in Florida (http://geodata.myfwc.com/ datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida). This map identifies more than 7,920 ha (19,580 ac) of live oysters, yet gaps remain, and further mapping efforts are needed in several areas. Oyster monitoring in Florida is conducted by a number of agencies and organizations with a variety of objectives, such as determining the efficacy of hydrologic restoration, the health of oyster fisheries, or the success of restoration efforts, as well as general ecological assessments. While methods used in monitoring programs may vary widely, commonly measured parameters include water quality (salinity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature), reef area, reef height, oyster density, degree of tidal emersion, and oyster size-frequency distribution. The chapters in this report summarize mapping and monitoring programs for oyster reefs in each region of Florida. Content of each chapter includes a general introduction to the region, location-specific threats to oyster reefs, a summary of selected mapping and monitoring programs, and recommendations for oyster management, mapping, and monitoring. Regional figures include the FWC compilation of oyster maps, FDACS shellfish harvesting areas, and oyster harvesting data from 1951 to 2017. Through the process of compiling this report and from feedback provided at the OIMMP workshops, several needs and recommendations were identified for Florida oysters:"}, {"section_title": "Management priorities and recommendations", "text": "\u2022 Manage freshwater flow to mimic natural flow, avoiding rapid salinity changes and prolonged exposure to salinity extremes. \u2022 Add shell and other materials to combat substrate limitation due to extensive harvesting, dredging, or past shell mining.

Updated oyster mapping is needed for the Panhandle (Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, and St. Andrew bays), Big Bend and Springs Coast (Apalachee Bay and subtidal oysters), much of the Everglades, and the Indian River Lagoon (outside of its major tributaries). \u2022 Complete regular mapping: Oyster extent is dynamic as a result of urban development, variability in salinity and temperature, and ongoing changes in freshwater management. Maps of oyster extent should be updated every 5-7 years. Some oyster maps in Florida are significantly out of date; for instance, parts of Apalachee Bay have not been mapped since 1992. \u2022 Map all types of oysters: Intertidal oysters on hardened shorelines or on mangrove roots generally have not been mapped, as they are not easily identifiable from aerial imagery. Sarasota County is one of the few locations in Florida to have a focused oyster mapping effort for these peripheral habitats . Oysters on mangrove roots and seawalls contribute a significant number of individuals to the breeding population in an estuary and provide many of the same ecosystem services as oyster reefs . In more heavily developed estuaries (e.g., Biscayne Bay, Broward County), seawall and mangrove-root oysters may be the dominant form of oyster. Subtidal oyster reefs are also mapped infrequently or not at all, because it is so labor-intensive to map the benthos with sonar. Additional subtidal oyster mapping is needed across the panhandle, Big Bend, Tampa Bay, and possibly other locations where the extent of subtidal oysters is unknown. \u2022 Determine historical extent of oyster reefs: Continue efforts to determine oyster distribution before European settlement using historical records and sedimentary coring techniques. In many regions of Florida, the historical (and sometimes current) extent of oyster reefs is unknown, which hinders decision making regarding targets for future reef extent. \u2022 Differentiate between live and dead extent on oyster reefs: Mapping efforts vary as to whether they distinguish between live or dead oysters on a reef.

This type of standardized and regularly repeated monitoring program is recommended for all estuaries in Florida. While constant monitoring of all reefs in all estuaries may not be logistically feasible, a sample design that allows both regional and local monitoring at appropriate time and spatial scales would provide a better understanding of statewide oyster resources. Long-term monitoring is also needed to gauge the success and sustainability of oyster restoration efforts, which are frequently only monitored for a few years following installation. \u2022 Assess genetic diversity, life history, and habitat characteristics of high-salinity oyster reefs: Several estuaries in Florida are home to significant intertidal populations of oysters that survive in environments with an average salinity range of 30-35 . These locations include lower Tampa Bay, Sarasota Bay, parts of the Ten Thousand Islands, the Mosquito Lagoon, and the southern Loxahatchee River. Oysters in these regions must have some combination of genetic aptitude towards survival at high salinity , adaptive life history traits, or only moderate amounts of parasitism and predation. The intertidal nature of these reefs does provide temporary relief from predation during exposure at low tide, but further study is needed on life history, genetics, and habitat characteristics to determine why certain oyster populations survive in high salinity while others are decimated by predators and disease. \u2022 Quantify size structure of oyster populations: Measuring shell height in an oyster population can provide an easily measured indicator of reef resilience, as large oysters are disproportionately important to reproductive output and shell budgets .

Oysters are vulnerable to rapid changes in salinity and temperature and are less resistant to environmental extremes when they occur simultaneously . Occasional snapshot water quality monitoring often does not capture these extreme events. Autonomous sampling also provides information regarding long-term trends and water quality variability within estuaries."}, {"section_title": "Introduction to oysters in Florida", "text": "The dominant and only reef-forming bivalve in Florida is the eastern oyster, also known as the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica ( Fig. 1.1). The eastern oyster is found intertidally and in shallow subtidal depths along Florida's nearshore and inshore estuarine waters ( Fig. 1.2). Eastern oysters are ecosystem engineers as well as keystone species, and the reefs they build provide a variety of critical ecosystem services to coastal communities (Grabowski et al. 2012). Oyster reefs are commercially valuable as a harvested resource and indirectly valuable for protecting shorelines against erosion Peterson 2007, Scyphers et al. 2011). As filter feeders, oysters improve water quality and clarity by removing nutrients and other pollutants from the water column (Kellogg et al. 2014). The Florida State Wildlife Action Plan (FWC 2012) identifies numerous species of greatest conservation need in Florida as being linked to habitat or food sources provided by oyster reefs, including the eastern oyster itself. Eastern oysters belong to the family Ostreidae, the true oysters. Florida contains several non-reef-forming members of this family including the mangrove oyster (C. rhizophorae), crested oyster (Ostrea stentina), threaded oyster (Teskeyostrea weberi), frond oyster (Dendostrea frons, typically found on soft corals), and possibly the commercial sponge oyster (Ostrea permollis), a Caribbean species. The crested oyster is difficult to distinguish from the eastern oyster without examining the inside of the shell. Florida also has oysters in the family Pteriidae (the pearl or winged oysters), including the scaly pearly oyster (Pinctada longisquamosa), Atlantic pearly oyster (P. imbricata), black-lipped pearly oyster (P. margaritif marine hardbottom. Florida has two native species of foam oysters, the Atlantic (Hyotissa mcgintyi) and deepwater (Neopycnodonte cochlear), as well as one introduced species, the giant foam oyster (H. hyotis) (Forbes 1966, Thayer et al. 2005, Mikkelsen and Bieler 2008."}, {"section_title": "Eastern oyster life history and ecology", "text": "Eastern oysters reproduce via broadcast spawning with external fertilization, while other oysters (e.g. Ost rea spp.) reproduce via internal fertilization and brooding before the release of larvae. Because multiple generations of oysters settle on top of one another, numerous gener-ations of eastern oysters can contribute to a diverse mixture of genotypes during spawning (NOAA 2007). Areas with low oyster density have lower spawning biomass and consequent decreased rates of fertilization (Mann and Evans 1998). Spawning generally requires water temperatures above 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F); while May-October is the peak period in Florida, reproduction may continue year-round in all but the coldest times of the year (Berrigan et al. 1991. After hatching, eastern oysters spend 2-3 weeks as planktonic larvae before settling on a hard substrate (Stallworthy 1979, Kennedy 1996. During settlement, oyster larvae attach to a substrate and metamorphose into their sessile benthic form. Successful recruitment refers to both settlement and some period of postsettlement survival (Wildlish andKristmanson 1997, Baggett et al. 2014). Rates of settlement are generally dictated by larval density, water residence time, water quality, substrate availability, and larval mortality. In contrast, recruitment and postsettlement survival are additionally influenced by rates of predation, environmental stress, and competition with other bivalve species or conspecifics Evans 1998, Baggett et al. 2014). Recruitment is therefore highly variable spatially and temporally (on both seasonal and annual timescales). Estuaries with high rates of flushing tend to have low but more consistent recruitment, while estuaries with low flushing have higher but more variable recruitment (Kennedy 1996). After settling, oysters can reach reproductive maturity in as little as four weeks and grow to a length of 7-8 cm (3 in) in the first 18-24 months in Florida's warm waters (NOAA 2007, FWC 2010, VanderKooy 2012. Most eastern oysters are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning that they begin life as males and later change to primarily female reproductive organs. Some females may revert to male later in life . Spawning and larval development may be reduced in response to high temperatures or abrupt changes in temperature (Kennedy et al. 1996). While oysters are tolerant of extreme high temperatures up to 36-40 \u00b0C (97-104 \u00b0F), their tolerance decreases above 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) if the high temperatures co-occur with disease, low oxygen, or salinity extremes , Coen and Bishop 2015. Tolerance of salinity extremes are similarly limited if combined with higher temperatures . Temperature and salinity influence nearly every aspect of oyster physiology, including feeding, respiration, reproduction, larval life span, growth, and survival . While eastern oysters can briefly tolerate extreme salinity ranging from 5 to 40, prolonged exposure to salinity outside their ideal range of 14 to 28 can harm both subtidal and intertidal populations , Coen and Bishop 2015. Growth and reproduction decrease at low salinity, and oysters can suffer high rates of mortality over a short period under freshwater conditions , Thayer et al. 2005, Turner 2006. While oysters can physiologically tolerate high salinity for extended periods, they are more vulnerable to disease and predation as marine predators and parasites of oysters can survive and reproduce in those saline conditions Bishop 2015, Garland and. Several estuaries in Florida are home to significant populations of oysters that survive in an average salinity range of 30-35 . These populations are predominantly intertidal and so have daily protection from marine predators during exposure at low tide. Oysters in these reefs must have some combination of a reproductive potential that exceeds predation and parasitism or have a genetic aptitude towards survival at high salinity . Eastern oysters in Florida are of two relatively distinct genotypes, which can be differentiated by genetic analyses. The Atlantic coast of the United States from Maine to Cape Canaveral, on the east coast of Florida, predominantly supports the Atlantic coast genetic stock, while the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts from Florida to Texas are home to the Gulf coast genetic stock (Buroker 1983, Hare and Avise 1996, FWC 2010. Marine invertebrate species including bivalves often exist as a metapopulation, a group of spatially separated local populations with some degree of interbreeding and genetic exchange (Kritzer andSale 2006, Bert et al. 2014). For instance, Florida bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus) exhibit genetic exchange between local populations within the larger metapopulation (Bert et al. 2014). The eastern oyster is also such a species; its local populations can be relatively isolated, but interbreeding and larval export sometimes occur (Reeb and Avise 1990, Murray and Hare 2006, Varney et al. 2009, Anderson et al. 2014. Larval export and settlement in neighboring estuaries are key to the maintenance of a population's genetic diversity (Kritzer and Sale 2006). Most of Florida's estuaries once had abundant oyster reefs, but the areal extent of these reefs has declined significantly (see discussion on threats below). When the oyster population in an estuary declines, it reduces the chances that larvae will be exported from that estuary and subsequently imported by a neighboring estuary. As a result, oyster populations in each estuary function largely as an isolated local population with only occasional larval exchange . Detailed genetic analyses are needed to determine the degree of larval export and genetic isolation among Florida's remaining oyster reefs, as genetic diversity is key to oyster populations surviving the variety of environmental stressors they currently face . Oysters grow best in regions where water currents move settled particulates. These currents provide water exchange for feeding and keep oysters from being smothered in sediment, their own feces, or pseudofeces (incorporated particulates expelled by the oyster with mucus that did not pass through the digestive tract) (Lenihan 1999, Levinton et al. 2001. Oysters filter feed on phytoplank-ton, small zooplankton, bacteria, suspended particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter in the water column (Langdon andNewell 1996, Dame et al. 2001). Oysters remove excess organic matter and fine sediments from the water; this filter feeding increases water clarity and improves light conditions for seagrass and other benthic photosynthesizers (Booth and Heck 2009, Peterson and Heck 2001a, 2001b. Additional benefits may occur when the complex structure of oyster reefs entrains sediments by physical processes; these benefits include improved water quality and stabilized reef structure resulting from the filling of pore spaces between shells (Walles et al. 2015). Additionally, algae and associated organisms often form a complex film that encrusts oyster shells and serves as an important food source for invertebrates that live within the microhabitats of oyster reefs."}, {"section_title": "Oyster reefs and shell budgets", "text": "Over many decades, multiple generations of oysters settle upon one another, constructing complex calcium carbonate reefs. Reef accretion depends on the rate of shell deposition relative to rate of shell loss; the balance between the two can be quantified as a shell budget (Powell et al. 2006). Natural shell deposition occurs through the growth and calcification of oysters. Large, longlived oysters are particularly important contributors of shell material . Oyster growth encourages further reef building as shell presence leads to increased settlement of calcifying organisms. For this reason, occasional die-offs can even increase the rate of carbonate addition to the reef (Kidwell and Jablonski 1983). Shell mass can be lost as a result of bioerosion (from boring sponges, worms, and mollusks), chemical degradation, dissolution, subsidence, burial, erosion, and habitat loss due to harvesting or dredging (Powell et al. 2006, Waldbusser et al. 2011. Oyster reefs with a balanced shell budget can maintain their intertidal position or depth in the water column in response to changes in water depth as sea level rises. Yet many oyster reefs in Florida and the eastern United States have negative shell budgets; this shell loss results from a complex set of factors (see discussion on threats, below). Oyster reefs are found in the majority of bays and lagoons in Florida (Fig. 1.2). Local oyster distribution is limited to locations with hard substrates for attachment, such as hardbottom, mangroves (Fig. 1.3), seawalls, pilings, or shell accumulations (FWC 2010. Fringing intertidal oyster reefs occur on the edges of shallow embankments in and around estuaries and lagoons, where they stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion (Scyphers et al. 2011, Hanke et al. 2017. Subtidal reefs are generally found in water less than 4-5 m (13-16 ft) deep (MacKenzie 1996, NOAA 2007. The physical structure of the reef and its associated fauna provide a complex refuge and feeding habitat for many invertebrates including mollusks, echinoderms, fish, crustaceans, flatworms, boring sponges, polychaetes, mammals, and birds ( Fig. 1.4; ASMFC 2007, zu Ermgassen et al. 2016. Over 30 species of greatest conservation need in Florida are linked to habitat or food sources provided by oyster  reefs, including the American Oystercatcher (Haemato pus palliates), the Short-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), the Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), the diamond-backed terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), the peppermint shrimp (Lysmata wurdemanni), and the banded tulip snail (Fasciolaria lilium) (FWC 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Oyster harvesting in Florida", "text": "Oysters have high intrinsic economic value and have been both harvested as a food source and mined for shell , Grabowski et al. 2012. About 98% of Florida's oyster harvests come from the Gulf coast, and 90% of the state's historical harvests originated from Apalachicola Bay in Franklin County (Fig. 1.5;FWC 2010, VanderKooy 2012. Oysters are abundant along the Atlantic coast of Florida, though they are nearly all in intertidal reefs and harvesting is less common. Statewide harvests have varied significantly since 1950 ( Fig. 1.5), largely as a result of varying salinity and the impacts of hurricanes on Apalachicola Bay (Berrigan et al. 1991, FWC 2010. In 2012-2013, a dramatic decline occurred in the oyster fishery in Apalachicola Bay due to a combination of low river flow, increased predation and disease, and removal of substrate by fishing; all these factors led to high mortality and low recruitment , Fisch and Pine 2016. Historical catch data and the fishery collapse in Apalachicola Bay are discussed in detail in Chapter 3 of this report. Oyster decline has been even more dramatic on the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, where commercial harvests have decreased to only 1-2% of previously recorded landings as a result of overharvesting and mortality from parasites (Beck et al. 2011). Oyster populations on the mid-Atlantic coast are now considered to be in poor condition or functionally extinct (Beck et al. 2011). Before the 2012 collapse in Apalachicola Bay, landings and oyster populations in the Gulf of Mexico were more stable than in the mid-Atlantic (NOAA 2007, Beck et al. 2011. The Florida Shellfish Commission was established in 1913 to enact shellfish harvesting laws and implement a leasing program. Since that time, responsibility for shellfish harvesting regulations has passed through several state agencies . Data on historical commercial fishery yields from 1950 through 1983 were generated by a variety of agencies (see Appendix A). Commercial harvest records from 1984 to present are available from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). Commercial landings from all Florida fisheries, including oysters, are available in a report generator that can sort landings by coast, region, or county at https://myfwc.com/research/saltwater/fishstats/ commercial-fisheries/landings-in-florida/ (FWC 2018). Prior to 1986, data on trips and oyster landings were collected voluntarily; the FWC has since recorded this information via a mandatory reporting system . The FWC establishes limits and seasons for both commercial and recreational harvest. Current regulations  County (Apalachicola Bay), the remainder of the west coast of Florida, and the east coast of Florida from 1951 to 2017. Oyster landings data before 1986 were collected under a voluntary reporting system. Data sources: 1951-1983, Berrigan (1990-2017, FWC (2018. for the commercial or recreational harvest of oysters may be found at http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater. States surrounding the Gulf of Mexico require a market size of at least 7.6 cm (3.0 in) shell height for oysters harvested from public reefs, but in Florida this size limit does not apply to private oyster leaseholders (VanderKooy 2012). Commercial oyster landings in Florida are reported as pounds of oyster meats. Conversion factors for commercial landings of oysters and other marine species may be found at https://myfwc.com/media/9085/sumfact.pdf. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) divides Florida into shellfish management areas (Fig. 1.6) and issues leases for the cultivation of oysters. Shellfish management areas are classified into sections that are deemed approved, conditionally approved, conditionally restricted, restricted, or prohibited for shellfish harvest. As filter feeders, oysters may accumulate harmful substances including heavy metals, toxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs), pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and viruses like Norovirus. Therefore, bays in Florida in which oysters are commercially harvested for human consumption are monitored for bacteria, red tide, and other pollutants by FDACS and FWC. FDACS can issue closures of shellfish harvest areas when oysters are not safe for consumption. The regional status of shellfish harvesting areas in Florida is available at http://shellfish.floridaaquaculture.com/ seas/seas_statusmap.htm. Oyster shells have been dredged or mined in Florida for use in road construction, in decorative projects such as driveways and walkways, or as material for oyster settlement (known as cultch) for oyster restoration efforts (Whitfield 1975). Extensive shell deposits across Florida can be found in middens from centuries of harvesting by indigenous populations (Dame 2009, Saunders andRusso 2011). Oyster shells were mined extensively in Florida from shell middens as well as from submerged and intertidal oyster reefs. Before 1947, companies could dredge shell from live oyster reefs that were deemed unproductive, so long as an artificial reef was constructed as replacement. But productive reefs were sometimes targeted for dredging, and restored extent often fell short of the original reefs (Whitfield 1975). Extensive shell dredging operations led to a decline in suitable oyster habitat in several estuaries due to a lack of suitable hard substrate and excess sedimentation (Whitfield 1975). Because oysters provide essential ecosystem services and are so important economically, a great deal of effort is being exerted to enhance or restore oyster reefs. Restoration objectives may focus on increasing harvest potential or improving the value of the ecosystem services provided by oyster reefs. Oyster settlement is encouraged in many areas of Florida through the provision of cultch such as bagged or unconsolidated natural or fossil shell ( Fig. 1.7; Brumbaugh et al. 2006. Management practices for fisheries often include replacing harvested substrate with cultch. As shell and fossil shell become more expensive or difficult to find, some oyster restoration projects, especially large commercial reefs, have switched to various types of rock, especially limestone. A variety of other alternative substrates can also be used in oyster reef restoration (concrete, porcelain, sandstone, granite, clam shell, engineered options, etc.; Goelz 2017). The Oyster Restoration Workgroup website, available at http://www. oyster-restoration.org, presents an array of resources regarding site selection, materials, gear, implementation, monitoring, and reports of oyster restoration projects."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oyster reefs", "text": "Globally, oyster reef habitat has declined by more than 85%, and remaining habitats are often in poor condition (Beck et al. 2011). In the United States, oyster spatial extent has decreased by as much as 64%, and oyster biomass has declined by 88% (zu Ermgassen et al. 2012). Worldwide, declines are due primarily to unsustainable harvesting practices in combination with disease, pollution, sedimentation, and competition with nonnative species (Beck et al. 2009, Beck et al. 2011, Gillies et al. 2015. The loss of this keystone species can alter the trophic structure of an estuary. For example, in the Chesapeake Bay, dramatic declines in oyster populations have been linked to increased occurrences of hypoxia and shifting food chain dominance from benthic to pelagic organisms (Ulanowicz and Tuttle 1992, Thayer et al. 2005, Breitburg and Fulford 2006. Although Florida oyster populations were considered to be more stable than those in many other regions (Beck et al. 2011, zu Ermgassen et al. 2012, the State still classifies reefs as being in relatively poor and declining condition with a very high level of habitat threat (FWC 2012). It is estimated that 80-90% of oyster reefs have been lost in several Florida estuaries . Although Apalachicola Bay historically dominated state harvests, it suffered serious declines in 2012-2013 and has not recovered ( Fig. 1.5; . The most critical stressors identified in Florida's State Wildlife Action Plan include altered hydrologic regimes, altered water quality, and habitat disturbance (FWC 2012). These and other threats are described in further detail below. Altered hydrology and salinity: Altered hydrology as a result of stormwater management, canalization, freshwater withdrawal, and coastal development is the most significant threat to bivalve habitats in Florida (FWC 2012. Altered hydrology and low flushing can lead to extreme salinity events, increased sedimentation, low oxygen levels, and increased temperature. Channelization reduces sheetwater flow through coastal wetlands and concentrates freshwater runoff, reducing salinity around outflows beyond levels optimal for oyster growth and reproduction (Thayer et al. 2005, Turner 2006. Conversely, freshwater withdrawal, diverted stormwater runoff, and drought conditions can increase estuarine salinity, making oysters more vulnerable to predation and disease (Coen and Bishop 2015). Rapidly changing or seasonally variable salinity can also have detrimental effects on fish and invertebrate communities associated with oyster reefs (Tolley et al. 2006) but may provide relief from predation and disease. A large number of oyster reefs in Florida are stressed by salinity extremes brought about by altered hydrology, particularly in south Florida, Apalachicola Bay, and the Big Bend . The locations of oyster reefs have even shifted inshore or upriver in the Big Bend and the Everglades, following the lower salinity regimes ). Predation: Rates of predation and density of predators (native and nonnative) on oyster reefs are influenced by a variety of physical factors including salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (Eggleston 1990, White and Wilson 1996. High salinity allows for the survival of marine predators, making oysters vulnerable to high rates of predation. Predators of eastern oysters include crown conchs (Melongena corona), oyster drills (Stramonita haemas toma and Urosalpinx cinerea), mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and occasionally lightning whelks (Sinistrofulgur sinistrum) ( Fig. 1.8; . Predation occurs statewide, but high mortality due to predation has especially been noted in Apalachicola Bay and the Big Bend following periods of increased salinity . Development: Oysters are subject to direct habitat loss as a result of coastal development, shoreline hardening, and dredging, but they are also indirectly vulnerable to diminished water quality and increased pollutants and sedimentation associated with coastal development . Hardened shorelines interrupt the transition area from upland to benthic habitat. While seawalls often provide a substrate for oyster settlement, the surface area is often smaller than that of the intertidal habitat they replace. Reflected wave energy from seawalls can also undermine potential adjacent oyster habitat. Oyster habitat has been lost to development across Florida, most notably in areas of high population density such as Tampa Bay, Sarasota Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Naples Bay, and much of southeast Florida. Substrate loss: The physical removal of oyster reefs and associated shell through harvesting, mining, construction, or dredging reduces the overall reef footprint and available substrate for settlement of new oysters. While reefs naturally lose substrate through degradation and dissolution, ocean acidification also presents challenges for all calcifying marine and estuarine organisms and is expected to lower rates of calcification and survival while increasing shell degradation , Waldbusser et al. 2011. Substrate loss due to mining historically was common across Florida (particularly in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor). Continued loss to live harvesting remains a concern and has had a particularly detrimental impact on reef extent in Apalachicola Bay and Suwannee Sound . Hypoxia: While oysters can tolerate occasional exposure to low dissolved oxygen, hypoxia and anoxia decrease settlement, growth rate, and survival Mann 1992, Johnson et al. 2009). Dissolved oxygen under 2 mg/L can cause mortality in subtidal oysters and associated reef fauna . Benthic hypoxia may arise when water bodies are stratified as a result of freshwater flow or limited vertical mixing (Woithe and Brandt- Williams 2006). Water bodies with limited flushing, such as the Indian River Lagoon, are also susceptible to hypoxia, particularly in warm summer temperatures when oxygen solubility is low (FDEP 2014). Areas with high sedimentation of organic matter are also prone to decomposition-induced benthic hypoxia . Subtidal oyster reefs with sufficient vertical relief that elevates them off the bottom are less often exposed to hypoxic conditions (Coen and Humphries 2017). Intertidal oyster reefs encounter hypoxia less often as they are periodically submerged in surface water that has higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Coen and Humphries 2017). Disease and parasitism: Two protozoan diseases can cause high mortality in oyster populations. Perkinsus mari nus causes the disease dermo and Haplosporidium nelsoni causes the disease MSX Tripp 1996, Fisher et al. 1999). Dermo is present in waters throughout Florida, although typically at a low intensity . The disease is usually recognized as a weakening factor for oysters rather than a primary cause of mortality in Florida. Dermo may have been a contributing factor to an oyster die-off in Pensacola Bay in 1971, although there was also poor water quality at the same time (USEPA 2004). MSX, first noted in the United States in the late 1950s, is present from Maine to northeast Florida and can cause local die-offs of as much as 90% mortality (Burreson et al. 2000). MSX has never been detected in the Gulf of Mexico (Ford et al. 2011), and its presence in Atlantic Florida waters is not pathogenic (Burreson andFord 2004, Walters et al. 2007). Infestations of boring sponges (Fig. 1.9), polychaetes, and boring mollusks can also harm oysters and make shells more vulnerable to predators or breakage; this forces the oyster to dedicate more energy toward shell repair and away from growth and reproduction (Buschbaum et al. 2007, VanderKooy 2012. Oysters are more susceptible to these diseases and parasites at higher salinity (Camp et al. 2015, Coen andBishop 2015). Boating impacts: Boat wakes can cause significant local damage and erosion on intertidal oyster reefs, harming both established adults and new recruits . Erosion of intertidal reefs and salt marshes from boat wakes is a significant problem in many parts of northeast Florida, particularly along the Intracoastal Waterway. Mosquito Lagoon oyster reefs have extensive dead margins and in some cases have been reduced to intertidal sand flats as a result of erosion from boat wakes . Sedimentation: Excessive sedimentation due to dredging or the lack of water currents can bury oysters and impede filter feeding and respiration (Thayer et al. 2005, Coen andHumphries 2017). Many of the reefs in Naples Bay were buried due to dredging, and seismic profiling has revealed remnant reefs buried below sediment . Shell removal can also increase sedimentation on reefs, which can smother remaining oysters on low-relief reefs (Berrigan et al. 1991, Breitburg 1999, Lenihan 1999. Bottom currents help protect subtidal oysters from burial in sediments or their own feces and pseudofeces. Overharvesting: Until recently, the oyster fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico were described as one of the last remaining areas in the United States (and perhaps globally) for which oyster conservation and sustainable wild fisheries were feasible (Beck et al. 2011). Areas such as Apalachicola Bay that have historically been central to the oyster fishery along the Gulf now face significantly reduced harvests as a result of numerous stressors including salinity variability, tropical storms and hurricanes, and substrate loss , NASEM 2017. While overharvesting is seldom considered a primary threat to oyster populations in Florida (in the sense that harvest does not limit recruitment; NOAA 2007, FWC 2012, FWC 2013, the substrate depletion associated with harvest may constitute a form of overfishing that results in loss of essential habitat , NASEM 2017. The effects of fishing pressure and substrate removal are of growing concern, particularly when paired with altered hydrology and sea-level rise. Chemical contamination: Pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides enter the estuarine environment through runoff. Herbicides or antifouling chemicals such as tributyltin (TBT) can inhibit oyster growth, cause shell thickening, increase disease abundance, or decrease disease resistance (Alzieu 1998, Fisher et al. 1999. According to Mussel Watch, a U.S. program that monitors bivalve contaminants, oysters at many sites in Florida have elevated levels of arsenic, copper, mercury, or lead . Contamination by crude oil can also have detrimental impacts on oyster health (Barszcz et al. 1978). Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the densities of spat, juvenile to young adult oysters, and market-size oysters decreased in several Gulf states , NASEM 2017. However, there is no evidence that the oil spill contaminated seafood from Apalachicola Bay . Competition: Invasive species such as the striped barnacle (Balanus amphitrite), Asian green mussel (Per na viridis), charru mussel (Mytella charruana), and pink titan acorn barnacle (Megabalanus coccopoma) compete against native oysters for space and resources (Boudreaux 2003. The presence of nonnative species can decrease larval settlement and survival of juveniles . When present in high densities, native oysters and nonnative mussels may also compete with each other as they grow and mature . A native of the Indo-Pacific, the Asian green mussel (Fig. 1.10) has established populations on both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida . While cold weather can cause die-offs and restrict expansion of the mussel, the range of this invasive species is expected to grow in the southeastern United States as a result of climate change (Firth et al. 2011, Urian et al. 2011. Climate change: Rising sea level, altered precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, and ocean acidification all pose significant threats for oysters (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno 2010, . \u2022 Sea-level rise: Intertidal exposure offers oysters refuge from predation, pests, and disease . Increased submergence times and salinity lead to increased susceptibility to predation and pathogens . As the rate of sea-level rise continues to accelerate, intertidal oysters will need to migrate landward or accrete sufficient substrate if they are to keep pace with water depth . Similarly, subtidal reefs will need to colonize substrates with higher elevations or grow vertically to maintain viable depths. Oyster reefs with balanced shell budgets and manageable stressors are the most likely to keep pace with sea-level rise, as new shell material will enable the reef to grow vertically into the space provided by the rising water . Reduced recruitment due to sea-level rise may move oyster reefs toward a shell budget deficit, as shell loss reduces carbonate supply and hampers reef building . Sea-level rise also causes estuaries to be increasingly saline and pushes seawater further up the estuary. Depending on the shape of the estuary, this shift can decrease the geographic area for which the salinity is suitable for oyster growth. As estuaries become more saline, oysters will become more vulnerable to predation, disease, and harmful algal blooms ). \u2022 Altered precipitation patterns: Global warming alters precipitation patterns by increasing evaporation and increasing the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere (Trenberth 2011). This effect can exaggerate weather patterns, including droughts and floods. Regions in Florida, such as parts of the southeast and southwest coast, Apalachicola Bay, and Suwannee Sound, that have historically been susceptible to high salinity as a result of both low precipitation and freshwater withdrawal, will continue to be vulnerable to more extreme variations in precipitation , SWFWMD 2015. \u2022 Increasing temperatures: Oysters in Florida are already coping with temperatures near the upper limit of their physiological tolerance. Not only are oysters more susceptible to disease in high temperatures, but they can suffocate because the solubility of oxygen decreases as temperatures rise. Increased temperatures also can change the timing and frequency of oyster spawning (Hofmann et al. 1992, Wilson et al. 2005 and reduce larval survival and settlement . Not only will increasing temperatures expose oysters to temperature extremes more often, but also a lack of critical cool temperatures during winter months may force oysters to allocate energy toward survival and reduce energy input toward growth and reproduction . High temperatures have also been shown to disproportionately affect large oysters as oxygen diffusivity decreases and disease intensity increases with body size (Forster et al. 2012, Waples and. This phenomenon can result in the loss of large oysters , which are disproportionately important to reproduction and shell budgets ). \u2022 Ocean acidification: Ocean acidification results from an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide which dissolves in water, reducing carbonate ion concentrations in the water column and lowering pH. These changes make it difficult for calcifying organisms such as oysters to produce shell and can enhance dissolution of existing shell material , Waldbusser et al. 2011. Eastern oyster larvae reared under acidic conditions have shown stunted shell growth and reduced calcium content ."}, {"section_title": "Mapping oyster reefs", "text": "The choice of techniques used to map oyster reefs depends on the size of the area to be mapped, which can vary from an individual restored reef (typically < 1 ha) to the regional or even statewide scale (thousands of ha). Relatively small intertidal reefs can be mapped directly by walking around the perimeter of oyster beds while they are exposed at low tide with a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) or differential GPS (dGPS) . A surveyor's measuring wheel or transect tape may also be used to measure the perimeter, length, or width of the reef. Geographic information system (GIS) software may then be used to document the location and calculate reef areal coverage or reef footprint. For larger scales, oyster reefs are mapped from georeferenced multispectral or hyper-spectral imagery , Le Bris et al. 2016. These remote images may be collected at low tide using satellites, airplanes, balloons, or drones. Oyster reefs are identifiable in aerial photographs by patterns of light and dark, texture, and shape . In traditional photo-interpretation, a person visually identifies oyster reefs in aerial images. This process can be automated or semiautomated using various object-recognition software packages , SCDNR 2008. All methods of remote sensing require some ground truthing for assessing the accuracy of the mapping products, which, for intertidal reefs, may be conducted by visual validation at low tide (SCDNR 2008. Reef identification from aerial photography can be confounded if oysters are covered in mud or intermixed with algae, seagrass, rubble, or darkly colored sediment , Vincent 2006, SCDNR 2008, Le Bris et al. 2016. The spectral signature of reflectance will also vary depending on vertical or horizontal orientation of individual oysters, the sun's angle, and seasonally variable algal growth (Vincent 2006, SCDNR 2008, Le Bris et al. 2016. In Florida, the mangrove canopy can hide fringing oyster reefs and oysters growing on mangrove roots (Fig.  1.11). Mapping based on remote imagery is only possible on reefs with a horizontal footprint. Oysters growing on mangrove roots or seawalls are seldom mapped because these peripheral habitats are difficult to see in aerial photography, but those oysters still contribute significantly to an estuary's population . Subtidal reefs can be mapped indirectly with sidescan or multibeam sonar and simultaneous acquisition of RTK GPS or dGPS data (Allen et al. 2005. Acoustic backscatter of side-scan sonar data allow for differentiation between strong and weak acoustic returns, which provide, respectively, some indication of hard and soft substrate (Preston andCollins 2003, Twichell et al. 2007). A high-quality depth finder that uses side-scan technology may also be used to detect changes in bottom type. Multibeam sonar can extract additional directional information from the acoustic return of hundreds to thousands of points simultaneously, providing a high-resolution image with wide swath coverage. Single-beam so-nar methods are less expensive than multibeam, but they provide data from a narrower footprint (Twitchell et al. 2007, Grizzle et al. 2008. Tidal depth is a critical concern in mapping using acoustic methods because shallow water limits boat access and the width of the sonar swath (Preston and Collins 2003). Divers, poles, or tongs can be used to validate the presence of live subtidal oysters . In areas with high water clarity, mapping can be completed using underwater video imagery with simultaneous collection of RTK GPS or dGPS data. Underwater videography can map oyster reefs with high accuracy, but it covers a small swath and is greatly restricted by low-visibility conditions (Grizzle et al. 2005(Grizzle et al. , 2008. Videography may also be used in combination with ground truthing to obtain information such as ratio of live to dead oysters, mean oyster size, or density (Grizzle et al. 2005(Grizzle et al. , 2008. Subtidal oyster mapping is complicated by murky water, variable water depth, limited vertical relief, and oyster reefs interspersed with multiple benthic habitats such as seagrass beds and hardbottom."}, {"section_title": "Classification of oyster reef habitats", "text": "Benthic habitat maps use a variety of classification schemes, which are often hierarchical in structure. Most maps simply group all oyster structures into one category, but oyster habitats may be further subdivided based upon characteristics such as shell density, mean size, live/dead, reef complexity, dominant species, tidal exposure, or reef height (Table 1.1, . This report does not distinguish between reefs of differing vertical heights and refers to all oyster structures as reefs. However, some publications may refer to an oyster structure with a relief of less than 0.5 m (1.6 ft) as an oyster bed (Beck et al. 2009, Gillies et al. 2015. Oysters growing on structures, such as mangrove roots, seawalls, or pilings, have sometimes been termed aggregations (ASMFC 2007, Beck et al. 2009. Relevant statewide and national classification schemes that include classification of oyster reefs are summarized in Table 1.1 and explained in further detail below. The Florida Land Use and Cover Classification System (FLUCCS) was created by the Surveying and Mapping Office of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The original classifications were published in 1985 (FDOT 1985) and revised in 1999 (FDOT 1999).  , FGDC 2013 Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Classification System NOAA National Marine/estuarine reef = Mollusk reef Klemas et al. 1993, Dobson et al. 1995 Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) FGDC National Geoform origin: biogenic = Geoform: mollusk reef = Fringing mollusk reef = Linear mollusk reef = Patch mollusk reef = Washed shell mound Substrate: biogenic = Shell substrate = Shell reef substrate < Oyster reef substrate = Shell rubble < Oyster rubble = Shell hash < Oyster hash Biotic setting: Benthic/attached biota = Reef biota = Mollusk reef biota < Oyster reef = Faunal bed = Attached fauna < Attached oysters = Soft sediment fauna < Oyster bed FGDC 2012 = 6000 Wetlands: areas where the water table is at or near the surface of the land for a significant portion of most years = 6500 Non-vegetated: Hydric surfaces lacking vegetation < 6540 Oyster bars The System for Classification of Habitats in Estuarine and Marine Environments (SCHEME) was developed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by FWC in an effort to make a standardized, hierarchical classification system for Florida (Madley et al. 2002). Relevant SCHEME classifications include: = 3. Reef/hardbottom: region dominated by calcium carbonate substrate formed by reef building organisms = 32. Mollusk reefs: concentration of sessile mollusks attached to a hard substrate < 321. Bivalve reef: oyster reef, partially exposed at low tide The Guide to the Natural Communities of Florida was first published in 1990 by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI 1990) and updated in 2010. Relevant FNAI (2010) classifications include: = Marine and estuarine: includes subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal zones = Mollusk reef: subtidal or intertidal area with concentration of sessile mollusks The Florida Land Cover Classification System (Kawula 2009, updated in Kawula 2014 and Kawula and Redner 2018) was developed to create a single land cover classification scheme for Florida by integrating established classification systems. The Florida Land Cover Classification System's hierarchy is based upon other mapping schemes including the FNAI's Guide to the Natural Communities of Florida (FNAI 1990) and FLUCCS classifications (FDOT 1999). Relevant classifications include: = 5000 Estuarine = 5200 Intertidal < 5230 Oyster bar Sarasota County developed a Methods Manual for Field Mapping of Oysters for detailed mapping in Sarasota Bay and adjacent tidal creeks . Methods are based upon FWC protocols that were used to map oyster habitat in Tampa Bay. The training manual fully describes each category with accompanying photo-graphs and provides protocols and data sheets for mapping . Specific classifications include the following: = Shell (S): single shells, usually dead, scattered densely enough along a shoreline that a person would step on shells when walking through the area = Scattered shell (SS): same as above, but shells are less dense, such that a person could walk through the area without stepping on shells = Oyster clumps (C): clusters of two or more oysters that are cemented together; oysters may be live or dead. Clumps are dense enough that a person would step on shells when walking through the area = Scattered oyster clumps (SC): same as above, but clumps are less dense, such that a person could walk through the area without stepping on clumps = Oyster reef (R): includes patch reefs and string reefs, which may or may not be attached to the mainland and may or may not include mangroves growing out of the shell substrate in the center of the reef = Oyster clumps/reef (CR): central solid oyster reef surrounded by clumps or scattered clumps = Mangrove apron (MA): solid oyster reef growing in a narrow band around mangroves that are growing in sediment (not on a reef substrate). May be attached to the mainland or surrounding a mangrove island. Also known as a fringe oyster reef = Mangrove root oysters (MRO): oysters grow on the prop roots and drop roots of Rhizophora man gle (red mangrove). May be single shells or clumps = Seawall (SW), riprap (RR), pilings (P), or floating docks (D): oysters grow on solid structures such as seawalls, bulkheads, and riprap rather than on bottom substrate. Thickness and vertical height of oyster aggregations are subdivided, and oysters are classified as solid or scattered along the substrate: = Light: 1 or 2 layers of oysters in a band less than 15 cm (6 in) wide = Medium: more than 1 layer of oysters in a band 15-30 cm (6-12 in) wide = Heavy: more than 1 layer of oysters in a band 30-46 cm (12-18 in) wide = Very heavy: more than 1 layer of oysters in a band >46 cm (18 in) wide < Solid: solid stretch of oysters along the seawall or riprap < Scattered: sporadic stretch of oysters along the seawall or riprap The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) and the NOAA Coastal Services Center mapped the coastline of South Carolina using multispectral imagery (SCDNR 2008). The effort included the development of classification system for oyster reefs, largely using different spectral signatures as a result of vertical or horizontal orientation of the oysters. The project report (SCDNR 2008) describes each category with accompanying photographs and provides protocols for classifying aerial imagery. Classes and oyster strata include the following: = Class 1: background (no oysters) = Class 2: vertical and horizontal oysters mixed, little or no mud or washed shell = Stratum A: dense oyster clusters with little exposed dead shell or mud = Stratum E: oysters tightly clustered on rocks, may have mud or Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) between clusters = Stratum F: vertical clusters with spatial separation. Substrate between clusters consists of shells with few horizontal live oysters and little mud = Stratum F1: small, vertical clusters on a substrate of single, horizontal oysters. Very little exposed mud = Class 3: vertical oysters on a substrate of mud with few to no horizontal oysters = Stratum C: vertical clusters with up to 1 m spatial separation. Substrate between clusters is usually mud with little surrounding shell = Stratum G: close vertical clustered oysters separated by mud with little to no shells or oysters = Class 4: horizontal oysters mixed with washed shells = Stratum B: little to no vertical oysters and few clusters, oysters frequently single. Found on heavily shelled substrate in the lower intertidal zone = Stratum D: mostly horizontal dead oyster shell with little live crop, generally found in lower intertidal zone = Class 5: washed shell The Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States, developed by  for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, was updated by the Federal Geographic Data Committee in 2013 (FGDC 2013). Classification codes directly relevant to oyster reefs include E1RF2L, E2RF2M, and E2RF2N. Oysters that are mixed with unconsolidated substrate may be classified as E2RF2/US2N, E2RF2/USM. The hierarchical structure of these relevant classifications is as follows: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) uses its own classification system. The original classification system was described in Klemas et al. (1993), and an updated summary is available in Dobson et al. (1995), which also explains how the land cover categories compare to Cowardin et al.'s (1979) classes. Relevant classifications include: = Class: marine/estuarine reef: ridge or moundlike structure made from sedentary invertebrates = Subclass: mollusk reef The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) was created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee and the Marine and Coastal Spatial Data Subcommittee (FGDC 2012). CMECS is a hierarchical classification scheme designed to use common terminology to classify marine and estuarine habitats. CMECS includes classifications based on two settings (biogeographic and aquatic) and four components (wa-ter column, geoform, substrate, and biotic). The relevant hierarchical classifications for oyster reefs in the geoform, substrate, and biotic components are listed below. = Geoform origin: biogenic: physical features created by organisms, most commonly reefs made by corals, mollusks, or worm tubes = Geoform: mollusk reef: shell reefs intermixed with channels and unvegetated flats < Geoform type: fringing mollusk reef: narrow, linear reefs; generally intertidal and lower than the marsh along tidal creeks < Geoform type: linear mollusk reef: narrow, ridgelike reefs; generally intertidal and in areas with small tidal range < Geoform type: patch mollusk reef: mounded reefs with vertical relief above surrounding substrate; usual intertidal, occasionally subtidal < Geoform type: washed shell mound: accumulations of loose, dead shell in the high intertidal zone = Substrate origin: biogenic substrate: majority of substrate is of nonliving biogenic origin rather than geologic or anthropogenic origin = Substrate class: shell substrate: substrate made of shells or shell fragments; may or may not include live reef-building fauna < Substrate subclass: shell reef substrate: cemented, conglomerated, or self-adhered shell reefs with median particle size >4 m = Substrate group: oyster reef substrate < Substrate subclass: shell rubble: shells with a median particle size of 0.064-4 m; may be loose, cemented, or conglomerated = Substrate group: oyster rubble < Substrate subclass: shell hash: loose shell, broken or whole, with median particle size of 2-64 mm = Substrate group: oyster hash = Biotic setting: benthic/attached biota: biota live on or in the substrate = Biotic class: reef biota: reef-building fauna construct biogenic substrates < Biotic subclass: mollusk reef biota: living and dead mollusks or gastropods aggregate and attach in sufficient numbers to make a substrate = Biotic group: oyster reef: mounds or ridges formed by live oysters cementing to the substrate of live and dead conspecifics = Biotic communities: Crassostrea reef, Ostrea reef = Biotic class: faunal bed: seabed dominated by benthic fauna that have not created a reef < Biotic subclass: attached fauna: dominated by fauna that maintain contact with a hard substrate = Biotic group: attached oysters: oysters attach to a hard substrate other than conspecifics = Biotic communities: attached Crassostrea, attached Ostrea < Biotic subclass: soft-sediment fauna: sand or mud with dominant presence of infauna, epifauna, or mobile fauna that create burrows = Biotic group: oyster bed: sand or mud with low densities of oysters that are not attached to a hard substrate. = Biotic communities: Crassostrea bed, Ostrea bed"}, {"section_title": "Recent oyster mapping data in Florida", "text": "Oyster mapping data sets in Florida are often limited to a specific estuary or region. The FWC and OIMMP have combined many of these maps to create a statewide oyster map. This GIS shapefile is updated periodically and was used to create the maps in this report. The shapefile is available for download at http://geodata.myfwc.com/ datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida. A listing of selected largescale data providers, including the FWC compilation, is compiled in Table 1.2 and summarized in further detail below. These and other smaller-scale mapping efforts are described in the regional chapters of this report. While land classification schemes vary across agencies (Table  1.1) and may subdivide different types of oyster habitat, many maps simply plot oyster extent using one category. Land cover maps vary widely among agencies due to variable classification schemes, image resolution, and minimum mapping units. Oyster reef maps are subject to similar variability but also suffer from gaps as mapping efforts are generally regional and often focus on either subtidal or intertidal reefs. For more than 30 years, the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) has generated and updated highly detailed wetland maps following Cowardin et al.'s (1979) classification scheme using a variety of methods and data sources, including aerial images (Dahl et al. 2015). Most recently, NWI maps are available online at http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/index.html. The effort fo-cused primarily on wetlands, but mollusk reefs are included in available maps. Not all bays in the state with oyster reefs included labeled mollusk reefs under the NWI scheme. The Florida Water Management Districts (WMDs) periodically complete their own assessments of land use and land cover (LULC) in their jurisdictions. Land-cover analysis is based on remote imagery using FLUCCS categories (FDOT 1999)   . LULC data are available on the water management district websites (Table 1.2). The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) conducts periodic seagrass and oyster mapping within its district boundaries using a modified version of FLUCCS (FDOT 1999). Subtidal habitats are mapped using natural color aerial photography collected in winter at a scale of 1:24,000. Mapped habitats include tidal flats, oyster bars, beaches, patchy seagrass, and continuous seagrass. Dead and live oysters were mapped together to form the oyster bar classification. Map files may be downloaded from the district website https://dataswfwmd.opendata.arcgis.com/. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) mapped live and dead oyster reefs within the Northern Coastal Basin of Florida with the use of aerial photographs and a custom photo-interpretation key of oyster reef types. There was no minimum mapping unit. Field verification determined that the maps were 96% accurate. The data set is available for download at http:// data-floridaswater.opendata.arcgis.com/. FWC created the Oyster Beds in Florida GIS data set by compiling mapping data from a variety of sources. This map is a compilation of multiple studies and methodologies and was greatly expanded upon by OIMMP. Sources of data include the WMDs, FWC, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and university and city mapping efforts for seagrass, oysters, or general benthic habitat mapping. The data set is regularly updated and is available for download at http://geodata.myfwc.com/ datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida. Although this is the most comprehensive oyster map available for Florida, gaps remain. There is need for updated detailed mapping in the panhandle (Perdido, Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, and St. Andrew bays), Big Bend and Springs Coast (for Apalachee Bay and subtidal oysters), much of the Everglades, and the Indian River Lagoon (outside of its tributaries). The Cooperative Land Cover Map (CLC) is a collaboration between FNAI and FWC to support the goals of the Florida Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (FNAI and FWC 2010). The CLC project compiles data from various sources and integrates them using aerial photography and local data collections. Data were obtained from Florida WMD LULC data, local mapping efforts, aerial photographs, and interviews with local experts (FNAI and FWC 2010). Each data set is assigned a confidence category to determine which data set takes precedence over other data sets with conflicting maps. Due to the diverse array of data sources, multiple land classification systems are used (FNAI 1990, FDOT 1999, Kawula 2014. All classifications are related to the Florida Land Cover Classification System (Kawula 2009). Mapping layers are updated approximately every six months and can be downloaded at http://myfwc.com/ research/gis/applications/articles/Cooperative-Land-Cover. The Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas (http://gulfatlas.noaa. gov/), created by NOAA, compiles data from other sources. The oyster mapping layer for Florida is compiled from sources such as the water management districts, USGS, FWC, The Nature Conservancy, and the National Estuarine Research Reserves in the state. The data atlas includes an online mapping program that enables the viewing of maps for distribution of oysters and other invertebrates."}, {"section_title": "Oyster reef monitoring", "text": "Oyster monitoring in Florida is performed by a variety of state and local governments, water management districts, preserves, reserves, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. The goals of these efforts include monitoring the efficacy of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program (CERP) , the health of oyster fisheries (FDACS 2012), the success of restoration efforts (Brumbaugh et al. 2006), identifying long-term changes , and providing general ecological assessments   al. 2016). A variety of other parameters is also used, depending on objectives and goals of the monitoring. These parameters are briefly described below; see cited references for further detail. Reef areal dimensions and footprint include the area of the reef (the summed area of patches of living and nonliving oyster shell or other substrate material) and reef footprint (entire area of the reef complex, including gaps between small patch reefs) (Baggett et al. 2014). Al-ternatively, data may be collected on the percent cover of oysters within the footprint (Coen et al. 2004). Data on reef area is collected with the same methodologies used to map oyster reefs (see previous section), which includes walking the perimeter of the reef with an RTK GPS or dGPS, use of aerial or underwater imagery, or use of sidescan or multibeam sonar. Reef height and reef depth provide information on reef accretion and stability and offer an indicator of the reef's utility as habitat for associated species . Subtidal reefs that are sufficiently elevated above the bottom substrate tend to be less vulnerable to hypoxia and sedimentation (Lenihan andPeterson 1998, Coen et al. 2004). A high-precision GPS unit or traditional surveying equipment may be used to determine intertidal reef elevation and topography . Subtidal reefs can be assessed using side-scan sonar across a reef to determine the reef's relief and water depth. A sounding pole may also be used at intervals across a subtidal reef to determine variation in elevation of a given reef footprint. Tidal emersion: The length of time portions of a reef are exposed to air at low tide can result in clear zonation in oyster development, performance, and ecosystem services , Hanke et al. 2017. Tidal emersion can be determined from temperature loggers or water-level gauges. It can also be assessed with the use of bathymetric or topographic maps, or the elevation of the top of the reef can be measured using an RTK GPS or dGPS. The elevation can then be converted to emersion time based on local sea level and tidal cycles . Oyster density is determined by counting live individuals of a particular size within quadrats on an oyster reef (0.25-m 2 quadrats recommended in high oyster densities, 1-m 2 in low densities) . If necessary, the oysters in a given quadrat should be excavated to a depth of 10-15 cm to allow the counting of live oysters and articulated shells. Articulated shells, also called boxes, often indicate recent mortality (Christmas et al. 1997). Percent cover by live oysters can also be determined using a point-intercept method in a grid within a quadrat ( Fig. 1.12). Grizzle et al. (2005) paired underwater videography with divers excavating oysters in grids in order to evaluate the accuracy of estimating live oyster counts from video stills. This method was found to work best in regions of low oyster density that did not have large numbers of spat or juveniles or a lot of dead shell. Oyster size-frequency distribution is determined by using a ruler or caliper to measure the shell height of a subset of the oysters in a quadrat (Galtsoff 1964). A digital caliper system that wirelessly inputs data directly into a computer can also be used to efficiently measure a large number of oysters (Coen et al. 2004). The same set of oysters can generally be used for both density and size-frequency measurements (Coen et al. 2004, NASEM 2017.  recommend measuring at least 50 oysters per sample (or 250 oysters per reef). Size-frequency metrics can be used to gauge recruitment, to track a cohort over time, or to compare the age (size) structures of restored and natural reefs. Note that this can be diffi-cult to implement on reefs with high recruitment or a high density of oysters. Settlement can be monitored using arrays of replicate ceramic tiles, shells, or other materials appropriate for colonization to determine recruitment of spat (Figs. 1.13 and 1.14). Regular collection of these materials and counting the spat that have settled on the surfaces enables determination of the seasonal timing and rate of oyster settlement (Brumbaugh et al. 2006). On subtidal reefs with significant relief, separate measurements of oyster spat densities on different areas (e.g., the reef crest, slope, and base) can provide information on recruitment variability with depth (Lenihan 1999, Brumbaugh et al. 2006, Hanke et al. 2017. Salinity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature are the three environmental metrics universally recommended for inclusion in an oyster monitoring plan , NASEM 2017. These water quality metrics should be monitored continuously with automated sondes, and data should be collected as close to the reef as possible. Automated sampling is recommended because water quality measurements during infrequent site visits (weekly or monthly) provide only a snapshot of local conditions. These data are not very helpful for assessing impact of these parameters on growth, survival, or diseases. Estuarine water-quality parameters vary widely with tides, seasons, winds, and rainfall (see http://recon.sccf.org/ for real-time water-quality data associated with a number of oyster restoration efforts). Additional parameters such as total suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and water clarity also aid in ecosystem-wide water quality assessments (Brumbaugh et al. 2006). For intertidal reefs, air temperature at low tide should also be measured.  This dry-to-wet-weight ratio can provide a metric of the proportion of water in the tissue of a given oyster. A high amount of water within the tissue is a sign of depleted energy reserves (as occurs after spawning) or food limita-tion (Lucas andBeninger 1985, Rheault andRice 1996). At least 25 oysters should be used to determine oyster condition at a location; the same oysters used for the size and density measurements as described above can be used for this purpose as well. Oyster growth and survival can be determined by placing premeasured oysters in trays, mesh bags, or cages, and placing them back out on the reef. These oysters are then tracked for growth and survival over time (e.g., Kingsley- Smith et al. 2009 vs. open cages allows for determination of predation on oysters of various sizes. Oyster disease: Monitoring for the presence, frequency, and severity of diseases such as dermo and MSX can be achieved by collecting and examining 20-25 oysters per location (Coen et al. 2004). Dermo infections can be diagnosed by using Ray's fluid thioglycolate method (Ray 1952, Bushek et al. 1994, Dungan and Bushek 2015. In this method, oyster tissue is incubated in Ray's fluid thioglycolate medium, stained with iodine, and then examined for parasites under a microscope. The intensity of a dermo infection is scored on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 indicates no infection and 5 indicates that protist density almost entirely obscures the oyster tissue ( Fig. 1.15; . Frequency of disease monitoring should be tailored to seasonal and annual variability of a given location. In some cases, seasonal variability of disease prevalence necessitates a sampling frequency of 4-5 times per year (Coen et al. 2004). MSX is not found on the Gulf coast of Florida (Ford et al. 2011) and has not shown pathogenicity on the east coast of Florida (Burreson andFord 2004, Walters et al. 2007). Disease monitoring may therefore be necessary only if disease prevalence is a problem in an area or there is unexplained high mortality . MSX is more difficult to detect than is dermo and can be determined using the paraffin histology method (Burreson et al. 1988, Burreson andFord 2004) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (Stokes et al. 1995), but suspected infections should be verified with histology (Burreson 2008). Chemical contamination: Oysters are useful indicators of water quality and pollution because, as sessile filter feeders, their tissues provide a record of water quality and they can be used to quantify spatial variation in contaminant levels. Compounds of interest include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, and heavy metals. The methods used by NOAA's Mussel Watch program to monitor organic contaminants and trace elements in bivalve tissue and sediments are summarized in Lauenstein and Cantillo (1993), and two decades of results are summarized in  and Kim et al. (2008). Monitoring of associated species: The presence and diversity of transient and resident species on oyster reefs provide an indicator of ecosystem status and function (Tolley et al. 2006. The biomass, abundance, and diversity of the fish and invertebrates that live near the oyster reef can be assessed with various types of nets (lift nets, drop nets, seines, gill nets, etc.), traps, embedded sampling trays, and visual surveys (Brumbaugh et al. 2006, ASMFC 2007, zu Ermgassen et al. 2016, Hanke et al. 2017, NASEM 2017. Animals may also be collected when shells are excavated during an oyster density survey; resident organisms such as crabs, mollusks, and other invertebrate species can be sampled in this way. While monitoring associated fauna may be time consuming and require significant knowledge of taxonomy, the resulting data are valuable for understanding the ecology of the reef (Coen et al. 2004, Coen and Humphries 2017. In the case of restored reefs, faunal monitoring may focus on similarity of species composition with adjacent natural reefs (Walters and Coen 2006). Seagrass surveys may also be of interest after oyster restoration efforts, because enhanced water clarity as a result of oyster reefs has been noted to increase seagrass productivity (Peterson and Heck 2001a, 2001b, Newell and Koch 2004.  Restoration monitoring: Monitoring restoration sites calls for special consideration of sampling design (NASEM 2017). Monitoring data (physical and biological) collected before restoration activities begin allows for evaluation of the suitability of the habitat and its hydrology (Thayer et al. 2005, Coen andHumphries 2017). Frequent postrestoration monitoring of survival and erosion rates allows for early assessment of restoration success or any needed improvements , NASEM 2017. Use of a before-after-control-impact (BACI) sampling design, which includes monitoring both the oyster restoration site and a control site before and after the restoration effort, enables identification of change as a result of restoration efforts rather than environmental factors (Thayer et al. 2005, NASEM 2017). An interesting direction in restoration monitoring includes the estimation of ecosystem services derived from natural and restored oyster reefs. These can include production of fish and invertebrates, shoreline protection, or reduction of nutrients (Peterson et al. 2003, Grabowski et al. 2012, zu Ermgassen et al. 2016. Using an easily accessible tool (see http:// oceanwealth.org/tools/oyster-calculator/), one can even calculate filtering capabilities of potential oyster habitat by area, estuary volume, residence time, and other variables."}, {"section_title": "Region-specific chapters", "text": "The remainder of this report documents region-specific ecosystems, monitoring, and mapping programs for oyster reefs across Florida.

In high salinity, eastern oysters are vulnerable to predation and disease while at low salinity they have low rates of survival and reproduction. Crested oysters (Ostrea stentina) are present in higher salinity and do not generally create reef habitat. Shellfish harvesting is prohibited in Perdido Bay. Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrew, and St. Joseph bays all have areas of approved or conditionally approved harvest ( Fig. 2.2). Historical harvests across the region are"}, {"section_title": "Description of the region", "text": "Northwest Florida contains numerous barrier islands and peninsulas as well as five large bays (Fig. 2.1). The coast along the Gulf of Mexico is composed of sandy dunes and beaches, while salt marshes and tidal flats are commonly found in the estuaries protected by barrier islands. Hardened shorelines associated with urbanized areas are much less common in northwest Florida than in other regions of the state. Bays with moderate salinity provide habitat for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virgini ca), which are found in both subtidal and intertidal reefs. Eastern oysters thrive in a salinity range of 14 to 28; while \nApalachicola Bay is the largest of several estuarine systems in the panhandle region of northwestern Florida. It is confined hydrologically by a network of four barrier islands and is divided into four sections: St. Vincent Sound, Apalachicola Bay proper, East Bay, and St. George Sound (Fig. 3.1). The system is connected to the Gulf of Mexico through three natural tidal inlets (Indian Pass, West Pass, and East Pass) and one man-made inlet (Government Cut, also known as Sike's Cut). The bay is in a transition zone between diurnal tides to the west and semidiurnal tides to the southeast, resulting in a mixed tidal regime with one to five tides daily (Huang 2010, Oczkowski et al. 2011, Huang et al. 2015. Tides can be strongly affected by wind and are normally less than 1 m (3.3 ft) in range. Water currents are tidally driven but can also be strongly impacted by river discharge and winds. Currents generally do not exceed 1 m s \u22121 (3.3 ft s \u22121 ) except in passes and tidal cuts. The system is wide and shallow, with an average depth of 2-3 m (6.5-10 ft), resulting in well-mixed and well-oxygenated waters with little stratification. Bottom types consist largely of sand and other soft sediments, with hardbottom in the form of extensive oyster reefs (Edmiston 2008). Water temperature typically ranges annually from 5-32 \u00b0C (41-90 \u00b0F). Salinity varies widely spatially and temporally and can range from less than 1 to 33. Overall water quality conditions in Apalachicola Bay are excellent, in part because the panhandle region is one of the least populated  (Livingston 1984. The bay receives most of its freshwater inflow from the Apalachicola River, the largest river in Florida in terms of flow. Average seasonal discharges range from 570 m 3 s \u22121 (20,000 ft 3 s \u22121 ) in late summer and fall to 1,800 m 3 s \u22121 (65,000 ft 3 s \u22121 ) in early spring (Edmiston 2008, Huang 2010). More than 80% of the water in the Apalachicola River comes from the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers ( Fig.  3.2), which converge at Lake Seminole and the Jim Woodruff Dam at the Florida/Georgia border to form the Apalachicola. The Chipola River also provides smaller volumes of water as a tributary to the Apalachicola. The watershed of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system encompasses roughly 50,500 km 2 (20,000 mi 2 ) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. More than 7 million people, including many residents of Atlanta, live in the ACF watershed and rely on it as a major source of fresh water for drinking, recreation, and agriculture . The ACF river system includes 16 dams built to control alluvial flow and prevent flooding (la Cecilia et al. 2016). Because of its productivity, biodiversity, and water quality, Apalachicola Bay has been designated as an Outstanding Florida Water, State Aquatic Preserve, International Biosphere Reserve, and National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR; Livingston 1984. The region is within the Northwest Florida Water Management District (NWFWMD). The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR), which encompasses roughly 1,000 km 2 (390 mi 2 ), spans the estuary and the lands surrounding the lower Apalachicola River ( Fig \nThe northern Gulf coast of peninsular Florida is commonly divided into two segments: the northern segment, from Wakulla to Levy County, is referred to as the Big Bend, while Citrus to Pasco County is called the Springs Coast due to the abundance of natural freshwater springs (Fig. 4.1). Also referred to as the Nature Coast, the region has limited urban development, low coastal pollution, and a lower population density than other coasts in Florida, in part due to the lack of extensive beaches (Livingston 1990). Large portions of the coast and nearshore waters are protected in a network of national wildlife refuges, state parks, and aquatic preserves including the Big Bend Seagrasses Aquatic Preserve. The region is also divided among three water management districts: Northwest Florida, Suwannee River, and Southwest Florida (NWF-WMD, SRWMD, and SWFWMD, respectively; Fig. 4.1). The coastal waters of the Big Bend and Springs Coast are characterized by gentle topography, little wave energy, low sediment supply, and limestone bedrock that lies at or near the land surface (Wolfe 1990, FDEP 2015. These conditions provide ideal habitat for extensive salt marshes and seagrass beds, which are interspersed with tidal flats and oyster reefs. Although the nearshore areas of the Big Bend and Springs Coast are not enclosed by barrier islands, coastal waters up to several kilometers offshore typically have lower salinity than ocean water throughout the year due to freshwater inputs from spring-fed rivers and submarine groundwater discharge (Orlando et al. 1993, FDEP 2015. Oysters in this region are more fre- ranging from 1.5 to 3 m (5-10 ft) and an average salinity of 30 (FDEP 2015). A zone with moderate salinity (15-25) extends about 8 km (5 mi) offshore during months of high freshwater flow (Nelson 2015). Tidal range in the bay is 0.75 m (2.5 ft). Oyster reefs are found in the moderateand low-salinity (5-15) areas near the mouths of creeks and rivers ( Fig. 4.2; Nelson 2017). A large portion of Apalachee Bay is included within the Big Bend Seagrasses Aquatic Preserve, the boundaries of which extend up the coastline and navigable tributaries until the tidal mean high-water line (Fig. 4.2; FDEP 2015). The coastline is largely undeveloped, and the river systems, salt marshes, seagrass beds, and oyster reefs have relatively little human impact compared to other regions of Florida (FDEP 2015). An exception is the Fenholloway River, located outside the Big Bend Seagrasses Aquatic Preserve, which was once classified by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) as a Class V water body (designated for industrial use) as it received point-source pollutants from the Buckeye Foley pulp mill, mining companies, and the city of Perry's wastewater treatment plant (FWC 2004). Water quality in the river has improved in recent decades, and the river was upgraded to a Class III water body (designated for fish consumption, recreation, and maintenance of fish and wildlife) in 1998. Nevertheless, water quality concerns and the need for environmental monitoring remain (FDEP 2012(FDEP , 2014. Oysters are sparsely found at the mouth of the Fenholloway River; current mapping may underestimate extent (Fig. 4.2).\n\nThe southwest Florida region includes Charlotte Harbor, Estero Bay, Rookery Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, and the Everglades. The surface water hydrology of southwest Florida has been severely affected by human modifications (e.g., impoundment and channelization), which have changed the quality, quantity, timing, and distribution of freshwater delivered to coastal wetlands and estuaries. Before development, the hydrology of the Everglades was tightly linked to a large watershed that encompassed much of central and southern Florida ( Fig. 6.1; Chimney andGoforth 2001, Huber et al. 2006). Water meandered down the Kissimmee River to Lake Okeechobee, where it spilled over the southern edge of the lake into an expansive sawgrass marsh. The sheet of surface water then slowly made its way south, supporting a variety of freshwater marshes in the interior and mangroves, salt marshes, and oyster reefs along the coasts. Significant hydrological changes began in 1881, when the Caloosahatchee River was connected to Lake Okeechobee by Hamilton Disston for steamboat transportation (CHNEP 2013). In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Central and Southern Florida Project made major changes to the watershed in an effort to avert floods and drain wetlands for agriculture (Chimney and Goforth 2001). The Herbert Hoover Dike prevented water from seeping over the southern edge of Lake Okeechobee, stopping the sheet flow of surface water through the Everglades and instead diverting large amounts of freshwater flow into constructed channels with outlets in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers (Fig. 6.2). These hydrological alterations resulted in markedly lower salinity and increased nutrient and sediment supply in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries. Meanwhile, draining and channelization of wetlands increased the severity and frequency of droughts in other estuaries of the Everglades and Ten Thousand Islands, causing high salinity and disrupting the center of abundance of oysters in the major rivers and creeks (Chimney andGoforth 2001, Huber et al. 2006). Awareness of the extensive environmental damage caused by this alteration of surface water flow prompted the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which the U.S. Congress authorized in 2000. Major components of CERP include ecological management of Lake Okeechobee, decreasing channelized freshwater releases from the lake, increasing freshwater sheet flow to rehydrate the Everglades, and retaining water in reservoirs for slow release during the dry season (Huber et al. 2006. CERP also includes projects that focus on improving habitat for oysters, such as removing muck accumulations and providing substrate for oyster establishment . Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are monitored as an indicator species in the Caloosahatchee estuary to gauge the impacts of CERP (Volety and Haynes 2012). Oysters provide a useful indicator of high flows because they are sensitive to prolonged periods of low salinity (below 10). Because they are sessile after settlement, they also integrate the impact of varying water quality at a location from weeks to months or even years, depending on the metric used (CERP 2004, Volety et al. 2014, CHNEP 2019. Oysters additionally provide an indicator of the overall biodiversity of an ecosystem, because biomass, density, and species richness of fish and invertebrates are all greater on oyster reefs than on unvegetated sand or mud bottoms .\nSoutheast Florida features some of the most highly altered landscapes in the state, in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, as well as unique habitats in the Florida Keys archipelago. Broward and Miami-Dade counties are the most populous in Florida; the estimated 2017 population between the two counties was nearly 4.7 million (U.S. Census 2018). Oyster reefs are extremely limited, primarily due to suboptimal salinity, so there are no mapped oyster reefs or shellfish harvesting areas in this region of Florida.\nThe Central Eastern region of Florida includes the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) system, St. Lucie Estuary, the Loxahatchee River, and Lake Worth Lagoon (Fig. 8.1). Water management in the region is divided between the jurisdictions of the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). The coast includes sandy beaches on the Atlantic side of the barrier islands and a mosaic of mangroves, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and tidal flats in the protected inshore lagoons. Historically, these barrier islands were in a state of natural flux and inlets periodically opened or closed, altering salinity in the enclosed bays and lagoons. Human development has restricted that natural process, and many of the inlets are now permanently open to the Atlantic Ocean. Hydrology in the region has been highly altered by urban development, freshwater management practices, mosquito ditching, dredge-and-fill operations, and construction of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). Regional watersheds are now considerably larger because of the construction of canals to drain inland wetlands for agriculture and development. Existing watershed-to-basin ratios for this region are 5:1 for the IRL (Engle et al. 2007); 98:1 for the St. Lucie Estuary (the estuary also receives freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee; C. Buzzelli pers. comm., SFWMD et al. 2009); 175:1 for the Loxahatchee River and Estuary (Howard et al. 2011); and 7:1 for the Lake Worth Lagoon (Taylor Engineering Inc. 2009). Freshwater delivery to estuaries varies as a result of concentrated surface water flow, freshwater management, storms, and droughts, which in turn make salinity widely variable and result in challenging conditions for oyster growth. The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) has the highest rates of survival and reproduction at a salinity between 14 and 28 . Oyster reefs are therefore largely confined to bays, lagoons, and rivers with predominantly brackish salinity regimes along central and southeast Florida Geiger 2010). While the eastern oyster forms large reefs, the flat oyster (Isognomon alatus) can also be found on seawalls, pilings, and mangrove prop roots (Bachman et al. 2004) and can be a major component of some reefs (e.g., in the southwest fork of the Loxahatchee River). The crested oyster (Ostrea stentina) is also occasionally found in downstream, high-salinity areas of this region on mangrove prop roots (Abbott andMorris 1995, Puglisi 2008). Oyster reefs on the southeast coast of Florida often have lower densities than reefs on the southwest coast, although growth, condition index, and reproductive activity are comparable (LWLI 2013.\nThe coast of northeast Florida contains an extensive network of salt marshes, estuarine lagoons, oyster reefs, and tidal creeks (Fig. 9.1). Spanning the transition between subtropical and temperate climates, mixed mangrove and salt marsh vegetation in coastal Volusia County gives way to salt marsh dominance in the north (Nassau and Duval Counties). Estuarine salt marshes and oyster reefs are protected from ocean energy by barrier islands and sand ridges. Freshwater input is provided by several rivers, the largest of which is the St. Johns River, as well as numerous natural creeks, man-made canals, and stormwater outfalls. The entire northeast region of Florida is within the jurisdiction of the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD). Oyster reefs in northeast Florida are generally intertidal, rather than subtidal, and are commonly found as patches independent from the shoreline or as fringing reefs along the margins of salt marshes. Most oyster reefs occur at elevations between mean low water and mean sea level (Ridge et al. 2017). The northeast coast of Florida experiences a larger tidal range than do the southeast and Gulf coasts, and the range decreases from north to south. Regions with greater tidal energy generally have greater oyster biomass and more reef structure (Byers et al. 2015), and the northern coastal counties contain extensive eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in their tidal tributaries (Table 9.1). "}, {"section_title": "Perdido Bay", "text": "Located on the border between Florida and Alabama, Perdido Bay receives freshwater flow from the Perdido River as well as other smaller rivers and creeks (Fig. 2.4). Sediment in the bay ranges from firm sand to soft mud (NW-FWMD 2017a). Water quality issues include heavy metal pollution, high amounts of fecal coliform bacteria, and low dissolved oxygen (NWFWMD 2017a). The National Shellfish Sanitation Program categorizes Perdido Bay as an unclassified water, thus shellfish harvesting is prohibited, and the bay is not surveyed or mapped for oyster reefs (DWH NRDA Trustees 2017). There are no known continuous oyster reefs, but oysters do grow on piers, pilings, and rip rap (Beck and Odaya 2001, DWH NRDA Trustees 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Pensacola Bay", "text": "The Pensacola Bay System includes Big Lagoon, Santa Rosa Sound, Pensacola Bay, Blackwater Bay, East Bay, and Escambia Bay (Fig. 2.5). The bay system is mostly enclosed by barrier islands. The average tidal range is 0.5 m (1.6 ft), and the main source for tidal exchange is through Pensacola Pass to the Gulf of Mexico, leading to low flushing and a long water residence time (USEPA 2004). Additional tidal connections include western Big Lagoon (which connects to Perdido Bay via the Intracoastal Waterway, ICW) and eastern Santa Rosa Sound (which connects to Choctawhatchee Bay). Upland forests are the dominant land cover within the watershed, with smaller areal extent occupied by agriculture and urban development including the city of Pensacola (FDEP 2012). The bottom of the bay is predominantly sandy in the lower bay, transitioning to silty clays in the upper region of the estuary (USEPA 2004). Pensacola Bay provides appropriate salinity and temperature ranges for oyster habitat. Salinity in the upper part of the Pensacola Bay System ranges from 5-18, while salinity in the lower bay ranges from 18-30 (USEPA 2004). There are an estimated 95-99 ha (235-245 ac) of oyster reef within the Pensacola Bay system (Lewis et al. 2016); the majority of these reefs are located in East Bay. Water is shallow in areas of Escambia Bay and East Bay where reefs are located (average depth 3 m/10 ft) and the water column is often stratified with a halocline present (FDEP 2012). From the 1950s through the 1970s, Pensacola Bay faced water quality challenges including fish kills and algal blooms due to high-nutrient wastewater discharge. Oyster populations declined during the 1960s-1980s due to poor water quality, low salinity resulting from heavy rainfall, a lack of suitable hard substrate due to dredging, sediment contamination, and dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infections (USEPA 2004, Lewis et al. 2016, NWFWMD 2017b. Dermo infections contributed to the loss of more than 90% of oysters in 1971 (USEPA 2004). Compared to 1960 acreage, oyster reef area in Pensacola Bay has declined by 72% (a loss of 190-255 ha/470-630 ac) (Lewis et al. 2016). Water quality in the bay improved significantly since the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s and the implementation of best land-use practices in the watershed. However, concerns remain high for sedimentation, excess nutrients, and water clarity near Pensacola and other urban areas (USEPA 2004, FDEP 2012. Oyster habitat restoration has been successful in several areas in the Pensacola Bay System, but the oyster population has been slow to recover following improvements to water quality due to lack of suitable substrate, disease, and natural variation in salinity and predation (USEPA 2004, Lewis et al. 2016. Escambia County used to have high oyster annual yields that peaked at 63 metric tons (140,000 pounds) in 1970, but reefs have been slow to recover following the die-offs of the 1970s (Fig. 2.3; Col-   (Fig. 2.3)."}, {"section_title": "Choctawhatchee Bay", "text": "Choctawhatchee Bay (Fig. 2.6) receives freshwater flow from the Choctawhatchee River, several smaller creeks, and groundwater from the Floridan aquifer system (NW-FWMD 2017c). There is also a limited exchange of water with Santa Rosa Sound to the west and with St. Andrew Bay to the east through the ICW. As a result of limited hydrological connection with the Gulf of Mexico, the bay has a small tidal prism and limited flushing. Salinity in the bay varies widely depending on river input. Salinity is lowest in the eastern half of the bay near the Choctawhatchee River, and the bay is frequently stratified with a halocline present (Ruth and Handley 2007). Benthic substrate in the bay primarily includes sand, mud, seagrass beds, and scattered oyster reefs (NWFWMD 2017c). Choctawhatchee Bay hosted variable oyster populations in the past; oyster extent was largely dependent upon increased tidal connectivity with the Gulf (CBA 2017). The 1500s were the most recent documented time when the bay hosted extensive oyster reefs (Thomas and Campbell 1993). The bay connects to the Gulf of Mexico at East Pass, which was an ephemeral tidal inlet until it was dredged and permanently opened in 1929 (Ruth and Handley 2007). The reefs that exist today were established shortly following the opening of the East Pass (CBA 2017). Choctawhatchee Bay has low oyster abundance, possibly due to limited hard substrate and changing water conditions from the previously ephemeral inlet. Although there is limited information on early harvest yields in Choctawhatchee Bay, it is thought that the oyster harvest has declined since the early 1900s Lanier 1981, CBA 2017). Choctawhatchee Bay has undergone several substrate replenishment efforts coordinated by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) using clam and oyster shells (including fossil shell) in efforts to improve the fishery (Berrigan 1988, CBA 2017. Replenishment and mapping efforts have focused on the eastern side of the bay in Walton County. While oyster extent in the western side of the bay is small, the extent of reefs is underrepresented by current maps (Fig. 2.6), particularly as there are known oyster restoration efforts located near Fort Walton Beach and Rocky Bayou (CBA 2017). While parts of Okaloosa and Walton counties are conditionally approved for shellfish harvesting ( Fig. 2.2), landings are reported infrequently, and harvest yields are low ( Fig. 2.3, FWC 2018)."}, {"section_title": "St. Andrew Bay", "text": "The West, North, and East bays that comprise St. Andrew Bay receive freshwater flow from 10 small creeks (Fig. 2.7). The largest flow originates from Econfina Creek, which drains into the northern portion of North Bay (FDEP 2016, Brim andHandley 2007). There is also a small hydrological exchange through the ICW in the west to Choctawhatchee Bay and in the east to St. Joseph Bay and the Apalachicola watershed. Approximately 2,000 ha (5,000 ac) of North Bay were impounded in 1961, disconnecting water flowing from Econfina, Bear, and Cedar Creeks and Bayou George into St. Andrew Bay proper. This impoundment is known as Deer Point Lake and provides water to Panama City and surrounding areas. The water in St. Andrew Bay is relatively clear as little suspended sediment is brought in by the low freshwater flow (Brim and Handley 2007). The bay is protected from the Gulf by narrow peninsulas and barrier islands that have become welded to the mainland, which limit tidal flushing. Tidal range between neap and spring tides varies from 0.06-0.67 m (0.2-2.2 ft) (Brim and Handley 2007). Historically, St. Andrew Bay was connected to the Gulf of Mexico at East Pass at the end of Shell Island. A shipping channel was constructed through the center of the barrier peninsula in 1934 and sediment accumulation eventually closed East Pass in 1998 (FDEP 2016). Water in the bay has a long residence time and is susceptible to the accumulation of pollutants. The bay is a challenging habitat for oysters due to higher than optimal salinity as a result of low freshwater input (NWFWMD 2008). Little is known about rates of disease and predation on oyster reefs in St. Andrew Bay, although these rates are likely to be high because of high salinity (NWFWMD 2008). During certain weather conditions, such as stalled frontal systems, the salinity can decline rapidly throughout West and North Bays. The duration of these freshwater pulses is poorly understood but may persist for long enough to have deleterious effects on oysters found here. The extent to which such events impact East Bay is unknown. Additionally, the substrate in many parts of the upper bay is clay or silt and is therefore too soft for oyster reef establishment (Brim and Handley 2007). The impact of Hurricane Michael, a category 4 hurricane which made landfall at St. Andrew Bay in October 2018, on the bay's oyster reefs is unknown at the time of the writing of this report. Both natural and planted reefs are found within the bay (NWFWMD 2008). However, limited data are available on oyster extent within the bay (NWFWMD 2017d) and existing maps (Fig. 2.7) may underestimate true extent (NWFWMD 2008). Parts of the West, North, and East Bays are conditionally approved for shellfish harvesting ( Fig. 2.2). In 1975, the total oyster harvest area in Bay County was less than 60 ha (150 ac) (USEPA 1975). Annual harvest yields for Bay County peaked in 1993 at 213 metric tons (470,000 pounds) ( Fig. 2.3)."}, {"section_title": "St. Joseph Bay", "text": "St. Joseph Bay is partially enclosed by a spit of land extending north from Cape San Blas (Fig. 2.8). Salinity within the bay is similar to the Gulf of Mexico as a result of minimal freshwater input and a large tidal prism. Freshwater sources include groundwater input, precipitation, and the Gulf County Canal. The Gulf County Canal and ICW enable water exchange with East Bay of the St. Andrew Bay system and the Apalachicola River via Lake Wimico. Sediment load and turbidity is higher in the Gulf County Canal than the bay itself, which has consequently decreased seagrass coverage in the bay near the canal as a result of light limitation (Hand et al. 1996, Berndt andFranklin 1999). The salinity in St. Joseph Bay is too high for optimal oyster habitat as oysters are more vulnerable to predators and disease , Coen and Bishop 2015. The bay is clear with predominantly sandy bottom and abundant seagrass, but lacks extensive oyster reefs Odaya 2001, DWH NRDA Trustees 2017). Commercial oyster harvest yields that are reported for Gulf County (Fig. 2.3) are primarily derived from Indian Lagoon rather than from St. Joseph Bay (Fig. 2.2). Indian Lagoon is discussed in Chapter 3 of this report.

Pensacola Bay faces widely variable salinity, which can make much of the system too fresh for oysters for months at a time. Choctawhatchee Bay is often stratified with a halocline. \u2022 Sedimentation: Oysters can be smothered by fine sediments and excess sedimentation can also limit oyster recruitment. Sedimenta tion is exacerbated by runoff in areas that lack vegetation, such as construction sites, dirt roads, and tree harvesting sites. Reducing erosion and sedimentation is one of the primary goals in water improvement plans across the region (NWFW-MD 2017a, 2017b, 2017c, 2017d). Unconsolidated fine-grained sediments do not provide a sufficiently sturdy substrate for reef establishment. A lack of suitable substrate is a limiting factor for reef extent in several of the bays. Additional oyster shell or lime rock aggregate may be needed for the creation, restoration, or enhancement of reef habitat as long as these added materials can be supported without sinking into existing sediment (VanderKooy 2012). \u2022 Oil spill impacts: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 exposed the westernmost bays in the panhandle to crude oil and weathered residue. Oil exposure in Perdido Bay was light and primarily occurred on the Alabama side of the bay (Byron et al. 2016). Portions of Pensacola Bay near inlets to the Gulf of Mexico were also exposed to oil, including areas near Pensacola Pass and Santa Rosa Sound (Harvey et al. 2016). Specific data on the impact of these oil exposures on oysters within these bays are not available; however, general studies have shown that direct oyster mortality was considerably higher in other Gulf states than in Florida (DWH NRDA Trustees 2017). Several oyster restoration activities have been financed by funds resulting from compensation for the oil spill, including cultch placement (in multiple bays in Florida panhandle) and construction of living shorelines (in Pensacola Bay) (DWH NRDA Trustees 2017). \u2022 Climate change and sea-level rise: Increased temperatures have the potential to change timing and frequency of oyster spawning (Wilson et al. 2005, Hofmann et al. 1992) and reduce larval survival and settlement (Shumway 1996, DWH NRDA Trustees 2017). Sea-level rise will further increase salinity in bays along northwest Florida, making oysters even more vulnerable to predation and disease. \u2022 Harvesting: Most of the panhandle bays have areas open to oyster harvest. During harvest, oyster shell is removed from the oyster bed. If the rate of shell removal exceeds the rate of growth, supplemental deposition of shell is required for the reefs to maintain suitable vertical relief and exposed surfaces for settlement to occur (VanderKooy 2012). \u2022 Isolated populations: As each bay along the Gulf coast goes through periods of reduced abundance, genetic connectivity between populations in the bays is reduced. When the oyster population in a single bay declines, the chances of larvae being exported from one bay and subsequently imported by a neighboring bay decline."}, {"section_title": "Oyster reef mapping and monitoring efforts", "text": "The compilation of oyster maps used in figures in this report are available for download at http://geodata. myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida.\nThe compilation of data used to create the oyster maps in this report is available for download at http:// geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida.\nThe compilation of oyster maps used in figures in this report are available for download at http://geodata. myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida.\nThe compilation of data used to create the oyster maps in this report is available for download at http:// geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida.\nThe compilation of oyster maps used in figures in this report are available for download at http://geodata. myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida.\nThe compilation of data used to create the oyster maps in this report is available for download at http:// geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/oyster-beds-in-florida."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Sensitivity Index maps", "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) office of Response and Restoration created Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps of coastal zone natural resources across the state of Florida.

Effective management planning should be stakeholder driven, involve the input of state resource management and policy agencies, and consider the full suite of economic and environmental services provided by oyster populations and the habitat they create. Oyster habitat management plans for each basin should consider managing the resource for sustainable human consumption (whether via wild harvest or aquaculture), shoreline protection, water quality improvement, the provision of fisheries habitat, and carbon sequestration. Bay-specific fishery management plans should be developed to include an estimate of sustainable harvest based on maintenance of the reef structure, including assessment of how much shell must be returned to the reef to offset loss due to harvest. \u2022 Ensure that each bay has established oyster reefs in both upstream and downstream locations to increase genetic exchange among local populations within the metapopulation. By having a variety of reefs in each system, the resilience within each system is increased and the probability of exchanging larvae with neighboring bays increases.

Population structure of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica, on an oyster bar in central Chesapeake Bay: changes associated with shell planting and increased recruitment. Journal of Shellfish Research 7:33-40. Apeti DA, Kim Y, Lauenstein GG, Powell EN, et al. 2014. Parasites and disease in oysters and mussels of the U.S. coastal waters.  Many oyster reefs in Florida are stressed by either a lack or excess of freshwater flow. Variable freshwater inputs are largely due to surface water management efforts (e.g. South Florida) or limited river flow due to low precipitation and/or freshwater withdrawals (Apalachicola Bay and Suwannee Sound). Salinity is a primary factor for oyster survival and reproduction. Ensuring freshwater flow mimics natural flow helps to prevent rapid salinity changes and extreme salinity conditions; this is crucial to the survival of remaining oyster reefs. \u2022 Combat substrate limitation: Many estuaries in Florida are substrate-limited due to extensive harvesting, shell mining, or dredging. Oyster restoration efforts that create new reef substrate or add shell to harvested reefs are key to maintaining oyster reef extent. Substrate placement should be based on present and predicted conditions, not principally on historic locations. New reef substrates should be placed on firm sediments to prevent their sinking. Although many materials can be used to create oyster substrates , shell recycling programs help replace the original substrate type removed during harvest and also engage the community through interaction with local businesses, school educational programs, and volunteer events. Limiting factors for substrate replenishment often include funding and materials. Areas like Apalachicola Bay need regular shell replenishment, yet the cost for purchase and distribution of this shell is often funded by grants, which are inher-Most of Florida's estuaries contain (or historically contained) significant populations of oysters. While the statewide extent of oyster reefs before European settlement is unknown, a marked decline in oyster extent has been documented in many areas that do have historical estimates. Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor have each lost 90% of their oyster reefs , Naples Bay has lost 80% , Pensacola Bay has lost 72% (Lewis et al. 2016), Suwannee Sound has lost 66% of its reefs , and Biscayne Bay has lost all its reefs . A large portion of historical losses was due to activities that are now restricted by environmental regulations, such as dredge-and-fill construction and shell mining on live reefs. Altered hydrology and its associated stressors (especially salinity extremes) still threaten many reefs. Climate change and sea-level rise will increase the frequency and severity of high temperatures and salinity stress. Other, regional threats, such as erosion due to boat wakes and substrate loss from harvesting, also contribute strongly to losses. This combination of stressors makes Florida a challenging place for remaining oyster reefs and causes continuing degradation and habitat loss. Multiple priorities and recommendations for the management, mapping, and monitoring of Florida's oyster reefs emerged during the writing of this report and as outcomes of the OIMMP workshops. Region-specific priorities and needs are identified in each chapter. Several priorities were frequently identified at the regional scale. These and additional statewide priorities are outlined below as key recommendations for the management, mapping, and monitoring of oyster habitats across the state. ently temporary. Long-term funding for shell replenishment is needed in areas that are heavily harvested and should perhaps be a requirement of harvesting. Efforts should also be made to reduce the use of plastic to hold together loose shell when creating artificial reefs due to the eventual degradation and release of microplastics into estuaries. \u2022 Create and implement a comprehensive fishery management plan: Dynamic fishery-management strategies are needed to prevent overfishing or loss of substrate. These plans should incorporate changing climate, variable oyster fishing effort, annually variable rainfall, and widespread anthropogenic changes. Fishery management should consider maintaining positive shell budgets, oyster size structure (including large size classes), and the fluctuating hydrology of the watershed. Areas with high fishing pressure may also benefit from rotational harvest with fallow periods. These fallow periods allow for natural mortality on the reef and thereby production of natural shell, the preferred settlement substrate on a reef. The development of Territorial User Rights Fisheries (TURFs), which lease the rights of bottom areas to individual fishers, would incentivize care of the fishing resource. The growing oyster aquaculture industry is another means of reducing harvest pressure on wild oysters. \u2022 Replace or supplement hardened shorelines with living shorelines: Living shorelines create habitat for oyster reefs and coastal wetlands and provide a gradual elevation change that facilitates the migration of these habitats upslope as sea level rises. Before new living shorelines or reefs are created, sites should be assessed for habitat suitability to ensure that they have appropriate environmental conditions for restoration success. \u2022 Maintain genetic connectivity of oyster populations: Connectivity between oyster populations in multiple estuaries is important to maintaining genetic diversity, which is key to the survival of populations facing a variety of environmental stressors (Koehn et al. 1980a, Hilbish and. Each estuary should ideally have established oyster reefs in both upstream and downstream locations to increase genetic exchange among local populations and maximize resiliency to local perturbations, stabilizing the regional metapopulation. Further study is also needed to elucidate the degree and temporal variability of existing genetic exchange across oyster populations."}, {"section_title": "Chapter acknowledgments", "text": "Additional review of this cahapter was provided by Laura Geselbracht (The Nature Conservancy), Jonathan Brucker (FDEP Central Panhandle Aquatic Preserves), and Caitlin Snyder (FDEP/Apalachicola NERR).

Spawning occurs mainly from April through October, typically with spring and fall peaks. Growth is continuous and rapid throughout the year, and market size (76 mm [3 in] shell height) is reached in approximately 18 months (Ingle and Dawson 1952). Oyster reefs cover perhaps 10% of the bay bottom and include both subtidal and intertidal reefs (Kennedy andSanford 1989, Edmiston 2008). Subtidal reefs cover much more area than those in the intertidal zone, with 1,600-4,000 ha ( Fig. 3.3; 4,000-10,000 ac) of subtidal oyster bottom mapped or estimated in recent decades (Livingston 1984  fossil shell, and other hard materials to provide cultch (suitable substrate) for oyster larval settlement in support of the fishery (Berrigan 1990, FDACS 2015a. Based on extensive sonar mapping and field sampling, Twichell et al. (2010) concluded that the present-day subtidal reefs in the bay began to develop on the crests of broad, flat sand bars around approximately 400 BCE, most of which were oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the bay. The early reefs grew vertically and migrated westward, suggesting a net westward transport of sediments in the bay. This model contrasts somewhat with reef development in the Big Bend region to the south, where it is thought that oyster reefs initially developed on nearshore limestone outcrops ). Core and seismic profile data indicate that oyster reefs were more extensive historically and have decreased at their edges due to fine sediment inputs from the Apalachicola River (Twichell et al. 2010). The current reef size and other characteristics reflect changes in the original spatial patterns resulting from more than two millennia of responses to changes in climate, sea level, water quality, sediment inputs from both freshwater and marine sources, and more recently by harvest and management practices. Recent work has shown wide spatial variability in live oyster densities on both intertidal and subtidal reefs in the bay. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) has annually monitored selected reefs in the bay for oyster density and size from 1990 to 2015, when monitoring responsibilities shifted to FWC (data summarized in ; also see . From 1990 through 2011 (prior to the fisheries collapse discussed below), total oyster densities fluctuated between roughly 200 and 400 oysters/ m 2 (19-37 oysters/ft 2 ). On intertidal reefs, Grizzle et al. (2017b) found an overall mean of ~400 oysters/m 2 (37 oysters/ft 2 ) in 2016 throughout the bay. However, the western and eastern portions of the bay differed greatly. Many intertidal reefs in the western bay were dead, and the overall mean density of live oysters was <50 oysters/m 2 (4.6 oysters/ft 2 ), compared with ~1,000 oysters/m 2 (93 oysters/ft 2 ) in the eastern bay. The same overall pattern was reported for subtidal reefs by Kimbro (2013). Spatial patterns in mortality also vary widely across subtidal reefs in Apalachicola Bay (Berrigan 1988, Livingston et al. 2000. For example, Livingston et al. 2000produced maps of oyster mortality illustrating how river flow and salinity variations were related to mortality patterns across the bay in 1985 and 1986. Under moderate river flows, oyster mortality was reduced throughout the central portions of the bay. Under low-flow conditions, the area of high mortality in the outer bay increased. This effect is presumably because predators move from the Gulf of Mexico further into the bay when waters are more saline. The reverse-high river flows, such as during a hurricane-can result in essentially the opposite result with respect to spatial mortality patterns if salinity falls below the oyster's tolerance levels . The impacts of storms are more complicated, however, because storm-related factors other than salinity can increase oyster mortality. For example, Hurricane Elena in 1985 produced extreme tides, strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high river discharges that resulted in burial by sediments and other physical damage to reefs in western St. George Sound and eastern Apalachicola Bay (Berrigan 1988(Berrigan , 1990. Oyster production in most areas of the bay dropped by 90% following Hurricane Elena, resulting in closures to harvest, but rebounds in growth and recruitment quickly followed, particularly in areas with substrate restoration (Berrigan 1990).  reviewed the literature on the impacts of subsequent storms on oysters in the bay, emphasizing that the effects of sporadic events such as hurricanes can vary widely and involve multiple mortality factors. Thus, their effects are not easy to predict. The spatial distribution of the bay's reefs today (Figs. 3.1 and 3.3) is a result of both natural processes and intensive management, which began in the late 1800s (Dugas et al. 1997; see review in . Among the most important of the management actions was implementation of extensive shelling (shell planting) programs. It was soon recognized that loss of shell due to harvest threatened sustainability of oyster fisheries throughout Florida because it removed hard substrate needed for larval settlement. Shell additions to the bay were first recommended around 1885. The Florida Division of Agriculture planted the first known shell, 15,000 barrels' worth, in 1913. Shell distribution increased substantially around 1925 (P. Zajicek, FDACS, personal compilation from Biennial Reports of the Fish Commission, Biennial Reports Shellfish Division, Florida Department of Agriculture and Biennial Reports of the State Board of Conservation). Shell distribution continued more regularly after 1949 as the result of a State-mandated program requiring that harvested oyster shell be returned to public oyster beds, sometimes supplemented with limestone rock. Whitfield and Beaumariage (1977) wrote that as of 1977, more than 4 million bushels of shell and rock had been used to cover nearly 400 ha (1,000 ac) of bottom in Apalachicola Bay. Shell buy-back programs have been implemented to pay dealers for collected shell, but because these programs rely on grants, they do not have a permanent source of funding. Recent shelling programs have used primarily fossil shell (FDACS 2015a, 2015b)."}, {"section_title": "Oyster harvesting in Apalachicola Bay", "text": "Much of the Apalachicola Bay system is classified by FDEP as Class II waters (those designated for shellfish propagation or harvesting) that are conditionally approved or restricted for harvest by FDACS dependent on prevailing water quality and seasonal closures (Fig. 3.4). Current oyster harvest regulation in Apalachicola Bay includes bag limits, size limits, and spatial closures. The oyster fishery is integral to the lives of many people living in the Apalachicola Bay region. Before the collapse, the fishery provided more than 2,500 jobs to nearby coastal communities, of- ten making up to half of their revenue . Harvest from portions of the bay in Franklin County has historically dominated oyster harvest in Florida, yielding more than 90% of the state's commercial landings (Fig. 3.5) and 10% of the oysters sold in the continental United States (Livingston 1984. Commercial landings data from 1895 to 1984 were reported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Florida State Board of Conservation, Florida Department of Natural Resources, or National Marine Fisheries Service, but the FWC's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute took over these responsibilities in 1985. From 1986 onwards, FWC recorded the number of trip tickets and landings via a mandatory reporting system . Earlier, such data had been reported voluntarily. Despite the mandatory reporting system, Havens et al. 2013found evidence of unreported harvest and harvest from closed areas that are difficult to quantify and reconcile with reported landings data. Oyster landings from Franklin County (dominated by Apalachicola Bay) fluctuated but overall increased from 1950 through the early 1980s, peaking at 3,000 metric tons (6.6 million pounds) in 1981 ( Fig. 3.5). In September 1985, Hurricane Elena caused extensive damage to the bay's reefs, particularly on the east end (Livingston et al. 1999; also see discussion above). Many of the reefs that had historically been the most productive suffered high mortality of live oysters, loss of cultch, and extensive sedimentation (Berrigan 1990). The bay was closed to harvest for several months for research and distribution of clam shells as substrate (Berrigan 1990). Commercial oyster harvest resumed in May 1986, but with harvest restrictions. Landings were nearly an order of magnitude lower than the pre-hurricane harvest in 1985. Oyster populations recovered relatively quickly as a result of successful recruitment, shelling, and restricted harvests (Berrigan 1990, Livingston et al. 1999, but commercial harvests never returned to the levels recorded before Hurricane Elena (Fig. 3.5). Landings as well as catch per unit effort (CPUE) estimates fluctuated, but generally increased, through the late 1980s and early 1990s ( Fig. 3.6). Several hurricanes affected Apalachicola Bay after 1985; impacts to the oyster reefs and the fishery varied depending on storm-related physical disturbances and salinity extremes. In 1994, hurricanes caused record flooding in the region, resulting in near-freshwater conditions in the bay for nearly two weeks. While reefs were apparently not physically damaged by the hurricanes, mortality on the reefs varied from 10 to 100% as a result of low salinity . Oysters at Dry Bar and St. Vincent reefs (Fig. 3.3) suffered particularly high mortality. In 2005, Hurricane Dennis caused a 3-m (10-ft) storm surge, but this had little impact on subtidal oyster reefs, as the extra water depth protected them from wave energy . Hurricane Katrina in 2005 did not have a measurable impact on the oysters, but hurricane winds pushed a red tide bloom into the bay, resulting in the closure of oyster harvesting for more than three months . Landings increased substantially after Katrina, but CPUE began to show a steady decline until the most recent collapse, in 2012. The impact of 2018's Hurricane Michael on Apalachicola Bay oysters was unknown when this report was written. It should be noted that Apalachicola Bay was not directly affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 . The fishery remained openunlike those in large areas of Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama-and the shortage of oysters in other Gulf areas initially led to an increase in oyster harvesting and prices for oysters from Apalachicola Bay ). Out of concern for possible future closures, the oyster harvesting season in Apalachicola Bay was opened early. While oyster harvesting is usually prohibited Friday through Sunday, harvesting was also allowed on weekends during that time (though no changes were made with regards to size limits or daily bag limits) (FWC 2013). Despite the extended season, oyster landings in 2010 were slightly lower than those before and after (Fig. 3.6), perhaps in part due to declining prices. Concern about the safety of post-oil spill Gulf oysters led to a decline in demand and oyster prices (Sumaila et al. 2012, though there has been no evidence that the oil spill contaminated seafood from Apalachicola Bay ."}, {"section_title": "2012-2013 collapse of the oyster fishery", "text": "Oyster landings from Apalachicola Bay began a marked decline in 2012, dropping from 1,378 metric tons (3.0 million pounds) in 2012 to only 483 metric tons (1.1 million pounds) in 2013, followed by four years of historically low landings (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6). Fishery-independent sampling by FDACS has also shown a sharp decline  , Berrigan (1990-2017, FWC (2018. in oyster density on subtidal reefs (results summarized in . As previously mentioned, from 1990-2011 total oyster densities fluctuated between roughly 200 and 400 oysters/m 2 (19-37 oysters/ft 2 ). The density of oysters on subtidal reefs then fell below 100 oysters/m 2 (9 oysters/ft 2 ) during 2012 and 2013. Although many of the mapped subtidal reefs have not been monitored for density in recent years, a spatially extensive sampling program in 2016 by FWC found live oysters at only 66 of the 161 stations sampled on mapped reefs, and the overall average live oyster density at those stations was only 17 oysters/m 2 (1.5 oysters/ft 2 ) (Parker 2016). The cause of the 2012-2013 fishery collapse has been linked to a combination of events. The conclusions of , paraphrased in the following summary, provide a plausible scenario linking five likely contributing factors: 1) low river flow led to increased salinity in Apalachicola Bay for a multiyear period, which caused 2) an increase in oyster parasites, predators, or unknown pathogens, leading to 3) increased oyster mortality, particularly among juveniles, resulting in 4) recruitment failures (over several years) possibly worsened by shell removal by fishing or environmental events, finally leading to 5) collapse of adult oyster populations. Numerous studies have assessed the role of river discharge in the long-term dynamics of oyster harvest from the bay, confirming the importance of freshwater discharges to the ecology, production, and harvest of oysters but also underscoring the complex nature of the relationship (Wilber 1992, Oczkowski et al. 2011, Fisch and Pine 2016. Unfortunately, sufficient data to fully support factors 2 and 3 are not available because studies of predators were not under way before the collapse. But, very high densities of boring sponges and predators have been observed in the bay since the collapse (Fig. 3.7, .  also see Fisch and Pine 2016) also discuss research that arrived at similar explanations for previous fishery collapses in Apalachicola Bay and other parts of the state. Fisch and Pine (2016) did not find a significant correlation between oyster CPUE and river discharge between 1987 and 2013; they posit that this lack of a relationship may be a result of the changes in fishery landings reporting requirements, a lack of a proportional relationship between CPUE and oyster populations, hurricane impacts, and changes to ecosystem dynamics in the bay. Overfishing is not thought to have directly contributed to the 2012 collapse, in the sense that recruitment was not limited by harvest (FWC 2013. Rather, the fishery may have indirectly exacerbated the collapse through the removal of shell substrate . The fishery collapse resulted in a request by the State of Florida for a Federal Fisheries Disaster declaration. The request was granted in 2013 by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, enabling the use of federal funds to support the community in the aftermath of the collapse ). These funds, as well as funding from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, led to the Apalachicola Bay Fishery Disaster Recovery Project Plan, which included restoration of oyster habitat, monitoring of oyster resources and restoration efforts, vocational and educational training for affected oyster fishers and their communities, and processor facilities upgrades. Several studies were also published focusing on various aspects of the ecological and social dimensions of the collapse. Fisch and Pine (2016) focused on the complexities of the relationship between freshwater discharge and oyster landings.  and  explored the relationship between ecological and social issues, focusing on management strategies that should be considered to enhance resiliency in the fishery. Kimbro et al. (2017) and Pusack et al. (2018) demonstrated the potential importance of predation as related to freshwater discharges to the bay in oyster population dynamics. Overall, recent research has provided new perspectives on the temporal and spatial dynamics of oyster populations in Apalachicola Bay, as well as the complexity and importance of the fishery to the regional economy and local communities. Legal battles over water rights have been ongoing between the states of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia since the 1980s. But after the 2012-2013 oyster fishery collapse, the State of Florida sought to have the Court apportion water rights in the ACF watershed. The State of Florida argued that Georgia's water policies negatively affected Apalachicola's oyster fishery, resulting in the collapse of the oyster population and the loss of many of the ecosystem services that oysters provide. Florida stated its concern that upstream water use will continue to increase as urban and agricultural demands for water grow in Georgia, inhibiting the recovery of the fishery. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear State of Florida v. State of Georgia over the appropriation of water from the ACF basin (Fisch and Pine 2016). In 2017, the court-appointed special master recommended that the court side with Georgia because Florida had failed to prove that a water-consumption cap would have averted the fishery collapse (Lancaster 2017). In June 2018, however, the Supreme Court declared that the special master had applied too strict a standard in requiring Florida to prove its case and ordered reconsideration of the case (Florida v. Georgia 2018, Pittman 2018). Review of the case under a new special master is ongoing at the time of the writing of this report. Little research has dealt with the substantial ecosystem services such as habitat provision, water filtration, and fish production that Apalachicola Bay's oyster reefs provide (Coen et al. 2007, Grabowski and. In addition to oyster landings and economic impacts, the 2012 fishery collapse in the bay also resulted in a loss of some portion of the ecosystem services the oyster reefs provided. The collapse thus had ecological as well as economic and social effects. In their assessment of long-term changes in water filtration by oyster reefs in 13 estuaries in North America, zu Ermgassen et al. (2013) found only Apalachicola Bay showed an increase in filtration capacity. However, their assessment was based on 1990-2010 data, prior to the 2012 collapse (see Table 1 in zu Ermgassen et al. 2013). It is reasonable to assume that other ecosystem services provided by the bay's oyster reefs have also greatly diminished since 2012. Finally, a recent result of the Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery collapse is that much of the oyster fishery (harvest and management) shifted to the Big Bend region. In 2016, yields from the Big Bend equaled those from Apalachicola Bay (FWC 2018). In 2017, commercial oyster landings for the Big Bend increased to 219 metric tons (483,000 pounds), surpassing the Franklin County yield of 122 metric tons (268,000 pounds; FWC 2018). There has also been a renewal of interest in oyster aquaculture in which oysters are grown in cages suspended in the water column, where they are safer from predators and less vulnerable to sedimentation or hypoxic conditions (Reiley 2018). This shift is similar to changes occurring in other estuaries, where traditional oyster fisheries that have failed or are greatly diminished are being supplemented with aquaculture practices."}, {"section_title": "Indian Lagoon", "text": "Located at the westernmost edge of Apalachicola Bay, Indian Lagoon (Fig. 3.1) is within the borders of Gulf County and is not part of ANERR. The lagoon is bounded by Indian Pass peninsula and opens to St. Vincent Sound to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast at Indian Pass. The lagoon is shallow with a bottom of fine organic sediments (FDEP 2014), and most oyster reefs in the lagoon are intertidal ( Fig. 3.3; Grizzle et al. 2017a). Oysters from Indian Lagoon make up most of the landings from Gulf County, which were at substantial levels during the 1960s and 1980s but have been at record low levels since 1990 ( Fig. 3.8)."}, {"section_title": "Eastern Franklin County", "text": "Oyster reefs also exist in Alligator Harbor and Ochlockonee Bay in eastern Franklin County (Fig. 3.1). Alligator Harbor is a barrier-spit lagoon partly enclosed by Alligator Point peninsula. It has a mean low water depth of approximately 1.2 m (4 ft) (FDEP 2018). Salinity is similar to that in the Gulf of Mexico due to negligible freshwater input. There are some small areas of dense intertidal and subtidal oyster reef in the eastern end of the Harbor, as well as some scattered larger reefs and oyster growth associated with salt marshes (  stitute of Food and Agricultural Sciences intermittently monitored water quality near these shellfish harvesting areas from 2002-2012; monitoring was discontinued in 2012 due to lack of funding (FDEP 2018). Ochlockonee Bay receives freshwater flow from the Ochlockonee River. The watershed of this river covers 6,412 km 2 (2,476 mi 2 ), including parts of southern Georgia and the city of Tallahassee (NWFWMD 2017). Human population in the watershed is steadily increasing, and with population growth comes concerns for proper wastewater and stormwater management. Ochlockonee Bay includes extensive seagrass beds and coastal salt marshes. Salinity in the bay varies with river flow, and the bay is often stratified (NWFWMD 2017). Salinity has remained sufficiently low in the upper half of the bay to protect oysters there from key predators (Kimbro et al. 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in Apalachicola Bay", "text": "Several recent papers provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the Apalachicola Bay's oyster fishery (and, indirectly, its oyster populations) and various environmental factors, thus providing an overview of threats to oysters , Fisch and Pine 2016, Kimbro et al. 2017, Pusack et al. 2018. From those papers, four of the most important factors are described below (and in some cases in sections above). \u2022 Altered hydrology: Water withdrawals and other changes in the hydrology of the ACF river system represent a threat to oysters that has been at the center of debate and litigation for decades. A network of dams in the ACF river system alters freshwater flow rates, sediment delivery, and erosion patterns for the Apalachicola River and Bay. When this altered hydrology is coupled with low precipitation and urban and agricultural demand for fresh water, the resulting low freshwater flow and high salinity make oysters more vulnerable to dermo (Perkinsus marinus) and predators such as the stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) and southern oyster drill (Stramonita haemastoma) (Livingston et al. 2000, Kimbro et al. 2017, Pusack et al. 2018. Parasites, such as the boring sponge, boring clam, and polychaetes also cause damage to the oysters' shells, possibly resulting in death. The shells become weakened, leaving the oyster more vulnerable to predators . \u2022 Sea-level rise: The combined impact of decreasing freshwater inflow and rising sea level will likely lead to more frequent instances of high salinity in the region. Even with modest increases in sea level, more saline water will enter the bay through East Pass, which will push river discharge toward the west with tidal currents (Huang et al. 2015). Cat Point is expected to experience greater increases in salinity than Dry Bar, as freshwater flow from Apalachicola River is pushed toward Dry Bar (Huang et al. 2015). While most oysters in Apalachicola Bay are subtidal, intertidal oysters will have to cope with increased submergence times.  found that shell length and recruitment are greatest at high rates of submergence for intertidal oysters in Apalachicola Bay. However, these submerged reef elevations also had the highest rates of sedimentation, which can smother reefs. \u2022 Hurricanes and tropical storms: Hurricanes can negatively impact oysters and may cause erosion of reef substrate, sedimentation and burial of reefs, and extreme salinity changes . Hurricanes also redistribute shell off the reef, where it can be buried and lost in the mud (Twichell et al. 2010). Storms often bring heightened pollutant and nutrient loads with terrestrial runoff, which can feed algal blooms (including red tide) and lead to hypoxia ). \u2022 Harvesting: The effect of harvest on a fishery is generally considered a threat only if harvest exceeds the ability of the population to replenish itself.  found that Apalachicola Bay was not experiencing recruitment overfishing, whereby the population of adults can no longer replace itself. There is no assessment of growth overfishing, whereby oysters may be harvested at a size too small to support a maximum sustainable yield, but one still might argue that if the number of legal-size oysters were extremely limiting, growth overfishing might be occurring. However, removal of shell substrate can cause impacts similar to overfishing as it results in the loss of substrate. Substrate loss is a significant factor for poor recruitment; therefore, fishing without shell replacement (as well as illegal fishing not complying with regulations) greatly reduces the chance that populations may recover . The effect of harvest on the ecosystem services oyster reefs provide, however, has not been well assessed and remains controversial (Beck et al. 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Apalachicola Bay oyster mapping and monitoring efforts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Historical oyster mapping", "text": "Oyster maps for Apalachicola Bay date to the work of Franklin Swift who conducted a comprehensive survey in 1895-1896 for the U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries and published a detailed map based on 75,000 manual sounding points (Swift 1897).

The   project used both high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery from Grizzle et al. (2015) and ground truthing to assess the position and size of oyster reefs at the time.

While portions of intertidal reefs have recently been mapped and characterized, there has been no comprehensive mapping of the bay's entire subtidal oyster reef system since Swift (1897). Such a program should yield data that can be coupled with fishery-independent monitoring of the condition of the reefs in all areas of the bay to more fully assess the bay's oyster resources. \u2022 Monitor the condition of the bay's oyster reefs, including harvested and nonharvested reefs. Fishery-dependent data are limited to reefs open to fishing, so fishery-independent monitoring should be expanded to include adequate sampling of both harvested and non-harvested reefs . The resulting data should be coupled with mapping programs to improve understanding of spatial and ecological relationships between the bay's oyster reefs and environmental variability. \u2022 Better manage the fate of oyster shell removed during harvest. The importance of adequate hard substrate for larval settlement, and thus long-term sustainability of oyster reefs, has long been recognized (Swift 1898). Shelling programs have been conducted in Florida by FDACS, but no permanent funding source exists. These programs have focused on Apalachicola Bay and, more recently but to a lesser extent, St. Andrew and Pensacola bays, but they have relied on grants. The importance of shelling programs to oyster management is well established . Many questions remain, however, with respect to details in program design . Ongoing research is aimed at assessing optimal densities for deployment of fossil shell, but research also is needed on where shell plantings should be located, the types of substrate (e.g., fossil shell, recycled seasoned shell) that are most effective, and how to spread the shell. \u2022 Investigate management needs and social issues related to salinity and river discharge requirements for Apalachicola Bay. Increased salinity as a result of reduced river discharges to the bay and sea-level rise is a major threat to oysters in this region, but also one of the most difficult to address. Litigation continues for water rights between states in the ACF watershed (Florida v. Georgia 2018, Pittman 2018. Although there has been a substantial amount of research on how oyster popu-lations respond to increasing salinity, including research in Apalachicola Bay, research is also needed on how to address such complicated social issues from a management perspective. \u2022 Continue research on the ecological roles of oysters in Apalachicola Bay. The bay's oyster resource has historically been managed almost entirely as a resource for human harvest, but oyster reefs also provide habitat, improve water quality through filter feeding, and are components of the estuary food chain. More information is needed particularly on how oyster harvest practices impact these ecological roles, and on how to optimize ecosystem functionality in a heavily harvested estuary. \u2022 Further explore the role of oyster aquaculture in the bay. Oyster farming and oyster fishing are not mutually exclusive, but the tradition in Apalachicola Bay has not included aquaculture. In contrast, oyster farming is becoming increasingly common in other Florida estuaries, such as nearby Apalachee Bay and Alligator Harbor (FDEP 2018; Reiley 2018). The use of Territorial User Rights Fisheries (TURFs; Prince et al. 1998), in which oysters are harvested from areas leased to individual oyster farmers rather than from common-use public reefs , should also be explored. Individual leases help prevent unsustainable fishing practices and shell removal and encourage stewardship of reefs for long-term use, such as shelling to replace lost substrate. \u2022 Involve all relevant state agencies, experts from academic institutions, and community organizations such as the Seafood Management Assistance Resource and Recovery Team (SMARRT) to develop an oyster management plan for the long-term well-being of oyster populations and the oyster industry in Apalachicola Bay. Although the present oyster shell height limit of 76 mm (3 in) is appropriate, it needs to be better enforced. Harvesting sublegal-size oysters is detrimental to future Apalachicola Bay oyster populations . Spatial restrictions and temporary closures need to be enforced and respected, including continuation or implementation of on-land and on-water checks. A bag tax used to fund research and monitoring programs that ended in the 1990s could also be reinstated ). \u2022 Enhance community outreach with partnerships in research, policy development, and education. The most effective policies will be those that result from a broad support base and are responsive to changes and new knowledge. quently found in intertidal areas with greater freshwater input, such as at the mouths of rivers and tidal creeks, as the lower salinity reduces the abundance of marine predators . Oyster reefs in these low-salinity nearshore areas often have higher percent cover and population density than high-salinity offshore reefs (Bergquist et al. 2006). The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is the most common oyster species; the crested oyster (Ostrea stentina) is also found, but is much less common (Wolfe 1990). Offshore reefs often form in linear patterns roughly parallel to shore, following paleoshorelines (Wright et al. 2005). Linear reef chains can act as semipermeable dams that slow the flow of fresh water from rivers and decrease salinity inshore of the reef, facilitating the development of inshore oyster reefs (Wright et al. 2005, Frederick et al. 2015, Kaplan et al. 2016. Oyster reefs can also lead to the development of a marsh island with smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora; Wolfe 1990). Marsh islands are generally located closer to shore and have higher elevations than sand-oyster reefs, which are made up of coarse sand with shell fragments interspersed with oyster clumps ."}, {"section_title": "Apalachee Bay", "text": "Apalachee Bay (Fig. 4.2), located in the northern Big Bend, receives freshwater inflow from the Ochlockonee, Wakulla, St. Marks, Aucilla, Econfina, and Fenholloway rivers along with numerous other small creeks.

Surface and subsurface freshwater discharge flows into Deadman Bay, creating an average salinity of 26 within the bay. Limited oyster reefs are found near the mouth of the Steinhatchee River (Fig. 4.3)."}, {"section_title": "Suwannee Sound", "text": "The Suwannee River begins in Georgia and provides the largest source of fresh water to the Big Bend (FDEP 2015). Suwannee Sound, which extends roughly from Horseshoe Point to Cedar Key, has an average salinity of 16 (and a range of 1 to 26) due to freshwater input from the Suwannee River (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4; FDEP 2015, Frederick et al. 2015). Moderate-salinity (15-25) waters extend about 8 km (5 mi) offshore (Nelson 2015). Suwannee Sound contains oyster reefs scattered among salt marsh islands and historically hosted extensive linear offshore oyster reefs (Fig. 4.5). Evidence from the past 150 years suggests that many offshore, inshore, and nearshore oyster reefs migrated landward, with the exception of those offshore reefs that were largely lost ( Fig. 4.5; ). An aerial-photograph assessment of oyster habitat trends in the Suwannee Sound region revealed a 66% net loss of oyster reef area from 1982 to 2011 . The loss was greatest in high-salinity offshore reefs (88% areal loss) and decreased in nearshore (61% loss) and inshore reefs (50% loss). Restoration efforts have shown that the physical reef structure can cause waters on the landward side of the reefs to have salinity that is an average of 3 (or maximum of 10) lower than waters on the seaward side of the reef (Frederick et al. 2015). Because offshore barrier reefs help to protect inshore reefs from wave action and create lower salinity conditions, the collapse of offshore oyster reefs leads to further oyster collapse inshore (Frederick et al. 2015, Kaplan et al. 2016. Oyster collapse resulted in the erosion (~7 cm/2.8 in elevation loss per year) of many high-density, high-relief oyster reefs and conversion to low-relief tidal flats dominated by sand and scattered shells . In some cases, oyster collapse led to an apparent increase in reef area as eroded shell spread across a wider expanse of substrate. This apparent expansion was temporary, as oyster spat were not able to successfully settle and establish on these collapsed oyster reefs due to limited substrate availability and stability. Following declines in oyster acreage in the 1980s and 1990s, oyster reef collapse was reported after 2000. The cause for the decline has been attributed to decreased freshwater discharge from the Suwannee River, which is linked with human usage and rainfall. Total discharge from the Suwannee River has declined relative to the amount of rain falling in the watershed, and months with low discharge have increased in frequency .  suggest that mechanisms for the loss of oyster reefs include some combination of increased occurrence of disease, predation, and parasitism driven by increased salinity, as has also been reported in the Chesapeake Bay (White and Wilson 1996). Restoration actions that include the addition of substrates resistant to erosion may mitigate reef collapse (Frederick et al. 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Springs Coast", "text": "The Springs Coast (Figs. 4.4 and 4.6) receives freshwater outflow from groundwater seeps and spring-fed rivers including the Crystal, Homosassa, Chassahowitzka, Weeki Wachee, and Pithlachascotee rivers . Oyster reefs are found mostly inshore among marsh islands, but occasionally offshore as linear reefs that fringe the shoreline. Mid-19th-century surveys of the Springs Coast indicate that offshore reefs were more abundant at the mouths of these spring-fed rivers than today ( Fig. 4.7; Bache 1861, Raabe et al. 2004). The Crystal, Chassahowitzka, and Weeki Wachee rivers also had oyster reefs in the 1800s, but offshore reefs remain only at the Crystal River. At other rivers, remnants of these reefs are evident in the numerous shoals dominated by sand and scattered shell that extend across river mouths, many of which are no longer exposed at low tide (Hesterberg, pers. obs.). Spatial analysis of the historical distribution of oyster reef locations near the Crystal River compared with the best available mod- ern maps indicates a net landward movement of oyster habitat over the past 150 years (Fig. 4.7). These observations corroborate the findings of , who attributed shifts in reef distribution in the Suwannee area to decreasing freshwater input. The spatial loss of offshore oyster reefs near the Crystal River mirrors patterns of decline observed elsewhere in the Big Bend and corresponds with decreasing freshwater discharge from the Crystal River and increasing periods of higher salinity (SWFWMD 2015). Excavations of prehistoric (1,500-1,000 ybp) shell middens from well-dated archaeological sites near the Crystal River suggests a dramatic decline in shell height of individual oysters over the last two millennia (Hesterberg et al., in review). Mean oyster size in the modern population is one third that of the archaeological baseline, and maximum body size has been sharply truncated at approximately 120 mm (4.7 in). These results are in stark contrast to frequent observations in middens of shells greater than 140 mm (5.5 in). Large oysters disproportionately contribute to increased water filtration, reproductive output, and shell budgets compared to smaller individuals (Riisg\u00e5rd 1988, Mroch et al. 2011, Mann et al. 2014. Thus, shifts in oyster size structure suggest a reduction in ecosystem services for reefs that have existed for thousands of years (Grinnell 1971, Wright et al. 2005. Despite losses in both habitat extent and ecosystem services, the Crystal River still possesses the highest density of oyster reefs along the Springs Coast (Figs. 4.4 and  4.7). The clustering of oyster reefs in this area partially results from the large spring-fed discharge of the Crystal River. Like other river systems in the Big Bend, the substantial quantity of freshwater that empties into Crystal Bay creates lower-salinity conditions that extend for several kilometers offshore. The lower nearshore salinity, paired with a strong tidal exchange and often exposed limestone bedrock, produce favorable conditions for intertidal oyster reef formation . Although the Crystal River faces ongoing water quality challenges (SWFWMD 2015), this system might offer the best opportunity to protect and restore oyster reefs along the Springs Coast, given the amount of remaining habitat and its favorable hydrology. "}, {"section_title": "Oyster harvesting", "text": "Numerous shell middens along the Big Bend and Springs Coast indicate that oysters have been harvested in this region for at least 1,400 years (Dean et al. 2004, Sassaman et al. 2013. Commercial harvesting began in the Big Bend in the late 1800s, but an intensive industry failed to materialize in the 20th century despite the presence of productive beds (Dawson 1955, Arnold and. The modern commercial oyster fishery in Florida has been dominated by landings from the Apalachicola Bay region in Franklin County, but the Big Bend area also has a history of commercial harvest. Annual yields in the Big Bend and Springs Coast varied throughout the 1900s and peaked in the 1980s before declining significantly in the 1990s (Fig.  4.8, . This decline can be attributed largely to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) beginning to close shellfish harvesting areas in 1987 due to the presence of fecal coliform bacteria as well as a shift in emphasis in 1991 from wild oyster harvesting to hard-clam aquaculture (Colson andSturmer 2000, Seavey et al. 2011). The Big Bend and Springs Coast region contains several shellfish harvesting areas, located in Wakulla, Dixie, Levy, and Citrus counties, that are monitored by FDACS ( Fig. 4.9; FDACS 2017). Several of the areas with productive oyster reefs in the Big Bend are often closed to commercial harvest due to water quality concerns (FDEP 2015). Other factors have been proposed to explain the industry's limited development in the region, including periodic mortality events, habitat loss, pollution, and market pressures (Dawson 1955, Colson and Sturmer 2000. However, the relative contribution of each factor remains unclear and likely varies locally. Since the collapse of the Apalachicola oyster fishery in 2012, there has been increased focus on the Big Bend fishery. Although current oyster harvests in the Big Bend are far smaller than the peak yields of the 1980s (Fig. 4.8), harvests are increasing again. In 2016, commercial oyster landings for both the Big Bend and the previously dominant Franklin County were both 170 metric tons (375,000 pounds; FWC 2018). In 2017, commercial oyster landings for the Big Bend increased to 219 metric tons (483,000 pounds), surpassing the Franklin County yield of 122 metric tons (268,000 pounds; FWC 2018). The role of harvest in structuring the distribution and viability of oyster reefs in the Big Bend is unclear, primarily because of uncertainty regarding the effects of fishing to the predominantly intertidal reefs along the Big Bend compared to the subtidal oyster reefs of Apalachicola.\nTampa Bay had a robust commercial fishery in the late 1800s that yielded up to 227 metric tons (500,000 pounds) annually (Finucane and Campbell 1968). Most of this harvest originated in northern parts of Old Tampa Bay. Yields dramatically decreased in the first half of the 1900s, and by the 1950s commercial oyster harvest declined to an annual yield around 2.3 metric tons (5,000 pounds) ( Fig. 5.2; Finucane and Campbell 1968, Morrison et al. 2011. Harvest temporarily rebounded in the mid-1960s, largely as a result of cultch distribution on leased oyster grounds in Old Tampa Bay (Finucane and Campbell 1968). Cultch was also distributed in sections of Middle Tampa Bay for commercial fisheries (Whitfield 1975). Based on records of shell production from leases, Estevez (2010) estimated that Tampa Bay once held 800 ha (1,980 ac) of oyster reefs and submerged shell. Oyster shell was extensively harvested for use in the construction industry and over 25.9 million metric tons (28.5 million US tons) of oyster shell were mined between 1931 and 1974 (Whitfield 1975 (Fig. 5.3) contingent on levels of fecal coliform bacteria and other contaminants, which often correlate with intensity of rainfall events (FDACS 2017). The commercial harvest in Tampa Bay has often been closed since 1995 as a result of fecal coliform and other contaminant levels ( Fig. 5.2; SWFWMD 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in the Big Bend and Springs Coast", "text": "\u2022 Altered hydrology and salinity: The primary threat to oyster reefs in the Big Bend and Springs Coast region is decreased freshwater input, which results in higher salinity (Geselbracht 2007). Many aspects of oyster biology are strongly influenced by local salinity patterns, including abundance, growth, mortality, recruitment, and reproduction (Bergquist et al. 2006, La Peyre et al. 2013, Miller et al. 2017. Evidence of the effects of increased salinity on oyster reefs can be seen in the preferential loss of offshore reefs and the net landward migration of extant habitat Figs. 4 \u2022 Sea-level rise: Sea level rose at a rate of 2.02 mm/yr (0.80 in/decade) from 1914 to 2016 in the Big Bend and Springs Coast (Cedar Key tide gauge; NOAA 2017), increasing risk of exposure to parasites and predators as salinity and tidal immersion increased . Oyster reefs accrete vertical elevation over time and thus can decrease the length of time spent immersed by tides , but this requires a healthy reef, including large, long-lived individuals that can contribute ample shell to reef accretion at rates equal to or exceeding sea-level rise . Thus, if oyster reefs are expected to keep pace with accelerating sea-level rise, managers must attempt to maximize oyster body size on reefs and keep other stressors, such as temperature and salinity, below thresholds that impact individual performance or mortality. \u2022 Lack of adaptive, robust management strategies: Current management strategies for oyster resources focus on a combination of size limits, bag limits, and seasonal closures to protect human health. It is not known how effective these regulations are in protecting oyster recruitment and growth from increasing fishing effort. Given that oyster populations declined before the recent increase in landings and trips in this region , the concern that increased landings will result in high effective mortality is justified.

Traditional mapping and ground-truthing of oyster reefs is needed to help evaluate the continued impacts of reduced freshwater flow on oyster conditions and changes in reef location (FDEP 2015). Efforts to reconstruct the historical distribution of oyster habitat from aerial photographs and nautical charts could also prove useful for establishing reference conditions and elucidating the causes of habitat loss. Although mapping the spatial distribution of oyster habitat is valuable, oyster monitoring must extend beyond reef aerial extent, which can increase due to reef collapse and therefore mask declines in habitat quality . The Conservation Action Plan for Marine and Estuarine Resources of the Big Bend specifically recommends monitoring oysters for population structure (e.g., size, abundance), disease, recruitment, and vertical relief of reefs (Geselbracht 2007). The NOAA Oyster Restoration Workgroup recommends monitoring similar metrics ). Yet widespread monitoring has not been implemented, and a severe lack of basic information on past and present reef conditions exists for the region. There are no standardized Perkinsus marinus (dermo) monitoring efforts for oysters within the Big Bend, nor are there standardized pre-or postharvest surveys of oyster population structure that might inform management decisions (as are conducted in Apalachicola Bay). This lack of information reduces the likelihood of detecting early warning signs of oyster population collapse and understanding what factors lead to the declines. \u2022 Quantifying an oyster population's size structure can rapidly provide a snapshot of reef health, as large oysters are disproportionately important for reproductive output and shell budgets and provide information about the capacity of the habitat to withstand future stressors. The presence of large individuals can also be indicators of a reef's ability to cope with the threats outlined above, including salinity and thermal stress, overfishing, and sea-level rise. Change in body size has also been suggested as an early indicator prior to population collapse Ozgul 2015, Clements et al. 2017). Given the limited time and resources available for monitoring, size structure of oyster populations should be emphasized in future assessments as it is both important and easy to quantify (Woodward et al. 2005). \u2022 Large-scale oyster reef restoration should continue in the Suwannee Sound and expand to other sections of the coast, complementing habitat protection towards achieving regional conservation goals. Substrate-focused restoration efforts on Suwannee Sound oyster reefs have proved successful in improving oyster densities and reducing salinity inshore of the reefs, allowing for mitigation of some of the impacts of reduced freshwater flows (Frederick et al. 2015, Kaplan et al. 2016. But the long-term effectiveness of adding shell material to promote oyster reef growth is uncertain given the oyster population stock status and limited availability of cultch. If this restoration method proves successful, other viable locations, such as the Withlacoochee, Crystal, Homosassa, and Chassahowitzka rivers, should be considered for future restoration. An alternative strategy is to develop a better understanding of how positive shell budgets can be maintained naturally on oyster reefs without the addition of shell material. For harvested reefs, this may necessitate examining fishery practices including how and where culling takes place and determining survival rates of culls. It may also require implementing rotational harvest policies to allow for the accumulation of shell material through natural mortality processes on extant reefs. It is not certain whether restoration is more effective when creating large areas of low-relief habitat or creating smaller areas of high-relief habitat. Addressing these uncertainties will increase the effectiveness of management and restoration. \u2022 The 2012 collapse of the Apalachicola oyster fishery and subsequent increase in oyster harvest in the Big Bend region have created a need to re-evaluate oyster fishery policies in the region. While size regulations, bag limits, and seasonal closures may once have promoted sustainable fisheries, new fishery management strategies should be considered, along with changing climate, fluctuating oyster fishing effort, and widespread anthropogenic changes, in efforts to reduce the risk of resource collapse . These strategies could include watershed-scale management and reef resilience, consideration of positive shell budgets and diverse size-age structure on remaining reefs (Quiros et al. 2017). Better enforcement is also needed to address harvesting below minimum size limits and returning culled oysters to their reef of origin. Experimental management policies that might be considered include rotational harvest of wild oyster areas (with long fallow periods) and the development of Territorial User Rights Fisheries (TURFs), which transfer (through leases) rights to bottom areas to individual fishers. The latter approach could promote innovative modes of reef conservation and restoration by providing TURF holders the incentive to better manage their individual resource. Finally, the growing oyster aquaculture industry should be viewed as a new alternative for providing direct benefits to oyster harvesters and local communities and reducing harvest pressure on wild oyster resources. "}, {"section_title": "Tampa Bay", "text": "Located on the central Gulf coast of Florida, Tampa Bay is Florida's largest open-water estuary with a surface area of 1,036 km 2 (400 mi 2 ) ( Fig. 5.1; TBEP 2017). The bay receives freshwater flow from four major rivers (Hillsborough, Alafia, Manatee, and Little Manatee) and more than 100 small tributaries. Tampa Bay has a large, permanent connection to the Gulf of Mexico and has strong tidal currents at the mouth of the bay. There are five passes that connect to the Gulf of Mexico (Pass-a-Grille Channel, Bunces Pass, Egmont Channel, Southwest Channel, and Passage Key Inlet) as well as connections to Clearwater Harbor in the north through Boca Ciega Bay and the Intracoastal Waterway. Tampa Bay connects to the south to Sarasota Bay through Anna Maria Sound. The watershed area is about 5,700 km 2 (2,200 mi 2 ) and includes large portions of Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Manatee counties, as well as smaller portions of Pasco, Polk, and Sarasota counties (TBEP 2017). Outside of the Tampa Bay watershed, the greater region also includes Clearwater Harbor and St. Joseph Sound in northwestern Pinellas County (Fig. 5.1). The Tampa Bay area includes many city, county, and state parks and preserves, aquatic preserves, and national wildlife refuges. The entire region lies within the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) and the bay has one of the 28 National Estuary Programs in the United States. The Tampa Bay area is highly urbanized with a population of over 3 million people. Local hydrology has been altered by freshwater withdrawal from tributaries and the construction of water reservoirs in order to meet urban water demands (Yates and Greening 2011). Urban construction has led to the channelization of stormwater, which increases the rate of surface water delivery and also transports nutrients and other pollutants to the bay. By the 1970s, Tampa Bay faced severe water quality problems and habitat degradation as a result of excessive nutrient input. These nutrient inputs were reduced through upgraded wastewater and stormwater treatment, lower industrial emissions, and other improvements in Tampa and St. Petersburg, reversing trends in eutrophication and improving habitat quality throughout the bay (Greening and Janicki 2006, Holland et al. 2006, Sherwood et al. 2017. Tampa Bay has an average depth of 4 m (12 ft); this average depth has increased by more than 5% since 1900 as a result of channel dredging and rising sea level (Goodwin 1984, SWFWMD 1999. The bay has been dredged extensively for the creation of shipping channels and approximately 51% of Tampa Bay's shoreline has been altered (Coastal Environmental, Inc. 1994). In developed areas, the shoreline is generally hardened as rip-rap or a seawall; remaining natural shorelines are dominated by mangroves. The average tidal range in Tampa Bay is 0.4 m (1.2 ft) (SWFWMD 1999). Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs are found in intertidal areas throughout Tampa Bay and are often clustered near freshwater inputs (Kaufman 2017). Mean monthly salinity on oyster reefs in Lower Tampa Bay ranges from 25 to 36 , but salinity can reach the low 20s during wet seasons . Although Tampa Bay is highly urbanized, the bay does not face the extreme hydrologic impacts and salinity fluctuations seen in south Florida, making it a comparatively stable habitat for oysters . However, tidal flow and flushing are restricted by multiple causeways in the upper reaches of Old Tampa Bay (located in northwestern Tampa Bay; Fig. 5.1). In a study of oyster density and recruitment across estuaries in central and southern Florida, Tampa Bay was found to have the most stable oyster population and a reef population density of 104-442 oysters/m 2 (10-41 oysters/ft 2 ) . As the lower bay provides relatively stable salinity, a lack of suitable hard substrate is the primary factor limiting oyster distribution (Morrison et al. 2011). The sediments of Tampa Bay are largely made up of sand and carbonate shell fragments, with clays and organic sediment becoming more prominent in the upper reaches of the bay (Brooks and Doyle 1998). Intermittent hard bottom, including subtidal oyster reefs and low-relief limestone outcroppings, are also found in the bay. Like oyster reefs, hard bottom is considered essential fish habitat and supports sponges, soft corals, algae, and live rock. Hard bottom has been mapped in selected parts of Tampa Bay (Savercool and Lewis 1994), but the full extent of hard bottom and subtidal oyster reefs is unknown (TBEP 2017). Oyster reefs in Tampa Bay were most recently mapped in 2016 by the SWFWMD seagrass and oyster mapping effort ( Fig. 5.1; SWFW-MD 2016). Oyster extent includes natural reefs and restoration sites created by multiple organizations since the early 2000s. Old Tampa Bay contained approximately 44% of Tampa Bay's oyster habitat in 2016 (Table 5.1; Kaufman 2017). Oysters that grow in close association with mangroves or seawalls are frequently not mapped or included in acreage estimates due to the difficulty of mapping these peripheral habitats using aerial imagery . However, oyster populations on seawalls or mangrove roots often have a higher density and biomass than oysters in reefs in Tampa Bay (Drexler et al. 2014). Although oysters on mangrove roots and seawalls are significantly smaller, they have similar condition index, fecundity, and recruitment as reef oysters and therefore are an important component of the bay-wide population . The oyster disease dermo (Perkinsus marinus) is relatively common year-round in Tampa Bay and has been found in 50% of oysters on natural reefs, 45% of oysters on seawalls, 42% of oysters on mangrove roots, and 38% of oysters in restoration habitats (Drexler 2011. The increased prevalence of dermo on natural reefs may be linked to longer submergence times or greater age of oysters there than of oysters on seawalls or mangrove roots . Although dermo infections are common, intensity is quite low and averages less than one on  scale of zero to five, where a zero indicates no infection and five is a severe infection . There is no evidence of MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) in Tampa Bay oysters (Arnold et al. 2008). Several organizations including Tampa Bay Watch, Manatee County, and numerous supporting partners have conducted oyster restoration efforts since the early 2000s (TBEP 2017). In addition, intertidal restoration projects or living shorelines often directly (through use of oyster bags or reef modules) or indirectly (through oysters growing on red mangrove prop roots) result in increased oyster habitat (NOAA 2015, Brandt Henningsen pers. comm.).

Sarasota Bay is not an estuary under the influence of a major river, but rather a restricted coastal lagoon bounded by barrier islands. Phillippi Creek, which drains into Roberts Bay, is the largest of 16 tidal tributaries that flow into the system. Sarasota Bay has 135 km 2 (52 mi 2 ) of open water and a watershed comprising 390 km 2 (150 mi 2 ) (SBEP 2007 The cities of Sarasota and Bradenton are located along Sarasota Bay and the barrier islands are also highly developed. Many of the area's coastal wetlands have been lost to urban development and more than 160 km (100 mi) of seawalls are present today around Sarasota Bay, making up more than 80% of the bay's shoreline (SBEP 2010). As development expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, increased coastal runoff and poor wastewater management resulted in poor water quality due to excess sediments, nutrients, and other pollutants. Similarly, hydrologic alteration and canal systems around Dona and Roberts bays have tripled the historical freshwater flow into the small bays, reducing salinity and increasing nutrient load (CHNEP 2013). By the late 1980s, Sarasota Bay had reduced bivalve and fish harvests and diminished extent of seagrass beds (SBEP 2010). Nearly 1,820 ha (4,500 ac) of benthic habitat in Sarasota Bay, including oyster reefs and seagrass beds, were covered by dredge-and-fill operations (SBEP 2006). The SBEP was formed in 1989, and the community began to improve water quality and stormwater management in order to aid shoreline habitats, local fisheries, and seagrass extent (SBEP 1992). As a result of these efforts,  nitrogen pollution decreased 64% from 1988 to 2010 and nitrogen loading from wastewater decreased 95% (SBEP 2010). Oysters are found along the fringes of greater Sarasota Bay, particularly near areas of freshwater input where salinity is more suitable for oyster survival. Salinity within greater Sarasota Bay is generally 30-35, although in the rainy season salinity in Little Sarasota Bay varies between 15 and 30 (Sarasota County 2017). As a result of its more favorable salinity, Little Sarasota Bay contains the largest portion of the area's oysters (Table 5.2). The majority of oyster extent in the greater Sarasota Bay area is primarily made up of natural reefs, with smaller contributions from oysters growing on seawalls, rip rap, mangrove roots, and pilings . Sarasota Bay has lost much of its fringing mangroves to hardened shorelines through ongoing urban development, resulting in a loss of mangrove root habitat (SBEP 2006). Like Tampa Bay, oysters in Sarasota are also substrate-limited (SBEP 2006, SBEP 2010, SBEP 2014. To provide additional substrate, restoration efforts include the addition of fossilized shells in mesh bags and prefabricated reef ball modules (SBEP 2006). Mounds of oyster shells at Historic Spanish Point and elsewhere provide evidence that Sarasota Bay once hosted an active oyster fishery for Native Americans (SBEP 2006). While Sarasota Bay does include a conditionally approved shellfish harvesting area (Fig. 5.3), it is opened infrequently, and commercial oyster harvest was only recorded four times between 1951 and 2017 ( Fig. 5.2)."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in Tampa and Sarasota bays", "text": "\u2022 Habitat loss: Large areas of oyster habitat in Tampa and Sarasota bays have been lost to dredge and fill construction, shell mining, and poorly-regulated commercial harvesting prior to the 1970s. Dredging efforts to maintain shipping channels move and suspend sediment, which can smother neighboring reefs. Hard bottom habitats and subtidal oyster reefs have also been removed for the construction of underwater pipelines and communications cables. Although mitigation regulations require the creation of new habitats, the resulting communities on the mitigated surfaces may be different than the natural habitats (TBEP 2017). \u2022 Altered hydrology: Both natural and restored oyster reefs are indirectly impacted by proximity to urban development through nutrient and pollutant runoff, but water quality has improved substantially since the 1970s-1980s Janicki 2006, SBEP 2010). In addition to water quality, changes to natural hydrology and salinity regimes by water control structures and consumptive use have also caused adverse impacts to oyster populations , CHNEP 2013. The construction of several causeways (Sunshine Skyway, Howard Franklin, Courtney Campbell, and McKay Bay) has certainly reduced tidal flushing within Tampa Bay but the net result for oysters is poorly understood. \u2022 Boating impacts: Recreational boaters harm oyster reefs through erosion from boat wakes, boat groundings, collective damage from anchors (TBEP 2017). \u2022 Invasive species: The Asian green mussel (Perna vir idis) was first documented in Tampa Bay in 1999 and is presumed to have arrived as larvae in ballast water . The mussel does not have native predators and can outcompete native bivalves for space and food . Asian green mussels have been observed outcompeting eastern oysters for space in at least one location in the intertidal zone in Tampa Bay (Baker et al. 2007). \u2022 Climate change and sea-level rise: Changes in hydrology from sea-level rise or climate change may impact suitable areas for oyster reefs by altering the salinity regime. Additionally, most oyster reefs in Tampa Bay are intertidal. Sea-level rise may force vertical accretion on these existing reefs, result in the loss of this habitat type, or cause upslope migration of oyster reefs in areas where their movement is not inhibited by steep slopes, seawalls, or other factors. Changes in the frequency and severity of storms (both tropical and frontal systems) and weather patterns (El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation) affect rainfall and subsequently the location and size of optimal oyster habitat. Decreases in pH levels worldwide (ocean acidification) can be detrimental to oysters and other calcifying marine and estuarine species . However, there are some indications that increased seagrass extent (as seen in Tampa Bay over the past three decades) in areas with carbonate sediment can locally combat pH trends toward acidification (Yates et al. 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Southwest Florida Water Management District mapping", "text": "The SWFWMD has conducted seagrass mapping every two years since 1988 using a modified version of the Florida Land Use and Cover Classification System (FLUCCS; FDOT 1999) for coastal areas in the district.

More frequent water sampling, such as sampling with autonomous instruments, is needed to capture data on freshwater pulses and their impact on oysters (CHNEP 2019). \u2022 Compared with more urbanized areas of Florida, oyster mapping and monitoring are notably lacking for many regions of Everglades National Park. Oyster distribution in the region should be documented before completion of major improvements to U.S. 41 that will improve surface water flow. The Shark River Slough and Taylor Creek areas should be monitored after construction to assess whether the changes have improved conditions for oyster development (Penny Hall, pers. comm.). \u2022 To gauge progress toward the goal of 400-2,400 ha (1,000-6,000 ac) of oyster habitat in Charlotte Harbor, the CHNEP Oyster Habitat Restoration Plan recommends mapping oyster habitats by type and implementing and monitoring oyster restoration efforts throughout the estuary by 2020 ). \u2022 Continue efforts to determine patterns of oyster distribution before European settlement using historical records and sedimentary coring techniques ). \u2022 Improve mechanistic understanding of reef-forming and reef-eroding processes (i.e., improve shell budget calculations). \u2022 Improve understanding of how larval supply and transport among oyster reefs is impacted by river flow. \u2022 Improve ecosystem service estimates (e.g., habitat provision, wave attenuation, water filtration, food-web contributions) for reef-forming and mangrove-root oysters. \u2022 Improve estimates of predation and disease, especially as they relate to droughts. \u2022 Assess whether recent increases in regional oyster harvests are sustainable.

Duration of intertidal exposure should also be included among those environmental indicators , particularly in the context of sea-level rise. Oyster health and histology assessment should be included in routine monitoring (e.g., diseases, sex ratios, physiological status). \u2022 While oysters have been mapped within the major tributaries of the IRL, oyster reef mapping data are lacking in the main portion of the lagoon and its minor tributaries. In central and southeast Florida, much oyster growth occurs on mangrove roots or along seawalls. Oysters at the periphery are seldom mapped by traditional efforts, which rely on aerial photography; on-site mapping should be completed to identify oysters on seawalls and mangrove roots. \u2022 Oyster extent in southeast Florida fluctuates as a result of urban development, variable freshwater flow, and changing freshwater management.

"}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6 Southwest Florida", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Charlotte Harbor", "text": "Charlotte Harbor is a large, complex estuary bordered by barrier islands and includes the cities of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Punta Gorda, and North Port. The estuary falls on the boundary between the jurisdictions of the Southwest and South Florida water management districts (SWFWMD and SFWMD, respectively) ( Fig.  6.2). It receives freshwater input from the Myakka, Peace, and Caloosahatchee rivers along with many other minor tributaries. Management of the region is facilitated by the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program, CHNEP, which in 2019 was renamed the Coastal and Heartland National Estuary Partnership, and large areas are protected from development under the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Aquatic Preserve program (Fig. 6.3). The J.N. \"Ding\" Darling Wildlife Refuge complex, owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), includes Island Bay, Pine Island Sound, Matlacha Pass, and Caloosahatchee National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) and encompasses a significant area of mangrove islands. Most oyster reefs in Charlotte Harbor are intertidal, although subtidal reefs are present at depths of at least 1.8 m (6 ft) in the Caloosahatchee River . Reefs in open water are common in San Carlos Bay at the mouth of the Caloosahatchee, Matlacha Pass, and Pine Island Sound (Fig. 6.3). Historically, reefs in San Carlos Bay were typically elongated, usually perpendicular to the predominant direction of tidal or river flow, but today they more commonly persist as fringing reefs on low-relief spoil islands. Typical healthy oyster densities are 300-1,500 oysters/m 2 (28-139 oysters/ft 2 ) with shell heights of 21-35 mm (0.8-1.4 in). Many of the remaining reefs, however, have large areas with loose, scattered shell or shell fragments and appear to have lost substrate since the widespread development and land-use conversion that began in the late 1960s (Milbrandt, pers. obs.). Many of the reefs are surrounded by shallow sand bottom with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) growing up to the reef edge; the most common species of SAV are turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum), manateegrass (Syringodi um filiforme), and shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii). Larval supply to these oyster reefs may depend on proximity to a healthy reef, but the relationship between hydrodynamics and larval transport remains poorly understood. In addition to open-water reefs, oysters attach to mangrove prop roots and create fringing reefs along mangrove shorelines. FDEP's Aquatic Preserve and Buffer Preserve programs have protected much of the mangrove habitat in Charlotte Harbor from development. The shade provided by the canopy and the relatively stable root system creates an excellent place for oysters to thrive. However, settlement of oysters on prop roots may be limited because flow restrictions and shallow water may either prevent larvae from reaching the mangrove shorelines or limited water flow may restrict food supply. While data are limited on the extent of oyster reefs before development, it has been estimated that Charlotte Harbor has lost 90% of its oyster reefs since the 1950s , CHNEP 2019. These reefs were lost as a result of mining oyster shell for road construction, unsustainable harvesting rates, changes in surface-water hydrology, excess sedimentation, and direct habitat destruction due to coastal development. Commercial oyster harvests in Charlotte Harbor peaked in the 1960s (Fig.  6.4), and by the early 1970s much of Charlotte Harbor was closed to commercial oyster harvest due to pollution and declining oyster populations (Taylor 1974). Following a resurgence in the 1980s, oysters were not harvested commercially in Charlotte Harbor from 1992 through 2010. Landings resumed in 2011 and increased to 2.1 metric tons (4,666 pounds) in 2016. The impact of this resurgent commercial fishery on the resilience of remaining oyster reefs is a concern. Southwest Florida contains five shellfish harvesting areas. Four are found in Charlotte Harbor and one is in the Ten Thousand Islands (Fig. 6.5; FDACS 2017). Shellfish are also harvested recreationally in the greater Charlotte Harbor region . Removal of oysters for use as chum is largely unregulated in practice and does not adhere to shellfish harvesting areas. Eastern oysters prefer a salinity range of 14-28, although they can survive brief exposure to salinity ranging from 0 to 42 , Vander-Kooy 2012. Oysters in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary must cope with the stress of freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee that result in rapid and extended declines in salinity. Juvenile oysters are particularly susceptible to fresh water, and salinity <5 can result in 95% juvenile mortality (Volety et al. 2003). The combination of low salinity and high flow in summer hinders larval recruitment in the Caloosahatchee (Volety et al. 2003. Oysters in San Carlos Bay, Pine Island Sound, and associated waters also must endure long periods of high salinity during periods of low river flow. The CHNEP Oyster Habitat Restoration Plan (Boswell et al. 2012) was funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and developed by the CHNEP Technical Advisory Committee as well as the oyster experts and stakeholders that made up the Southwest Florida Oyster Working Group. The purpose of the plan was to establish oyster restoration goals, methods, and partnerships in the region. While a 1999 mapping effort documented only 100 ha (247 ac) of oysters in the estuary (Avineon 2004), the restoration plan determined that the CHNEP study area should ideally support 400-2,400 ha (1,000-6,000 ac) of oyster reefs . The plan also included an oyster restoration suitability model, which identified locations within the estuary that ranged from least to most optimal for oysters based on five key restoration factors: local seagrass persistence, aquaculture lease areas, boat channels, bathymetry, and salinity . To advance  oyster restoration in the Charlotte Harbor region and throughout the state, TNC facilitated a statewide team of stakeholders in the development of a new FDEP general permit specifically for low-profile oyster restoration efforts. The permit was approved by the state in 2013 and is the only state permit designed specifically for oyster restoration."}, {"section_title": "Estero Bay", "text": "South of Charlotte Harbor, Estero Bay is also lined by barrier islands and receives freshwater flow from many small rivers and creeks (Figs. 6.3 and 6.6). Much of the shoreline was protected from development and has been preserved as Estero Bay Preserve State Park, although there is extensive development on the barrier islands and uplands surrounding the bay. A large network of oyster reefs is present in northern Estero Bay, and smaller reefs are found in the southern part of this system (FDEP 2014; Fig. 6.6). The reefs in Estero Bay are subject to modified timing and delivery of freshwater flow, but to a lesser extent than the Caloosahatchee River. The irregular shape of the coastline and mangrove islands in Estero Bay are a result of oyster reef formation and accretion of sediments in the early to middle Holocene (Savarese et al. 2004a). The sedimentation, along with shell growth and recruitment of young oysters, results in high rates of accretion and provides substrate for settlement of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle). These mangroves eventually mature into mangrove islands, but evidence of past oyster reefs remains in the underlying stratigraphy (Savarese et al. 2004a)."}, {"section_title": "Naples Bay", "text": "Historically, Naples Bay received the majority of its freshwater flow from rainfall-derived sheet flow and from small natural tributaries: Gordon River, Rock Creek, and Haldeman Creek. The watershed's drainage area was approximately 25 km 2 (10 mi 2 ) before it was developed and comprised mostly mesic and hydric flatwoods (Woithe and Brandt- Williams 2006). Mangroves dominated the shoreline of this shallow estuary, and the bay once thrived with oyster reefs, seagrass beds, and numerous fish species (Simpson et al. 1979). Extensive development, watershed alterations, and dredge-and-fill activities since the 1950s transformed Naples Bay (Fig. 6.7) into a highly urbanized estuary (Laakkonen 2014). Residential development led to an increase in hardened shorelines in the 1950s and 1960s . Navigation canals lined with sea-walls and bulkheads replaced more than 70% of the mangrove shoreline. The bay has lost 90% of its seagrass beds and 80% of its oyster reefs ( Fig. 6.8; . Today subtidal oyster reefs are present on sandy substrates in the northern part of the bay and fringing reefs are found in the southern part of the bay. Seismic profiling in Naples Bay revealed few buried oyster reefs, indicating that most of the historical reef extent was lost to dredging rather than sedimentation . Today, Naples Bay remains a challenging environment for oysters due to water quality issues, muddy substrates, and suspended sediments, which can smother reefs . The natural tributaries of Naples Bay have been severely altered by urbanization and the addition of numerous canals, significantly changing the hydrology and disrupting the timing and magnitude of freshwater flow to the estuary. The construction of canal systems in residential areas has increased the perimeter of the bay by 53% and the water surface area by 23% . Land use in the watershed is a mosaic of residential developments, industrial areas, and agricultural lands, which have increased the pollutant load to the bay (Woithe and Brandt- Williams 2006). Surface water that once traveled as a sheet flow through wetlands is now rapidly conveyed to Naples Bay via stormwater pipes and surface canals, resulting in degraded water quality including increased nutrients, sediments, and metals (CSF 2011). The construction of the Golden Gate Canal (Fig. 6.7) in the 1960s to drain the Northern Golden Gate Estates increased the size of the Naples Bay watershed from approximately 25 km 2 (10 mi 2 ) to more than 300 km 2 (120 mi 2 ), drastically increasing rainy season freshwater flow into Naples Bay (Fig. 6.9; Woithe and Brandt- Williams 2006, CSF 2011. Average annual discharge from this weir-controlled canal is 7 m 3 /sec (250 cfs), with flows exhibiting high seasonal variability ranging from 0 m 3 /sec (0 cfs) in the dry season to 40 m 3 /sec (1,400 cfs) in the wet season (CSF 2011). In the dry season (November-May), salinity is relatively uniform from Gordon Pass through the Gordon River. In the wet season (June-October), freshwater flow from the Golden Gate Canal causes severe stratification of the water column, which lowers benthic dissolved oxygen, inhibits vertical mixing, and decreases water clarity (Woithe and Brandt- Williams 2006). In addition, these large wet-season freshwater influxes greatly reduce salinity in the bay. When combined with the other stressors, this results in harmful impacts to the aquatic biota, including declines in oyster populations (Simpson et al. 1979). "}, {"section_title": "Rookery Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands", "text": "Rookery Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands (Fig. 6.10    Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. Although much of the natural mangrove coastline remains intact, the watershed has been historically affected by widespread dredge-andfill operations that drained large tracts of land for development and an increasing demand for fresh water by the growing population of southwest Florida. As a result, the timing and volume of fresh water entering the estuary has been altered (Scheda and RBNERR 2015). North of the Ten Thousand Islands, canals were dug to drain the failed planned community of the Southern Golden Gate Estates. These canals connect to the Faka Union Canal (Fig. 6.10), delivering large amounts of fresh water and increasing tur-bidity in the Ten Thousand Islands (USFWS 2000). The State of Florida purchased the private lots in the undeveloped community, and the land is now the Picayune Strand State Forest. Restoration efforts to improve hydrology are under way and include refilling canals, pumping water, and removing roads (SFWMD and USDA 2003). Salinity in the Ten Thousand Islands generally stays above 34 in the shallow coastal waters as a result of limited freshwater flow in the dry season; in the wet season it fluctuates between 20 and 32 (Soderqvist and Patino 2010). The region is susceptible to impaired water quality, including low dissolved oxygen and pollution from nutrients and heavy metals (CSF 2011). Shellfish harvesting is conditionally approved for a large part of the Ten Thousand Islands in shellfish harvesting area #66 ( Fig. 6.5), although FWC records do not show any commercial harvest in Monroe or Collier counties since 1965 (FWC 2018). Like Estero Bay, the geomorphology and formation of the Ten Thousand Islands can also be attributed to topography created by oyster and vermetid gastropod reefs formed during the early to middle Holocene (Volety et al. 2009a). Mud and shell accretion on these reefs provided a substrate for the settlement of mangrove propagules (Fig.  6.11), which matured into the mangrove islands that give Figure 6.9.

With reduced sheet flow, however, oysters are now restricted to brackish river mouths, inland bays, and channels ( Fig. 6.12; Volety et al. 2009a). Mapping data are limited for much of Everglades National Park and may underestimate oyster extent. Limited oyster beds have been observed in the Taylor Creek and Shark River Slough systems, but since salinity is so dependent upon the timing and volume of upstream freshwater flows, their presence is highly variable (Penny Hall, pers. comm.). Florida Bay is a broad, shallow bay south of the Everglades (Fig. 6.12). Some oysters are found in brackish waters on prop roots of mangroves bordering Florida Bay (Goodman et al. 1999), but these mangrove-root oysters are difficult to detect via remote imagery and so have not been mapped. Florida Bay itself does not support extensive oyster reefs and experiences widely variable water quality, including warm temperatures and hypersaline conditions as a result of reduced freshwater flow and evaporation (Fourqurean and Robblee 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in southwest Florida", "text": "\u2022 Altered hydrology: Oysters located in concentrated freshwater outflows such as the Caloosahatchee River Estuary or the Faka Union Canal must cope with very low salinity (<10) during the rainy season, which result in increased mortality and decreased reproduction (La Peyre et al. 2003. High nutrients in urban runoff and freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee support algal blooms that smother oyster beds, cause hypoxia, and may release biotoxins (Volety et al. 2014). Most oysters in southwest Florida, including those near freshwater outflows, must also cope with low freshwater flow and high salinity, which increases rates of disease and predation (Volety et al. 2003, Volety  . 2008). The consequences can be seen in the Everglades, where the range of oysters has shifted inland to follow lower salinity regimes (Volety et al. 2009a). \u2022 Sedimentation: Several regions in Charlotte Harbor and Naples Bay must cope with excessive sedimentation as a result of runoff and altered hydrology. Fine sediment can interfere with filter feeding, cause decomposition-induced hypoxia, and accumulate as muck substrates that are unsuitable for oyster settlement . Frequent resuspension of sediments can occur due to boat wakes and waves intersecting with seawalls along the Caloosahatchee. \u2022 Habitat loss: Large areas of oyster reef in Charlotte Harbor, Naples, and Marco Island were destroyed as a result of shell mining, commercial fishing, and dredgeand-fill construction , Volety et al. 2014. Mangroves, and thus mangrove-root-oyster habitat, were also lost to coastal development. \u2022 Disease: Perkinsus marinus (dermo) infections have been found in 65-95% of oysters in southwest Florida (Volety et al. 2009a, Volety et al. 2014. Although infection is common, infection intensity (as gauged on the scale developed by Mackin 1962) is often relatively low as warm summer temperatures are counteracted by the low salinity of the rainy season (La Peyre et al. 2003. Areas that do not receive high freshwater flow in the summer rainy season are more vulnerable to infection (Volety et al. 2009a). \u2022 Invasive species: The Asian green mussel, Perna vir idis, was first found in Charlotte Harbor in 2000 and in Estero Bay in 2002 (FDEP 2014). These mussels have no natural predators in Florida, reach sexual maturity quickly at an age of 2-3 months, and are tolerant of a wide range of salinity, so they can outcompete native bivalves. The Charlotte Harbor Aquatic Preserves have been monitoring green mussels since 2009 (FDEP 2017). Efforts to combat these invasive mussels include targeted removal efforts and educating the public on invasive species (FDEP 2014). \u2022 Climate change and sea-level rise: Altered precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, rising sea level, and ocean acidification all pose threats to oysters , Hoegh-Gulberg and Bruno 2010, Rodriguez et al. 2014), but their effect on oyster populations  in southwest Florida is uncertain, particularly when the many other anthropogenic impacts in the region are considered. This is a complex topic that requires further investigation and substantive review. \u2022 Harvesting: Commercial harvesting in southwest Florida is not as extensive as it is in other coastal areas of the state, but Lee and Charlotte counties have experienced extensive shell mining and widely variable harvest intensity. The impact of the recent resurgence in commercial harvesting on severely reduced oyster populations needs to be assessed and managed."}, {"section_title": "CHNEP and TNC volunteer oyster habitat monitoring", "text": "The CHNEP volunteer oyster habitat monitoring program is intended to enable the collection of meaningful long-term monitoring data from oyster habitat restoration sites by citizen scientists (CHNEP 2017).

The focus has shifted toward assessing the health of a subset of oyster reefs in the bay (Stephanie Erickson, pers. comm.). Mapping and monitoring have typically been completed from October through March to take advantage of the low winter tides, but on a few occasions have been done in summer. In winter 2012-2013, 67 reefs were mapped and data were collected on reef status (natural live reef, natural live shell, natural nonliving, restored live reef, restored live shell, restored nonliving), presence of oysters, the perimeter of the intertidal oyster reef, presence of surrounding seagrass species, presence of green mussels, substrate, and water depth. Since 2013, more parameters have been added to the protocol, including presence of mangroves and tide stage. In addition, each reef is surveyed using a transect and randomly placed quadrats.

The bay includes two aquatic preserves and Biscayne Bay National Park (Fig.  7.2). The average depth of the bay is around 2 m (6.5 ft), excluding dredged channels (Comp and Seaman 1985). Biscayne Bay was historically connected to the Everglades watershed via rivers and creeks that ran through and around the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, a ridge of limestone that runs along part of Biscayne Bay's western shore. Wetlands surrounded Biscayne Bay, and surface water entered the bay as a diffuse sheet of freshwater and through nu- merous small creeks and groundwater springs (Browder et al. 2005). Northern Biscayne Bay, which is partly enclosed and separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a series of barrier islands, used to be a brackish estuary as a result of freshwater input from the Everglades. Eastern oysters, whose survival and reproductive rates are greatest between 14 and 28 salinity , were relatively abundant in northern Biscayne Bay in those moderate-salinity waters, as evidenced by remnant oyster shells in sediments and historical accounts (Smith 1896, Meeder et al. 1999, CERP 2012. Shell middens along Biscayne Bay also show evidence of oyster harvest by Native Americans , FDEP 2013. The northern part of the bay supported numerous oyster reefs and even a small oyster fishery in the late 1890s (Smith 1896. Smith (1896) described oysters as being abundant on mangrove roots, pilings, boats, and submerged logs. Dense reefs also existed in the bay and near rivers, particularly near Little River and Indian Creek. Central Biscayne Bay is broadly connected to the Atlantic Ocean. It is separated by a submerged ridge of Pleistocene-age coral reef, which is emergent at Key Biscayne, Elliott Key, and several smaller keys. Southern Biscayne Bay is partly sheltered from the Atlantic by Elliott Key and other islands in the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys. The central and southern parts of the bay historically had higher salinity than did northern Biscayne Bay, as determined by the marine mollusk species whose shells were found in sediment cores from those areas (Stone et al. 2000. Relict oyster reefs have been found at the mouths of mangrove creeks in central Biscayne Bay , but central and southern Biscayne Bay likely did not host extensive oyster reefs even before humans altered the watershed . The construction of canals, ditches, and levees in the 1800s and 1900s drastically altered the hydrology of Biscayne Bay and concentrated freshwater flow into constructed canals. This led to the loss of many of the mangrove creeks and resulted in large seasonal fluctuations in salinity due to variable freshwater input (Browder et al. 2005). The high-velocity release of fresh water does not readily mix with salt water in the bay, resulting in rapid changes in salinity that may kill estuarine organisms (Chin-Fatt and Wang 1987, CERP 2012. The Biscayne Aquifer, which contributes fresh groundwater to Biscayne Bay, is found in highly permeable limestone and sand from Miami-Dade County through Broward to southern Palm Beach County and supplies water for much of the population of south Florida (USFWS 1999b, CERP 2010). Canal construction in the early 1900s low-ered the water table, and groundwater levels continue to decline due to urban and agricultural freshwater withdrawal (FDEP 2013). The western shore of the southern half of the Biscayne Bay is largely lined with mangrove forests that are often cut through by tidal creeks. Historically, these creeks drained a small watershed, but as the area was developed, many of the creeks were disconnected by a series of water management canals and mosquito control ditches. The main waterflow is bisected by the L-31E canal, which disrupts the coastal sheet flow that once fed the creeks. The canal system still diverts most of the local watershed flow into a few canals, such that sheet flow from land into the bay has been largely eliminated by 1962 (Buchnan and Klein 1976). Near the southernmost point of the bay, the Turkey Point nuclear power plant dispenses water into an impoundment containing a large series of dredged canals, the intent of which is to cool thermal effluent. Under the present hydrological regime, salinity exceeds 30 across Biscayne Bay in the spring and ranges from 25 to 30 in the fall, although areas along the coast with many canals can have an average salinity of 12-20 (CERP 2012). Today, the extent of oyster distribution is smaller than that before the hydrology was altered. In northern Biscayne Bay, where oysters had been abundant enough to support a fishery, they are now found, only occasionally, on mangrove roots, docks, or pilings. Oyster reefs are now limited to upstream areas of the Oleta River (FDEP 2013). Oleta River State Park has a large area of urban park with mangrove-lined creeks, but few oysters. Land between Oleta River State Park and Virginia Key is mostly urbanized with hardened shorelines. Oysters are occasionally found on these seawalls and riprap, especially in those areas that receive urban runoff from storm drains (Voss 1976). Most are eastern oysters. At some creeks, flat tree oysters are also found, but they do not form reefs or accumulate substrate. In central Biscayne Bay, relict oyster reefs are present near some tidal creeks ) and a small number of live oysters may occasionally be found associated with mangrove roots. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) includes efforts to redirect freshwater flow from canals into coastal wetlands to restore hydrology to a more natural state (CERP 2012). Projects relevant to Biscayne Bay include the Biscayne Bay coastal wetlands plan, the C-111 spreader project, and L31-N seepage management (Browder et al. 2005, FDEP 2013. These projects focus on four important stressors: altered freshwater inflow, input of toxicants and pathogens, altered input of solids and nutrients, and physical changes in structures."}, {"section_title": "Monroe County: Florida Keys", "text": "The Florida Keys are a 210-km-long (130 mi) archipelago on the southern edge of Florida (Fig. 7.3). The region is encompassed by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Additional protected regions in the Sanctuary include Key West National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Great White Heron NWR, National Key Deer Refuge, and Crocodile Lake NWR, as well as several state parks and aquatic preserves. Beginning near the border of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, a series of sounds are found between the mainland and the primary tract of the Florida Keys. These sounds are all semienclosed and have low tidal amplitude and minimal exchange with other water bodies. The shoreline in these areas is mostly lined with mangroves. The lack of freshwater input and poor water circulation makes these sounds largely inhospitable to oysters. Oysters in the Everglades and Florida Bay are described in Chapter 6. Continuing south, the middle and lower Florida Keys are a mix of hardened shorelines, mangroves, and occasional sandy beaches. Sources of fresh water include small amounts of terrestrial runoff, including runoff from watering lawns. Salinity is too high to support extensive populations of the eastern oyster, but they are occasionally found on hardened shorelines or mangrove prop roots (Mikkelsen and Bieler 2000). Several species of non-reef-building oysters are present in the Florida Keys, including two other species within the family Ostreidae: the root oyster (C. rhizophorae) and the crested oyster (Ostrea stentina) (Mikkelsen and Bieler 2000). The morphology of these oysters is plastic, as they often develop around their settlement substrate. The root oyster has a straighter and more elongate hinge than does the eastern oyster, as well as an elongate muscle scar. The crested oyster has a series of fine marginal teeth, lacking in both Crassotrea species, and a lighter muscle scar (Mikkelsen and Bieler 2007). The other most common oyster in the Keys is the scaly pearl oyster (Pinctada longisquamosa), which can at times be abundant in seagrass meadows.

The threats to oysters listed here are therefore restricted to those areas (namely Biscayne Bay) that are known to have hosted significant oyster reefs in the past. \u2022 Altered hydrology: The hydrology of Biscayne Bay has been significantly altered by intense urbanization and the construction of drainage canals, which has decreased sheet flow through coastal wetlands and natural creeks. Water management canals preclude natural coastal flow and deliver large pulses of sediment-rich water through few large canals. Such canals allow rapid delivery of water that is often hypoxic and contaminated with urban runoff (SFWMD 1995). Additionally, the canals are generally steep-walled and linear, so their shorelines offer little habitat value. Restoration of minimal flows to the many mangrove-lined tidal creeks around the bay would enhance their chances of supporting small oyster communities ). \u2022 Isolated populations: The survival and resilience of any remaining oyster populations are of concern due to their isolation from other oyster populations and vulnerability to continued urban development . Biscayne Bay oysters are isolated from other oyster reefs on the southeast coast of Florida; the closest significant population of oysters is in the Lake Worth Lagoon, in Palm Beach County. \u2022 Habitat loss: The coast of Broward County and northern Biscayne Bay is heavily developed, and much of the natural shoreline has been replaced by seawalls and other structures. Oyster reefs have directly faced habitat loss as a result of dredging and hardened shorelines. \u2022 Sea-level rise: Sea-level rise is another contributor to the high salinity of Biscayne Bay. Sea-level rise will continue to suppress freshwater influence in the bay, such that brackish conditions may be completely eliminated in the bay except for waters adjacent to managed drainage canals. Sea-level rise may also result in increased submergence times, which would limit the intertidal exposure time for oysters that offers them refuge from predation, pests, and disease . Increased submergence times as a result of sea-level rise, along with increasing salinity, lead to greater susceptibility to predation, pests (e.g., the boring sponge Cliona celata; , and pathogens . \u2022 Harmful algal blooms: Harmful algal blooms have been tied to pollution from fertilizers, animal wastes, and increased soil erosion, all conditions that exist in south Florida watersheds.

The IRL covers 40% of Florida's east coast and includes seven Historically, the IRL drainage basin was much smaller than today, and its boundary followed the Atlantic Coastal Ridge. Numerous canals were constructed from 1916 to the 1950s to drain wetlands for agriculture, which greatly increased both the size of the IRL watershed and the rate at which water was delivered to the lagoon. The canals concentrate stormwater runoff, delivering large quantities of freshwater flow and associated land pollutants into the lagoon during the rainy season (FDEP 2014). Upstream agricultural and urban consumption has decreased freshwater flow in the dry season. Other constructed hydrologic alterations include multiple causeways and impoundments on many of the remaining coastal wetlands. A prominent feature of the IRL system is the dredged ICW and associated spoil islands. The ICW was conceived in the 1800s and was dredged in the early to mid-1900s. For much of the IRL, the spoil was piled into a series of islands. Some of these islands were built as ring-shaped levees, which were intended to be flooded to reduce mosquito breeding but have now created enclosed basins of poor water quality. In some cases, spoil islands may create beneficial intertidal habitat. Some of the ring-shaped levees have been opened to improve water quality within the impoundments, creating small areas of suitable habitat for oysters. The barrier islands that border the east side of the IRL system restrict tidal exchange and currents, resulting in a long water residence time and making the region susceptible to impaired water quality (FDEP 2009a(FDEP , 2009b, 2014). Along the 250-km (156-mile) extent of the IRL system there are five permanent inlets that connect with the Atlantic Ocean (Ponce, Sebastian, Fort Pierce, St. Lucie, and Jupiter inlets). The Banana River Lagoon requires two years for complete turnover (FDEP 2013). In extreme summer droughts, a combination of evaporation, low freshwater input, and limited flushing has caused salinity to reach 45 in the Banana River Lagoon (FDEP 2014). Turnover in the southern IRL is 10-15 times faster than in the northern lagoons (FDEP 2009b, FDEP 2014. The average depth of the IRL is 1.2 m (4 ft). The shallow water warms quickly in summer, decreasing oxygen solubility and facilitating development of hypoxia or anoxia (FDEP 2014). The region is also susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms, harmful algal blooms, and associated mortality of seagrass, marine mammals, and birds (FDEP 2014). Harmful algal species include those that cause brown tide (Aureoumbra lagunensis), red tide (Karenia brevis), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (Pyrodinium bahamense). Research into the ecosystem-wide relationships that lead to these algal blooms and mortality events is a key focus of scientific and management efforts in the IRL (SJRW-MD et al. 2012). Extensive oyster reefs are generally not found today within the main portion of the IRL, although the presence of shell middens along the coast of the IRL (FDEP 2014) and buried oyster shells (William Arnold, pers. comm.) indicate more extensive reefs existed in the past. The decline in oyster populations is likely a result of habitat degradation, altered salinity regimes, and decreased water quality (high salinity, low dissolved oxygen, algal blooms, etc.) (FDEP 2014). While oysters are abundant in the northern portion of Mosquito Lagoon (see Chapter 9), they are not common in the southern portion due to limited suitable substrate and salt marsh extent, minimal tidal flushing, and seasonally variable water levels. Seasonal precipitation patterns and winds can also result in changes in water levels that exceed tidal range, leading to seasonally variable water depths (FDEP 2009a, Smith 1993. Patches of oysters are occasionally present around spoil islands, and oysters can be found at the periphery of the IRL, often growing beneath or on the prop roots of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) trees (Aquino-Thomas and Proffitt 2014). The red mangroves facilitate oyster establishment by providing a substrate for growth and protection from erosion and sedimentation (Aquino-Thomas and Proffitt 2014). Oysters on mangrove roots are difficult to map and frequently do not appear on maps of oyster reefs, so IRL oyster maps likely underrepresent their true extent (Fig.  8.2). There are some oyster reefs in the central IRL located near the Northern Relief Canal near Vero Beach, and Jack Island and Wildcat Cove near Fort Pierce (lower right of Fig. 8.2). These three reefs are all found in the Indian River -Vero Beach to Fort Pierce Aquatic Preserve. The most significant oyster populations along the IRL are found within tributaries, including the Sebastian River (Fig. 8.2). Oyster populations in the Sebastian River fluctuated after construction of the Sebastian Inlet, which increased salinity, and completion of the C-54 flood-control canal, which decreased salinity . Studies conducted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) during [2005][2006][2007] showed that salinity in the Sebastian River was generally below 20 and that values below 5 were not uncommon . These FWC monitoring efforts followed an extremely active 2004 storm season, the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record. From 2005-2007, considerable freshwater inputs from rainfall and runoff substantially reduced salinity to levels below the oyster tolerance range (Paperno et al. 2006, Steward et al. 2006. When the FWC study was initiated, in early 2005, oysters in the Sebastian River were scarce and likely recovering from a large-scale dieoff in late 2004. Their recovery was further impeded by the active 2005 storm season. As a result, densities of live oysters in the Sebastian River were relatively low during that period . The oyster population in the Sebastian River recovered in 2007 after salinity increased to more suitable levels for oyster growth and survival . A commercial oyster fishery operated intermittently in the IRL during the 1800s, flourishing after the construction of the railroad and becoming well known by the 1900s . Periodic opening and closing of inlets to the IRL resulted in variable salinity, contributing to a decline in oyster extent and commercial harvest by the 1960s . Today the IRL contains nine shellfish harvesting areas with varying degrees of allowable harvest (Fig. 8.3, FDACS 2017). Oyster harvests for the region remain relatively low, particularly since the 1980s (Fig. 8.4, FWC 2018)."}, {"section_title": "St. Lucie Estuary", "text": "The St. Lucie Estuary (SLE; Fig. 8.5) was a freshwater river until the St. Lucie Inlet was created in 1892, resulting in saltwater intrusion that extends as far as 26 km (16 mi) upstream (FDEP 2009c). Construction of the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) was completed in the 1920s, draining large areas west of the river and connecting Lake Okeechobee to the south fork of the St. Lucie River (FDEP 2014). The north fork was connected to the C-23/C-24 canal system in the 1950s as part of the Central and Southern Florida Project, further increasing freshwater diversions to the SLE. Water releases from Lake Okeechobee increased freshwater inflow as well as sediment and nutrient load to the SLE and southern IRL, decreasing water clarity and resulting in the loss of seagrass and oyster habitats (Bartell et al. 2004, FDEP 2014. Key components of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aim to improve the quality, quantity, timing and distribution of fresh water delivered to the SLE. The eastern oyster was chosen as an indicator species in the CERP REstoration, COordination, and VERification (RECOVER) Monitoring and Assessment Program due to its wide distribution and importance to estuarine ecosystems (CERP 2004. The density, population structure, and condition of oysters are therefore routinely monitored in the SLE. The SLE was estimated to contain 570 ha (1,400 ac) of oyster reefs in 1940-1960URS Greiner Woodward Clyde Inc. 1998). Oyster extent had decreased to ~80 ha (200 ac) by the late 1990s (SFWMD 2002a). The goal of SLE restoration according to CERP and SFW-MD's minimum flows and levels process is to \"promote and sustain a healthy oyster population\" and increase the acreage of oyster reefs (Dixon et al. 1994, SFWMD 2002a. SFWMD (2014) outlines the oyster monitoring results for live density, recruitment rate, and dermo (Perk insus marinus) infection prevalence and intensity for the SLE by subbasin. Salinity effects on different size classes are a key factor impacting oyster populations in the SLE, but other factors that are related to salinity (such as predation and parasitism) or sometimes correlated with it (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll a, temperature) likely help determine population dynamics (Salewski and Proffitt 2016). Perhaps most important is the interaction of temperature and salinity. The most stressful time of year for an oyster in Florida is during the summer months when temperatures are high, often near their upper physiological tolerance limits. Water temperatures have exceeded 32\u00b0C for four months or more, and oysters can experience even higher temperatures if they are exposed during afternoon low tides. When oysters are subjected to environ-mental conditions that meet or exceed their tolerance limits, their energetic capacity to deal with additional stresses, such as salinity extremes, are diminished or lost . Winter is an essential time for oysters in southeast Florida to allocate energetic reserves for growth and reproduction. Conditions are the least stressful when temperatures are lower, salinity is moderate, dissolved oxygen concentrations are greater, and predation and disease are less prevalent . Stressful events in the winter season may require oysters to allocate energy toward survival and reduce energy input toward gametogenesis , but these effects are less adverse than those incurred during the warm summer months. The population and health of oysters in the SLE fluctuate dramatically due to variable freshwater inflows related to storm events and managed freshwater releases associated with Lake Okeechobee and the surrounding canals. The timing, magnitude, and duration of a freshwater release govern the severity of the impact on the local oyster population as well as the recovery time following the release. In 2004 and 2005, excess rainfall from hurricanes and large freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee resulted in low salinity and widespread oyster mortality within the SLE , Parker  and . Estuarine salinity remained below oyster tolerance levels through December 2005, so larvae from downstream locations could not settle and repopulate the SLE reefs, and recovery was delayed until late 2006. SLE oyster populations were again damaged when Tropical Storm Fay hit in August 2008. Though the event was of relatively short duration, the rainfall and freshwater inflows associated with it caused another oyster die-off. Salinity rapidly increased to tolerable levels immediately following the storm, allowing for settlement of larval recruits in late fall before the end of the 2008 spawning season. Those recruits successfully overwintered, allowing for a more rapid recovery in 2009 . The reprieve for oysters in the SLE was short-lived as salinity decreased again in 2010 due to a prolonged freshwater release that lasted from March through October. Although oyster mortality was not estuary-wide, upstream oysters were disappearing or exhibiting poor health during the warm summer months. In addition, the freshwater release coincided with the months of peak oyster reproductive development and spawning, and though oysters developed and spawned as expected, recruitment rates were significantly lower, suggesting that larvae were either killed by the low salinity or flushed out of the estuary by high water flow . Near-drought conditions in early 2012 kept SLE salinity levels relatively high and near optimal levels for oysters . Later in 2012, rainfall from Hurricane Isaac caused less damage to the SLE oyster reefs than storm-associated rains in 2005 or 2008, possibly due to management decisions to delay freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee for a few weeks after the storm . SLE salinity recovered quickly in late 2012. For the first several months of 2013, drought conditions kept salinity so high it often exceeded the oyster tolerance range. High rainfall in the early wet season of 2013 led to high water levels in Lake Okeechobee, and subsequent freshwater discharges caused salinity to decrease rapidly to suboptimal levels. This event caused another widespread oyster die-off in the SLE and led to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria and a cyanobacterial bloom, both of which prompted the Martin County Department of Health to issue a health advisory regarding poor water quality. Density surveys conducted in December 2013 found only a few live oysters, all of which were spat that had settled in the past few weeks, and no live adults. Excess freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee during the 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o resulted in low salinity in the SLE from February through October 2016, causing a loss of oysters upstream (Parker and Radigan 2017). The oyster population response was similar to the response to the 2010 event, in that recruitment rates were poor even though spawning did occur. Freshwater discharges following Hurricane Irma in September 2017 had an even greater impact on oyster populations in the SLE, as they continued into late December, hindering the fall spawning and recruitment season."}, {"section_title": "Loxahatchee River", "text": "The Loxahatchee River crosses through both Martin and Palm Beach counties, draining a watershed of 700 km 2 (270 mi 2 ) before it reaches the Atlantic Ocean at the Jupiter Inlet (Fig. 8.7; SFWMD 2006, Howard and Arrington 2008). The tidal floodplains and estuary with its seagrasses, mangroves, and oyster beds are valuable ecological resources within the watershed, which also includes extensive urban development. Historically, the Jupiter Inlet opened or closed as a result of storm events and river flow. After the construction of the ICW and the Lake Worth Inlet, the Jupiter Inlet frequently remained closed until the 1940s, after which the Inlet was kept open through dredging operations and the construction of jetties and sand traps (SFWMD 2006). The Loxahatchee River watershed has been permanently altered by the stabilization of Jupiter Inlet, which heightens tidal amplitude and saltwater intrusion. Freshwater flow has also been altered by the construction and operation of drainage canal systems. Oysters were intermittently present along Jupiter Inlet and Hobe Sound, their abundance influenced by the opening and closing of the inlet . Oyster populations declined by the 1990s; today a moderate population is found in the central embayment and northwest fork of the Loxahatchee River and a smaller assemblage in the southwest fork ( Fig. 8.7; Gambordella et al. 2007, Howard andArrington 2008). While some oysters have been documented on the north fork of the river (Law Environmental 1991), this area has not been mapped. In an average year, salinity ranges between 15 and 20 within the northwestern fork of the Loxahatchee River, within the optimal range for oyster survival. Salinity in the southwestern Loxahatchee River is consistently higher, closer to 30 (Parker and Geiger 2010). Both branches of the river support moderate to high densities of oysters, with the northwestern fork generally containing more suitable substrate for oysters and higher densities on reefs and associated with mangroves ( Fig. 8.8), particularly 6.5-11 km (4-7 mi) upstream , SFWMD 2002b. The Loxahatchee River has been affected by salinity fluctuations associated with storms and water management practices, but a large-scale oyster die-off has not been documented . Densities of live oysters were lower in 2005 than in subsequent years, reflecting the impact of the active 2004/2005 storm seasons, but oyster populations rapidly recovered under the higher salinity in 2006. In 2016, salinity decreased in the Loxahatchee River as a result of increased freshwater flow associated with El Ni\u00f1o precipitation. Oysters upstream in the northwestern Loxahatchee River experienced a die-off, but higher salinity in the rest of the river supported a thriving population (Parker and Radigan 2017). Although the effects of low-salinity events are often more acute, long-term exposure to high salinity can also be harmful. In the Loxahatchee River, salinity often exceeds the optimal range, and during such periods disease and predation rates increase substantially. Oysters that are physiologically acclimated to high salinity may be less able to cope with additional stresses, such as a rapid decrease in salinity. It follows that an oyster adapted to high salinity that has been weakened by a parasitic infection, e.g., dermo, would be even less likely to be able to withstand extreme changes and would more rapidly die when salinity decreases abruptly. As a consequence, oyster densities in the Loxahatchee River are likely moderated by the higher disease and predation rates."}, {"section_title": "Lake Worth Lagoon", "text": "The Lake Worth Lagoon (LWL) is a long, narrow lagoon that extends 35 km (22 mi) along coast of Palm Beach County (Fig. 8.9). The LWL began as Lake Worth, a freshwater lake that received sheet flows of surface water from the Everglades. The lake became a saline lagoon following construction of artificial inlets to the Atlantic Ocean in the early 1900s (CERP 2005). More than 81% of the lagoon's present shoreline is surrounded by urban development (PBC DERM 2008); mangroves occupy some islands and patchy regions of the shoreline. The LWL receives freshwater input from the Earman River, West Palm Beach Canal, and Boynton Canal (C-17, C-51, and C-16 canals, respectively) (SFWMD 2013). Oysters were not present in Lake Worth while it was a freshwater lake, but they occurred intermittently after the artificial inlets created the brackish lagoon . The LWL supported an oyster fishery in the early 1900s, but it had declined by the 1950s (Linehan 1980. Oysters are not harvested in the LWL at present, nor does the region include any other shellfish-harvesting areas (FDACS 2017). Oysters can still be found on mangroves, jetties, edges of spoil islands, limestone rock revetments, and other hard substrates surrounding mangrove and salt marsh restoration projects, especially in the central LWL ( Fig. 8.10; , LWLI 2013. Salinity in the LWL is generally in the range optimal for oysters only during the summer rainy season and is greater than 30 during the rest of the year (Parker and Geiger 2010). The LWL seldom experiences low-salinity events. The LWL and Loxahatchee River have higher salinity than the SLE and IRL, resulting in increased densities of predators . Survivorship studies of tagged oysters left in cages in the LWL and Loxahatchee River showed poor survivorship, particularly in open cages in areas in which the oysters were exposed to predators . Dermo has been found to be relatively common in both the Loxahatchee River and the LWL, although intensity levels are low (below 2 on the scale of 0 to 5 developed by )."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in central and southeast Florida", "text": "\u2022 Altered hydrology: The hydrology of southeast Florida has been significantly altered by construction of drainage canals, both increasing the size of the watershed and altering the rate of surface water delivery. This has resulted in even more freshwater flow during the wet season and less during the dry season. While dredging and stabilization of inlets have increased the amount of salt water entering local estuaries, salinity is highly variable as a result of large freshwater pulses. Stormwater releases from Lake Okeechobee can reduce salinity below tolerable levels for oysters in the SLE, resulting in periodic die-offs , Parker and Radigan 2017. Sedimentation and muck accumulation brought by the extensive freshwater flow also pose a threat to affected reefs (Bartell et al. 2004). Dredging of the ICW and the creation and expansion of spoil islands further complicates natural water circulation in the basins. \u2022 Isolated populations: The recovery of reefs after freshwater-induced mortality depends on the hydrologic transport of larval recruits from other reefs. The sur- \u2022 vival and resilience of local populations is of concern due to their isolation within rivers along the coast and vulnerability to continued urban development ). \u2022 Habitat loss: The coastline of southeast Florida is heavily developed, and much of the natural shoreline has been replaced by seawalls and other hardened shorelines. Oyster reefs have directly faced habitat loss as a result of dredging and hardened shorelines, and remaining reefs must cope with the indirect impacts of a large human population including altered hydrology, nutrient loading, and associated phytoplankton blooms. \u2022 Sea-level rise: Intertidal exposure offers oysters a temporary refuge from predation, pests, and disease . Increased submergence times and higher salinity (due to both sea-level rise and reduced freshwater flow) lead to increased susceptibility to marine predators, pests (e.g., the boring sponge Cliona celata; , and pathogens . Sea-level rise will result in longer submergence times for intertidal habitats, decreasing the intertidal exposure time that is often the only respite from predation (optimal exposure frequency for eastern oysters is around 20-40% according to ). This will encourage oyster settlement that results in vertical accretion on reefs or upslope migration onto shorelines with appropriate elevation. Natural tidalphenomena, combined with sea-level rise, also impact oyster reef exposure time. The highest spring tides (\"king tides\") typically occur during the fall in south Florida and cause extended periods of high and low water. An additional effect of sea-level rise is that increased salt water intrusion into an estuary will push the zone of optimal salinity further upstream. In estuaries that narrow in geographic area upstream, this may decrease the size of the area of optimal salinity for oyster growth. \u2022 Boating impacts: Boating channels and the ICW extend through the lagoons and rivers of southeast Flor- ida, and prop wash can erode the margins of oyster reefs. Boat wakes in the Mosquito Lagoon ICW have eroded salt marshes and oyster reefs to the extent that some have been reduced to intertidal sand flats ). Campbell (2015) documented that boaters can lessen their impact on oyster reefs if they reduce wake by being on plane or boating at a slow speed. \u2022 Invasive species: Invasive estuarine invertebrates along the east coast of Florida include the Asian green mussel (Perna viridis), charru mussel (Mytella charruana), and pink barnacle (Megabalanus coccopoma). The Asian green mussel has been found as far south as Cocoa on the IRL, and the pink barnacle has been found intermittently along the east coast of Florida ). Charru mussels are native to Central and South America and were first noticed on the east coast of Florida in 1986, in Jacksonville (Galimany et al. 2017. These nonnative species are invasive, competing with native oysters for habitat and food . Population-genetic research suggests the Asian green mussel and pink barnacle were transported in ballast water or on ships' hulls (Spinuzzi  . The parasitic rhizarian Bonamia sp. was first reported in Florida in 2007(Dungan et al. 2012 and has been documented in the LWL and southern IRL (Laramore et al. 2017).

The abundance and diversity of other reef fauna also reached levels approaching those natural reefs, although after 14 months there were still significant differences in species composition between the constructed reefs and natural reefs (Jud and Layman 2011).

A series of bio-boxes (50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10 cm) were also deployed for several months and retrieved to quantify abundance and diversity of species that inhabited the boxes. At three of the six sites, additional studies were conducted to examine predation, recruitment, and community development. MarineGEO and the University of Florida formed the Florida Census of Marine Life, a working group focused on collecting and identifying marine species around Florida with a strong focus on marine invertebrates within the IRL. The goal of the working group is to create a baseline of biodiversity and a species inventory for future research and to facilitate monitoring of nonnative species. Marine invertebrates are collected, identified, photographed, DNA barcoded, and physical specimens are catalogued in the university's Florida Natural History Museum."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 9 Northeast Florida", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nassau and Duval counties", "text": "The northernmost coastal counties, Nassau and Duval, have extensive oyster reefs in tidal tributaries and the St. Marys, Amelia, Nassau, Fort George, and St. Johns rivers (Fig. 9.2). These oyster reefs line shallow mud flats, tidal creeks, and fringe salt marshes dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Large portions of the sovereign submerged lands are designated as outstanding Florida waters, aquatic preserves, or are located within the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve. Spring tidal range is 1.9 m (6.4 ft) in the St. Marys River on the Georgia border and 1.4 m (4.5 ft) at the St. Johns River mouth (NOAA 2017). Waters in the lower 40 km (25 mi) of the St. Johns River are considered mesohaline, with a mean salinity of 14.5 (LSJRBR 2016). Mean salinity in the St. Johns River increases from around 3 near Jacksonville to 26 at the river's mouth; salinity in the Nassau River increases from around 7 near I-95 to 27 near Nassauville ( Fig. 9.2; USNPS 1996). Average salinity in the St. Johns River increased from 1996 to 2007 as a result of sea-level rise and reduced freshwater input (LSJRBR 2016). Alligator Creek, located south of the Amelia River, and parts of the Nassau River and Sound are classified as Class II waters (i.e., they are designated for fish consumption, recreation, and maintenance of fish and wildlife), but harvest has been prohibited since the mid-1980s. Shellfish harvesting area #96 includes the Fort George River and Nassau Sound (Fig. 9.2), but harvesting is prohibited there as well. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) has designated the Fort George River and the beaches at the south end of Amelia Island in Nassau Sound as 303(d) impaired water bodies because of bacteria in shellfish. South of the St. Johns River, Hopkins Creek, which flows from the barrier island into the intracoastal waterway (ICW), has designated total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform bacteria, and nutrients (Chl a) Rhew 2010, SJRWMD andFrazel 2016b)."}, {"section_title": "St. Johns and Flagler counties", "text": "The St. Johns River is connected to the Tolomato River via the ICW. Oysters exist in tidal creeks along this connection, but seawalls limit intertidal oyster extent around Palm Valley (Fig. 9.3). South of Palm Valley, the Tolomato River continues into the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) and Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve. The GTMNERR includes approximately 30,350 ha (75,000 ac) of relatively undeveloped coastal and estuarine habitat. The reserve is separated into northern and southern components, with the city of St. Augustine at the center, and is named after the Guana, Tolomato, and Matanzas rivers (Fig. 9.3). Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve, located in the southern component of GTMNERR, is the largest tributary of the Matanzas River. The GTM estuary includes vast salt marshes dominated by smooth cordgrass, black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus), and other high-marsh species. Mangroves are expanding rapidly in the southern reaches of the Matanzas River. Salinity varies from near-freshwater conditions in tributaries to near-oceanic salinity (28-35) at the inlets to the Atlantic Ocean . Tidal range averages 1.5 m in the ICW (GTMNERR data). Intertidal oyster reefs are extensive in the low-energy lagoons and tidal creeks (Fig. 9.4). Two conditionally approved areas for shellfish harvesting (St. Johns North, Area #92, and St. Johns South, Area #88; Fig. 9.5) and four shellfish leases held in perpetuity are located in the GTM estuary (FDACS 2017). Two of those leases are in conditionally restricted waters (Guana River), one is in conditionally approved waters (Matanzas River), and one is in the Summer Haven River, which filled with sand after a barrier island breach in 2008. Oyster harvesting is restricted in several Class II water bodies (those designated for shellfish propagation and harvesting) due to concerns about pollution. Modern oyster landings in northeast Florida peaked in 1990, at 87 metric tons (190,000 lb) ( Fig. 9.6). Commercial oyster landings declined after 1990 but had begun to increase again by the mid-1990s. Despite declines in some years, the general increase in landings has apparently been driven by increased harvest effort, as overall catch per unit effort (CPUE; pounds harvested per trip) has declined slightly since 1986 (Fig. 9.6b). Landings before 1986 were reported voluntarily, so CPUE is not shown in Figure 9.6b before 1986. Recreational oyster harvesting continues in the region but remains unquantified and difficult to estimate.  A number of water bodies in the GTM estuary are listed as impaired due to bacteria and the Matanzas River south of Matanzas Inlet is impaired due to high nutrients (Chl a) (Frazel 2009, SJRWMD andFrazel 2016b (Figs. 9.3 and  9.7). Much of the ICW from Palm Coast to the Tomoka River has a developed shoreline. Several segments along the ICW are impaired due to low dissolved oxygen, high nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria (SJRWMD and Fra- Use of living shorelines to restore patch and fringing oyster reefs has become more common in northeast Florida. Along the reach of Tolomato River within the GTMNERR, issues with shoreline erosion prompted the creation of ~260 linear meters (850 ft) of oyster reefs at Wright's Landing in 2012-2014. A new hybrid design consisting of breakwaters and oyster gabions was deployed at six new sites along the Tolomato River in 2017."}, {"section_title": "Volusia County", "text": "The Halifax River and Tomoka Basin form a narrow lagoon that connects to the Atlantic Ocean at Ponce de Leon Inlet (Fig. 9.7). The Halifax River has an average depth of 1.5 m (5 ft), and spring tidal range at Ponce de Leon Inlet is 1.0 m (3.2 ft) (NOAA 2017). Water levels are strongly influenced by wind speed and direction (FDEP 2017). Intertidal reefs are not found in great densities in the Tomoka Marsh Aquatic Preserve and Bulow Creek, but some sparse clusters of oysters are present along the shoreline. The waters of Bulow Creek have an average salinity of 11, but throughout the creek and Tomoka Marsh Aquatic Preserve salinity is dependent on rainfall, wind-driven tides, and storm surge (FDEP 2017). The small tidal amplitude around the Tomoka Basin (0.2 m; 0.75 ft) is not known to support intertidal reefs, although historical records indicate they have been present (SJRWMD and Frazel 2016b). Smith Creek and the waterway adjacent to High Bridge Road do support intertidal reefs. A large percentage of the shoreline on the Halifax River north of Port Orange is hardened and does not support shallow gradations of intertidal habitat (unpublished SJRWMD 2016 shoreline survey). Intertidal reefs become more abundant in the lower Halifax River near Port Orange (Fig. 9.7). Tomoka River and Spruce Creek are the only substantial freshwater inflows in the Halifax River. Mosquito Lagoon is a shallow lagoon with an average depth of 1.2 m (4 ft) that receives freshwater input predominantly through runoff, with small contributions from groundwater seepage, precipitation, small tributaries, and canals (FDEP 2009). Because it is enclosed by barrier islands and connects to the Atlantic Ocean only by the Ponce de Leon Inlet and to the Indian River Lagoon by the Haulover Canal, the lagoon is characterized by weak currents, a small tidal range (0.15 m/0.5 ft), and minimal flushing (Steward et al. 2010). Wind movement of water on time scales of weeks or months can exceed the normal diurnal tidal range, leading to irregular surface water levels (Smith 1993). Due to its restricted nature and small tidal prism, Mosquito Lagoon has a long water residence time and so is susceptible to poor water quality due to accumulation of pollutants (FDEP 2009). Salinity is generally between 25 and 36, although it can become hypersaline during times of high evaporation and low freshwater flow (Grizzle 1990. The northern portion of Mosquito Lagoon is managed under the Mosquito Lagoon Aquatic Preserve, while Canaveral National Seashore and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge manage the remainder of the lagoon. Analysis of aerial imagery from 2010 revealed 2,542 oyster reefs in Mosquito Lagoon, 624 of which were within the boundaries of Canaveral National Seashore (Garvis et al. 2015). Of these totals, 8.9% of Mosquito Lagoon reefs were classified as dead, with a 24% loss of acreage when compared to 1943 aerial images. For Canaveral National Seashore, 17.5% of the reefs were classified as dead, with a 40% loss of acreage (Garvis et al. 2015). Many of the dead reefs in Mosquito Lagoon were associated with frequent boat wakes, which had dislodged oyster clusters from the sediment. South of Oak Hill/Eldora Hill, oyster abundance is minimal. This is potentially due to the lack of tidal range to support intertidal oysters as well as water levels that vary seasonally as a result of precipitation and wind patterns. Canaveral National Seashore contains large shell mounds from pre-Columbian indigenous populations, including Turtle Mound, the largest shell midden on the east coast of Florida (FDEP 2009). These mounds and other Timucuan artifacts indicate a long history of oyster harvest by indigenous people in the area; archeological evidence indicates that the area was inhabited for more than 10,000 years before European settlers arrived. Many of these shell mounds were removed when they were mined for shell for use in roads and railroads or as fill (FDEP 2009). A large portion of the Mosquito Lagoon is classified as a Class II water body (see Area #82 in Fig. 9.5), and oysters and clams are commonly harvested commercially and recreationally. Also, some active oyster leases in the southern portion of the lagoon were established be-   fore the creation of national park (FDEP 2009). FDACS monitors water quality for concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria and toxic algae, including species that cause brown tide (Aureoumbra lagunensis), red tide (Karenia brevis), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (Pyrodinium bahamense). The lagoon has sometimes been closed to shellfish harvests due to high concentrations of toxins or algal cells (FDEP 2009). The CPUE of oysters declined from 2000 to 2011 in the Mosquito Lagoon; this decline coincides with an increase in occurrence of the predatory crown conch (Mel ongena corona) associated with increased salinity and reduced freshwater input . Crown conch larvae have higher survivorship in high salinity (Hathaway andWoodburn 1961, Garland and. Craig et al. (2016), however, found that crown conchs have a low density in this location, with an average of only 1 conch per 100 m 2 (1,074 ft 2 ). Thus, the decline in CPUE may also be related to other factors such as poor water quality, disease, and erosion due to boat wakes. Oyster reef restoration has been carried out continuously in Mosquito Lagoon since 2007, and shell substrate has been prepared and deployed for the growth of an estimated 11 million oysters (Walters, unpublished data). Dead reefs have been transformed into living reefs by reducing the height of large piles of disarticulated shell above the high tide line and placing stabilized shell on the leveled area closer to or below the high tide line. The University of Central Florida (UCF) and its partners restored 83 reefs in Mosquito Lagoon with a footprint of approximately 1.2 ha (3 ac) and stabilized 1,865 m (6,120 ft) of shoreline between 2011 and 2017 in Canaveral National Seashore. Restored reefs have endured five hurricanes and three brown tides (e.g. . Restored reefs with more than 1,000 living oysters per m 2 (83 per ft 2 ) were present after nine years (Walters 2016). Significant recruitment of oysters along stabilized shorelines has also been documented . The wave energy hitting these shorelines is reduced by 69% when 1-year-old restored oysters and smooth cordgrass are present (Manis et al. 2015). Within one year of establishment, these restored oyster reefs achieve biogeochemical cycling similar to that of natural reefs (Chambers et al. 2018). Larval recruitment to restored reefs accumulates as much genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and allelic richness in microsatellite loci) as to natural reefs as little as one month after shells are deployed. Likewise, harvesting did not impact genetic diversity of oyster reefs in Mosquito Lagoon (Arnaldi et al. 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Threats to oysters in northeast Florida", "text": "Climate change and sea-level rise: Sea-level rise and variable precipitation patterns may increase (or already be increasing) predation, disease, and harmful algal blooms in this region ). An emerging threat to the increasingly submerged reefs in Mosquito Lagoon is boring sponge (Cliona spp.) infestations that result in weakening and loss of shell (Walters and Fang, unpublished data). Areas of oyster reefs with moderate exposure and submergence times grow fastest, while areas that are entirely submerged have lower rates of growth and accretion because of exposure to disease, predation, and sedimentation . Thus, increased submergence as a result of sea-level rise may put these intertidal reefs at risk. Boating impacts: Oyster reefs are susceptible to wave exposure and boat wakes, which can result in erosion or accumulation of dead shell above the high tide line in piles known locally as shell rakes. Boat wakes in the ICW of northeast Florida have eroded salt marshes and oyster reefs to the point that they are reduced to intertidal sand flats , Price 2005). An analysis of aerial photos from 65 km (40 mi) of channel in the southern GTMNERR revealed that 70 ha (170 ac) of shoreline habitat eroded from 1970 to 2002 (Price 2005). Reefs in Mosquito Lagoon also underwent erosion as a result of boat wakes (Garvis et al. 2015). The width of dead margins increased from 1940 until 2000, when they made up 9% of the aerial extent of oyster reefs in Mosquito Lagoon . Some reefs migrated as much as 50 m (165 ft) away from the ICW as a result of the erosion . While wave exposure and shifting inlets can also alter locations of erosion, exposure to boat wakes and rising sea level are of greatest concern .  documented that boaters do the most damage on oyster reefs when traveling at intermediate speeds with maximal wakes. Habitat loss: Oysters are directly susceptible to habitat loss as a result of coastal development, shoreline hardening, and dredge-and-fill operations. In an SJRW-MD study, more than half of the 2,000 locations surveyed in developed areas of northeast Florida were on a hardened shoreline edge, particularly in residential areas (Ron Brockmeyer, pers. comm.). Thirty percent of these areas lacked a natural intertidal zone. Hardened shorelines not only interrupt the transition area from upland to benthic habitat, but reflected wave energy can also undermine potential adjacent oyster habitat. Coastal development also indirectly impacts oysters through reduced water quality, increased pollutants, and increased sedimentation . Harvesting: Harvesting removes individuals from the population, removes available substrate for larval settlement, changes population size structure, and can widen the reef and reduce its height (Abbe 1988, Woods et al. 2005. Greater reef height reduces the effects of hypoxia and enhances current flow over oysters, both of which increase growth and survivorship rates (Rothschild et al. 1994, Lenihan and. Loss of substrate due to overharvesting may further hinder the ability of reefs to keep up with sea-level rise . Diseases: In one study, the protozoan disease dermo (Perkinsus marinus) was common throughout the GTMNERR, but intensities were relatively low (0.75-1.16 on the scale of 0 to 5 developed by   (Brandimarte et al. 2017). There is no evidence of elevated intensities or population-scale impacts due to either der-mo or MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) in northeast Florida , Apeti et al. 2014. But because multiple stressors often interact and make oysters more susceptible to disease (Lenihan et al. 1999), monitoring of diseases and oyster condition should continue. In particular, warmer winters may allow disease to flourish year-round. The possible impacts of those conditions are poorly understood. Invasive species: The Asian green mussel (Perna vir idis), charru mussel (Mytella charruana), and pink barnacle (Megabalanus cocopoma) are invasive species found in northeast Florida, where they compete with native oysters for habitat and food (Gilg et al. 2010). Charru mussels were first noticed on the east coast of Florida in Jacksonville in 1986; localized, long-term populations have been observed in several locations on the east coast (Boudreaux et al. 2006, FDEP 2009. Population genetics research suggests that all three species were transported via ballast water or ships' hulls (Gillis et al. 2009,  , Calazans et al. 2017. The Asian green mussel has been found in greater numbers, particularly near Jacksonville (FDEP 2009)."}, {"section_title": "GTMNERR oyster monitoring", "text": "Pilot monitoring of intertidal oyster reefs within the GTMNERR and surrounding waters was initiated in 2014 ( Fig. 9.8). The main objectives were to evaluate the status of oyster populations in the area; provide abundance and size estimates that would inform the quantification of ecosystem services provided by oysters; obtain baseline estimates of reef, population, and community structure metrics for future assessments; and evaluate methods for long-term monitoring. Oyster reefs were sampled in the winter (January-March) and summer (July-September) during 2014-2016 (summer only in 2014). A stratified-random design was used to sample 210 reefs in seven regions (Fig. 9.9). In addition to reef sampling, larval settlement patterns were monitored following Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) protocols . Samples were collected using a spat tree, i.e., a T-shaped PVC device with cleaned oyster shell suspended on a wire from each end of the crossbar; rates of larval settlement were determined by counting the number of oyster spat on the bottom/inside of each interior shell (Fig. 9.10). An average of 1,621 oysters per m 2 (150 oysters per ft 2 ) were observed. The proportion of spat-sized oysters (< 25 mm/1 in shell height) was higher in summer than winter, but there was no evidence of a seasonal difference for fishery-size oysters (\u2265 76 mm/3 in shell height). Size-frequency distributions, an indicator of the age structure of a population , were mostly skewed right with more abundant smaller individuals or size classes (Fig.  9.11). The decreasing abundance of larger individuals indicates higher mortality when they reach a subadult size; this pattern is common for intertidal oysters in the southeastern United States , Coen and Luckenbach 2000, Volety and Savarese 2001. Understanding implications for the oyster fishery and long-term population sustainability will require estimation of growth and mortality rates and population modeling (Dame 2011). Primary mass settlement of new recruits (spat) occurred in the late spring-early summer in all regions during 2015-2016 ( Fig. 9.12). Smaller settlement events occurred in each region throughout the summer and fall. Reef height and slope measurements did not differ by season. Reefs were tallest and steepest in the northern regions and flattest in the most southern regions, similar to findings by Shirley et al. (2016). Reefs were also relatively flat in the Salt Run region, an easily accessible but relatively small oyster harvest area, resulting in relatively high harvest pressure. Local harvesting practice is to cull the reefs by hand, knocking off the small oysters and taking only fishery-size oysters. Salt Run reefs also had few clusters and lower oyster density but had one of the highest proportions of fishery-size oysters. The harvest activities that keep the reef profiles, clusters, and numbers low may also contribute to faster growth rates of oysters in this region. Regional means in percent living cover were relatively similar (24-29%). Living oyster and shell cover were higher in winter; sediment cover was higher in the summer. Living oyster cover was positively correlated with densities of oysters, indicating that cover could be used to estimate oyster density (and relative quantities of the ecosystem services they provide). The ease and relative quickness of measuring percent cover would facilitate increased sample sizes and spatial coverage in a nondestructive manner. Oyster density was correlated with densities of all associated fauna. The strongest relationship was with mussels (R 2 = 0.69). Associated fauna observed on oyster reefs throughout this study include annelids (Polydora spp.), quahog/hard clams (Mercenaria campechiensis), oyster drills (Urosalpinx cinera), white/striped barnacles (Bala nus amphitrite), ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa), mahogany date mussels (Lithophaga bisculata), crown conch, boring sponges, slipper snails (Crepidula spp.), porcelain crabs (Petrolisthes armatus), stone crabs (Menippe merce naria), swimming crabs (Callinectes spp.), other xanthid crabs (Family Panopeidae), and hermit crabs. Predatory crown conchs were found on reefs only in the Pellicer region, consistent with a study by  in the region. Mean crown conch density Figure 9.9. Map of oyster monitoring regions and conditionally approved shellfish harvest areas in the GTMNERR and surrounding waters. was higher in this study (3.8 per m 2 vs. the 1.5 per m 2 found in Garland and Kimbro), but it is difficult to assess whether the difference is significant. The Pellicer region surrounds the mouth of a freshwater tributary (Pellicer Creek), and oyster growth rates tend to be lower in low salinity (Volety and Savarese 2001. Thus, the lack of large oysters in this region may also be a long-term consequence of freshwater discharge and associated factors."}, {"section_title": "Lower St. Johns River Basin Report", "text": "The University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Valdosta [Georgia] State University complete an annual analysis of the health of the Lower St. Johns River Basin. Salinity has gradually increased in the St. Johns River Basin since the mid-1990s as a result of sea-level rise and decreased freshwater flow (LSJRBR 2016). Nutrient levels and chlorophyll-a levels remain high, but total nitrogen levels declined 31% from 1997 to 2015. Dilution of estuarine waters by low-nutrient ocean water and reduced freshwater flow may be contributing to the decrease in nutrients (LSJRBR 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Northeast Florida oyster reef condition assessment", "text": "The SJRWMD, GTMNERR, UCF, and the Northeast Aquatic Preserves collaborated to develop an intertidal Oyster Condition Assessment (OCA) protocol built on their earlier research efforts but standardized for regional application across geographic areas .
