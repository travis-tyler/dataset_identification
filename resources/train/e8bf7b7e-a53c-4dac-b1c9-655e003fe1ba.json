[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global pandemic as it has affected the entire population (Pang et al., 2020) . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a close similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 Lai et al., 2020) . World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic because more than 70,000 people died and about 2.5 million infected (Chang et al., 2020) . After H1N1 (2009 H1N1 ( ), Polio (2014 , Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and again Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019); WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of global distress (Lai et al., 2020) . The current situation is rapidly advancing; thus, the ultimate extent and severity of this pandemic remain to be critical. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is about 3.8% which has been reported as the lowest than other SARS-CoV (10%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (37.1%). However, its infection rate is more than 10 times higher than these CoVs (Ahn et al., 2020) . The most characteristic symptom of COVID-19 patients is a high level of respiratory distress, which needs immediate intensive care facility (Lai et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020) . So far, there has been no effective and accurate treatment to cure COVID-19 . Hence, there is an urgent need to make significant efforts to develop therapeutic interventions and diagnostic methods to control coronavirus infections .\nCoVs belong to the family of Coronaviridae containing a single-strand of positive-sense RNA viruses. These viruses can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The current SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus and is commonly known to infect humans (Menachery et al., 2015; Ahmed et al., 2020) . The genome length of this virus is about 27-32 kb encoding both structural and non-structural proteins (Zhang & Holmes, 2020) . Among the structural proteins, membrane, envelope, nucleocapsid, and spike proteins contribute significantly to virus transmission and its replication in the host cells (Naqvi et al., 2020; Shanmugaraj et al., 2020) . PLpro and 3CLpro proteases are vital in virus replication and hence considered a promising drug target. Structural and mechanistic information will help to design potent and selective inhibitors of 3CLpro and PLpro that will eventually be implicated to address COVID-19 as these proteases are indispensable for virus assembly and replication .\nThe unexpected emergence of COVID-19, have underscored the urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic measures for the development of antiviral therapy (Kumari et al., 2020) . To address the critical health challenge of COVID-19, many therapeutic targets for the development of vaccines and drugs are under the explorative stage Wrapp et al., 2020) . COVID-19 is difficult to control because of heterogeneous member's periodical cycle and significant overlap with human and wild animal ecologies. Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral therapies available for SARS-CoV-2. Several attempts have been made using approved antivirals drugs (ribavirin and lopinavir-ritonavir) and immunomodulators (corticosteroids, interferons, etc.) (Grein et al. 2020; Li et al., 2020; Morse et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . However, these approaches are not much effective in the case of COVID-19 because of significant differences in the surface, structural, and enzymatic proteins of SARS-COV-2 in comparison to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Grein et al. 2020; Kumari et al., 2020) . Design and development of SARS-COV-2-specific direct-acting antiviral drugs could be potentially obtained by targeting conserved enzymes such as 3 C-like protease, papain-like protease, non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Zumla et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2020) .\nThe main protease (M pro )is a key enzyme that plays a critical role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle as this enzyme influence the process of viral replication and transcription (Jin et al.; Naqvi et al., 2020) , making it an attractive target for antiviral drugs discovery (Ahn et al., 2020) . Here, we have used SARS-CoV-2 M pro as a target enzyme to facilitate the rapid search of antiviral compounds with clinical potential in the therapeutics of COVID-19. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro has been determined which is highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV M pro , with a 96% sequence identity with the RMS deviation of 0.53 \u00c5 ). Although, a minor variation in the sequence and structure of M pro from both the viruses, a significant difference was noticed in the binding pattern and inhibition of M pro by inhibitors designed for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, approved protease inhibitors such as disulfiram, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been reported to be active against SARS and MERS CoVs, but are ineffective in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (Kandeel & Al-Nazawi, 2020) .\nThe bound inhibitor showed the formation of several interactions with the binding pocket residues. The N atom of lactam moiety, N atom of amide functional group of the neighboring His164, and O atom of benzyloxy group formed hydrogen bonds with His163, His164, and Gly143, respectively. The alkyl moiety of leucinamide subunit of N3-ILP is surrounded by the hydrophobic side chain of His41, Met49, Tyr54, Met165, and Asp187 of M pro . The solvent-exposed area of the Val side chain of the inhibitor indicated that this site could be substituted by a wide range of functional groups. The Ala side chain N3-ILP was surrounded by the side chains of Met165, Leu167, Phe185, Asp192, and Asp189, which formed a hydrophobic pocket. P5 makes van der Waals contacts with P168-A and the backbone of residues 190-191, Figure 1 .\nHere, the structural features of already known peptide-like N3-ILP inhibitor of SARS-COV-2 M pro enzyme have been employed to generate a small library of similar compounds to gain a short-term and specific solution to treat COVID-19 patients Ton et al., 2020) . To address this general challenge, we developed an integrated approach of drug discovery using pharmacophore modelling, screening of PubChem library, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to find potential preclinical leads for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 . This strategy will provide a route-map for tailoring the antiviral inhibitors that might help in assisting and developing novel SARS-CoV-2 M pro lead compounds to be implicated in the treatment of COVID-19 patients."}, {"section_title": "System preparation", "text": "The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with a peptide-like inhibitor was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7) (Jin et al., 2020) .

Any changes or disruption on enzymes' structural integrity might have a significant influence on its activity . The binding of small molecule inhibitors affects the mechanism of action of enzymes that are involved in disease pathways, thus there is a necessity to calculate the structural dynamics and conformational changes linked with the inhibitory activity of these inhibitors (Skjaerven et al., 2011) . The calculation of a time variable concerning an RMSD of C a atoms from produced trajectories was performed to discover the constancy and efficacy of the simulated M pro in complex with N3-ILP and along with the top five hits. The 2 D structure of the top five PubChem compounds and N3-ILP-inhibitor are presented in ( Figure S2 ).\nThe perturbations in the RMSD values as indicated in the plot ( Figure 4A) during simulation time revealed a probable conformational deviation in the structure of the enzyme upon inhibitor binding. As Figure 4A revealed, all the systems were stabilized and achieved convergence after almost 30 ns of the simulation run. 54035018-M pro exhibited the lowest average RMSD of 2.03 \u00c5, while 54152887-M pro and 54456426-M pro demonstrated the average RMSD of 2.45 \u00c5 and 2.33 \u00c5 respectively. The N3-ILP-M pro indicates a perturbation of 2.50 \u00c5 as shown in the plot. This analysis suggests that any other investigations made on the generated trajectories of all models were reliable. The RMSD plots suggest that 54035018-M pro , 54152887-M pro , and 54456426-M pro complexes exhibit the lowest divergence of C a backbone atoms indicating that binding of these three compounds imposed higher stability on M pro enzyme relative to N3-ILP-M pro complex. This could be implicated that the overall inhibitory activity of M pro by 54035018, 54152887, and 54456426 compounds was illustrated by the stabilization of its structural conformation. The stability of compounds 54035018, 54152887, and 54456426 was further retrieved during the simulation time as their corresponding activities might inform the respective interactions that they cause with active site residues.\nTo further validate our results, we have calculated R g value, a parameter directly associated with the overall conformational changes in the structure of the enzyme upon ligand binding. It also reveals the structure stability, compactness and folding behavior (Fakhar et al., 2017) . We measured the compactness of all the selected compounds and the reference complex by calculating their R g values. The average values of R g for 54035018-M pro , 54152887-M pro , and 54456426-M pro complexes were noted to be 38.87 \u00c5, 40.39 \u00c5, and 43.68 \u00c5, respectively. Figure 4B plots revealed a slight alteration in the compactness of the three compounds. The compound showed the lowest R g as compared to the other two complexes and also with the control N3-ILP-M pro complex (41.26 \u00c5), thus suggesting increased compactness and better binding with the M pro enzyme. All these patterns of conformational evaluation are indicating greater stability, flexibility, and compactness of compound 54035018 with the M pro enzyme.\nAfter analyzing the conformational binding, we have also explored SASA to determine the function of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues and forces exposed to the solvent during the simulation time (Khan et al., 2018) .

The interactions between the hydrophobic native contacts within the enzyme structure is a significant intermolecular interaction that influences enzyme inhibition. Hydrophobic interaction produced among the non-polar residues confirms the stability of the enzyme structure in solution by protecting the non-polar residues inside the hydrophobic core distant from an aqueous solution (Chen & Panagiotopoulos, 2019; Gupta et al., 2020) . As shown in Figure 5A , an average SASA for all the selected compounds has been calculated during the 100 ns MD simulation run. The average value of SASA for the compound 54035018-M pro complex was 13745 \u00c5 2 which was exposed to the solvent system. A total mean of SASA of 14283 \u00c5 2 and 14439 \u00c5 2 was noted by 54152887-M pro complex and 54456426-M pro complexes, respectively. The variations in SASA values for all the complexes during the simulation time resemble the folding and unfolding of an enzyme. The overall SASA values in the control complex were 14009 \u00c5 2 , higher than the 54035018-M pro complex. The SASA estimation observed in compound 54035018 bound complex further confirmed that this compound has increased exposure to solvent and subsequently preferred the increased inhibitory activity of compound 54035018 over other complexes.\nThe flexible or rigid residues of a protein contribute specifically to the biological function of the target enzyme in different biological pathways. Thus, the binding of inhibitors to the enzyme may be analyzed through the change in flexibility in terms of RMSF values (Mart \u0131nez, 2015) . To discover the rigidity and flexibility of residues in M pro upon binding of the selected compounds, RMSF values for C a atoms were calculated from trajectories generated over 100 ns of MD simulations production run. As shown in Figure 5B and C, the 54035018-M pro complex exhibited the least fluctuations in the residues with 11.12 \u00c5. An average RMSF of 15.06 \u00c5 and 15.29 \u00c5 were noticed in complex 54152887-M pro and 54456426-M pro , respectively. The complex, N3-ILP-M pro revealed an average of 11.25 \u00c5 that is slightly greater than 54035018-M pro complex, suggesting a better binding in comparison to the N3-ILP-M pro complex. This significant decrease could be associated with structural inactivation that is ensured as an outcome of the influential binding of this compound in the catalytic site of the M pro enzyme.

As we have mentioned in the residue interaction map analysis these complexes contributed greatly to the binding throughout the simulation period. The number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed in the active site of the M pro enzyme noted to be 2 and 3 hydrogen bonds in 54035018-M pro and 54152887-M pro complexes and between 3-4 hydrogen bonds in 54456426-M pro and 57076946-M pro complexes with higher fluctuations Figure 6B .\nTo understand the intermolecular interactions between ligand with the active site residues, we have calculated the ligand interaction maps ( Figure 7A and B). Compound 54035018 forms two direct hydrogen bonds with the polar residues Thr26 and Asn142 with OH and NH group suggestive of a stable interaction. However, hydrogen bond formation of Asparagine was noted to be absent in other complexes. Another polar residue Gln192 formed two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl functional group of compound 54152887. Gln166 also formed a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of 54152887 compound and residue His41 formed a p-p stacking within the complex. Compounds 54456426 and 57076946 also contributed significantly to the hydrogen bond network by forming major hydrogen bonds between the polar (Gln19, Thr26, Thr190), negatively charged (Gln166) and hydrophobic (Cys145) amino acid residues indicative of a stabilized binding with the enzyme. His41 forms a p-p stacking in compound 54456426 and 91366909.\nCompound 91366909 formed only one hydrogen bond with the negatively charged Gln166 residue, thus suggestive of weak binding. The hydrogen bond network plays an important role in the drug-binding mechanism, thus Thr amino acid residue contributed notably in the binding of the M pro enzyme as shown in Figure 7 ."}, {"section_title": "Secondary structure analysis", "text": "Based on the conformational behavior of bound complexes noted in RMSD, RMSF, and R g , we have calculated the secondary structure of 54035018-M pro complex and apo form of M pro enzyme as it is essential to observe the changes in enzyme structure without the inhibitor ( Figure 8 ). As shown in Table 2 , the average number of structural components are higher in the inhibitor bound M pro complex as compared to the apo form of the M pro enzyme. A slight increase was observed in the a-helix of the M pro apoenzyme. The b-strands and 3 10 -helix are marginally high in 54035018-M pro complex indicative of a stable binding. However, no major change was observed in the secondary structure of the M pro enzyme upon binding of the compound which shows strong stability, flexibility, and compactness of 54035018-M pro complex. The secondary structural analysis characterized here might provide useful conformational information of M pro which leads to the development of SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors. We presume that the design and development of selective inhibitors of M pro enzyme using rational approaches may pave new routes in antiviral therapeutics."}, {"section_title": "Mechanistic insights into binding affinity", "text": "The thermodynamic energy contribution of an inhibitor to the overall binding free energy of the complex corresponds to the structural stability of the inhibitor in the catalytic site of the enzyme. The intermolecular interactions in the catalytic/allosteric site residues participate considerably in the stability, binding affinity, and selectivity of the inhibitor. Thus, it was necessary to examine the binding affinity of all the selected compounds towards M pro enzyme using MM/ GBSA technique to establish the impact of the studied compounds. The results are presented in Table 3 .\nAs estimated free binding energy (DG bind ) of M pro complex was calculated as the highest energy with an average value of \u00c037.40 kcal/mol relative to 54152887-M pro and 54456426-M pro complexes with total mean values of \u00c037.18 and \u00c024.79 kcal/mol. The overall binding energy of control complex N3-ILP-M pro appeared to be lower (-30.89 kcal/mol) than the 54035018-M pro complex suggesting a better and improved binding of compound 54035018 to its target enzyme. We further estimated other components of the free binding energy associated with enzyme-inhibitor binding (Table 3) .\nWe observed that the intermolecular van der Waals and electrostatic energies in complex 54035018-M pro were favorable with average values of \u00c044.79 and \u00c031.73 kcal/mol whereas the gas-phase energy was higher (-56.21 kcal/mol) in complex 54152887-M pro . There is a slight difference of 0.22 kcal/mol among the DG bind energies of 54035018-M pro and 54152887-M pro complexes. The DG solvation contributed to the unfavorable binding of compound 54035018 as it is the least energy with a value of 25.01 kcal/mol among all complexes. Although the systematic movement of compound 54035018 and 54152887 from the solvent phase to the active site of M pro stimulated van der Waals and electrostatic interactions with the catalytic residues, these interactions are not enough to contribute fully in the binding of M pro enzyme as DG bind contributes to enhanced binding of these compounds. This analysis suggests that compound 54035018 bounds to M pro enzyme with greater affinity in comparison with other complexes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The necessity to control the emerging COVID-19 pandemic made us develop, a strategy to discover lead compounds that might be used in clinical trials to provide rapid success. Despite major efforts in the design and development of specific drugs or vaccines, not much proven to be efficacious against this SARS-CoV-2 infection. This curiosity leaves us to explore the drug designing approaches that could serve valuable to combat this disease. In this report, we have performed structure-based drug designing, virtual drug screening, and all-atom MD simulation approaches to discover highly selective compounds that possess significant binding affinity and presumably inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme. We have identified the five best compounds, however, only three have been discussed in detail as they have shown favorable binding energy against M pro enzyme. 54035018-M pro complex exhibited most stable, flexible, and compact in all the complexes with the highest notable secondary structure elements and binding energy (DG bind \u00c037.40 kcal/mol). Based on our overall observations, compound 54035018 could be recommended as a potential lead for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients after required clinical validations.
