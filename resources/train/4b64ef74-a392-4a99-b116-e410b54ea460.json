That is, will the ACGs induce more economically disadvantaged high school students to complete a rigorous high school program and enroll and succeed in postsecondary education? Will the National SMART Grants motivate more students to major and receive degrees in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical languages? It is still too early to answer these questions definitively. Students currently in their final years of high school may not have had enough time to take all the required courses and prerequisites, and students already in college may be well-established in other majors and not have the foundation needed to select one of the qualifying majors even if they wanted to. However, using data for the first two years of the programs, academic years 2006-07 and 2007-08, this report addresses a number of questions about indicators of intermediate progress toward achieving the long-term goals of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. The following are key study questions: \uf0b7 How have the legislation, regulations, and implementation of the programs changed? \uf0b7 What percentage of students who met the Pell Grant requirement for ACG and National SMART Grant eligibility also received an ACG or a National SMART Grant, and is this percentage increasing over time? \uf0b7 What percentages of students who obtained 2006-07 ACGs and National SMART Grants were eligible for and received renewed awards the following year? \uf0b7 What evidence is there that students were aware of the ACGs and National SMART Grants and knew what the requirements were? \uf0b7 Is there any evidence to suggest that students who received ACGs or National SMART Grants were more likely to persist in college than students who received Pell Grants only? The first report of this study, Academic Competitiveness and National SMART Grant Programs: First-Year Lessons Learned (U.S. Department of Education 2009), addressed questions about the numbers and characteristics of students participating in the Pell Grant, ACG, and National SMART Grant programs in 2006-07 (using the COD-CPS Interface Grant Recipient File maintained by the office of Federal Student Aid). It also analyzed historical data and used information gathered from stakeholders in focus groups and through published sources (public comments on proposed regulations, publications, and websites) to describe implementation concerns and legislative and regulatory actions taken to address the concerns. This report updates the first report. It compares student participation in the Pell Grant, ACG, and National SMART Grant programs in 2007-08 with 2006-07. The report also presents information on renewal rates-that is, how many students who received an ACG or National SMART Grant in 2006-07 received another one in 2007-08. Finally, it includes an analysis of data on program awareness collected through the student interview administered as part of the 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08). Note that the numbers of Pell Grants, ACGs, and National SMART Grants reported here may not exactly match numbers reported elsewhere. The FSA files used to generate the participation data are updated continuously with data from institutions on disbursements and cancellations so the exact number of awards varies slightly from day to day. By September, however, most financial aid data for the previous academic year have been finalized so differences between the numbers reported here and in other publications using data generated in September or later should be minor. Note that, unless otherwise indicated, the Pell Grant totals reported here are limited to recipients at institutions participating in the ACG or National SMART Grant programs and therefore are lower than Pell Grant totals reported elsewhere. Additional Pell Grant recipients can be found at less-than-two-year institutions and at two-and four-year institutions that made no ACG or National SMART Grant awards and therefore are not included in this report."}, {"section_title": "Addressing Initial Year Implementation Issues: Legislative Changes and Implementation of the ACG and National SMART Grant Programs", "text": "Examining whether and how the legislation, regulations, and the implementation of the programs have changed over time helps to provide a context for subsequent questions concerning program eligibility and participation. As awareness of the program spread, as greater clarity on program requirements helped institutions identify eligible students, and as the initial eligibility requirements were broadened, more students would be expected to participate. The ACG and National SMART Grant programs were signed into law in February 2006, while the first grants were awarded for the 2006-07 academic year. This timing posed significant challenges for the U.S. Department of Education, colleges and universities, students and their families, and other stakeholders. In a short time period, the Department had to publicize the programs, develop interim regulations, and set up processes to disburse funds, and institutions had to identify and verify eligible students and incorporate the new awards into students' aid packages. Although stakeholders generally supported the intent of the programs, many were initially frustrated by the lack of awareness about the programs, the administrative burdens put on institutions and staff, and confusion over how the programs should be implemented. Some of the difficulties were eased during the first year of the program as the Department made it easier to identify eligible students by clarifying language in the regulations related to issues such as how to compute GPAs, define the academic year, and establish a student's academic major. Nevertheless, some concerns remained, including the need to base ACG awards on students' four-year high school transcripts (which colleges do not always have) and difficulties associated with verifying the completion of a rigorous high school program. Many of the concerns expressed by stakeholders in the first year of administering the grants were addressed with clarifications in the final regulations and in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (H.R. 4137). The new legislation expanded eligibility for the programs to include a wider range of Pell Grant students. However, some stakeholders still have concerns about the administrative burden associated with correctly identifying students eligible for the financial awards who also met the rigorous secondary school curriculum and postsecondary GPA requirements. Especially when many colleges are facing cutbacks in staffing, many stakeholders view the processes for verifying certain aspects of student eligibility (the rigorous curriculum requirement for the ACG and the required minimum GPA for the ACGs and National SMART Grants) as unduly burdensome. Information on both grant programs is now more widely available. Many colleges and universities have posted information about these programs on their websites, and some stakeholder organizations continue to publish information for students and administrators on eligibility requirements and how to implement the grants at the institutional level. The U.S. Department of Education set a goal of doubling participation in both programs by 2010-11. To achieve this goal, the Department asked states to promote the participation of lowincome students in rigorous high school courses, especially those that prepare them for majors that would make them eligible for National SMART Grants, and to support efforts to increase program awareness. In addition, the Department and others suggested strategies to improve the identification of eligible students and reduce the administrative burden associated with this task."}, {"section_title": "ACG Eligibility, Participation, and Awareness", "text": "In fall 2006, a total of 15.2 million undergraduates enrolled in degree-granting institutions, and 5.2 million of them received a Pell Grant (Table A). Of these, 3.0 million were in their first or second year of college and therefore potentially eligible for an ACG. The Department of Education estimated that some 425,000 of these first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients would be eligible for an ACG, 4 but actual participation has been lower. \uf0b7 In the first year of the program, 301,700 students received an ACG. A combination of factors may account for the discrepancy between the actual and expected numbers, including a lack of awareness about the new programs, start-up difficulties common to all new programs, the difficulties that institutions had in identifying and verifying student eligibility, and the problem of accurately estimating the number of students meeting complex eligibility requirements with available data. \uf0b7 In the second year of the program, the number of students receiving an ACG rose by 97,000 (or 32 percent) to 398,700. Some of this increase reflects the 12 percent increase in Pell Grant awards to first-and second-year students at ACG-participating institutions (from 3.0 to 3.4 million), which expanded the pool of potentially eligible students. However, if the number of ACGs awarded had increased in proportion to the number of Pell Grants awarded (i.e., by 12 percent), only 339,000 (rather than 398,700) students would have received an ACG in 2007-08. This suggests that an additional 60,000 students received ACGs in the second program for other reasons. More students may have met the qualifications or institutions may have identified more eligible students. In addition, the pool of potential recipients was expanded because, in 2007-08, students who delayed entering college for one year became eligible for the grant, while in 2006-07, only immediate college entrants were eligible due to the requirement of high school graduation after Jan. 1, 2006. \uf0b7 The increase in ACG awards was particularly notable at two-year institutions, where the number of students receiving ACG awards increased by 71 percent between 2006-07 and 2007-08, from 38,300 to 65,600. Again, had the number increased in proportion to the number of Pell Grants awarded at two-year institutions (10 percent), only 42,000 students would have received ACG awards, suggesting that an additional 24,000 students received ACGs in 2007-08. \uf0b7 The number of students with awards at four-year institutions increased from 263,400 in 2006-07 to 333,100 in 2007-08. Again, had the number of ACGs increased at the same rate as the number of Pell Grants awarded (15.4 percent), only 303,900 students would have received ACG awards, suggesting that an additional 29,200 students received ACGs in 2007-08 because more students met the qualifications or institutions identified more students meeting them. \uf0b7 Despite the growth in the number of ACGs awarded, many Pell Grant recipients simply do not meet all the criteria for an ACG. The proportion of Pell Grant recipients who received an ACG remained low, increasing only slightly overall, from 10 percent (U.S. Table E-2) to 12 percent (Appendix Table  D-2)."}, {"section_title": "Department of Education 2009, Appendix", "text": "ACG participation rates also varied by type of institution, reflecting the characteristics of the student populations at these institutions. Many Pell Grant recipients at public two-year institutions would have been ineligible because they were not recent high school graduates, they attended part-time, or they were enrolled in certificate or nondegree programs. \uf0b7 About 25 percent of first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients received an ACG at public and private nonprofit four-year institutions, compared with only 4 percent at public two-year institutions ( Figure A). The pattern in 2007-08 was similar to that of 2006-07. \uf0b7 Almost half (46 percent) of all participating institutions awarded 50 or fewer ACGs (Figure 4). Some public four-year institutions handled relatively high volumes-52 percent awarded between 201 and 1,000 ACGs in 2007-08, and another 7 percent awarded more than 1,000 (Appendix Table D -4). The average number of ACGs awarded across all participating institutions was 134 (Appendix Table D-3). ACG recipients tended to come from the higher end of the income distribution of Pell Grant recipients (although all were from lower-income families). \uf0b7 In 2007-08, 8 percent of the dependent ACG recipients were from families with incomes of $50,000 or more, compared to 5 percent of dependent students in that income range who received Pell Grants only ( Figure 7). Twelve percent of the dependent ACG recipients were from families with incomes of $40,000-49,999, compared to 9 percent of dependent students in that range who received Pell Grants only. In contrast, only 19 percent of ACG recipients were in the lowest income group (under $10,000), compared to the 25 percent in that range who received Pell Grants only.

As with the ACG program, the discrepancy between estimated and actual participation may be attributable a combination of factors, including a lack of awareness about the new programs, start-up difficulties common to all new programs, the difficulties that institutions had in identifying and verifying student eligibility, and the problem of accurately estimating the number of students meeting complex eligibility requirements with available data. \uf0b7 The number of students receiving a National SMART Grant increased to 65,400 (5 percent) in 2007-08. Some of this 3,000 increase was due to expanded eligibility. About 1,800 National SMART Grants were awarded to students in newly eligible fields of study (see Appendix A for new fields). As with the ACG program, receipt of a National SMART Grant is tied to Pell Grant eligibility. If the number of Pell Grant recipients changes, so does the pool of students who are potentially eligible for a National SMART Grant. \uf0b7 The number of Pell Grants awarded to third-and fourth-year students at institutions participating in the SMART Grant program increased by 7 percent between 2006-07 and 2007-08, growing from 1.2 to 1.3 million students (Table A). \uf0b7 Had the number of SMART Grant awards grown at the same rate in 2007-08 as the number of Pell Grant awards among third-and fourth-year students, 66,600 students would have received SMART Grants-an excess of 2,200 over the number actually awarded. In short, the increase in SMART Grant awards did not keep pace with the increase in Pell Grant awards. At most institutions, few students received National SMART Grants. Again, levels of participation varied by type of institution and field of study. \uf0b7 Eighty percent of participating institutions awarded fewer than 50 grants, and more than a third awarded 10 or fewer ( Figure 14), with an average of 44 grants (Appendix Table  D-3). \uf0b7 While about a quarter of public four-year institutions awarded more than 100 SMART Grants in 2007-08, almost all private nonprofit four-year institutions (94 percent) and most for-profit four-year institutions (83 percent) awarded 50 or fewer (Appendix Table  D-4). As was true for dependent ACG recipients, dependent National SMART Grant recipients were overrepresented at the higher end of the family income distribution of Pell Grant recipients ( Figure 17). \uf0b7 In 2007-08, 22 percent of the dependent National SMART Grant recipients came from families with incomes of $40,000 or more, compared with 18 percent of third-and fourthyear students who received Pell Grants only. Life science was the most common major of National SMART Grant recipients (Table A). \uf0b7 About three-quarters of National SMART Grant recipients majored in one of three fields of study in 2007-08: life sciences (40 percent), engineering (21 percent), or computer science (15 percent) ( Figure 21). The pattern was similar in 2006-07. For-profit institutions awarded more than one-third of all the National SMART Grants in computer science ( Figure 22). As with the ACG program, relatively few students were aware of the National SMART Grant program. Those who were aware of it tended to know the requirements. \uf0b7 Of the third-, fourth-, and fifth-year undergraduates who were U.S. citizens and likely to be eligible for a Pell Grant, only 5 percent had heard of the National SMART Grant program (Table 9). \uf0b7 Students who were aware of the National SMART Grants were asked if they knew about each of the three requirements, and most said they were aware of them: 80 percent were aware of the full-time enrollment requirement, 74 percent were aware of the major requirement, and 75 percent were aware of the need to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (Table 10)."}, {"section_title": "National SMART Grant Renewal Rates", "text": "An important question is whether students who received a National SMART Grant as a thirdyear student were able to obtain another one in their fourth year.

Without longitudinal enrollment data, which are not available for the students included in this study, this question cannot be answered. However, if a student who received a Pell Grant in 2006-07 also received one in 2007-08, it means that the student persisted. If the student did not receive a Pell Grant the second year, it means that the student either did not enroll or enrolled but no longer qualified for a Pell Grant because of a higher family income or because the student dropped below half-time enrollment. Based on their Pell Grant renewal rates, students who received an ACG or National SMART Grant persisted at higher rates than their peers who received a Pell Grant only. \uf0b7 Three-fourths (75 percent) of first-year Pell Grant recipients who also got an ACG in 2006-07 received a Pell Grant again the following year, compared to just over half (56 percent) of those first-year Pell Grant recipients in 2006-07 who had received a Pell Grant only ( Figure D). \uf0b7 The Pell Grant renewal rates for third-year students who had also qualified for a National SMART Grant in 2006-07 were nearly 10 percentage points higher than for their counterparts who had received a Pell Grant only in 2006-07. The higher persistence rates for ACGs and National SMART Grants cannot be attributed solely to these grant programs. Students who receive ACGs or National SMART Grants are among the most academically qualified students receiving Pell Grants and therefore would be expected to persist at higher rates. However, the additional financial support (perhaps reducing the need to work during the school term) and other student attributes may have been contributing factors. Nevertheless, the substantial differences are worth noting. As experience with these programs accumulates, it will be possible to address these key questions with additional data and analyses.

The ACG program is intended to encourage students to take challenging courses in high school and attend college fulltime, thus increasing their likelihood of succeeding in college. The National SMART Grant program is intended to encourage students to pursue college majors considered to be in high demand in the global economy (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and languages deemed critical to the national interest. 6 Congress provided $4.5 billion over five years for these programs, and the first grants were awarded in 2006-07. Unless reauthorized, both programs will end after the 2010-11 academic year. Initially, to be eligible for either grant program, a student had to qualify for a Federal Pell Grant, 7 enroll full-time, and be a U.S. citizen. First-year students who met these conditions were eligible for an ACG up to $750 (depending on their financial need) if they graduated from high school after Jan. 1, 2006, completed a rigorous high school program (as defined by the U.S. Department of Education 8 ), and enrolled in a degree program at a two-or four-year institution of higher education. Second-year students could receive up to $1,300 if they graduated from high school after Jan. 1, 2005, met all the other conditions for an ACG, and had a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 9 at the end of their first year of college. Third-and fourth-year students with eligible majors at four-year institutions could receive a National SMART Grant worth up to $4,000 if they started with and maintained a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (H.R. 5715), signed into law in May 2008, expanded eligibility for the ACG and National SMART Grant programs to include part-time students and noncitizen permanent residents starting in January 2009. It also opened up the ACG program to students enrolled in certificate programs lasting a year or longer at a degreegranting institution. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (H.R. 4137), enacted in August 2008, further modified the programs. It gave states increased control to define rigorous secondary school programs of study (rather than leaving the definition up to the secretary of education) and delayed implementation of the eligibility changes until July 2009. Consequently, the expanded eligibility will first affect students enrolling in the 2009-10 academic year. Students enrolled during the first three years of the program (2006-07 through 2008-09) were subject to the original requirements. The timing of the legislation creating the ACG and National SMART Grant programs-the legislation was signed into law in February 2006 and the first grants had to be awarded for the 2006-07 academic year-posed significant challenges for the U.S. Department of Education, colleges and universities, students and their families, and other stakeholders. In a short time period, the Department had to publicize the programs, develop interim regulations, and set up processes to disburse funds, and institutions had to identify and verify eligible students and incorporate the new awards into students' aid packages. Participation in both programs in 2006-07 was lower than expected. Some 301,700 first-and second-year undergraduates received an ACG (compared with an early estimate that 425,000 students would have been eligible), and about 62,400 third-and fourth-year students received a National SMART Grant (compared with an expected 80,000) (Choy, Berkner, Lee, and Topper 2009). To what extent this lower-than-expected participation was due to inaccurate estimates of eligibility, lack of knowledge about the programs, implementation problems, or other reasons is unknown. All these factors may have played a role. In the second year of the program (2007-08), 398,700 students received an ACG and 65,400 received a National SMART Grant. This growth reflects, at least in part, increases in the number of Pell Grant awards, which expanded the pool of potentially eligible students, and some expansion of the list of eligible majors for the National SMART Grant. After the first year, the U.S. Department of Education set a goal of doubling participation in both programs by 2010-11. To achieve this goal, the Department asked states to promote the participation of low-income students in rigorous high school courses, especially those that prepare them for National SMART Grant-eligible majors, and to support efforts to increase program awareness. In addition, the Department and some stakeholders have suggested strategies to improve the identification of eligible students and reduce the administrative burden associated with this task."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of This Study", "text": "MPR Associates and JBL Associates are assisting the Department of Education in evaluating the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. Of key interest to the Department is whether the financial incentives provided by the grants affect student behavior. That is, will the ACGs induce more economically disadvantaged high school students to complete a rigorous high school program and enroll and succeed in postsecondary education? And, will the National SMART Grants motivate more students to major and receive degrees in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical languages? Unfortunately, it is still too early to answer these questions. Students currently in their final years of high school may not have had enough time to take all the required courses and prerequisites, and students already in college may be well-established in other majors and not have the foundation needed to select one of the qualifying majors even if they wanted to do so. However, using data for the first two years of the programs, academic years 2006-07 and 2007-08, this report addresses a number of questions about indicators of intermediate progress toward achieving the long-term goals of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. The following are key study questions: \uf0b7 How have the legislation, regulations, and implementation of the programs changed? \uf0b7 What percentage of students who met the Pell Grant requirement for ACG and National SMART Grant eligibility also received one of these grants, and is this percentage increasing over time? \uf0b7 What percentages of students who obtained ACGs and National SMART Grants in 2006-07 were eligible for and received renewed awards the following year? \uf0b7 What evidence is there that students were aware of the ACGs and National SMART Grants and knew what the requirements were? \uf0b7 Is there any evidence to suggest that students who received ACGs or National SMART Grants were more likely to persist in college than students who received Pell Grants only?

The report also analyzed historical data and used information gathered from stakeholders in focus groups and through published sources (public comments on proposed regulations, publications, and websites) to describe implementation concerns and legislative and regulatory actions taken to address the concerns. The second year of the study, reported on here, focused on updating information on the implementation of the programs (Chapter 2) and describing participation in 2007-08 (Chapter 3). Chapter 3 presents data for the ACG and National SMART Grant programs overall, by type of institution, across states, and by student characteristics. It also includes sections on the extent to which students were aware of the new programs and changes in STEM course-taking between 2003-04 and 2007-08. The report also describes renewal rates from 2006-07 to 2007-08 in some detail (Chapter 4). It presents, for each type of institution, how many of the first-year students who received an ACG in 2006-07 received another one as a second-year student in 2007-08. For those who did not receive an ACG in their second year, it indicates how many still had a Pell Grant in their second year but no ACG (implying that they did not earn a sufficiently high GPA in their first year or dropped below full-time attendance), and how many were either no longer eligible for a Pell Grant or not enrolled in college.

At the same time that legislation and regulations are modifying and shaping the ACG and National SMART Grant programs, changes are being made to the federal student aid programs that may affect the utilization of ACGs and National SMART Grants. The maximum authorized Pell Grant amount for eligible students was increased, starting July 1, 2009, to $6,000 for academic year 2009-10. However, because the authorized maximum amount was not funded, the maximum Pell Grant amount for the 2009-10 award year was $5,350, an increase of $619 from the 2008-09 award year. For 2010-11, the maximum award was funded at $5,550, a $200 increase, and eligibility for the Pell Grant was expanded. This will increase the number of potentially eligible ACG and National SMART Grant recipients. The Department of Education has developed a shorter and simpler version of the online Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and renewal FAFSA that eliminates nonapplicable questions. They have also developed a Web application that will let some families answer the remaining financial questions with a data feed from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These improvements should increase the number of Pell Grant applicants, as research shows that the complexity of the current FAFSA application prevents many low-income, potentially Pell Granteligible students from applying for federal aid (ACSFA 2008). Unrelated to the changes in student aid programs is the effect of the current economic recession on college and university operations. Declines in state support and losses in endowment holdings have increased the pressure on institutions to cut expenses and raise tuition to compensate for lost revenue. There have also been increases in enrollment, especially in less expensive public and community colleges. During a recession, unemployed or underemployed workers are more likely to return to college to upgrade their skills than are those who are fully employed. 10 The effects of these program changes and the larger economic cycles will affect the numbers of students who are eligible for ACGs and National SMART Grants in their final years of funding."}, {"section_title": "Continuing Controversy on the Design and Purpose of the Legislation", "text": "While financial aid has been a central part of the federal government's higher education policy for many years, the introduction of a merit component to the Pell Grant award process was perceived by postsecondary administrators and their stakeholder organizations as a significant change in federal policy. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act, or G.I. Bill, passed in 1944, was a significant federal foray into providing financial aid for students-in this case, veterans-for postsecondary education. The first need-based federal grant programs came into existence with Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Education Amendments of 1972 went on to expand aid to the neediest of students through the creation of the Basic Education Opportunity Grant, later renamed the Pell Grant. Title IV Grant programs were established to help financially needy students. Leading up to and continuing throughout the first award year for ACGs and National SMART Grants, there was general discussion about the merit components of the grants, and specifically about the ACG requirement that students complete a rigorous secondary school curriculum in high school and achieve a 3.0 GPA at the end of their first year to receive their second-year award, and the National SMART Grant requirement that students maintain a cumulative 3.0 GPA. The intent of the programs was to encourage academic and enrollment behaviors that would lead to successful degree completion. The statutory requirements (full-time enrollment, enrollment in degree programs) were aligned with previous research that identifies these characteristics as factors in degree attainment (U.S. Department of Education 1999Education , 2006. By tying these programs to the Pell Grant, the government was attempting to bolster access and degree completion for students who are most at risk of never reaching, or dropping out of, higher education. By mandating that students complete a rigorous secondary school curriculum, states were also encouraged to ensure that approved curricula were available to all students. Critics took issue with the merit component of the grants, based on philosophical differences and on logistical concerns. First, some critics were concerned about the perceived shift in federal aid policy away from need-based to merit-based aid and its effect on low-income students. They were concerned that this trend toward funding merit-based aid might affect the funding levels of other federal need-based aid programs, while serving a more limited student population. During interviews and focus groups held during the first implementation year, high school and postsecondary stakeholders voiced concerns that the distribution of aid would shift from the low end to the high end of the Pell Grant-eligibility range and exclude more racial and ethnic minority recipients, thereby reducing the resources going to those students who need the most help to attend college. The other, more practical, concern was how to fulfill the statutory requirements, given the time, budgetary, and administrative constraints facing postsecondary institutions. During the first implementation year, colleges and universities had less than six months to prepare for disbursement. Additionally, verifying academic achievement and meeting the necessary documentation requirements set forth by the statute required greater coordination among admissions officers, financial aid officers, and registrars. As open-access institutions, community colleges in particular felt the brunt of these new statutory requirements."}, {"section_title": "Changes in the Programs", "text": "Leading up to the start of the 2006-07 academic year, the Department notified the public of this new source of potential financial aid; provided guidance and Interim Regulations to higher education institutions; set up processes to disburse funds to colleges and universities; worked with stakeholders to develop Final Regulations for 2006-07; and began establishing regulations for subsequent years. The Interim Final Rules that governed these programs were issued by the Department in July 2006 and were followed by a series of \"Dear Colleague\" letters to address specific concerns-expanding the list of National SMART Grant majors and providing two approaches for determining \"academic year.\" At the same time, postsecondary institutions worked to identify eligible students and award these new grants, despite concerns about the administrative burdens created by the new requirements. The Final Regulations aimed to further reduce the administrative burden of implementing the grants. The Final Regulations for 2008-09, released in November 2007, were developed through the analysis of comments received on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that was based on a negotiated rulemaking process. Early implementation of the regulations was allowed. Modifications made to the Final Regulations included allowing states and local education agencies to submit rigorous curricula for approval beyond the following year; clarifying how to interpret Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and dual enrollment credits; and outlining a process by which institutions could submit petitions to have additional majors designated as National SMART Grant-eligible majors. and students enrolled in certificate programs lasting a year or more at a degree-granting institution. The legislation also deleted the \"academic year\" terminology, which allowed colleges and universities to determine student standing based on grade level. Students enrolled in demanding degree programs requiring five years of course credits were also allowed to receive a fifth-year grant. In addition, Congress made it clear that only states could add additional rigorous programs of study to those previously defined by the secretary to determine student eligibility for the ACG.

The passage of H.R. 5715 and H.R. 4137 in 2008 addressed many of these concerns, although the administrative burden was still felt by some institutions. Local campus difficulty in implementing technology solutions for the coordination of information on financial need, determining students' initial and continuing academic progress and eligibility, and the ACG's rigorous curriculum requirement continued to concern policy groups, financial aid administrators, and academic advisors. These stakeholders thought that the processes for verifying that a student initially met the rigorous curriculum requirement for the ACG, attained the required minimum GPA at the end of the first year for the ACG, and met the minimum GPA each term for the National SMART Grant required time-consuming administrative processes at a time when many colleges were facing cutbacks in staffing. Although the Department provided clarification throughout the first and second implementation years, no significant changes in legislation were made to address these concerns during the 2008-09 academic year."}, {"section_title": "Administrative Burden", "text": "Several recent reports cite the administrative burden of qualifying the grant recipients as one of the primary reasons why the number of recipients during the first two implementation years was lower than the Department had expected.  McSwain, Cunningham, Erisman, and Merisotis 2008), in which they called upon stakeholders to address the challenge of reaching a greater number of students. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) called the programs \"too complicated and ineffective\" in their April 2009 report National Conversation Initiative-Preliminary Recommendations (NASFAA 2009, p. 20). NASFAA's criticisms of the programs echo the feedback that stakeholders provided during the first implementation year: that the programs are challenging to implement, burdensome on financial aid and academic advising departments, and have thus far served a limited number of students. NASFAA also stated that the merit component both limits the reach of the grants and signals a change in federal student aid policy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) heard similar comments from the institutions and administrators they interviewed for their audit of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs, released in March 2009. Some of the state officials and college administrators interviewed by the GAO felt that the differing state and institutional participation rates were due in part to variances in access to rigorous curricula, state high school graduation requirements, college admissions requirements, and institutional and student characteristics. Many of the financial aid administrators interviewed for the GAO report (U.S. Government Accountability Office 2009) identified the rigorous curriculum requirement as particularly difficult to verify and burdensome to implement. Despite these concerns, states and institutions have made efforts to simplify the award process. Northwestern Connecticut Community College, for example, has reconfigured its data system to automate the award process and promote the ACG to students. While awarding the grants still creates a \"huge additional workload on already strained resources,\" the college has developed a form to help administrators and staff members determine student eligibility (Northwestern Connecticut Community College n.d.). The GAO also reported that several of the states and institutions they interviewed had implemented strategies to help streamline the verification process. Texas and Florida annotate the high school transcripts of students who meet the rigorous curricula requirement; Georgia provides institutions with a list of students who have received their Bright Future Scholarship (and thereby meet the curriculum requirements); and Rhode Island is considering annotating its high school transcripts as well."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Academic Year", "text": "Leading up to and during the first implementation year, stakeholders expressed concern about the definition of \"academic year\" as described in Section 481(a)(2) of the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005. Under the Interim Final Regulations, academic year progress was defined in terms of both the minimum number of weeks of instructional time and in credit or clock hours. Stakeholders preferred that \"academic year\" be determined only by the student's grade level or credits earned and his or her standing as defined by the institution, which is consistent with the definition of \"year\" used in other Title IV programs. Initial confusion over the rules for the program led to errors in awarding aid. In a \"Dear Colleague\" letter (GEN-06-18), the Department acknowledged that it would be difficult for many institutions using a traditional term-based academic calendar to determine the actual number of weeks of instruction that a student would need in order to complete the number of credit hours in an academic year and allowed institutions to decide this on a student-by-student basis, using two suggested approaches and several examples. The language of the law left the Department little latitude for modifying the statutory requirements, and there were no changes to the definition for the 2006-07, 2007-08, or 2008- "}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Requirements", "text": "Stakeholders continued to voice concerns over several of the regulatory requirements: that institutions must participate in the ACG and National SMART Grant programs to continue to participate in Title IV funding; that colleges review four-year high school transcripts to verify completion of a rigorous curriculum instead of using the typical three-year transcript; and that the determination of eligibility for the National SMART Grant be based on academic major, course work, and postsecondary GPA. Postsecondary institutions felt these regulatory requirements were particularly difficult to implement, especially for community colleges and smaller colleges and universities, which generally lack the staff, budget, and expertise to process student transcripts in such detail. As open-admission institutions, many community colleges did not require high school transcripts for enrollment and were not set up to meet the verification requirements of the ACG. Although many states and institutions have now put processes in place to mitigate the administrative burden of these grants, community colleges may continue to find the verification requirements burdensome as college enrollment increases and institutional and state budgets shrink."}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Participation", "text": "Stakeholders questioned the mandatory institutional participation requirement, saying it violated institutional autonomy and would be difficult to implement given the short amount of time between the authorization of the program and the awarding of the grants. In its response to the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Department said it was not going to change the Interim Regulations in order to ensure that students with financial need could receive all the federal grants to which they were entitled. A voluntary program would have created a \"separate but unequal\" situation where otherwise eligible students would be missing out on the chance to receive additional grant funds based on the college or university they decided to attend. Although no changes were, or will be, made to this part of the statute, the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was assigned the tasks of examining the proper identification of eligible students, the correct disbursement of monies, and institutional compliance. In the report Audit of the Department's Process for Disbursing Academic Competitiveness Grants and National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grants (U.S. Department of Education 2008), the OIG found that the Federal Student Aid (FSA) office had sufficient processes in place to correctly identify financially eligible students, but did not adequately follow up with colleges to ensure compliance. More than half of the nonparticipating ACG/National SMART Grant-eligible colleges never responded to FSA inquiries as to why they were not participating, and the OIG report found that a significant proportion of these colleges were in fact eligible to participate, although they may have had very few students who would have qualified.

Stakeholders were identified based on their role in preparing students for or implementing the ACG and National SMART Grant programs.

This list has since been broadened to include a more diverse set of stakeholders, ranging from representatives from high school and postsecondary organizations to nongovernmental organizations.\nGiven that some of the most contentious statutory concerns (rigorous curriculum requirement, postsecondary GPA requirement) are unlikely to be modified or removed before the programs' sunset following the 2010-11 academic year, many colleges have found ways to implement the grants and work within the framework and guidelines provided by the Department. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, and the National Association of College and University Business Officers continue to provide their members with updates and implementation information on the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. Questions raised by college and university financial aid administrators on the national FINAID-L listserv 13 continued to center on identifying students, determining eligibility, calculating GPA, and evaluating transcripts. Administrators and other financial aid personnel use this site to post technical questions and receive guidance from their colleagues on how to adhere to, and interpret, the legislation. Similarly, parents and students continue to post questions and comments about the grants on the College Confidential website, 14 which was developed by several college aid counselors, administrators, and a parent to provide information on the college admissions and financial aid application process. Posts from parents and students continue to focus on the eligibility requirements, approved majors, and how changes in enrollment affect grant disbursement. During the Brookings Institution's May 2009 forum on the \"Future of Student Financial Aid,\" participants discussed some of the challenges that institutions and administrators faced when implementing the ACGs and National SMART Grants. One of the concerns they raised about the design of the programs was that, unlike the Pell Grant, whose award amount is distributed on a sliding scale based on income, students must meet all of the eligibility requirements to receive the ACG and National SMART Grant. There have also been calls by various higher education advocacy groups to streamline the financial aid system and eliminate the ACG and National SMART Grant programs altogether by fully funding the Pell Grant. In September 2008, the College Board and the Rethinking Student Aid Study Group published the report Fulfilling the Commitment: Recommendations for Reforming Federal Student Aid (College Board 2008), which presents recommendations for improving the federal student aid system. The authors cited the growing complexity of the federal student grant system and recommended simplifying the Pell Grant program by increasing the average award instead of diverting funds to companion programs, such as the ACG and National SMART Grant programs, that serve a smaller population of low-and middle-income students. NASFAA (2009) made similar recommendations in its report, calling for an increase in the maximum Pell Grant award through the elimination of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Many of the concerns expressed by stakeholders during the first and second award years have been mitigated by the enactment of H.R. 5715 and H.R. 4137, although concerns were still raised about the perceived administrative burden of implementing the grants, and several recent reports have advocated instead for increasing the maximum Pell Grant amount by eliminating the ACG and National SMART Grant programs entirely. Stakeholders generally approve of the changes made to the legislation, primarily because more students will meet the new eligibility requirements, even though there are still concerns about the increased administrative burden of processing a higher volume of transcripts and awards. It is anticipated that a greater number of students will be served by the grants during the 2009-10 academic year, due in part to the broader eligibility rules and to more awareness about the programs and their requirements (Table 4). -20 - Increased participation by lower-income and adult students who are more likely to attend part-time and enroll in certificate programs.

Efforts made by the FSA to increase compliance may result in an increase in the number of ACG awards. State and institutional efforts to automate the award process and better classify students as having completed a \"rigorous\" secondary school curriculum will also streamline the verification process, and thereby reduce the associated administrative burden. Other recent developments-such as the increase in the maximum Pell Grant award and the simplification of the FAFSA-may also contribute to an increase in postsecondary enrollment and persistence. Postsecondary institutions, and community colleges in particular, may experience increases in student enrollment, despite decreases in state funding and institutional endowments, as unemployed and underemployed workers return to education. While many of these students may be enrolled part-time, they would still be eligible for the ACG or National SMART Grant as long as they enroll at least half-time and meet the other eligibility requirements. Federal, state, and local efforts to improve K-12 education, postsecondary enrollment, and degree attainment are unlikely to have the effect of increasing the number of ACG recipients. The ACG and National SMART Grant programs will sunset at the end of the 2010-11 academic year, and the fruits of these efforts are generally slow to mature. In considering participation in the ACG and National SMART Grant programs, it is important to remember (as explained in Chapter 1) that participation is tied to Pell Grant eligibility. As a result, it is sensitive to changes in Pell Grant participation and also to changes in the maximum Pell Grant. If the number of Pell Grant recipients increases, for example, so does the pool of students eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant. In addition, because a student's total grant aid cannot exceed his or her calculated financial need, it is possible that as the maximum Pell Grant amount increases, fewer students may be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant or the amounts they can receive may be reduced. 15"}, {"section_title": "THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK", "text": "In fall 2006, a total of 15.2 million undergraduates were enrolled in degree-granting institutions, and 5.2 million of them received a Pell Grant (Table 5).

As indicated earlier, there were several ways to meet the academic requirements for an ACG. Students may have qualified on more than one basis, but their institutions reported just one and may have chosen the easiest to verify. The distribution of recipients according to the way in which they formally qualified for an ACG was about the same in 2006-07 and 2007-08. In both years, more than half qualified by completing the ED course-defined high school curriculum ( Figure 11). Next most common was meeting the requirements of a state-designated rigorous program of courses (35 percent in 2006-07 and 37 percent in 2007-08). Participation rates varied widely by state. Table 6 shows the states ranked from high to low according the percentage of first-and secondyear Pell Grant recipients-at four-year institutions only-who received an ACG in 2007-08. This table is based on students' state of residence, regardless of where they attended college. Massachusetts residents had the highest level of participation (37 percent of Pell Grant recipients from that state received an ACG), and Utah had the lowest level (5 percent). The overall participation rate at four-year institutions was slightly higher in 2007-08 than in 2006-07, and there were increases in all but a few states. Table 7 shows data by state for students at two-year institutions ranked by their rate of ACG participation. Most states had low rates of participation, but some improved in 2007-08. The rate of ACG participation in two-year institutions was low in part because, as already indicated, these institutions have large numbers of part-time students and students enrolled in certificate programs. While these students were eligible for Pell Grants in 2007-08, they were not eligible for ACGs. When this eligibility requirement changes in 2009-10, participation rates at two-year institutions should increase. Participation in the ACG program may also be lower in two-year institutions because these institutions often do not require high school transcripts and may have found it difficult to verify rigorous high school course-taking. Finally, the rate of ACG participation may be lower because students at two-year institutions may be less likely than those at four-year institutions to have completed a rigorous high school curriculum.

All institutions participating in the Pell Grant program are required by law to participate in the ACG program. However, nonparticipation in the ACG program does not necessarily mean noncompliance with the law, because a Pell Grant-eligible institution may not have any students qualifying for an ACG. For example, institutions offering primarily certificate programs or only a few degree programs (as many private institutions do) might not have any ACG-eligible students. In 2007-08, 4,100 degree-awarding institutions were eligible to participate in the Federal Pell Grant program, up from 3,600 a year earlier (Appendix Table D-1 and U.S. Department of Education 2009, Appendix Table E-1). The number of institutions participating in the ACG program (defined as making at least one award) also increased (from 2,800 to 3,000), but the increase was proportionately less. As a result, the percentage of Pell Grant-eligible institutions awarding ACGs declined, from 78 to 73 percent. This decline may not be particularly meaningful, however. The actual numbers of eligible and participating institutions are difficult to determine because some multi-campus institutions report data separately by campus and others report centrally. 16 Therefore, what may appear to be a change in the number of eligible or participating institutions may reflect, in part, a change in how the data are reported. A more important point is that most Pell Grant recipients had access to an ACG if they qualified for one. In both years, about 90 percent of the students with Pell Grants were enrolled in institutions that awarded ACGs and thus could have received one if they met the nonfinancial criteria. Among all types of institutions, public four-year ones had the highest participation rate in the ACG program in both 2006-07 and 2007-08 (about 95 percent) ( Figure 1). For-profit four-year institutions showed the most notable increase in the rate of participation (from 62 to 73 percent), but the number of such institutions is relatively small (just 164 in 2007-08). See Appendix Table  D-1 for more detail on institutional participation."}, {"section_title": "The number of students receiving an ACG increased by a third.", "text": "In the first year of the program, 301,700 students received an ACG (Table 5). A combination of factors may account for the discrepancy between the actual and expected numbers of students, including a lack of awareness about the new programs, start-up difficulties common to all new programs, the difficulties that institutions had in identifying and verifying student eligibility, and the problem of accurately estimating the number of students meeting complex eligibility requirements with available data. 17 In the second year of the program, the number of students receiving an ACG rose by 97,000 (or 32 percent) to 398,700. Some of this increase reflects the 12 percent increase in Pell Grant awards to first-and second-year students at ACG-participating institutions (from 3.0 to 3.4 million), which expanded the pool of potentially eligible students. However, if the number of ACGs awarded had increased in proportion to the Pell Grant awards (i.e., by 12 percent), only 339,000 (rather than 398,700) students would have received an ACG in 2007-08. This suggests that an additional 60,000 students received ACGs in the second program year for other reasons. More students may have met the qualifications or institutions may have identified more eligible students. In addition, the pool of potential recipients was expanded because, in 2007-08, students who delayed entering college for one year became eligible for the grant, while in 2006-07, only immediate college entrants were eligible due to the requirement of high school graduation after Jan. 1, 2006. The increase in ACG awards was particularly notable at two-year institutions, where the number of students receiving ACG awards increased by 71 percent, from 38,300 in 2006-07 to 65,600 in 2007-08. Again, had the number increased in proportion to the Pell Grant awards at two-year institutions (9.5 percent), only 42,000 students would have received ACG awards, suggesting that an additional 24,000 students received ACGs in 2007-08 because more students met the qualifications or institutions identified more students meeting the qualifications. The number of students with awards at four-year institutions increased from 263,400 in 2006-07 to 333,100 in 2007-08. Again, had the number of ACGs increased at the same rate as Pell Grant awards (15.4 percent), only 303,900 students would have received ACG awards, suggesting that an additional 29,200 students received ACGs in 2007-08 because more students met the qualifications or institutions identified more students meeting them."}, {"section_title": "The percentage of Pell Grant recipients receiving an ACG increased only slightly.", "text": "Despite the growth in the number of ACGs awarded, many Pell Grant recipients simply do not meet all the criteria for an ACG. The proportion of Pell Grant recipients who received an ACG remained low, increasing only slightly overall, from 10 percent (U.S. Department of Education 2009, Appendix Table E-2) to 12 percent (Appendix Table D-2). The percentage rose at all types of institutions, but by varying amounts (Figure 2). Most of the grants went to students at public and private nonprofit four-year institutions. Of the approximately 400,000 ACGs awarded in 2007-08, more than half (225,200) went to students at public four-year institutions (Appendix Table D-2). 18 Another 100,700 went to students at private nonprofit four-year institutions. 19 A much smaller number went to students at public two-year institutions (61,900), even though these students accounted for almost half of all first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients. The relatively small number of ACGs awarded to students at public two-year institutions reflects, in part, the large proportions of students attending these institutions who would have been ineligible because they attended part-time, were enrolled in certificate or nondegree programs, or were not recent high school graduates. 20 When ACG eligibility is expanded in 2009-10 to include students in certificate programs at degree-granting institutions and part-time students, the number of grants and the percentage of Pell Grant recipients receiving an ACG should both increase at public two-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "A majority of ACG students have received the maximum award.", "text": "Colleges disburse ACGs and Pell Grants one term at a time, with students receiving one-half or one-third of the award each term depending on their colleges' academic calendar. Among firstyear ACG recipients, about three-quarters (77 percent) were enrolled for the entire academic year in 2007-08 and received the maximum of $750. This was a decline from the previous year, however, when 83 percent received the full amount ( Figure 3). The average ACG for first-year students was about $680 in both years. Among second-year ACG recipients, about two-thirds (68 percent) were enrolled for the full year in 2007-08 and received the maximum of $1,300. This represents a slight decline from 2006-07, when 72 percent received the maximum. The average ACG for second-year students was about the same in both years ($1,100). Students would have received less than the full amount if they attended only part of the year, and first-year students would have received more than $750 if they advanced to second-year status during the year. Additional students may have received less than the full amount because the full amount would have exceeded their financial need, but this was probably rare-most students not receiving the maximum received one-third, one-half, or two-thirds of the full amount, suggesting partial-year attendance as the primary explanation rather than a reduced award.  Table E-3). However, 46 percent of all participating institutions awarded 50 or fewer ACGs in 2007-08, making this a relatively small program at many institutions ( Figure 4). Many public four-year institutions handled relatively high volumes-52 percent awarded between 201 and 1,000 ACGs, and another 7 percent awarded more than 1,000 (Appendix Table  D -4). Other types of institutions, however, had relatively few students. Forty percent of private nonprofit four-year institutions and 60 percent of public two-year institutions awarded 50 or fewer grants. Appendix Table D-5 provides additional detail on the distribution of ACGs. "}, {"section_title": "C H A P T E R 3 .

In both 2006-07 and 2007-08, 77 percent of all ACG recipients were in their first year of college, and 23 percent were in their second year ( Figure 5). In contrast, 65 percent of all recipients with Pell Grants only were in their first year in 2007-08, and 35 percent were in their second year (Appendix Table D -6). The lower percentage of ACG than Pell-only awards going to second-year students suggests that it is difficult for low-income students to meet the cumulative 3.0 GPA required for an ACG. Because the ACG program was not signed into law until spring 2006, students who received an ACG for 2006-07 as a second-year student could not have known a year earlier that earning a 3.0 GPA could make them eligible for this grant. In contrast, students who received an ACG for 2006-07 as a first-year student would have known that if they earned a 3.0 GPA, they could get another, even larger, ACG in their second year. Therefore, it might be reasonable to expect that this prospect would have motivated some first-year ACG recipients in 2006-07 to work hard for a 3.0 GPA and retain eligibility. If this were the case, however, the proportion of grants going to second-year students should have increased in 2007-08. Because no such increase occurred, \neither the grants did not have the expected motivating effect or the effect was overshadowed by other factors. A majority of ACG recipients were women. Sixty-two percent of all ACG recipients in 2007-08 were women (Appendix Table D-8). However, women accounted for an even greater percentage (67 percent) of all first-and secondyear students with a Pell Grant but no ACG. This means that women were less likely than men to receive an ACG.\nAlthough all ACG recipients were from low-income families, they were disproportionately at the higher end of the income distribution of Pell-recipient families. In 2007-08, 8 percent of dependent ACG recipients came from families with incomes of $50,000 or more (compared with 5 percent of their counterparts who received Pell Grants only), and another 12 percent came from families with incomes of $40,000-49,999 (compared with 9 percent of their Pell Grant-only counterparts) ( Figure 7). The pattern was similar in 2006-07. The federal Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a measure of a family's financial strength and indicates how much of a student's and (for dependent students) family's financial resources should be available to help pay for a student's education. 21 The EFC is an index number and is used to determine the Pell Grant amount. Students with a zero EFC are the neediest and are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. As income increases, so does the EFC. Therefore, ACG recipients tended to come from the higher end of the EFC distribution as well as the higher end of the income distribution for dependent students (Appendix Table D-10 and U.S.\nDepartment of Education 2009, Appendix Table E-10). The corresponding EFC distributions for independent students are shown in the same tables. Among dependent students, the percentage of first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients receiving an ACG was about 4 percentage points higher in 2007-08 than in 2006-07 at each EFC level (Figure 8). -33 -    \nAs EFC increased, the ACG contributed relatively more than the Pell Grant to the combined award. First-and second-year students with ACGs received an average Pell Grant of $3,000 and an average ACG of $770, for a combined average of $3,800. First-and second-year students with Pell Grants only received an average of $2,500 (Appendix Table D -11). Because the ACG amount is income-based only in terms of being restricted to those eligible for Pell Grants, the average ACG for dependent students was roughly the same across EFC levels (between $750 and $810 in both 2006-07 and 2007-08) ( Figure 9 and Appendix Table D-12). The minor differences are due to a slightly different mix of first-and second-year students at each EFC level. On the other hand, Pell Grant amounts, which are based on need, decline as EFC increases. In 2007-08, first-and second-year dependent students with a zero EFC received an average Pell Grant of $4,000, which was much larger than their average ACG of $750. In contrast, their counterparts with an EFC of 3,000 or more received an average Pell Grant of $760, which was less than their average ACG of $790.   Figure 10 and Appendix Table D-12 show how ACG and Pell Grant dollars are spread across EFC levels. In 2007-08, students with an EFC of less than 1,000 received 75 percent of all Pell Grant dollars and 56 percent of all ACG dollars. Students with higher EFCs received a much greater share of ACG dollars (45 percent) than Pell Grant dollars (26 percent). The pattern was similar in 2006-07.\n\nIn both 2006-07 and 2007-08, 80 percent of all participating institutions awarded 50 or fewer National SMART Grants, and 38 percent awarded 10 or fewer ( Figure 14). Almost all private nonprofit four-year institutions (94 percent) and most for-profit four-year institutions (83 percent) awarded 50 or fewer grants in 2007-08 (Appendix Table D -4). Among public four-year institutions, which had the highest average number of grants, just 10 percent awarded 200 or more grants. \nNational SMART Grant awards were evenly divided between third-and fourth-year students. In 2007-08, about 5 percent each of third-year and fourth-year Pell Grant recipients received a National SMART Grant (Appendix Table D-7). Because the number of Pell Grant recipients was about the same at both levels, 50 percent of the National SMART Grants went to third-year students, and 50 percent went to fourth-year students ( Figure 15). Appendix Table D-7 shows additional detail on class-level participation by type of institution.  (Sept. 21, 2007) and AY0708 (Nov. 25, 2008). Men received a disproportionate share of National SMART Grants. The majority of third-and fourth-year students in the Pell Grant program were women in 2007-08 (62 percent), but more than half of the National SMART Grants (58 percent) went to men (Figure 16). This pattern reflects the predominance of men in eligible fields. In 2005-06, women earned less than half of all bachelor's degrees in physical sciences and science technologies (42 percent), engineering and engineering technologies (18 percent), mathematics and statistics (45 percent), and computer and information sciences (21 percent) (Planty et al. 2008, Indicator 27). Only in biological and biomedical sciences did women earn a majority of bachelor's degrees (62 percent). Appendix Table D-8 presents more detail on the demographic characteristics of National SMART Grant recipients.\nrelatively more important as EFC increased. At the zero EFC level, the average Pell Grant amount was slightly larger than the average National SMART Grant amount, while at the top EFC level (3,000 or more), the average Pell Grant amount was low relative to the average National SMART Grant amount ($760 vs. $3,300). See Appendix Table D-12 for more detail. Students with a zero EFC (i.e., the lowest income level) received 44 percent of the Pell Grant dollars awarded in 2007-08 and 31 percent of the National SMART Grant dollars (Figure 20). In both cases, these were slightly larger shares than in 2006-07. Figure 21 shows the distribution of National SMART Grant recipients by field of study. About three-quarters majored in one of three fields of study in 2007-08: life sciences (40 percent), engineering (21 percent), or computer science (15 percent). The pattern was similar in 2006-07. Public four-year institutions awarded more than two-thirds of the National SMART Grants in each category except in computer science and critical foreign languages (Figure 22). See Appendix Table D-13 for more detail.\n\n\nheard of it and if they knew about the various requirements. Among those asked, only 7 percent had heard of the ACG program (Table 9). After the survey was administered, a match with the recipient file indicated that among students who were awarded an ACG, more than half (56 percent) had responded in the interview that they had not heard of the program. 26 Whether they were truly unaware of the type of grant they had received or simply did not immediately recognize the name when asked later in the academic year is unknown. Among students asked about awareness (i.e., those potentially eligible for an ACG), there was some variation by student characteristics. For example, blacks and Hispanics were somewhat more likely than whites to have heard of the program (9 and 8 percent vs. 6 percent). Considering type of institution, potentially eligible students at public four-year institutions were the most aware of ACGs (12 percent), and students in for-profit two-year institutions were the least aware (3 percent). Students who had heard of the ACG were asked the source of their information and could mention more than one source. High school counselors were mentioned least often (by 23 percent). College financial aid counselors and letters addressed to the recipient were more likely sources (35 percent in each case), but students most frequently cited hearing about the ACG some \"other way\" (41 percent).\n-60 -- Table 10. Among potentially eligible students who had heard of ACGs and SMART Grants, percentage who were aware of each requirement, by Table 10.- \nLike their ACG counterparts, students who had heard of the National SMART Grant program tended to be aware of its requirements. Students who were aware of the National SMART Grants were asked if they knew about each of the three requirements: enrolling full-time, majoring in an eligible field, and earning a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. The full-time enrollment requirement was the best known (by 80 percent of the students who were aware of the grant) ( Table 10). The other two requirements were known by 74 and 75 percent of these students, respectively. Understandably, those with National SMART Grant-eligible majors were more aware than those without such majors, especially about the major requirement.\npercent. The number of black Pell Grant recipients increased, but the percentage who chose a STEM major dropped from 13 to 10 percent."}, {"section_title": "Among Pell Grant recipients, younger students were the primary beneficiaries of the ACG program.", "text": "To be eligible for an ACG in 2007-08, students had to be recent high school graduates and in their first two years of college. As a result, about half of ACG students were age 18 or younger, and almost all of the rest were between age 19 and 23 ( Figure 6). In contrast, nearly half of the first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients who did not receive an ACG were age 24 or older (Appendix Table D -8). "}, {"section_title": "National SMART Grant Program Participation", "text": "In 2006-07, there were 1.2 million third-and fourth-year Pell Grant recipients, and the Department of Education initially estimated that 80,000 of them would be eligible for a National SMART Grant in 2006-07 (Table 5). As happened with the ACG program, actual participation has been lower than expected. To participate in the National SMART Grant program, institutions must be eligible to participate in the Pell Grant program and offer bachelor's degrees in one of the designated science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical language fields. In both 2006-07 and 2007-08, approximately 2,100 four-year institutions were eligible to participate in the Pell Grant program, and the number participating in the National SMART Grant program increased just slightly (from 1,425 to 1,478 institutions) (Appendix Table D-1 and U.S. Department of Education 2009, Appendix Table E-1). National SMART Grant participation rates in 2007-08 were highest at public four-year institutions (85 percent) and lowest at for-profit four-year institutions (43 percent) ( Figure 12). Participation rates at all types of institutions were about the same as in the previous year. Institutional participation rates reflect the fact that not all colleges offer National SMART Granteligible majors. However, most third-and fourth-year Pell Grant recipients (88 percent) were enrolled in an institution that awarded National SMART Grants (Appendix Table D-1). See Appendix Table D-1 for additional detail about institutional participation. The number of students receiving National SMART Grants has increased but only slightly. In 2006-07, 62,400 students received a National SMART Grant (Table 5). As with the ACG program, the discrepancy between estimated and actual participation may be attributable to a combination of factors, including a lack of awareness about the new programs, start-up difficulties common to all new programs, the difficulties that institutions had in identifying and verifying student eligibility, and the problem of accurately estimating the number of students meeting complex eligibility requirements with available data. The number of students receiving a National SMART Grant increased to 65,400 (5 percent) in 2007-08. Some of this 3,000 increase was due to expanded eligibility. About 1,800 National SMART grants were awarded to students in newly eligible fields of study (see Appendix A for new fields). As with the ACG program, receipt of a National SMART Grant is tied to Pell Grant eligibility. If the number of Pell Grant recipients changes, so does the pool of students potentially eligible for a National SMART Grant. The number of Pell Grants awarded to third-and fourth-year students at institutions participating in the SMART Grant program increased by 7 percent between 2006-07 and 2007-08, from 1.2 to 1.3 million students (Table 5). Had the number of National SMART Grants grown at the same rate in 2007-08 as the Pell Grant awards among third-and fourth-year students, 66,600 students would have received SMART Grant awards-an excess of 2,200 over the number actually awarded. In short, the increase in SMART Grant awards did not keep pace with the increase in Pell Grant awards. The majority of the 2007-08 National SMART Grant recipients were enrolled in public fouryear institutions (43,900). Another 17,000 were enrolled in private nonprofit four-year institutions, and the remaining 4,600 in for-profit four-year institutions.

Participation rates were well below the targets originally set by the Department of Education, and also below estimates of the numbers that might be eligible based on analysis of survey data from nationally representative samples of postsecondary students. However, eligibility criteria for the grant programs are very specific and impossible to match exactly to these data. Therefore, these estimates of eligibility are likely to overstate actual eligibility somewhat. Because these grants are limited to Pell Grant recipients, the number of students eligible for them is sensitive to changes in Pell Grant eligibility. Therefore, goals and assessments of program success might best be tied to the percentage of Pell Grant recipients who receive grants rather than simply the number of awards."}, {"section_title": "Program Participation", "text": "Participation during the first two years of the programs was as follows: 2003-04-suggest that approximately 282,000 first-year students would have been eligible for an ACG had the program existed at that time (Table G-1). This is likely an overestimate, however, because data on the courses that students took in high school includes only the number of courses in each field (English, mathematics, etc.), not the level. As the table indicates, barely half of the students meeting all of the other criteria also met the academic requirements. BPS data do not allow estimates of the number of second-year students who might have been eligible. Refers to a high school curriculum that includes at least four years of English; three years each of mathematics, science, and social studies; and one year of a language other than English. The levels of these courses are unknown. This definition corresponds as closely as possible to the requirements under the ED course-based high school program, but because it does not take into account the level of the courses, these percentages will be overestimates. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2003/04 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Studies (BPS:03/04). For the purposes of estimating the required appropriations at the start of the program, the Department estimated that 310,000 first-year students and 110,000 second-year students would receive ACGs in 2006-07. 35 The numbers of awards were expected to increase to 330,000 for first-year students and 130,000 for second-year students in 2007-08."}, {"section_title": "National SMART Grants", "text": "The 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), based on a nationally representative sample of all postsecondary students, can be used to estimate the number of students who would have been eligible for National SMART Grants.

The ACG and National SMART Grant programs specify the eligibility requirements for a student to apply for and receive an award under these programs for the 2006-07 award year. These Interim Final Regulations also identify the roles of institutions of higher education (institutions), state education agencies (SEAs), and local education agencies (LEAs) in administering the programs. [These Interim Final Regulations will be effective for the 2006-07 award year. The secretary is, however, soliciting comments on all aspects of these Interim Final Regulations and may, for the 2007-08 award year, amend and finalize them as appropriate in response to comments received. For regulations that would take effect for the 2008-09 award year and subsequent award years, the secretary intends to conduct negotiated rulemaking, as required under section 492 of the HEA.] The ACG and National SMART Grant program Interim Final Regulations duplicate those of the Federal Pell Grant program to the extent practicable given the similar nature of these programs. Like the Federal Pell Grant program, the ACG and National SMART Grant programs provide for direct grants from the federal government to students to assist in paying their college expenses. In addition, a student must be receiving a Federal Pell Grant to be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant. The secretary will be administering the ACG and National SMART Grant programs using the same delivery system that the secretary uses for the Federal Pell Grant program. The secretary expects that this coordination of administrative requirements will assist participating institutions in administering these programs, reduce the amount of additional institutional administrative burden and paperwork, and simplify the process for students to apply for assistance under these programs."}]
