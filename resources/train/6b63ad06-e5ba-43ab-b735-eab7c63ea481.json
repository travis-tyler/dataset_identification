[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long neuropathological accumulation phase before the onset of dementia. Such AD neuropathological deposition between neurons impairs the synaptic communication, resulting in networks disorganization. Our study aimed to explore the evolution patterns of gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) along AD continuum. Based on the AT(N) (i.e., Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration) pathological classification system, we classified subjects into four groups using cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (A) and phosphorylated tau protein 181 (T). We identified 101 subjects with normal AD biomarkers (A-T-), 40 subjects with Alzheimer's pathologic change (A + T\u2212), 101 subjects with biological AD (A + T+) and 91 AD with dementia (demented subjects with A + T+). We used four regions of interest to anchor default mode network (DMN, medial temporal subsystem and midline core subsystem), salience network (SN) and executive control network (ECN). Finally, we used a multi-regression model-based linear-interaction analysis to assess the SCN changes. Along the disease progression, DMN and SN showed increased structural association at the early stage while decreased structural association at the late stage. Moreover, ECN showed progressively increased structural association as AD neuropathological profiles progress.

At the neuropathological level, AD neuropathological accumulation begins years before the onset of dementia (Villemagne et al., 2013) and develops in a specific temporal-ordered manner (Sperling et al., 2014) , with extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 plaques deposit appears the earliest and followed by intracellular phosphorylated tau deposition and downstream neurodegeneration events (Jack Jr. et al., 2013) . Hence, combining the pathological stages with the symptomatic diagnosis can help to assess AD continuum more accurately (Montal et al., 2018) .\nSpatially, AD neuropathological deposition around neurons impairs synaptic communication, resulting in neuronal networks disorganization (Myers et al., 2014) . As such, AD is regarded as a disconnection disease featuring intrinsic network disorganization (Delbeuck et al., 2003) . The most commonly affected brain regions in AD studies are the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and executive control network (ECN), which cooperate to maintain cognitive abilities including memory, and executive function (Zhu et al., 2016; Seeley et al., 2007) . Notably, recent studies also reported that the DMN consists of multiple, spatially dissociated but interactive subsystems, including the midline core subsystem (self-relevant decision-making) and medial temporal subsystem (episodic memory) (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Uddin et al., 2009) been associated with cognitive dysfunction in AD. Therefore, brain network analysis could be an effective method to study AD neuropathology and explore further cognitive changes.\nBrain networks can be constructed based on similarity in GM structure between brain areas, which was named as the gray matter (GM) structural covariance network (SCN) (Mechelli et al., 2005; Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013a; Tijms et al., 2012) . Based on prior studies, the biological meaning of SCN may link to coordinated GM growth during development (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013a) , functional co-activation (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013b) , axonal connectivity (Essen, 1997; Gong et al., 2012a) and genetic factors (Chen et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2009; Alexander et al., 2012) . Brain areas that are highly correlated in size are always part of systems that subserving specific behavioral or cognitive functions (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013a; Zielinski et al., 2010) . For example, areas involved in memory showed GM volume covariance (Bohbot et al., 2007) . In AD, SCN showed disorganization which correlates with cognitive dysfunction (Dicks et al., 2018; Tijms BM Kate et al., 2016) . Specifically, Spreng et al. demonstrated decreased SCN in DMN in AD patients (Spreng and Turner, 2013) . Another SCN study showed that early AD patients had decreased structural association within the DMN while increased structural association in the SN and ECN (Montembeault et al., 2016) . These results indicate the trend of decreased structural association in DMN while increased structural association in ECN and SN in AD patients. However, few studies considered the AD neuropathological stages. This may lead to inaccurate results considering the temporal-ordered neuropathological propagation along the network.\nTo address this gap, the current study aimed to explore the trajectory of SCN changes along the pathophysiological continuum of AD. Combining the neuropathological hallmarks and symptomatic status, we classified the subjects into four groups to reflect the disease progression along the AD continuum. According to the evidence that AD network highly linked to its neuropathological state (Seeley et al., 2009; Knobloch and Mansuy, 2008) , we hypothesized that DMN tends to show a decreased structural association while the ECN and SN tend to show an increased structural association as AD progresses."}, {"section_title": "Methods and materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging and initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http:// adni.loni.usc.edu).

These regions anchor the default mode network (DMN, medial temporal subsystem), DMN (midline core subsystem), salience network (SN) and executive control network (ECN) respectively. To achieve SCN t-maps, we performed the general linear analysis on modulated GM images. Specifically, we extracted the GM volume from a 4-mm radius sphere (Montembeault et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2017) around those coordinates on modulated images. Then, we performed four separate correlation analysis by entering the GM volumes of each ROI as a regressor and the total intracranial volume, gender, age, and education as covariates. Before statistical correction, we performed Fisher's Z transformation. For each group, we performed specific contrasts to identify voxels expressing a positive correlation with each ROI.

Li, et al. NeuroImage: Clinical 23 (2019) 101828 SN, subjects at the early and late stage of AD successively showed increased and decreased structural association. As for ECN, subjects with abnormal CSF showed progressively increased structural association as AD neuropathological profiles progress. Our results suggest the dynamic trajectory of AD progression based on GM SCN technique and provide support for the disconnection hypothesis underlying AD neuropathological progression. These results are partially in line with previous studies which reported the DMN, SN (Supekar et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010) and the ECN changes (Weiler et al., 2014; Agosta et al., 2012) in AD by using the functional Brier et al., 2012; Luo X Qiu et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2016) or white matter connectivity analysis (Garces et al., 2014) . The possible mechanism is the high metabolic load in DMN (Buckner et al., 2005) and pathogenic molecules spread via synaptic connections (Zhou et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2015; Klunk et al., 2004; Molinuevo et al., 2014; Racine et al., 2014) . Although SCN could not be considered as a direct measure of connectivity, convergent studies reported the spatial overlap between intrinsic connectivity and structural covariance, thus demonstrating that these patterns mirror each other (Mechelli et al., 2005; Seeley et al., 2009; Segall et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011; Lerch et al., 2006) . This could be explained by the fact that synchronous neuronal firing promotes network based synaptogenesis (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Bi and Poo, 1999) . Accordingly, GM SCN could indicate the connectivity to some extent and provide additional insight into the network topographical organization (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013a; Bassett and Bullmore, 2009; Gong et al., 2012b) . Here, decreased correlations between brain regions may be suggestive of disconnectivity or localization degeneration while increased correlations may indicate overconnectivity or correlated gray matter loss in regions targeted by the same neurodegenerative process.\nRegarding the DMN, subjects at the early stage of AD showed increased structural association while decreased association in subjects at the late stage. This result is in line with previous studies which reported the early involvement of DMN in AD (Seeley et al., 2009; He et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2018a; Luo et al., 2018b; Gili et al., 2011) , and the progressive SCN DMN score decline through the AD progression (Spreng and Turner, 2013) . The mechanism may be the activity-dependent or metabolism-dependent pathology hypothesis: the DMN's continuous activity may lead to the early formation and diffusion of the AD neuropathological hallmarks (Palmqvist et al., 2017; Buckner et al., 2005; Buckner et al., 2009) . To be specific, we found an increased structural association between the EC and MTG in Group 2 and decreased structural association between EC and MTG as well as SFG in Group 3. Although no significant difference in Group 1, these subjects show the trend of an increased structural association involving the temporal and frontal regions. These changes could be described as a biphasic trajectory which was resulted by neuropathological progression. Moreover, such DMN changes always correlate with cognitive status and CSF level (Spreng and Turner, 2013; Allen et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010) . One SCN study found a decreased association between EC and prefrontal region in early AD patients and proposed it as the underlying reason for cognitive deficits (Montembeault et al., 2016) . Similarly, we also found that entorhinal-anchored peak clusters linked to the clinical scores in the subjects along the AD continuum. These findings highlighted the primary role of the entorhinal-anchored network (DMN medial temporal subsystem) in cognition maintenance. Conclusively, we proposed that DMN showed a structural hyperconnectivity at the early stage and then hypoconnectivity as AD progresses; furthermore, structural connectivity changes may indicate the cognition decline.\nSN is in charge of diverse homeostatically relevant internal and external stimuli, and always shows alternated function in AD patients. Here, we observed a dynamic structural association in this intrinsic network: increased structural association between FIC and precuneus in Group 1 subjects, while decreased structural association in ITG in Group 3 subjects. These results are in line with one functional study, which reported firstly increased (between CDR 0 and CDR 0.5) and then K. Li, et al. NeuroImage: Clinical 23 (2019) 101828 decreased correlation (at CDR 1) in SN in subjects along AD continuum (Brier et al., 2012) . Similarly, the work of Schultz AP also reported hyperconnectivity in SN in subjects with amyloid positive and then hypoconnectivity when neocortical tau levels are high (Schultz et al., 2017) . Conclusively, these findings suggested the dynamic changes in SN along AD neuropathological progression.\nRegarding the ECN, we observed a continuously increased association in Group 1 and Group 3 subjects. Based on the previous study, we speculated it as a compensatory network associated with cognitive reservation in AD patients (Grady et al., 2003; Stern, 2006) . Similar results can be found in another study which observed extensive SCN in ECN in AD patients with positive A\u03b2 status (Montembeault et al., 2016) . Our data extended this work by demonstrating a gradually increased structural association between DLPFC and frontal regions along the AD continuum. Here, stronger covariance strength between the seed and peak clusters indicated more intra-network connections to maintain cognition (Lin et al., 2016) . Our further correlation analysis showed that DLPFC-anchored peak cluster volumes correlated to the cognitive performance, suggesting a compensatory clinical meaning of the DLPFC-anchored ECN in AD continuum. By coincidence, SFG presents a significant decreased structural association with the EC in AD patients. This may partially support the hypothesis that AD features opposing connectivity in the DMN and ECN Agosta et al., 2012) .\nThe DMN, SN, and ECN showed interactive and dynamic changes with neuropathological progression. Regarding the increased structural association in DMN and SN at the early stage, possible explanations may be the compensatory processes in response to toxic effects of A\u03b2 (Supekar et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010; Matura et al., 2014) or the amyloid-induced inflammatory response (Montal et al., 2018) , especially in Group 1. Such inflammation would trigger changes in cell volume (neuronal and glia swelling) as well as number (glia recruitment and activation) at the early stages of AD pathology and lead to the GM volume changes (Fortea et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Vieitez et al., 2016) . As the neuropathological progression, the synergy between amyloid and tau pathologies starts (Schultz et al., 2017; Pascoal et al., 2017) , such compensation mechanism become gradually invalid, ending with the whole structural connectivity in chaos. This could be proved the progressively decreased cognition in Group 2 and Group 3, reflecting the progressive decompensation process.\nConclusively, our study suggested a dynamic SCN pattern changes along the temporal pathological accumulation. As the AD progresses, the DMN and SN showed phases of hyperconnectivity and then hypoconnectivity while ECN showed the potentially compensatory role of the ECN in AD patients."}, {"section_title": "Limitation", "text": "There were some limitations to this study. Firstly, our study is crosssectional research. Although we try to use the subjects with different disease stages to depict the AD continuum, a further longitudinal study should be done. Moreover, our SCN analysis was constructed in a group level which may not allow the assessment of the relationship between single-subject gray matter network measures with cognition.
