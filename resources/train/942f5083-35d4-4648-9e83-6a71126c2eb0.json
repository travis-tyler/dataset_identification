[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper attempts to clarify several lines of research on gender in development and education, inter-relating findings from studies on intuitive/informal knowledge with those from research on achievements and attitudes in science. It acknowledges the declining proportions of male teachers world-wide and examination successes which indicate a reversal of educational disadvantage from female to male; as well as the recent evidence on the effects of the gender of teachers upon student success. An empirical contribution to the literature is offered, drawing from the gender-related findings from research on children's cosmologies in China and New Zealand with 346 boys and 340 girls (of whom 119 boys and 121 girls participated in the current study). The investigation focused on children's concepts of the motion and shape of the Earth through observational astronomy and gave children opportunities to express their ideas in several modalities. The in-depth interviews allowed children to share their meanings and gender differences became apparent (e.g. girls' superior ability to visually represent their cosmologies and boys' greater awareness of gravity). However, these differences were not universal across genders or cultures and marked similarities were apparent both in the content of children's responses and in their reasoning processes. By comparing boy/girl cosmological concept categories and by tracking their developmental trends by age, statistical evidence revealed the extent of the similarities within and across these diverse cultures. The findings reinforce those from the authors' knowledge restructuring and cultural mediation studies and provide support for the view that boys and girls have similar, holistic-rather-than-fragmented, cosmologies which have features in common across cultures and ethnic groups. "}, {"section_title": "Gender controversies continue", "text": "Gender 1 continues to be an important issue for researchers and teachers alike. It can easily be contentious as evidenced by the storm of controversy which followed the pronouncements of Lawrence Summers when, in January 2005 (then as President of Harvard University), he voiced the view 'that men outperform women in maths and sciences because of biological difference, and discrimination is no longer a career barrier for female academics' (Goldenberg, 2005) . Amongst the reactions was a ten-page feature article in Time magazine (7.3.05) written by Amanda Ripley ('Who says a woman can't be Einstein?') taking Summers to task for his 'provocative statements'.\nSome of the research relating to Ripley's observations is considered later in this paper, but at the outset we can say that such contentious debate underlines our need to know whether boys' and girls' scientific ideas (whether learned as everyday knowledge or through formal schooling), and their dispositions to pursue science, differ markedly, if at all. Despite limited and conflicting evidence from the literature, our own experience as teachers and researchers had certainly led us to identify gender as a potential factor in concept acquisition, an empirical study of which we report as part of this article. It is important, however, to recognise that several different lines of research are intertwined in the arguments about gender as it relates to development and education. This paper endeavours to clarify the links between them, thereby contextualising the empirical contribution we offer. Firstly, we consider what has been recently revealed in the research literature about the differences between the developing brains of boys and girls from brain scanning technology, for the emerging patterns help (a) to make sense of the accumulated and somewhat contradictory experimental evidence on children's mental capabilities; (b) to scotch simplistic assertions about biological deficits; while (c) suggesting that differences in scientific understandings between male and female children might indeed be anticipated.\nSecondly therefore, we examine whether any gender differences are apparent in the development of children's understanding of commonly encountered phenomena in their pre-school and school years (in what children acquire by way of general knowledge). That learning has the potential to relate to the scientific ideas they are taught in schools, either directly (in which case there might be conflicts with ideas prevailing in their local ethnic groups and communities), or indirectly through the influences of role models and expectations that are sometimes held differently for boys and girls. This paper presents evidence, using data from the field of children's cosmologies, that gender does not play an important part in such basic thinking.\nBoys' and girls' development and intuitive understandings are similar. This is important since:\nThirdly, significantly changed patterns of achievement in formal school learning have nevertheless taken place among boys and girls over recent decades, and these tell us about world-wide cultural change and improved professional expectations (and, arguably, account for what teachers have been able to do through more equitable instruction). We review the extent to which girls have overtaken boys in regard to science achievements and the gender differences apparent in interests and attitudes to science in school.\nFourthly, however, we take into account the very recent research into how the gender of teachers relates to pupil achievement, arguing its significance in relation to the growing gender imbalance amongst the numbers of schoolteachers (world-wide). There is now strong quantitative data to show that teacher gender does influence school students' learning and therefore we should be concerned about the diminishing numbers of male teachers."}, {"section_title": "Gender research: developing brains", "text": "The wide range of research raised by Ripley (2005) includes:\n(a) neurological studies where, with advancing technologies, brain differences between men and women are known to be greater than previously understood, some of them affecting behaviour in unexpected ways. Women's brains are now known to be better interlinked with more parts involved in specific tasks, men's thinking taking place in more focused areas. Brain-imaging techniques by Giedd, Blumenthal, Jeffries, Rajapakse, Vaituzis, Liu, Berry, Tobin, Nelson and Castellanos (1999) reveal that different anatomical regions of the brain mature differentially in childhood, and typically by several years, e.g. favouring earlier development in girls for those areas which handle verbal fluency, handwriting and face recognition; favouring earlier development in boys for those which handle spatial and mechanical reasoning and visual targeting.\nThis can be compared with pre-brain imagery research by, for example, Bradshaw & Nettleton, 1983 , and the conflicting findings between Annett, 1985; Casey, 1995; Siegel, 2000 (d) sociological research on scientific career patterns where leading researchers stress that 'biological factors would not play a role unless they interacted with social conditions' (see Xie & Shauman, 2003) .\nTwo further areas of research can also be highlighted:\n(i) The relationship between motor development, language ability, and cognitive development has been found to be mediated by gender (see Kershner & Chyczij, 1992) . This is critical to the multi-modal methodology used in the research reported later;\n(ii) The reports of manifestly higher rates of mental and learning disabilities in males (see De\nCourten-Myers, 1999) should not be ignored; they underline how intertwined the nature/nurture influences can be. And there is evidence that much research remains unpublished because it reports gender similarity as opposed to gender difference in a literary climate which is sensitised to the latter. Hence \"\u2026there is no research literature of gender similarities, only a research literature of gender differences\" (Richardson, 1991, p. 273) .\nTaken together, all of these branches of investigation suggest that there are strong grounds for anticipating gender-related patterns in children engaged in tasks designed to show their grasp of basic scientific concepts; concepts which they acquire (in a variety of complex ways) from their families and teachers. If the brains of maturing boys and girls are so detectably different, and children's later, educational achievements have changed -more accurately, have been changedrelative to each other so much (as indicated below) we might expect conceptual differences between genders to be revealed. In the long run, insights might be provided into the factors influencing any gender mediation, to the benefit of boys and girls in all cultures alike.\nCommentary is first required however about the wider context of various socio-cultural factors and how these relate to student outcomes and teaching input."}, {"section_title": "The gender of teachers", "text": "Firstly, with regard to the numbers of teachers in both New Zealand and China, concern has been raised as the proportion of male teachers has declined dramatically, particularly in primary schools. Recent statistics for the gender of primary teachers, internationally, are fairly striking. In 2003 only about 7% of primary teachers in Scotland were male (see Scottish Executive, 2005) .\nSimilarly, in the USA, in 1995-96, only 16% of primary teachers were male (see National Education Association, 1997); and by 1999 that had declined to only 13% (see Livingstone, 2004) .\nThe situation in China is similar and longstanding. According to Zhao Wei, Director of the Students' Affairs Division at Shenyang Normal University (where teachers receive their professional preparation): \"We have more female students than male ones. That's the way it's always been; a ratio of about 7:3\": and some provinces have even lower percentages of male teachers (see Zhang, 2005) . While in New Zealand men make up only 18% of primary teachers (see New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2003) . OECD figures show an international trend of declining male primary school teachers confirming the alarming statistics from other sources which depict a trend which shows no sign of abating. According to Livingstone (2004) \"\u2026the average across 23 OECD countries for which data were available was 23 percent\" (p. 2). Before we consider teacher gender effects, it is important to comment upon student success rates."}, {"section_title": "Gender patterns in achievement", "text": "Turning first to comparative studies of school student achievement, gender differences in scientific literacy were compared in the international surveys recently carried out by the OECD Summary, there were no systematic differences between the performances of males and females among the 29 OECD countries involved in PISA. \"In the minority of countries where gender differences exist, they are small\" (OECD, 2003) . A closer examination indicates that there were more countries with scores for males higher than for females, but that in only 11 of these countries were these differences statistically significant. In two of the three countries where females scored higher than males, the differences were also statistically significant (see OECD, 2003) . However, evidence from statistical analyses of science results by gender in national, school leaving examinations in the UK, indicates that girls are surpassing boys in all areas (see for example Kelly, 1987; and Riddell, 2003 Gender Effects 8 girls and pupils of low socio-economic status being the main beneficiaries (see Croxford, Tinklin, Ducklin & Frame, 2001; Furlong & Cartmel, 1997; Powney, 1997) . Early indications confirm the continuing trend for girls to outperform boys at several levels in the sciences following the implementation, post 2000, of new National Qualifications (which incorporate the Highers as part of a multi-level system of certificates). The extent of the reversal has reached a point where schools in the UK and elsewhere now actively strive to find ways to help boys to study more effectively. In New Zealand, 'Approximately equal proportions of males and females score the top grades in School Certificate science, while in Sixth Form Certificate females outperform males in all science subjects. In Bursary biology and physics, females have a slight edge, while in chemistry males have traditionally outperformed females' (Pratt, 1999, p.2) . Pratt also argues, however, that culture is a major factor on gender mediation (particularly evident in exploring the differences within 'boys' or 'girls' when ethnicity -NZ European, Maori, Pacific Islanders -is considered). This concern for boys from ethnic minorities is echoed in a recent review of student outcomes (see New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2006); and New Zealand school leaving statistics which show that in 2005 more than half of Maori boys left school with no qualifications (see Bishop, 2007) . There is other evidence in China and New Zealand that, given equality of opportunity, girls frequently excelled boys in all subject areas including the traditional domains of male \"superiority\" such as maths and physics. For example, in New Zealand, there was equal participation by boys and girls (by merit in mathematics and physics) in the Winter Schools of Astronomy at University of Canterbury. Similar trends have been evident in other countries; for example, Hacker (1986) , in Australia, found \"no evidence to support the claim that girls are disadvantaged in the science classroom\" (p. 69). This background of gender mediation by social change of such an order that, in a period of little more than 50 years, traditional gender roles and manifest (as opposed to latent) performances can be reversed, invites the question of why this has been possible, what factors are responsible, and could knowledge of these be used to bring about true gender equality, including extra resources for teaching boys -or, bearing Pratt's (1999) observations in mind, which boys are not reaching their potential?\nIf the altered pattern of achievement can be put down to changes in teachers and teaching, we must also consider a further complication however. Recently published research by Dee (2006;  forthcoming) presents new evidence which indicates that having a same-gender teacher influences educational outcomes. His research focused on a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of 13-14 year old school students in Grade 8 of the USA (corresponding to year 9, Key stage 3 in England and S2/S3 in Scotland) numbering some 25,000. A key feature of that National Education Longitudinal Study, base year 1988, was that for each student it also surveyed two of their subject teachers (their background and how they viewed the performance of the student; how the student viewed the subject). Thus Dee was able to statistically relate student achievement to the gender of their assigned teachers in a large sample of teenagers close to the age when the gender gaps in achievement seem to grow most rapidly. The results indicate that the gender interactions had statistically significant effects on a number of educational outcomes, including achievements, and were quite large. In science, social studies and English, the overall effect of having a woman teacher instead of a man raised girls' achievements by 4% of a standard deviation and lowered boys' achievements by about the same amount. To quote Dee (forthcoming):\nFor example, assignment to an opposite-gender teacher lowers student achievement by at least 0.042 standard deviations. This effect size implies that just one year with a male Baker (2006) has recently reported that although there has been very little research on boys' education in New Zealand there is substantial evidence of a gender gap in achievement scores of about 10% in favour of girls. Besides gender bias in the curriculum he found, \"How we teachpedagogy -is also not gender free. There has been a shift from closed, structured, information-dense learning activities, which boys did better at, to open-ended, experiential, reflective activities\u2026an example of the 'effeminized curriculum' (Baker, 2006;  www.boysforward.com).\nThe situation in England is similar where the Department of Education and Skills (2006) report a trend of boys falling behind girls as they get older leading to a gender gap of nearly 10% in favour of girls at GCSE level. As in New Zealand, gender is only one of several factors contributing to boys failing: demographics such as social class, background, and ethnic origin are all determining factors (see Warden, 2002) . However the groups at risk differ between cultures and "}, {"section_title": "Gender in relation to interests and attitudes", "text": "Gender effects are also apparent in the interests and attitudes to science displayed by school students. Where gender differentials have been detected amongst secondary school age students, it is apparent that topics which are seen as having relevance to their lifestyles and possible careers are considered to be more attractive, with girls being \"much more drawn to those [physics] themes that are perceived to have high social relevance, while boys are attracted to those themes that are perceived to have a high mechanical or practical relevance\" (Reid and Skryabina, 2003, p.533 ).\nThe particular applications in the 'applications-led' physics courses (which have been relatively successful in the Netherlands and in Scotland for 14 -16 year olds) have very different gender appeals, with consequences for the numbers who continue to study the subject and who seek to pursue scientific careers. Bell's research into exam performance shows that the differences in attitudes and prior experience translate into differential exam performances in 'declarative knowledge' (but not 'procedural knowledge'); favouring boys for content associated with mechanics and earth and space; favouring girls for human biology (Bell, 2001 ; and see also Dresel, Ziegler, Broome & Heller, 1998; Christidou, 2006) . These recent findings interestingly echo\nGardner's summary some 30 years ago: \"Sex is probably the single most important variable Gender Effects 12 related to pupils' attitudes to science\u2026 Although social forces are undoubtedly powerful, the possibility remains that there are innate cognitive differences between males and females which might influence attitudes and enrolment patterns\" (Gardner, 1975, pp. 22-24) . Ten years later the same writer considered that researchers internationally recognised that that gender was an important variable in quantitative aspects of science education and attitudes to science (Gardner 1985) . The qualitative features of interest in science have received attention with gender as a critical variable. For example, in their study of science student types in a study involving 5361 students age 12-16, H\u00e4ussler, Hoffman, Langeheine, Rost & Sievers (1998) were able to classify physics students into three main types: Type A students -with particular interest in physics and maths -tend to be boys; Type B students -who are interested in practical aspects of physics such as technology -tend to be both boys and girls; and Type C students -who are particularly interested in the application of physics to improving human life such as through medicine -tend to be girls (see H\u00e4ussler et al., 1998, pp. 234-235) ."}, {"section_title": "Gender and conceptual development: current debate on children's cosmologies", "text": "Turning now to children's intuitive understandings of common scientific phenomena, we consider the domain of children's cosmologies. This area has long attracted the attention of science educators and developmental psychologists because of the conflicts which children have to overcome as they mentally re-orient from a geocentric to a heliocentric perspective of the Earth-Sun-System. And of course there has been debate over whether or not it is possible or educationally sound to teach young children the scientific interpretation of the world; or whether children essentially have to navigate (what is for them uncharted waters in a new world) alone. For many decades, this debate has ignored inter-cultural and gender differences: \"the world\" was assumed to be where and with whom \"he\" grew up. Nevertheless researchers have endeavoured to Brewer (1992, 1994) , and Vosniadou, Skopeliti, & Ikospentaki (2004) .\nThese studies have been challenged by several groups of researchers who have found no evidence of children having holistic cosmologies, rather that children's concepts are inconsistent and their cosmological schemata disorganised and fragmented. In Blown and Bryce (2006) we have argued that the reason for these profound differences in interpretation is not to be found in children's responses alone, but rather in the research methodologies of the researchers; in particular interview technique and the use of researcher-selected models as props. This view has recently been supported by work by Agan and Sneider (2004) who also identified differences in interview methods as a critical difference between the traditional Piagetian-Socratic method originally exemplified by the work of Nussbaum and Novak (1976) ; and the more modern expository teaching approach exemplified by the work of Schoultz, S\u00e4lj\u00f6 and Wyndhamn (2001) . Contrary to the advice of Nussbaum and Novak, Schoultz et al. introduced children to the scientific concept of the Earth in the form of a globe at the outset and did not detect any alternative models. Similarly, we have argued, the use of a range of researcher-designed models of the Earth as props within the interview schedule is not conducive to children sharing their intuitive, cultural or scientific cosmologies. Nor are interview techniques that are too dependent on a single medium such as verbal language; or on media, such as drawing, which can be misinterpreted without three dimensional modelling by the child using clay (see Brewer, Herdrich & Vosniadou, 1987) ; Diakidoy, personal communication, 27 June, 2001) . Similarly, Samarapungavan, who studied the cosmologies of Indian children (see Samarapungavan & Vosniadou, 1988; Samarapungavan, Vosniadou & Brewer, 1996) reported that \"We have consistently found no gender effects in children's cosmologies\" (A. Samarapungavan, personal communication, 27 June, 2001 Sadler (1992) , in a study of 658 boys and 609 girls, aged 14-18, in USA, over a 4-year period (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) found that boys had greater understanding of astronomical concepts than girls. Similarly, Schoon (1989) , also in USA, found gender differences in his investigation of the astronomy and Earth science concepts of 619 males and 594 females, aged 11-18+, males having fewer misconceptions than females. Sneider and Pulos (1983) , compared 159 children, aged 9-14, of unspecified gender, from their own study in USA, with children from Israel (Nussbaum, 1979, 240 "}, {"section_title": "The empirical study", "text": "This rather complex pattern of findings and reports on the influence of gender on children's ideas and concept acquisition invites clarification by research. While it seems increasingly certain that particular school topics and teaching emphases do have differential effects upon males and females, our review of the literature shows that it is less clear whether ordinary 'common knowledge' is gender related. As part of the longitudinal, cross-cultural research on the astronomical concepts of children from two contrasting cultures, China and New Zealand (NZ), described in Bryce and Blown (2006) with N > 100 are rare (see Sadler, 1992 ) and cross-cultural, longitudinal studies with survey and control groups with n > 100 (as in these studies) are unreported. We chose to continue in the Piagetian research tradition while probing for the richest range of concepts from the youngest (a) To gain knowledge of the totality of an individual child's cosmology, something that Piaget, despite his great skill, did not do (see Oakes, 1947) , would require at least an hour of interview time using a sensitive instrument capable of being tuned interactively to children's responses reflective of intuitive, cultural and scientific conceptual levels.\n(b) To do this with large enough samples to counteract longitudinal losses and facilitate robust statistical analysis of ordinal data would entail aiming for n > 100 in all eight main groups summing to N > 800 overall. In the event, losses were greater than expected, so that although both Main Surveys (1993, 1994) had 127 and 113 children respectively, by the time of the Follow-up Surveys (1998 Surveys ( , 2000 the number of accessible children had reduced to 82 and 89 respectively, which determined that the number of children in the Control Groups would also be 82 and 89\nrespectively.

There were no statistically significant differences (at an alpha level of .05) between boys 2. Boys and girls follow similar trends in their cosmological development.\n3. The patterns of knowledge acquisition, cognitive development, and conceptual change, are similar for boys and girls across cultures and ethnic groups. These studies took place over a period of more than a decade with boys and girls from two diverse cultures in the expectation that there would be significant differences in children's cosmological concepts at all ages between cultures and possibly, though less certainly, between ethnicities, and boys and girls. In the event, the results have shown remarkable similarity at all three phases of conceptual organisation -intuitive, cultural and scientific -within and across cultures, ethnicities and genders. They have also shown that such differences as there are can only be revealed by a refined interviewing technique incorporating multimedia-multimodal procedures with triangulation of measurement to detect their fine texture. There is therefore good reason to believe that the results are not unique to Chinese and New Zealand children and that, were the same methods to be used to interview children in other cultures, a similar pattern of results would be obtained. Since it is apparent from the literature review that studies in this field using Piagetian interviews with boys and girls from differing cultures are not new, it seems reasonable to believe that there would have been similar differences in those groups but either they were not detected or because they were considered to be unimportant they were not reported. This raises three important questions. The first relates to differences in the literature on the apparent relevance of gender as a factor. The explanation that the current authors were specifically looking for gender effects, although true, is not sufficient. Nor is the full answer to be found in the interview technique which owes much to Piaget (1929 Piaget ( , 1930 ; Nussbaum and Novak (1976) ; Nussbaum (1979) ; and other researchers. It seems that the real answer lies in the way in which this research was approached as an anthropological-ethnological study involving adoption by the culture, and necessitating the allocation of adequate time -the major limitation of all Piagetian studies. By allowing time for children and teachers to accept the researcher not as a stranger or visitor but as a member of the culture of the kindergarten or school, it was possible for children to share their ideas in a way that they would never do with a stranger (for a variety of reasons). A younger child might simply be following the sound advice of all parents and teachers to be wary of strangers. An older child might fear ridicule by expressing inner thoughts that conflict with what they have been taught by parents or teachers. Even older children might be reluctant to be seen talking with an adult (any adult), one-to-one, because it isn't the done thing. The anthropological-ethnological researcher has to be aware of these difficulties and to overcome them, and the easiest way to do so is to spend time with the young people in other roles before trying to interview them. In the introduction much was said about the structure of the interview design and setting. What was not said, and what is of paramount importance, is that interviewers should not go in \"cold\" as visiting researchers and expect children to share their ideas. They won't. Not in great depth anyway. The researcher learned this very early in the 1 st NZ Survey. As a junior class teacher he had learned to play with children and several hours were spent just playing -especially at kindergarten -until he was accepted as someone who belonged and could be trusted so it would be alright to sit down and talk to him. Another simple idea learned from kindergarten teachers in New Zealand -and also later known to have been used by Hall (1883) in USA -was that of interviewing young children in the natural setting of the kindergarten with their friends running around and even coming over to see what was going on (without interrupting to any great degree -and without critically influencing validity). So that the young people felt at ease and were willing to share their deepest their initial concepts and cosmologies reflect this similarity. Cultural influences are there from the time a child is born, but they do not become significant until the child is old enough to listen with meaning and to talk fluently, by which time they attend kindergarten (at age 2 or 3 in China and New Zealand). Once at kindergarten any cultural influence from the home or other sources has to compete with the scientific world view of teachers, who regardless of culture, have to attend university or teachers college where they are taught by people who are unlikely to be bound by traditional cultural ideas. So from about age 3-years children in China and New Zealand who attend kindergarten (and the majority do) are exposed to a universal world view -that of sciencewhich over-rides -or at least sits alongside (and sometimes conflicts with) whatever they may learn from their local traditional culture. And by the time they attend school (at age 5 in New\nZealand, and age 7 in China) they are submerged in the world of science which is reflected in their The final question to be answered is the place of gender in these patterns of similarity despite cultural diversity. Here, the most significant factor is thought to be the way in which children in China and New Zealand are valued in gender-free ways. In China, because the one child policy de-emphasises gender. And in New Zealand, for a similar reason: although not compulsory, New\nZealanders prefer small families, so there is a high proportion of single child, and two-child families, and a strong tendency towards treating boys and girls equally. It is also significant that both countries are essentially egalitarian with a strong aversion to social class structures and the gender bias that adherence to such outdated feudal traditions entail. More work has to be done to ascertain whether or not the findings reported here are typical of other cultures and to identify the factors contributing to subtle differences in the abilities of boys and girls for the benefit of all children, regardless of culture, ethnicity or gender."}, {"section_title": "Implications for teacher training, teaching, and learning science", "text": "The main implications of these studies are that student teachers and in-service trained teachers who are planning to teach science either at primary (elementary) level or at secondary level should be taught astronomy and Earth science by specialists in the field who should introduce students to a wide range of astronomical experiences as a foundation for future teaching utilising the local environment. These experiences should include (a) multi-media approaches to teaching astronomy determining the North-South meridian line, local noon, and time by use of shadow sticks and elementary sundials, (e) night-time naked-eye observation of the heavens with the assistance of parents and local astronomers, (f) similar observations using telescopes supplied by local astronomers or educational resource centres, (g) field trips to astronomical observatories, planetariums, and science museums to view telescopes, the heavens, and if possible a Foucault pendulum (to give direct experience of the rotation of the Earth), (h) with children age 10 or older consider making Newtonian telescopes as an extension activity at school or in an extra-curricular club. In all cases all children should be involved, and in planning field trips, extra-curricular activities, and evening observation sessions, as many teacher colleagues and parents as possible should be involved (e.g., in supervising the observation of Jupiter, Saturn or Mars through a telescope).\nReturning to the relationships between common, intuitive scientific knowledge and formal learning in science at school, we can conclude (from this study) that the former seems not to be gender-related and (from literature reviewed at the start of this article) that the latter, particularly at secondary school levels, is gender-related (with clear indications that educational disadvantage has swung from female to male over recent years). We would argue that these are not incompatible\nfindings and underline what dedicated and determined professional teachers have achieved in modern times and what, from an evidence-based practice argument, they must turn to now.\nAssuming Dee's (2006;  forthcoming) research on teacher-gender effects is borne out in other cultures, it will be for increasing numbers of female teachers to find ways of countering the negative trend. What governments themselves might do to tackle the 'feminisation' of society in general and teaching in particular would seem intractable. "}]
