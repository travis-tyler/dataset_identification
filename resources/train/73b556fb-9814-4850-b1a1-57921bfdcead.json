The PET uptake values were also corrected by the LONI team for partial volume effect using the Geometric Transfer Matrix (GTM) approach. 23 The partial volume corrected standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from these regions, and several FreeSurfer-based reference regions were downloaded from the ADNI archive. Although the downloaded uptake values are intensity normalized (ie, SUVR), ADNI recommends users to conduct an additional intensity normalization with one of their FreeSurfer-defined reference regions. We selected the inferior cerebellar gray matter uptake reference region to reduce the influence of dorsal cerebellar off-target binding of flortaucipir.

Initially we had chosen a fixed cutoff threshold applied to the correlation matrices from all four groups to reduce the number of edges by eliminating those with low correlations. This caused the networks to have differing densities, which would make graph theory properties difficult to compare between networks. To address this issue, we determined for each individual network the highest cutoff for the SUVR correlation values where the network was fully connected (matched thresholds). All the graph metrics were reported at matched thresholds.\nMultiple measures were derived from these networks. One common approach is to decompose the networks into subunits known as modules or communities, which are sets of regions more densely connected with each other than with the rest of regions in the network. We used the Louvain algorithm 27 to detect network communities. We ran the Louvain algorithm with Gephi's default resolution value, which is set to 1. The same resolution was applied to all four networks. We found that this default resolution worked best in terms of unraveling the Braak staging in the community parcellation of tau networks by partitioning brain regions into pathologically meaningful communities. Selecting a higher resolution (finer partitioning), would divide the networks into a large number of small communities typically consisting of individual regions and their contralateral counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Connections between different communities occur through nodes", "text": "with high betweenness centrality (BC). High BC nodes can be thought of as regions that influence connections between different communities (bridging nodes). In the context of tau networks, high BC nodes may present regions that could facilitate the spread of tau across different communities. Other network measures included the weighted degree (WD), a measure of the number and strength of direct connections of each node (from 0.7 to 1), and the closeness centrality (CC), a measure of a node's centrality in the network, where a higher nodal CC indicates that a node is closer to all other nodes (less intermediate nodes). These centrality measures fall within two major categories, radial and medial measures. 28 Radial measures (eg, WD) assess connections that emanate from or terminate at a given node, whereas medial measures (eg\" BC) assess the number of walks (or pathways) that pass through a given node.

Figure 2D presents the box plots of the WDs in the four networks at matched thresholds. The median network WD value increased from CN to MCI, with the MCI-female network having the highest average WD (19 \u00b1 9) . At matched threshold, significant pairwise differences were detected between MCI and CN in both male (p = .003) and female (p < .001) participants as well as between the sexes in CN groups (p = .025) and MCI groups (p < .001).\nThe computed graph metrics (WD, CC, and BC) from the CN-men, CN-women, MCI-men, and MCI-women networks were compared against their null models (randomized versions of the original networks) to ensure that these graph metric values would not be explained on the basis of chance alone. 30, 31 We generated null models of each network using the Maslov-Sneppen rewiring algorithm. 30 The graph topological changes of tau-based networks in men occur later than those in women. It remains to be determined whether the MCI-male group will eventually (perhaps at a later AD stage) exhibit a dense network of brain-wide tau connections similar to that observed in the MCI-female network. For this study, we used standard centrality measures that were available in our software package. However, it is possible that tau spread would follow a diffusion process. Therefore, we consider using diffusion-based counterparts to closeness centrality and betweenness centrality in future studies, as it may offer novel insights into tau propagation pathways. The relationship between a node's centrality and its flortaucipir SUVR value is not straightforward. For instance, we (and others, eg, Buckley et al. 17 ) have observed high tau SUVR in the entorhinal cortex (also see Table 4 ), which is a region with relatively low centrality located at lower right corner of the network.\nMoreover, the PET network is obtained from population-based correlations (PET regional correlations across different subjects instead of time series). This means that each node within a network is associated with a single graph metric value (eg, WD) whereas the node's SUVR value varies across the subjects. Taken together, the associations between centrality measures and tau SUVR requires a more comprehensive analysis, which will be the objective of future work.\nThe sex-based differences in the tau network topology may indicate differences in anatomical and functional pathways and the strength of their associated connectivities that can contribute to sex-related vulnerability for AD. Previous studies have shown that women have structural 33 and functional 34 network characteristics that are different from those in men. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a modular organization of the brain function and structure, defined as the ability to segregate the brain connectivity patterns into distinct sub-networks. The modularity emerges early in life and refines during adolescence where the structural and functional modules become more segregated, presumably to develop the executive functioning performance in youth. 35 Measuring the diffusion-based structural connectome of children and adolescents, Ingalhalikar and colleagues 36 reported higher inter-modular structural connectivity in female than in male subjects. Using diffusion MRI data, a study by Tunc and colleagues 37 examined sex differences in the modularity of the structural connectome by implementing the Louvain algorithm, which was similar to our approach with tau networks. In their study, men showed significantly higher modularity than women, which corroborates with the modularity findings of our study with tau-PET networks. Moreover, a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity study with graph analysis by Zhang et al. 38 reported higher local efficiency and stronger clustering coefficient in men compared to women. These findings were in close agreement with Ingalhalikar's diffusion tensor imaging -based graph analysis, which found a significantly higher participation coefficient in women than in men. Low participation coefficient (nodes' preference to connect within their communities) and high clustering coefficient (nodes' tendency to cluster together) in men suggest that their functional/structural brain communities exhibit more segregation, whereas women have higher integration between these communities. Higher integration in women may favor a faster propagation of tau, leading to our observed higher (and Although sex difference in the brain connectome is present at young ages, the developmental trajectory of sex-based differences as related to aging and age-induced biological changes remains relatively unexplored. Compared to normal menopause, premature hormonal losses before menopause are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. 39 Although early postmenopausal women with cognitive complaints show evidence of altered (functional) brain connectivity, 40 the associations between hormonal-related changes in the overall (structural and functional) brain connectome and progression of tau in normal and pathological aging is not clearly understood.\nAlthough we currently do not have access to specific medical information to delineate hormonal changes in ADNI (female) participants, future studies should explore relationships between tau propagation and the hormonal milieu occurring after menopause, including age at menopause and any use of hormonal supplementation. The brain is a major target for circulating gonadal steroids, and the change in hormone levels after menopause appears to have implications for cognitive functioning. A number of clinical and preclinical studies have linked hormones and cognition, [41] [42] [43] and it has been hypothesized that menopause has detrimental effects on cognition that are over and above the expected effects of normal aging. Although the neuroprotective actions of hormones, such as estrogen, are related mainly to A production and clearance, some studies have shown that the phosphorylation sites in tau are influenced by hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. 44, 45 Studies of tau density and spread in the years after menopause could help clarify any potential effects of menopause on the sex differences seen in this study.\nWomen have a lifelong advantage in verbal memory, [46] [47] [48] [49] which is the most frequently used domain to diagnose AD. Women's superior verbal memory skills may be a form of cognitive reserve and explain why women show higher and more widespread tau burden than men at comparable cognitive stages. Our tau SUVR findings are informed by a previous investigation by Sundermann and colleagues 47 showing evidence of better verbal memory in woman with amnestic MCI than men, despite similar levels of temporal lobe hypometabolism. Moreover, their observed sex differences in verbal memory was most evident at low to moderate neurodegeneration (none to moderate hypometabolism) but declined among individuals at advanced neurodegeneration, suggesting that verbal memory may represent a female-specific form of cognitive reserve, which helps women to withstand higher pathological insult (eg, higher tau burden) before becoming symptomatic and crossing thresholds for diagnoses of AD.\nCurrently, relatively few ADNI AD subjects have tau scans. As the number of ADNI tau scans increases, future cross-sectional and longitudinal studies will include networks from other clinical diagnostic groups, including AD subjects, to determine whether the observed sex differences intensify over time and in AD.\nFuture studies should explore biological factors, such as differences in the timing of the menopause that may influence the sex-based differences in tau propagation. Such work could advance sex-specific riskmitigation strategies including hormonal therapies, preventive interventions, and cognitive remediation. Our data support the findings of sex differences in dementia risk and previous reports of sex differences in tau accumulation. We further hypothesize that sex-specific differences in brain's functional, neuroanatomical, and pathological organization may map into differences at neurobehavioral and cognitive level, thus explaining differences in the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders.
