By 2050, the number of elderly affected by AD is predicted to increase to 13.8 million, with health care costs increasing more than fivefold to $1.2 trillion, representing a significant public health burden to hospitals, patients, and their families (Alzheimer's Association, 2013) .\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health have recently highlighted the critical need for explicitly addressing male and female differences in clinical and biomedical research (Clayton & Collins, 2014; Collins & Tabak, 2014) . Sex plays a critical but only partially explored role in the etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of AD (Carter, Resnick, Mallampalli, & Kalbarczyk, 2012) . Better understanding these sex-specific differences and patterns would address an important barrier to more personalized health care for the growing elderly population (Ballard et al., 2011; Olgiati et al., 2013; Spies et al., 2013; Wei, Visweswaran, & Cooper, 2011) . Looking at several modalities simultaneously, however, requires bringing large neurodegenerative data sets together for analysis (Bateman et al., 2012; Kohane, Drazen, & Campion, 2012; Ogishima et al., 2013; Romero et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2011) . To our knowledge, the technology to handle \"big data\" for aging and dementia research and still characterize important male/female differences does not exist (Groves, Kayyali, Knott, & Van Kuiken, 2013; Khachaturian, Meranus, Kukull, & Khachaturian, 2013; Kohane et al., 2012) .\nWhile an exact description remains elusive, data analytics for clinical research characterizes information along three main dimensions: (1) volume refers to the increasingly massive amounts of data that must be organized, stored, and processed; (2) variety relates to the diverse formats that must be understood to quickly navigate complex information, and (3) velocity describes the rapid analytical needs in the clinical setting (Bourne, 2014; Khachaturian et al., 2013; Kohane et al., 2012; McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012) . There are major research efforts underway to improve the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of dementia and AD. Clinical, medical, and genetic factors have partly explained the risk of developing cognitive impairment, but more effective prediction requires an integrated assessment of these modalities (Ballard et al., 2011; Spies et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2011) . The purpose of this study was to (1) leverage informatics approaches to integrate large neurodegenerative data sets containing diverse data for males and females with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and/or Alzheimer's disease); and (2) analyze sex-specific differences in an unprecedented number of clinical, medical, and genetic factors and discuss their implications for the health of men and women."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "The population of cognitively impaired patients originated from three large clinical research data sets containing de-identified patient data relevant for the evaluation of cognitive impairment: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Alzheimer The NACC database was created using clinical and neuropathological research data from Alzheimer's Disease Centers throughout the United States, in collaboration with both the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, 2013) . The NACC database contains data from the Uniform Data Set and from 34 past and present Alzheimer's Disease Centers between 1984 and September 2013.\nThe ADNI was launched in 2003 by the NIA, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the FDA, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. Its primary goal has been to test for markers intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and improve the efficiency of clinical trials. Subjects from three protocols (ADNI, ADNI-GO, ADNI-2) have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, n.d.). ADNI data were downloaded on October 10, 2013."}, {"section_title": "Data collection, definition, and classification", "text": "An informatics data pipeline in the Python programming language was created to extract existing fields, derive relevant factors, and standardize raw neurodegenerative data from ADNI, CAMD, and NACC into a single population database. Patients were categorized as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia based on original baseline classifications, and patients with dementia were further subclassified as probable AD if documentation of a probable diagnosis was found. Relevant factors commonly associated with AD in the published literature were derived from health or medical history tables: age, sex, history of alcohol abuse, history of smoking (current or former), Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stroke (Ballard et al., 2011 ; Editors of The Lancet Neurology, 2010). A positive finding was defined as the presence of a relevant clinical term or abbreviation in the context of a prior diagnosis, medical history, or treatment for one of the aforementioned conditions. The APOE genotype was categorized as the presence or absence of any \u03b54 alleles from the appropriate subject characteristics or genetic results table. Positive obesity status was categorized as the presence of a body mass index (BMI) or calculated BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 using one of the following formulas: (1) (NOEIE Panel, 1998) . For unstructured data elements, automated extraction and classification using natural language processing techniques was followed by manual review and confirmation of all positive and negative findings."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Summary statistics were collected for continuous data as means with standard deviations (SD) and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), and for categorical data as frequencies and percentages. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare sex differences for continuous variables, while differences in the distribution of categorical variables (age group by sex, race/ethnic group by sex, characteristics by sex) were evaluated using chi-square tests.\nFor the patient subpopulation with dementia, the probability of documented probable AD was modeled with logistic regression using candidate predictor variables representing important clinical, demographic, medical, or genetic factors commonly associated with AD: age, sex, history of alcohol abuse, history of smoking, family history of dementia, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, stroke, abnormal MMSE (score < 27), obesity, and positive APOE \u03b54 status (Ballard et al., 2011; Carter et al., 2012 ; Editors of The Lancet Neurology, 2010; Sabia et al., 2014) .

Overall, 8,138 (33.5%) patients were classified with MCI and 16,132 (66.5%) with dementia, of which 12,505 (77.5%) had documentation of probable AD. Patients had a mean age of 73.3 \u00b1 9.5 years (median 74.0, IQR 67.0-80.0), with 19,696 (81.1%) over the age of 65.\nAs shown in Table 1 , women with cognitive impairment were older in age distribution as well as overall mean age compared to males (p < .001 for both). While nearly 88% of males were White, approximately 82% of females were White (2,282 or 17.9% of females were minorities). There were 2.2 times more females affected by dementia than MCI, and only 1.8 times more males affected by dementia than MCI. Compared to males, a larger fraction of females with dementia had documentation of probable AD (81.9% vs. 72.4%). There were a total of 1,676 (13.2%) reported female deaths in contrast to 2,223 (19.3%) males. A greater proportion of males with dementia than MCI died (23.7% vs. 11.3%), and similarly more females with dementia died (15.8% vs. 7.5%).

The fraction of demented males with a family history of dementia and abnormal baseline MMSE was 6.4 and 52.1 percentage points higher respectively than those with MCI (Table 2) .

Similarly for females with dementia, the fraction of those with a family history of dementia and abnormal MMSE was 3.7 and 56.8 percentage points higher respectively than their MCI counterparts. Finally, females with dementia had a percentage difference in hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking that was lower by 10.6, 4.5, and 13.1 points respectively compared to females with MCI.\nComparing factors between males and females showed similar patterns for MCI and dementia, although the relative magnitudes differed. For MCI, a larger fraction of males had a history of alcohol abuse (4.5 percentage points higher), hypercholesterolemia (4.3 points), and smoking (9.7 points) than females.

Controlling for sex and other factors, history of alcohol abuse decreased odds by 0.702 (p < .005), while stroke decreased probable AD odds by 0.413 (p < .001). In contrast, a positive family history of dementia increased odds of probable AD 1.272 times, and positive APOE \u03b54 increased odds by 2.194 (p < .001 for all). No significant associations were detected for smoking history, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension (p > .05 for all)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study shows that informatics tools are capable of meeting \"big\" data needs as well as addressing important NIH requirements and initiatives to clearly distinguish differences between males and females in aging and dementia research. To our knowledge, this study is one of the largest integrated modality analyses of sex-specific patterns and differences in cognitively impaired individuals to date (Hannawi & Smirnakis, 2013; Khachaturian et al., 2013) .\nThe results suggest several sex-specific differences associated with the level of cognitive function. For both MCI and dementia, males had a consistently larger proportional history of alcohol use and smoking than females, although intrasex differences were relatively small. While earlier studies have identified potential links with cognitive impairment, the full impact of these modifiable behavioral factors remains to be characterized (Beydoun et al., 2013; Edge, 2010) . Interestingly, for both males and females, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were more common in patients with MCI than dementia, and a larger fraction of deaths in the dementia population occurred in patients without probable AD than with probable AD. While this may suggest an inverse relationship between some medical conditions and the severity of cognitive impairment, it may also possibly be due to survivorship bias. These findings highlight the complex relationships between different sex-related factors and comorbidities in a large population of cognitively impaired individuals (Beydoun et al., 2013; Carter et al., 2012) .\nSeveral models for AD and dementia have investigated the impact of sex along with a variety of other factors (Bateman et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2013; Petersen, 2010; Spies et al., 2013) . Consistent with prior studies, our regression analysis found several factors associated with higher odds of documented probable AD, including increasing age, positive family history, abnormal MMSE, and positive APOE \u03b54 results (Alzheimer's Association, 2013; Ballard et al., 2011; Bateman et al., 2012; Beydoun et al., 2013) . According to our analysis, females were 1.5 times more likely to have a documented diagnosis of probable AD than males, further highlighting potential sex differences associated with dementia and AD. The association of alcohol use with lower odds of probable AD may seem counterintuitive, but some studies have supported a potentially protective sex-specific effect of alcohol on cognitive decline (Sabia et al., 2014) . Finally, our study highlights another potential application of these analyses: identifying risk factors that anticipate provider behavior (i.e., their likelihood of documenting a probable AD diagnosis). Because the gold standard for AD diagnosis is biopsy during autopsy, a clinical diagnosis is currently the only way a patient may possibly know if they have AD instead of another cause of dementia such as Lewy bodies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or vascular dementia (Karantzoulis & Galvin, 2011) . As health information technology enables more accurate data to be collected and documented, the ability to predict physician behavior may be just as important to patient care as the diagnoses themselves (Jha, 2011; Jha et al., 2009; Morrison, Fernando, Kalra, Cresswell, & Sheikh, 2013; Ronquillo, 2012) . For example, electronic medical record and population health data could be used to create sophisticated clinical decision support tools to help physicians rapidly identify optimal treatments targeted to the unique clinical situation of each male and female patient being assessed for Alzheimer's disease at the point of care (Jha, 2011; Kohane et al., 2012) . Our study had several limitations. First, the results may not be generalizable, given the focus on research patients in clinical studies of dementia emphasizing Alzheimer's disease. As a result, there is the potential for selection bias as well as underreporting of certain factors (e.g., deaths) in this particular population. However, we believe the study breadth and depth provide insight into relevant sex-related differences for an important patient population. Second, several important modalities were not available for all three data sets at the time of this writing; specifically, the inclusion of imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers would have significantly enhanced the analysis and are planned for future studies. Finally, the use of de-identified data sets means a potential concern for missing or overlapping data and an inability to recheck or reconfirm previously collected data. However, our study focused on reliable data sources (ADNI, NACC, CAMD) and accepted informatics methods for extracting information from existing results, and it is unlikely any issues would have substantially changed our conclusions (Ronquillo, Li, & Lester, 2012) . As the era of big data for clinical research moves forward, powerful analytics tools that can handle imperfect and large \"realworld\" data sets, quickly assess important clinical patterns, and identify relevant sex-specific differences will play a central role in providing individualized care for the aging patient population (Ohno-Machado, 2014; Ronquillo, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, sex-specific differences in dementia are well established, and our study builds on this previous work by performing a sex-stratified analysis with diverse medical, clinical, and genetic factors of unprecedented scale and scope by leveraging data analytics and informatics approaches. We found that several significant factors fell along sex-specific lines and were possibly associated with different levels of cognitive impairment. Future studies can extend our informatics approaches to larger data sets and further drive health innovation and discovery for the aging population. As research efforts further intensify for age-related conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, we have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the increasing availability of data, sophisticated informatics tools, and public readiness to solve critical challenges facing health care today."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the CAMD.
