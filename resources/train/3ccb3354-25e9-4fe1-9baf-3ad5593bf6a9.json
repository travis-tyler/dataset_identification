[{"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": "The SY 2011-12 Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe file provides a directory of all schools that provide free public elementary and secondary education and characteristics of each school, including mailing address, location information, and geographic codes. The school universe file contains both categorical variables such as operational status and school type that describe the school as well as aggregated demographic variables such as counts of students attending the school by grade, race ethnicity and gender and the number of teachers. The school universe serves as a basis for all information that EDFacts collects for programs offices at the school level. NCES and other educational researchers use the school universe in developing sampling frames for many NCES surveys such as the National Assessment of Education Progress or the Schools and Staffing Survey. The school universe data are also useful to (1) chief officers of state education agencies, (2) policymakers in the executive and legislative branches of federal and state governments, (3) education policy and public policy researchers, (4) the press, and (5) citizens interested in information about public schools. The remainder of this document contains a user's guide and four appendixes.

Methodology and Technical Notes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Data Collection and Editing Procedures", "text": "The EDFacts data collection system is the primary collection tool for the CCD. NCES' CCD team works collaboratively with the EDFacts team to develop and monitor the CCD nonfiscal collection. Coordinators from State Education Agencies (SEAs) submit the CCD data at different levels (school, agency, and state) to the EDFacts submission system. Prior to submitting CCD files to EDFacts, SEAs must collect and compile information from their respective Local Education Agencies (LEAs) via established administrative records systems within their state or jurisdiction. Once SEAs complete their submissions, CCD survey analysts review and verify the CCD for quality assurance. CCD survey analysts routinely verify data through SEA coordinators and do not contact LEAs or individual schools to verify data except in unusual circumstances. In some cases, CCD survey staff use SEAs', LEAs', or schools' public web sites to verify data. After performing edit and consistency checks, CCD analysts work cooperatively with SEA coordinators to resolve inconsistencies or possible errors. Editing procedures are described in more detail later in this section. For the purposes of data submissions to EDFacts/CCD, the definition of a school is an institution that provides educational services and: \u2022 has one or more grade groups (prekindergarten through 12) or is ungraded; \u2022 has one or more teachers; \u2022 is located in one or more buildings; \u2022 has assigned administrator(s); \u2022 receives public funds as its primary support, and \u2022 is operated by an education agency. The CCD school definition recognizes that this organization may encompass several locations but must have a single contact point, which is the mailing address entered on the CCD school record. There may be situations in which schools serve students on a part time basis and those students may be counted at the school where he or she receives education for the majority of the time; these schools are included in CCD but may show few or no students relative to the number of teachers counted at the school. There are also schools included in the directory in which students are served remotely where the school providing instruction is located in a different location than where the student resides; sometimes this is called distance learning, cyber learning, or virtual learning by the SEA or LEA. Additionally, charter school and schools run by SEAs are included in the scope of CCD even if they are not operated by a school district or LEA; these schools usually have a separate entity that serves as the authorizer for the school. States report data throughout the year to the EDFacts collection system through multiple file groups that include related variables. NCES and EDFacts request that SEAs submit data on a reporting schedule at different dates throughout the year; there is wide variation on how well SEAs are able to comply with the requested schedule due to varying resource and data system constraints among SEAs and the LEAs within the SEA. SEAs may also submit revisions to their data for up to three years after the opening of the collection for a given school year. The requested reporting schedule for the SY 2011-12 collection cycle is summarized in table 1. The specifications for these data files are available online at http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html. SY 2011-12 EDFacts collection of CCD submissions opened in January 2011. NCES extracted data from EDFacts between January 3, 2012 and February 20, 2013. CCD survey staff processed these file groups on a flow basis, so the date of the extract for each file group and each state may vary depending on when SEAs completed their submission for each file group. Once a file group was edited and verified for a particular state, CCD survey staff did not continue to incorporate late reports or updates unless these late reports or updates resulted in a major change of the reported data. Late reports or updates from SEAs may be included in subsequent file releases. NCES applies multiple types of editing procedures to ensure data quality. For example NCES performs an extensive matching procedure on the directory of schools to the directory from the prior year to ensure that the coverage of schools included in the directory is complete and accurate. NCES reviews the categorical variables for schools and changes in operating statuses to ensure that these meet with the business rules and data definitions established for reporting school data. Beginning with SY 2009-10 NCES implemented a revised editing methodology that more accurately identified school and LEA data that were likely to have errors. This methodology was initially applied to key data items such as school and school district enrollment, grade 12 enrollment, and free and reduced price lunch variables and related ratios such as pupil/teacher ratio, percent of enrollment from grade 12, and percent of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch. In the past data items were only compared to the reported data from the prior year for each school or LEA. The revised methodology used available data from multiple prior years and was applied to both the reported data items and related ratios. Specifically, an average variation over the prior 4 years was computed based on the differences between each year and the other 3 years. Then, the average variation between the target year and the four preceding years was computed based on the differences between target year and each of the 4 prior years. The average variation for the target year was compared to the average variation among the prior years; cases with large differences were flagged as potential errors. Additionally, a requirement was added that in order for an item to be identified as a potential error, both the count and a related ratio must be identified as potential errors. For example, for total student membership to be flagged as a potential error, both total membership and a related ratio, such as pupil/teacher ratio, must be flagged. At multiple points throughout the collection CCD survey staff contact EDFacts and CCD coordinators within each SEA and provide them targeted feedback about their data submissions. NCES asks state coordinators to address any data that appear to be in error or are anomalies in the data. Most often SEAs will submit corrected data or explain why the data are accurate. If an SEA provide no correction or adequate explanations for data anomalies, NCES may provide a logical correction to a data value (for example, replaced a reported value with the sum of detail component values) or suppress the data. For example, if a state reported enrollment of 12 th grade students that was substantially larger than the enrollment of 11 th grade students in the previous year, and the state could not explain the discrepancy or correct the data, NCES would suppress the reported number of 12 th grade students. NCES also applied additional edits across the school, LEA, and state-level data to reduce data anomalies and ensure consistency among the levels of data. For example, for a given LEA the teacher FTE counts at the school level may have summed to more than what was reported at the LEA level. If the SEA was unable to verify that this was accurate, explain the discrepancy, or resubmit a corrected data, NCES edited the FTE data at the school level to match the data at the LEA level by proportionally adjusting the counts. The EDFacts collection system accepted blank responses in SY 2011-12 reports and did not require that states distinguish among missing, not applicable, and \"zero\" values. NCES used statistical editing procedures to identify and edit responses as missing, not applicable, or zero, wherever appropriate with available information; however, it is possible that some blank responses were categorized incorrectly. For example, blank staff counts may have been categorized as missing when the actual count was zero. Appendix D, State Notes, identifies missing and not applicable data items for each state. Once CCD survey staff complete the collection and review of the CCD directory data, Census Bureau staff clean and standardize the reported physical location addresses for schools and LEAs and then assign geographic elements (latitude, longitude, locale, congressional district, and county) based on the school location address."}, {"section_title": "B. Sources of Error and Technical Details about the SY 2011-12 file", "text": "Nonsampling error. Nonsampling error is the error in an estimate arising at any stage in the survey from sources exclusive of sampling error. Nonsampling error includes nonresponse error, data processing or data entry errors, or reporting error because respondents misinterpret survey questions, do not follow survey instructions, or do not follow the item definitions correctly. State education policies may differ in such a way that does not allow them to map their data exactly to the CCD definitions. For example, some states issue several kinds of high school credentials, while other states issue a regular diploma to every student who meets requirements (which may also vary). Another source of nonsampling error may be variations in the reference period for the reported data. For example, CCD requests data for October 1 of each school year, but a state may report their information for another date because they were not able to capture the data for October 1. If specific discrepancies are known, these are provided in appendix D, State Notes. NCES attempts to minimize nonsampling error through the use of annual training of SEA coordinators, extensive quality reviews, and survey editing procedures. Universe Scope. The scope of the Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey includes all public schools providing education services to prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1-12, and ungraded students. In the SY 2011-12 CCD School Universe Survey file, there are 103,483 records-one for each public elementary and secondary school in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the four U.S. Island Areas, the DoDEA schools, and the BIE. Schools coded as being open in the SY 2010-11 file, but coded as closed in the SY 2011-12 file (2,194 schools), will be kept on the file for one year, and then removed (i.e., they do not appear in files for subsequent years). Closed schools are indicated by a value of '2' for the variable STATUS. Excluding closed schools, there are 101,289 schools on the 2011-12 file. Of the 101,289 schools, 91,183 are regular elementary and secondary, 2,118 are special education, 1,478 are vocational/technical, and 6,510 are other/alternative schools. For a count of all school types, including closed schools, see Table B-3. Both the school and agency files include type variables that make these distinctions. See Appendix C: Glossary for the complete typologies. Coverage error. Coverage error is a source of nonsampling error that occurs when the measured universe of schools and agencies varies from the actual target universe; for example, the same agency or school could be reported twice (i.e. overcoverage) or an agency or school could be omitted (i.e. undercoverage). To minimize coverage error CCD survey analysts conduct an extensive review of the schools submitted by SEAs by matching to the universe reported in the prior year and ensuring that, each school is only counted once and each school is accounted for with the appropriate operational status. Although longitudinal consistency is a key principle of the CCD, it is impossible for NCES to guarantee that state data coordinators follow CCD conventions regarding the deletion of closed schools or agencies and the addition of new ones. Errors may be more likely when there are cases of redistricting where the district boundaries change or if local education agencies merge or split or re-organize because these types of change make it more difficult to compare information for a given school or agency over time. The CCD asks states to report all free elementary/secondary public education in their state regardless of who administers the schools or districts. CCD coverage of traditional public schools and school districts is very complete (close to 100 percent). However, coverage of publicly funded education outside of traditional school districts has varying levels of coverage within different states and jurisdictions. Some states do not report schools that are administered by state organizations other than SEAs. Examples include charter schools authorized by an organization that is not a school district, schools sponsored by health and human services agencies within a state, and juvenile justice facilities. These schools may include schools for the deaf and blind, university lab schools, and other schools not covered by the authority of the SEA. In recent years EDFacts /CCD has increased efforts to work with other Department of Education offices as well as other federal agencies to use additional administrative data sources to identify schools that may be underreported by SEAs. Response. The DoDEA, BIE, and American Samoa did not report data for SY 2011-12; however, NCES used historical CCD information and more current information from public websites for these education agencies to minimally include the schools from these entities in the school universe directory. Item response is described in appendix B: Value Distribution, Field Frequencies, and Data Tables. This appendix lists the minimum, maximum, and mean value of each numeric variable as well as the total number of units and the number of units with missing data. Appendix B: Value Distribution also lists the frequency of responses by option for each of the categorical values. Handling of data items without a positive reported data value. All data elements are either completed by the state or have been filled with a \"0,\" \"-1,\" \"-2,\" \"-9,\" \"M,\" or \"N.\" \uf0b7 0 -There are no occurrences of this data element. A value was expected and measured, but there were no cases in the category. (For example, a high school having no 12 th graders would report 0.) \uf0b7 M (or -1 for numeric values) -Data are missing. A value was expected and none was measured. (For example, a school that has at least one 12 th grader but cannot measure the number of 12 th graders would report -1.) \uf0b7 N (or -2 for numeric values) -Data are not applicable. A value was neither expected nor measured. (For example, an elementary school would report -2 for 12 th graders.) \uf0b7 -9 -The submitted data item does not meet NCES data quality standards. This value would only occur with numeric values. \uf0b7 In addition schools that were not able to assign a geographic longitude/latitude were assigned a value of 0.000000 Note that starting with the SY 2002-03 CCD; all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate \"missing\" and a -2 to indicate \"not applicable.\" Previously, numeric fields contained an \"M\" for missing and an \"N\" for not applicable. Character fields continue to use \"M\" for missing and \"N\" for not applicable. Starting with SY 2009-10, the numeric fields contain a -9 to indicate that the reported data were suppressed because they do not meet NCES data quality standards. Since negative numeric values represent missing or nonapplicable data and not actual data values, users may want to recode these before performing data analysis. The following SAS code can be used to convert negative values to \"missing\" in the SAS data file: data new; set sc111a; array remove (*) _numeric_; do i = 1 to dim (remove); if remove (i) < 0 then remove (i) = .; end; drop i; run; BIE Schools. There are 10 operating schools that are reported by both the Bureau of Indian Education and state education agencies, leading to duplicate records on the data file. These schools are run by BIE, but they also receive federal funds or federally funded services through the state. To avoid double counting of schools or students, NCES created the BIES flag. This flag has a value of either '1' or '2'; a value of '1' indicates a school reported by a state that is also reported by BIE. All other schools, including all BIE schools, have a value of '2' in this field. Users trying to match NCES tabulations should exclude records with a flag set to '1' from their analysis. New York City Schools. New York City is shown in NCES reports as a single school district. However, \"New York City Public Schools\" is reported in CCD as a supervisory union comprising multiple \"geographic districts\" and an additional \"special schools\" district. To aggregate NYC school data to the supervisory union, researchers must select schools with a state ANSI code equal to 36 and a supervisory union ID (UNION) equal to 300. See table D-1 for a list of geographic districts associated with the New York City Public School district."}, {"section_title": "C. Detailed Information about File Variables", "text": "This section includes detailed information specific to each variable on the file. The code in parentheses before the variable description indicates the variable name, which is also referenced in appendix A, Record Layout. Counts exclude closed, inactive, or future schools (STATUS = 2, 6, or 7) and do not match counts in appendix B, Value Distribution, Field Frequencies, and Data Tables, which include all schools. Operational status codes are defined below. (LEANM) Name of Education Agency. Each record includes the name of the agency that operates the school. NCES reviewed any record filling the 60 characters assigned, and may have edited the agency name to improve readability (i.e., applied standard abbreviations). (SCHNAM) Name of School. Each record has a school name. NCES reviewed any record filling the 50 characters assigned, and may have edited the school name to improve readability (i.e., applied standard abbreviations). (MSTREE) Mailing Street. This field may contain a street address or a P.O. Box number. In addition, some mailing addresses consist solely of a city and state, indicated by an \"N\" in the street address field. If mailing street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank or missing, data from the corresponding location address fields were inserted. (MCITY) Mailing City. There may be some valid cases in which a school may be located in one city and have a mailing address in another city. (MSTATE) Mailing State (P.O. Abbreviation). Each record contains a mailing state. There are instances where a school that is part of one state's education system reports a mailing address in another state; these situations have been confirmed by the reporting state. A list of schools that have a mailing state code different from their ANSI state code is included at the end of this document (see table 3). (MZIP, MZIP4) Mailing ZIP Code +4. Each record displays a mailing ZIP Code in this field. The +4 may be left blank if it is unknown. (PHONE) Area Code + Telephone Number. If a valid phone number was not provided for a school for the 2011-12 school year, NCES researched prior year data files to determine if a valid phone number was reported for the school in a prior year. If a valid number was found in a prior year, this phone number was carried forward to the 2011-12 data file. (LSTREE) Location Street. If the location street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank, data from the corresponding mailing address fields were inserted. In some instances, SEAs did not report physical locations for the location street field, but rather reported Post Office boxes and other addresses that did not represent the location of a school. NCES sponsored research to determine the physical location (and latitude and longitude coordinates) for these types of location street reports. Missing or nonlocation addresses (e.g., Post Office box numbers) were resolved through several means, including telephone calls to individual schools. In addition to this research, if a valid location street was not provided for a school for SY 2011-12, NCES researched prior year data files to determine if a valid location street was reported for the school in a prior year. If a valid location street was found for a prior year, this value was carried forward to the 2011-12 data file. In SY 2007-08, CCD began editing the reported school type if it does not agree with the CCD definition. For example, if a school name indicated that it focused primarily on the needs of students with disabilities or if the state reported that at least 80 percent of the students enrolled in the school had special education individual education programs (IEPs), NCES reclassified the school as a special education school. (The number of students with IEPs was reported to EDFacts collection system at the school and LEA level, but the CCD only contained IEP data at the LEA level.) Similarly, if a school name suggested that it was a vocational or alternative school, NCES researched the school through different resources (e.g., school website or education association) or by calling the school to determine if the school should be reclassified as a vocational or alternative school. NCES asked CCD Coordinators to review these reclassifications, and if they provided evidence that a school met the CCD criteria for the originally reported type, the school type was not changed. (STATUS) Operational Status Code. Each record contains a status code to reflect the school's operational status for SY 2011-12. Valid responses include the following: 1 = School was operational at the time of the last report and is currently operational. 2 = School has closed since the time of the last report. 3 = School has been opened since the time of the last report. 4 = School was operational at the time of the last report but was not on the CCD list at that time. 5 = School was listed in previous year's CCD school universe as being affiliated with a different education agency. 6 = School is temporarily closed and may reopen within 3 years. 7 = School is scheduled to be operational within 2 years. 8 = School was closed on previous year's file but has reopened. Schools with an operational status code of \"2\" remain on the file for one year for historical purposes. Code \"6\" and \"7\" response options for the STATUS field were added to the CCD starting with the SY 2002-03 file. Code \"8\" response option for the STATUS field was added to the CCD starting with the SY 2005-06 file. (UNION) Supervisory Union Identification Number. This field was added for the SY 2011-12 collection. For supervisory union administrative centers and component agencies, this is a number assigned by the state to the union. Additionally, if the agency is a county superintendent, this is the ANSI county number. If no number was reported, the field will contain \"000.\" (ULOCAL) Urban-centric Locale Code. The locale code is an indication of a school's location relative to a populous area. Beginning with the SY 2006-07 CCD files, the locale code methodology was changed from a 1-digit code based on metropolitan statistical areas to a 2-digit code based on urban clusters. In order to distinguish the two methodologies, the older system of locale codes is referred to as \"metro-centric\" and the current system is referred to as \"urbancentric.\" The methodology used to assign locale codes is provided at the end of this section. ULOCAL is shown as not applicable (N) on the records of nonoperating (inactive, closed, or future) schools and agencies. The 12 urban-centric locale code categories are defined below. Locale codes are divided into four main locale types (city, suburb, town, and rural) and each of the four locale types has three subtypes (large, midsize, and small for city and suburb locale types and fringe, distant, and remote for town and rural locale types). 11 = City, Large: Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more. 12 = City, Midsize: Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000. (LATCOD) Latitude. Latitude is the north or south angular distance from the equator, with positive values going north and negative values going south. When combined with longitude, it reflects an estimation of where the school is physically situated on the street segment to which it was coded. Coordinate degrees, minutes, and seconds have been converted to, and are displayed in terms of, their decimal equivalent. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the equator, and the digits to the right of the decimal point represent the fraction of the degree carried out to six decimal places. For example, if a building's latitude is 30 degrees, 30 minutes north, then it is shown as 30.500000. Addresses that could not be found at the Census block level were assigned 00.000000. (LONCOD) Longitude. Longitude is the east or west angular distance from the prime meridian, with positive values going east and negative values going west. When combined with latitude, it reflects an estimation of where the school is physically situated on the street segment to which it was coded. Coordinate degrees, minutes, and seconds have been converted to, and are displayed in terms of, their decimal equivalent. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the prime meridian. The digits to the right of the decimal point represent the fraction of the next degree carried out to six decimal places. For example, if a building's longitude is 90 degrees, 15 minutes west, then it is shown as -90.250000. Addresses that could not be found at the Census block level were assigned 00.000000. (CONAME) County Name. This field was added to the school file starting in 2002-03. The values for this field are determined based on the reported location address. (CONUM) ANSI County Code. The values for this field are determined based on the reported location address. A small number of supervisory unions in New England states have an ANSI county code that differs from the county in which the school is physically located. (FTE) Full-Time-Equivalent Teachers. A school's count of full-time-equivalent teachers is collected to the nearest hundredth. Some schools may report teachers, but no pupils, while other schools may report pupils in membership but no teacher FTE. These are valid records indicating situations in which more than one school provides services to pupils, but the pupils are attributed to a single school to avoid double counting, or where a teacher provides services to pupils at multiple schools. An example of the former situation might be a vocational school whose pupil membership is attributed to the high school that sends its pupils to obtain vocational services. Because teacher counts are collected at all three levels of the CCD files (school, agency, and state), one data anomaly is that the sum of teacher counts aggregated from the lower level to the state level may exceed the sum of teacher counts from a higher level aggregated to the state level (i.e., school FTE data aggregated to the state level may exceed agency-level FTE data aggregated to the state or state-level reported data). Beginning with SY 2008-09, if the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state level reported on the school file exceeded the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state on the agency file or exceeded state file reports, teacher FTE may have been edited on one or more of the three levels. School-level FTE aggregated to the agency level is allowed to exceed agency-level FTE reports. (GSLO, GSHI) Low/High Grade Span Offered. The lowest and highest grades offered in each school was calculated by NCES using two types of information reported by states: (1) binary 'grade offered' flags that indicate whether a given grade (e.g., prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1) was offered by the school; and 2 Only states or jurisdictions other than the BIE can contain a value of \"1\" (\"Yes\") for this flag. (FRELCH) Free Lunch Eligible Students. This student count may be taken by a school at a different time than the membership count; therefore, free lunch and membership counts may not be comparable within a given school. In some states, a single school may provide the free lunch program for a cluster of schools; thus, the free lunch eligible count for the school providing services may over represent the school's total membership. To avoid identifying specific students as eligible for free lunch, the reported number may have been edited. (REDLCH) Reduced-Price Lunch Eligible Students. See preceding paragraph. (TOTFRL) Total Free and Reduced-Price Lunch Eligible Students. If not reported, this total field was calculated using reported free and reduced-price lunch detail. To avoid identifying specific students as eligible for free lunch, the reported number may have been edited. (RACECAT) Race/ethnicities category indicator. The data item RACECAT is a race/ethnicities category indicator that indicates whether the state reported student enrollment counts by five race/ethnicity categories or seven race/ethnicity categories. Prior to SY 2008-09, NCES asked states to report student enrollment counts by five racial/ethnic categories. In SY 2008-09 and SY 2009-10, NCES gave SEAs the option to choose between 5-category reporting and 7-category reporting for the SY 2008-09, five states reported their race/ethnicity data in the seven categories and in SY 2009-10, fourteen states reported data in the 7-category reporting. Since SY 2010-11, the SEAs were required to report race/ethnicity data in seven categories. All states and jurisdictions that responded to the EDFacts collection system reported data in the 7-category reporting. The data item RACECAT contains two values: In the current file, for the states that reported five race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=5), the variables related to the Asian race category include students who are Asian, Hawaiian Native, or Pacific Islander; for the states that reported seven race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=7), the variables related to the Asian race category include Asian students only. In appendix A, Record Layout, the race/ethnicity categories represented by the five and seven reporting categories are followed by a notation of \"(5)\" or \"(7),\" respectively. TITLEISTAT If the Title I variables are not reported, TITLEI and STITLI are populated with their prior year values and TITLE1STAT is kept as missing. Membership is the count of students enrolled on October 1st of the school year. CCD collects membership counts at three levels: school, agency, and state. The summed total of student membership reported by states at one level may often be different from what was reported at one or both of the other levels. In general, the total student membership on lower level file should be less than or equal to the total membership on higher level files. A common reason for these differences is that SEAs report aggregate counts of students at the school-level counting each student at the school the student attends the majority of the time; for SEA and LEA-level membership, SEAs report aggregate counts of students at the LEA or SEA that is financially responsible for the student. For example, a regular school district may not be able to provide services to students with special needs and may instead pay tuition for students to attend private schools that provide services to students with special needs. These students are then counted in the regular school district, but are not included in the membership counts for any of the schools in CCD school file. For states with membership discrepancies that exceed five percent of the lower level membership, CCD survey staff routinely follows up with SEAs and asks SEAs to verify the reported membership and provide explanations of the differences. In school year SY 2008-09, CCD began implementing editing procedures to correct for cross file inconsistencies on a case by case basis. If an SEA could not provide a plausible explanation for why there were inconsistencies across the SEA, LEA, and school files, CCD survey analysts applied cross file adjustments to student membership at one or more levels to ensure that the sum of the lower level membership does not exceed the sum of the higher level membership. Ungraded Students by Race/Ethnicity and by Sex. The classification of \"ungraded\" is not used for students in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, American Samoa, the Bureau of Indian Education, Department of Defense Education Activity, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands"}, {"section_title": "School Locale Code Methodology", "text": "Locale code is a geographic indicator that NCES has created for general description, sampling, and other statistical purposes. It is based upon the location of school buildings and, in some cases, may not reflect the entire attendance area or residences of enrolled students. The designation of each school's locale is based on its geographic location and population density. School locale codes are assigned by the Census Bureau from school addresses in the CCD files. Definitions of locale codes are contained in the \"Comments About the Data Fields\" section appearing earlier in this document. The urban-centric locale system is constructed from the same set of standard geographic concepts as the metro-centric system it replaces, but it prioritizes an urban approach that combines size and distance from an urbanized area. Locale types (city, suburb, town, and rural) and subtypes (large, midsize, and small for city and suburb locale types and fringe, distant, and remote for town and rural locale types) were assigned to all schools in the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Department of Defense dependents schools (domestic). Locale codes were not assigned for the Department of Defense dependents schools (overseas). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to evaluate the spatial relationships of the various thematic layers included in the locale criteria. Distances for town and rural locale types were based on straight-line or Euclidean distance. Although this simple geometric measure does not account for the presence or absence of road networks that may offer point-to-point drive time estimates, it is also unaffected by short-term changes to the transportation infrastructure that could cause significant fluctuations in those estimates. The basic unit for these distance indicators-2.5 miles-was borrowed from the Census Bureau's criterion for connecting densely settled non-contiguous territory to a qualifying core of an urbanized area or an urban cluster during the urban delineation process. Distances used to define locale subtypes are multiples of the basic distance unit of 2.5 miles (i.e., 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 miles for rural; 10 and 35 miles for towns). The U.S. Island Areas, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico were classified according to the proposed locale and subtype criteria that define the four locale types and three locale subtypes. Schools were spatially integrated with these territories based on school geocodes (i.e., their position was determined by each school's latitude and longitude). Third, the schools were assigned a locale and subtype based on their location (i.e., they received the same assignment given to the territory where they were located).  , the third and fourth characters indicate the file year (11 = SY 2011-12 CCD collection), and the fifth and sixth characters indicate the version number (1 = first version; A = released file). The \"SUPP\" suffix indicates that the numeric fields were tested against NCES data quality standards and that values failing to meet standards were replaced with a -9. At a later date, NCES may release revised SY 2011-12 provisional and final files and these will have incremental version numbers (e.g. the second revised file is labeled 2a. The record layout for the file is contained in appendix A, Record Layout."}, {"section_title": "E. Guidelines for Using the Flat ASCII Data File", "text": "When using the flat ASCII data file, care should be taken to label the identification number variables (e.g., NCESSCH) as character fields. This is necessary in order to retain the leading zero in many of the identification numbers. It is necessary to keep the leading zeroes when merging these data with other files. This can be accomplished in Excel by using the 'Import Wizard' to select the ID fields and set them as text fields. (*)Fields have two explicit decimal places, unless otherwise noted. The file contains data for the school year 2011-12 sorted by the NCES assigned school identification code (NCESSCH). Data presented in this release are available in two formats-SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and tabdelimited text file. Note that starting with the 2002-03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable. Previously, numeric fields contained an \"M\" to indicate missing and an \"N\" to indicate not applicable. Character fields continue to use \"M\" for missing and \"N\" for not applicable. Starting with the 2009-10 2a file, the numeric fields were tested against NCES data quality standards; a -9 value indicates that the data item did not meet those standards. 1 = School was operational at the time of the last report and is currently operational. 2 = School has closed since the time of the last report. 3 = School has been opened since the time of the last report. 4 = School was in existence, but not reported in a previous year's CCD school universe survey, and is now being added. 5 = School was listed in previous year's CCD school universe as being affiliated with a different education agency. 6 = School is temporarily closed and may reopen within three years. 7 = School is scheduled to be operational within two years. 8 = School was closed on a previous year's file but has reopened."}, {"section_title": "Variable", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "UNION AN Supervisory Union Identification Number for the school's agency:", "text": "For supervisory union administrative centers and component agencies, this is a number assigned by the state to the union.

A state or equivalent entity may comprise a single congressional district or similar representational area. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) provides the structure of numeric codes for representing congressional districts and similar areas defined for the various Congresses of the United States. The Congressional District Codes are two-digit numeric codes used to represent the congressional districts of each multi-district state of the United States. For example, the First Congressional District is identified as \"01,\" the Second Congressional District as \"02,\" etc. The Congressional District in a state with only a single representative elected \"at large\" is designated as \"00.\" In the 110th Congress, this applies to Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. For an entity with a nonvoting delegate-the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico (whose delegate is referred to as a \"resident commissioner\"), and the U.S. Virgin Islands-the representational area is designated as \"98.\" Those entities with no representation in the Congress-the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and the several U.S. minor outlying islands are designated as \"99.\" Although congressional district codes are unique within each state and equivalent entity, and for each Congress, the congressional districts in different states may have the same code. For example, the First Congressional District of Alabama and of Arizona are both coded \"01.\" Since the Common Core of Data (CCD) requires the identification of congressional districts in more than one state, the congressional district code is preceded by the ANSI State numeric code.
