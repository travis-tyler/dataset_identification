[{"section_title": "", "text": "A lzheimer disease (AD) is believed to have a long preclinical stage before apparent cognitive impairment. 1 This stage may last for decades and is characterized by the presence of asymptomatic brain pathology, primarily \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation. The accumulation can be detected by biomarkers in the form of decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b242 2 and increased uptake of A\u03b2 ligands visualized by positron emission tomography (PET). 3 The A\u03b2 biomarkers are important for drug development since they enable trials to be conducted in people with A\u03b2 accumulation in the symptomatic (tertiary prevention) or asymptomatic (secondary prevention) stage of the disease. In the absence of successful anti-A\u03b2 trials, it remains unknown at what stage anti-A\u03b2 treatment must be administered to be effective. One possibility is that the most effective approach would be to inhibit the initial accumulation of A\u03b2. If so, drug trials would need to be carried out in asymptomatic individuals who appear to lack amyloid accumulation but who are at high risk of developing it within a few years. Here we used longitudinal CSF A\u03b242 to model the development of A\u03b2 accumulation in cognitively healthy people. The indication of decline was defined as CSF A\u03b242 crossing the threshold of 192 ng/L, which corresponds to A\u03b2 positivity in imaging 4 and autopsy 5, 6 studies. It is often assumed that A\u03b2 biomarker changes occur before other biomarker changes in AD, 1 but some studies 7, 8 have suggested that other brain changes (especially tau related) may precede A\u03b2 accumulation. We therefore tested the hypothesis that baseline CSF A\u03b242, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, demographic factors, and cognitive scores could be used to identify people at risk for A\u03b2 accumulation as determined by low CSF A\u03b242 levels, within 3 years."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

We generated votes for each participant in a 5-fold crossvalidation procedure (the analysis was iterated 5 times, each time including 80% of the data in the training set and predicting the remaining 20%).

These participants were classified as nondecliners if the 4-to 5-year follow-up sample was negative (n = 9) and as decliners if both the 2-and 4-year follow-up samples were positive (n = 1). No participants had the potentially ambiguous combination of a negative 2-year sample and a positive 4-year sample; one person in the original data set had samples at baseline, 1 year (negative), and 6 years (positive) and was excluded from all analyses because his status at 3 years was ambiguous.

The results are presented as OOB in the Table and as ROC curves for continuous predictors in Figure 2 (receiver operating characteristic curves are not meaningful for dichotomous predictors). Baseline CSF A\u03b242 level was the strongest individual predictor of future decline (OOB accuracy, 79%; 95% CI, 70%-87%). The high diagnostic accuracy for baseline CSF A\u03b242 was in agreement with the distribution of baseline CSF A\u03b242 level in decliners and nondecliners ( Figure 1 and the Table) . The individual decision trees for CSF A\u03b242 favored splits at a level corresponding to the lower tertile of baseline CSF A\u03b242 (225 ng/L). Among the 12 participants with baseline CSF A\u03b242 levels less than 225 ng/L, 10 were decliners (positive predictive value, 83%). Among the 23 participants with baseline CSF A\u03b242 levels of 225 ng/L or more, 22 were nondecliners (negative predictive value, 96%).\nBaseline CSF P-tau levels also significantly predicted future decline (OOB accuracy, 68% [95% CI, 55%-81%]). The individual decision trees for CSF P-tau favored splits at CSF Ptau 25 ng/L, which was close to the upper tertile of baseline CSF P-tau (26 ng/L) and also close to a previously suggested cutoff for CSF P-tau to identify AD (23 ng/L, when analyzed at the same laboratory and with the same assays as in the ADNI study 25 ). Among the 10 participants with baseline CSF P-tau levels higher than 25 ng/L, 6 were decliners (positive predictive value, 60%).

Follow-up PET data during the study period were available for 6 CSF A\u03b242 decliners and 2 nondecliners; none became PET positive, and there was no change in the one participant with PET-positive findings."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main finding of this study was that it is possible to predict declining levels of CSF A\u03b242 in cognitively healthy individuals monitored for 3 years. Declining CSF A\u03b242 was defined as the CSF A\u03b242 level falling below the a priori-defined threshold of 192 ng/L. Baseline CSF A\u03b242 level was a strong predictor of declining CSF A\u03b242. Individuals with CSF A\u03b242 levels in the lower tertile of the reference range were very likely to become A\u03b2 positive during follow-up. The 192 ng/L cutoff was initially derived from a sample of patients with autopsyconfirmed AD dementia vs nonautopsy-confirmed controls. 5 This threshold, and corresponding thresholds used for A\u03b2 PET imaging, may be too stringent to detect very early pathology. The findings of our study suggest that a more liberal (higher) cutoff level could be explored in cognitively healthy controls. Previous studies 26 have described a large variability in CSF A\u03b242 levels among healthy controls, even for individuals who have CSF A\u03b242 levels above the normal cutoff value. Theoretically, this variability could be the result of a combination of factors, including differences in production and clearance of the A\u03b2 peptide. Thus, CSF A\u03b242 levels in the low normal range could be due to a physiologically low A\u03b2 production rate, which may not be associated with further decline. However, our finding contradicts this hypothesis and suggests that a low normal CSF A\u03b242 level is rarely a benign phenomenon since it is strongly associated with future CSF A\u03b242 decline. The finding agrees with previous results using A\u03b2 PET, in which cognitively healthy people who became A\u03b2 positive during follow-up had a higher baseline A\u03b2 signal than people who remained A\u03b2 negative, 27 which implies an association between A\u03b2 PET levels that are within the reference range and neurodegeneration. 28 The recent failures of anti-amyloid drug trials, such as the phase 3 trials of bapinuezumab 29 and solanezumab, 30 have been blamed partly on the fact that some of the participants did not have A\u03b2 accumulation. 31 In addition, the disease may be too advanced in patients with dementia for optimal intervention via an anti-amyloid mechanism since downstream effects of amyloid accumulation, especially tau pathology, may become self-propagating at some point. 32 This theory is b Out-of-bag accuracies (ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect accuracy) are from random forest analyses. Seven APOE \u03b52-positive participants had 1 APOE \u03b52 and 1 APOE \u03b53 allele. Three APOE \u03b54-positive participants had 1 APOE \u03b54 and 1 APOE \u03b53 allele and one individual had 1 APOE \u03b52 allele. For sex, APOE, and small hippocampus, the out-of-bag accuracy appears to be significant, but closer inspection of these models showed that they classified all cases (or all but 1 case) as nondecliners, and these accuracies therefore represent the frequency of nondecliners in the population.\nc Information was missing on 1 participant.\nsupported by some of the autopsy data from the AN1792 trial, 33 in which amyloid immunization may have removed amyloid plaques without affecting the course of the disease. Several new trials therefore use A\u03b2 biomarkers to verify that participants have amyloid accumulation, both for tertiary and secondary prevention, and/or focus on patients with less severe clinical disease. 34, 35 These results suggest that an even earlier prevention-before A\u03b2 biomarkers have reached the cutoff normally associated with widespread pathologycould also be an attractive approach since there are several problems associated with treatment when pathology is established. For example, successful prevention in people with established amyloid accumulation may be hampered by a large variability in the length of time that individuals have been exposed to the toxic effects of amyloid. Some people may have become amyloid positive very recently and others may have had amyloid depositions for years, putting them at higher risk for imminent spread of tau pathology and cognitive impairment. However, the benefits of primary prevention must be weighed against possible risks, costs, and the availability of early screening and intervention.\nThere has been discussion about whether A\u03b2 or neurodegeneration appears first during the course of AD. 7, 8, 27 Although the present study was not specifically aimed at answering this question, our results suggest that signs of A\u03b2 accumulation and signs of tau-related neurodegeneration may appear early in the disease process since a high baseline CSF P-tau level was also a significant predictor of future A\u03b2 level decline. Complicating analyses of preclinical A\u03b2 and neurodegeneration, brain A\u03b2 may have very early effects on neurodegeneration, even before A\u03b2 biomarkers become clearly positive. 36 The ADNI investigators 37 recently found that hippocampal atrophy rates started to accelerate at CSF A\u03b242 levels of approximately 220 ng/L, 37 which was about the same level of CSF A\u03b242 that was associated with a high risk of declining CSF A\u03b242 in the present study. Together, these findings suggest that the emergence of A\u03b2 accumulation and neurodegeneration is coupled even early (from a clinical perspective) in the disease process. Of course, these conclusions are based on currently available biomarker tools. For example, CSF A\u03b242 may lack sensitivity for the most toxic forms of brain amyloid.\nThis study has several limitations. The main limitation is the small sample size, especially of CSF A\u03b242 decliners, which restricts our power to identify significant predictors. The results therefore need to be confirmed in larger studies. Furthermore, the participants had a mean age of 76 years, and primary prevention of A\u03b2 accumulation should be explored in younger individuals given the long duration of preclinical amyloid accumulation.\n38,39 The study group included few APOE \u03b54 carriers since most elderly APOE \u03b54 carriers are CSF A\u03b242 positive at baseline. Thus, our results may not be generalizable to APOE \u03b54 carriers. Another possible limitation is the inclusion of individuals who were close to the cutoff level at baseline, which may lead to a bias by those crossing the threshold on the basis of random variation. However, the decliners decreased by a mean (SD) of 14.2% (5.9%) in CSF A\u03b242 levels from baseline to their last measurement, which clearly exceeded the intra-assay variability for CSF A\u03b242 (coefficient of variation, \u22646.5 12, 13 ). In contrast, although some participants who were classified as nondecliners had negative slopes, the mean (SD) change in the nondecliner group was within the intra-assay variability (\u22125.3% [9.5%] ). This argues against random variability having a major effect on the classification of the participants. The fact that individuals who were classified as decliners had both lower baseline values and steeper decline of CSF A\u03b242 levels than did those who were classified as nondecliners supports the idea that CSF A\u03b242 levels may have a sigmoidal trajectory, as previously suggested. 40 Our definition of decliners did not include people whose CSF A\u03b242 level decreased without reaching the cutoff value (192 ng/L) within 3 years. Although some of those individuals may be moving toward A\u03b2 accumulation, excluding them from the decliner group reflects possible procedures in future trials aimed at preventing A\u03b2 accumulation. We only analyzed hippocampal volume as a predictor of future CSF A\u03b242 level decline, but future studies may also explore other structures, including the precuneus, entorhinal, lateral temporal, and lateral parietal cortices. Likewise, several other cognitive tests could be explored. Recently, a composite score for secondary prevention AD trials was presented (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative StudyPreclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite). 41 However, the ADNI procedures allow only an approximation of this score, and the effects of baseline A\u03b2 level on the score were very mild in ADNI controls 41 ; therefore, we did not include the score in the present study. Finally, we could not confirm A\u03b2 accumulation with an independent technology. Few participants in this group underwent PET A\u03b2 imaging, and there was no evidence of PET A\u03b2 positivity in the CSF A\u03b242 decliners. This is difficult to interpret given the small number of people with PET imaging results available, but previous reports 42, 43 have suggested that CSF A\u03b242 levels may be reduced before PET A\u03b2 posi- The receiver operating characteristic curves were generated by cross-validated predictions from random forest models using different variables (biomarkers, demographics, and cognitive scores) to predict longitudinal CSF A\u03b242 level decline vs nondecline. The A\u03b242 and P-tau accuracies were significantly different from 50% (as measured by random forest out-of-bag error)."}]
