[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To examine the impact of state-and school district-level policies on the prevalence of physical education (PE) and recess in a nationally representative sample of US public elementary schools.\nDesign: Analyses from annual, nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys of school administrators in the United States. Results: The odds of schools having 150 min/wk of PE increased if they were located in states (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-5.7) or school districts (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3) having a law or policy requiring 150 min/wk of PE. Schools located in states with laws encouraging daily recess were significantly more likely to have 20 minutes of recess daily (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8). District policies were not significantly associated with schoollevel recess practices. Adequate PE time was inversely associated with recess and vice versa, suggesting that schools are substituting one form of physical activity for another rather than providing the recommended amount of both recess and PE.\nConclusion: By mandating PE or recess, policy makers can effectively increase school-based physical activity opportunities for youth."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T HE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Guidelines for Americans 1 recommend that schoolaged youth (ages 6-18 years) get 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily. Children spend the majority of their waking hours in school, thus schools are important locations to focus obesity prevention activities, such as increasing physical activity (PA) opportunities. 2 During the typical school day children have 3 potential opportunities for PA: (1) physical education (PE) classes, (2) recess, and (3) other unstructured physical activities such as PA breaks or before and after school activities.\nPhysical education class can increase daily PA levels of children 3 and more weekly hours of school-based PE have also been shown to encourage favorable PA behaviors in adulthood. 3 Physical activity has also been linked to positive influences on concentration, memory, classroom behavior, 4 and overall academic achievement. 5, 6 The national recommendation for school PEendorsed by the National Association of Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) 7 and the American Heart Association 8 -is that elementary school students be offered at least 150 min/wk of PE. However, fewer than 20% of third grade students at public elementary schools in the United States were offered this amount during the 2007-2008 school year.\nIt has been shown to be a good source of PA [10] [11] [12] and can account for up to half of the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA. 10 The unstructured nature of recess provides students discretionary time to be active while playing. Participating in recess is associated with teacher reports of better student classroom behavior, better focus, and less fidgeting among students. [13] [14] [15] [16] The NASPE recommends that all elementary school students be provided with at least 1 daily session of recess for a period of at least 20 minutes. 17 While only a few studies have examined the impact state-level policies have on the amount of time allocated to PE and/or PA during the school day, all show an increase in the number of weekly PE minutes after the passage of a state law. [18] [19] [20] However, implementation of state policy varied across the affected school districts 19, 20 and some schools cited competing time demands as a barrier to full implementation. 19 A limitation of these studies was that they examined individual states, did not account for additional policies at the school district level, and only focused on PE and/or PA without examining recess-related policies. We build on existing evidence by examining the impact of state-and school district-level policies on the prevalence of PE and recess in a nationally representative sample of US public elementary school; to our knowledge, this is the first study to do this. We focused on PE and recess because these are 2 primary opportunities for in-school PA time at the elementary level."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Our study collects information on food environments and PA in elementary school, as well as district-level policy data from corresponding school districts, and relevant state laws.

Public schools from all coterminous US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) were eligible for sampling. School weights adjusted for potential nonresponse bias by modeling every school's propensity to respond based on the following: student enrollment; school racial/ethnic composition; percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch; region; and urbanicity.

Wellness policies were gathered via Web site searches with telephone and mail follow-up, as necessary.

Response rates calculated using the American Association for Public Opinion Research method 2 34 -counting partial responses as complete-across the 3 years, were 54.6% (578 schools); 70.6% (748 schools); and 61.8% (641 schools), respectively.\nSurvey respondents were asked about the number of days per week and number of minutes for which each PE class was scheduled during a typical week for third-grade students. This information was combined to calculate the total minutes of PE weekly, and we calculated a dichotomous outcome variable according to the NASPE standard for 150 min/wk of PE (1) vs any amount less than 150 min/wk. Survey respondents were also asked to report on possible barriers to implementing or maintaining regular PE classes, each coded yes (1) or no (0), including the following: lack of necessary staff; inadequate indoor facilities/ equipment; inadequate outdoor facilities; competing demands for teaching other subject areas; physical education is not a high priority for district administrators; no state or district policies requiring PE; and financial constraints.\nRespondents were asked about scheduled recess during a typical week for third-grade students including the number of days per week, times per day, and total number of minutes per day of recess. This information was combined to create a dichotomous outcome of whether students were offered at least 20 minutes of recess daily for every day of the week (1) or not (0), corresponding to national recommendations for recess. At schools without regularly scheduled recess, respondents were asked to indicate which of the following reasons why not, each coded as yes (1) or no (0): inadequate resources (eg, staff, facilities); or competing time demands for academics. Multiple approaches were tried for constructing the outcome variables and dichotomization was the best fit for the data.\nTo control for relevant school-level characteristics, demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained. 21 We Variables included free or reduced-cost lunch, coded in tertiles (lowest tertile as the referent group); race/ ethnicity of the schools' students, coded in 4 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of majority black, majority Hispanic, diverse (no majority race), or majority white (referent group); and locale, coded as suburb, rural, township, or city (referent group).

Owing to the hierarchical nature of the data, 3-level Bernoulli logit models 35, 36 were used to examine the binary outcomes for recess and PE (described in the previous subsection), correctly adjusting the standard errors for the clustering of schools within districts and districts within states. Descriptive and regression analyses were weighted using school-level sampling weights. All data were prepared using the STATA/SE version 11 (StataCorp), analyzed using hierarchical linear model (HLM) 6.08 (Scientific Software International Inc), and used 2-sided tests with a significance level of .05.\nEach model included demographic covariates and relevant PE barriers or recess barriers, as appropriate. In addition, because schools sometimes substitute recess time for formal PE class time, we included the recess variable as a covariate in predicting PE outcomes and vice versa for the recess outcome. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the study sample. Approximately 70% of the schools in our sample offered at least 20 minutes of daily recess and 17.9% offered 150 min/wk of PE.

Results showed that state policies are associated with increased PE and recess time in elementary school. Having strong district-level PE laws was also associated with increased weekly PE minutes offered in schools. More importantly, although the federal wellness policy mandate did not require districts to address PE, 37 results show that having strong district-level PE policies increased the likelihood of schools having 150 min/wk or more of PE independent of the state having a strong PE law. We found Abbreviation: PE, physical education. a The sample size was 47 states, 690 districts, and 1761 schools for all models. Statistically significant differences at P\u03fd.05 are in bold. Regressions are weighted using school-based sampling weights. instances where districts adopted strong policies in states with weak or no policies (results not shown). We also found that the lack of necessary staff and the lack of PE as a district-level priority were barriers to having a greater number of weekly PE minutes. This finding coupled with results from a recent study showing that wellness policy provisions related to PA were weaker and less prominent than those related to nutrition 32 highlights the need and importance of educating district administrators about the benefits to youth of receiving an adequate amount of daily PA, as well as providing schools with the necessary resources to fully implement new policies.\nWe found that weak, but not strong, state-level recess laws were associated with schools having at least 20 minutes of daily recess. However, only 3 states' laws (Delaware, Nebraska, and Virginia) in our sample required daily recess and less than 2% of our school sample was located in these states, thus we have too few schools impacted by these laws to detect a significant effect. We also found no association between the number of weekly recess minutes offered by schools and district recess policies; however, it is important to note that the wellness and related policies compiled for this study were not required to address recess, so it may be that districts have other or informal policies that address recess time but that are outside the scope of this study.\nConsistent with previous research, 19 we found that a barrier to meeting the national criterion for 20 minutes of recess daily was competing time demands. Results of both models showed schools that had either 20 minutes of daily recess or 150 min/wk of PE were less likely to have the other, although those with longer school days were more likely to meet the NASPE requirements. This suggests that schools are substituting one form of PA for another rather than providing the recommended amount of both recess and PE. With many districts placing greater emphasis on academic achievement, schools may be sacrificing PA time in lieu of more classroom instruction. Schools may need to be better informed about the growing evidence of the positive relationship between PA and academics. [3] [4] [5] [6] 38 More research into this trade-off of schoolbased PA opportunities is warranted.\nWe also found that schools comprised primarily of racial and ethnic minority students as well as those containing the most socioeconomically disadvantaged students were less likely to offer at least 20 minutes of daily recess, with mixed racial and ethnic schools also receiving fewer weekly PE minutes. Latino and African American children have higher rates of being overweight or obese than their white counterparts, and the prevalence of obesity is significantly higher among low-vs highincome groups. 39 Lower-income youth also participate less in PA. 40 Existing evidence shows that students who are more physically active have lower body mass index scores than more sedentary youth, 38, 41 and that schoolbased PA has a positive effect on health outcomes and academic performance particularly among low-income and minority children. 5 Therefore, it is important to develop strategies to increase the number of minutes of recess offered specifically for these vulnerable populations most at risk to acquire the many health complications associated with obesity.\nThere are several limitations that should be noted in our study. First, the cross-sectional design limits causal interpretation. However, this study provides valuable insight into how state-level and district-level policies can have an impact on school-based PA opportunities. Second, our sample only examined public elementary schools. Not all state laws apply to private schools, and we did not have comparable district policies for private schools. Future research should examine private school policies and practices, as well as how state-level and school district-level policies affect both middle and high schools. Third, there is potential for response bias because we used self-report school administrator data. However, similar measures have previously been shown to be reliable and valid. 42 Fifth, data were unavailable for youth PA behavior during PE and recess (eg, percentage of time in MVPA), or weight outcomes such as body mass index. Future research should include these measures to better understand how these programs and related policies are associated with students' health outcomes. Sixth, state and district recess policies only captured provisions for daily recess and did not capture the amount of time required/ encouraged each day. We are compiling the daily recess time requirements starting with school year 2009-2010 and will be able to examine whether varying daily recess time requirements are associated with school recess practices. Seventh, PE and recess time are endogenous, which may bias the results, and cannot be adjusted using HLM. Eighth, we did not have sufficient statistical power using HLM to estimate the separate effects of state and district level policies requiring less than 150 min/wk of PE and those suggesting 150 min/wk of PE or more. Finally, states and districts may have noncodified or informal policies or guidance-related policies to PE time or recess not captured by this study. However, given that such informal policies would not carry the force of law, they were not compiled for this study.\nIn conclusion, given the amount of time youth spend in school and the importance of PA, our study provides important information for policy makers. Our results show that mandating only increased PE or recess time does not result in more overall PA as schools and/or districts appear to compensate for any increased PA in one area by decreasing other PA opportunities. To increase schoolbased PA, policy makers may need to mandate more of both PE and recess time. "}]
