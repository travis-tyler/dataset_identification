[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recently, unidentified human pneumonia has started from a local fresh seafood market in Wuhan, in December 2019. This emerging virus was later identified as coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 responsible on Coronavirus Disease 19 [1] [2] . It spreads to more than 216 countries all around the world causing a pandemic [3] . It is considered as the third major zoonotic human coronavirus outbreak of this century after the prominence of the two coronavirus pandemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4] [5] .\nDespite the fact that COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of April, the 8,844,171 confirmed cases with 465,460 confirmed deaths in a few months (December 8, 2019 to June 22, 2020) are terrifying.\nIndeed, this virus is highly contagious and the number of infected peoples can be doubled in less than seven days with a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2-2.7 [6] . Phylogenetic studies proved a complex coronaviruses evolutionary history originated from an ancient common ancestor (around 10,000 years ago) [8] . Indeed, these viruses present a high rate of mutation and recombination that enable great plasticity and high dynamic genome evolution. The mutation rate of coronaviruses varies from 1 /1,000 to 1 /10,000 nucleotides during the replication of RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) [9] . Also, Coronaviruses are known to use template switching Till now, scientists are trying to know how SARS-CoV-2 was emerged and infected Humans. Different hypotheses have been proposed. Recently, analysis of the whole genome of two viruses (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B (Sarbecovirus) of Betacoronavirus and demonstrated the existence of a novel coronavirus genetically closer to the bat SARS-like coronavirus bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933) [10] [11] .\nAnother research in [12] proved that SARS-CoV-2 has the highest similarity (96.3%) with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 all along the genome, using phylogenetic and similarity plot analysis. Other ones suggest that the human SARS-CoV-2, could also evaluate from yak coronaviruses [13] and also through recombination with pangolin coronaviruses [14] [15] .\nThe organism\"s genomic signature is a very important graphical representation that allows understanding of the intragenic variations [16] [17] [18] , especially for handling large genomic data. This assay is based on the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) derived from the chaos theory of Jeffrey et al. (1990) and it was considered as a mapping method of large genome sequences [19] . In this study, we try to identify the SARS-CoV-2 genetic origin using a combination of different DNA representation and signal processing tools. We compared full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to relevant viral genomes: sequences of the four Orthocoronavirinae genus, the 15th species included in the Betacoronavirus genus and also yak and pangolin coronaviruses. II [19] . This value is chosen according to previous research [16] [17] 19] . The proposed CGR steps are shown in the following Algorithm 1. The numerical genomic representation using coding methods is an important step to visualize and characterize the hidden information that can be contain in it, especially in this case where the nucleotide sequences do not have any continuously or homologous between them. Different coding techniques exist: the binary [20] , the structural bending trinucleotide (PNUC) [21] , the electron-ion interaction pseudo-potential (EIIP) mapping [22] , the FCGS [23] [24] [25] , and so on. In addition, several signal processing techniques were applied with success to detect the relationship between sequences and detect some biological repetitive sequences, and so on.\nIn this paper we use the Frequency Chaos Game Signal (FCGS) as a coding technique (first step) and\nthe Smoothed Discrete Fourier Transform (SDFT) and the Wavelet Transform as an analysis techniques (second step)."}, {"section_title": "Genomic signal representation", "text": "Nucleotide sequences are converted into a numerical sequence (1D signals) before processing from our database extracted from NCBI platform. Then, 1-D signals are generated by applying the FCGS order 2: FCGS 2 . This type of coding technique is based on the apparition\"s probability of two successive nucleotides in an entry sequence [23] [24] [25] . The probability (P 2_nuc ) of given L nucleotides in the sequence is as follows:\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (1) N 2_nuc represents the apparition number two successive nucleotides in the sequence and L represents the length in base pairs of the sequence. After that, in position (k), the oligomer (i), which consists of 2 nucleotides, is replaced by the corresponding occurrence probability:"}, {"section_title": "Smoothed Discrete Fourier Transform: SDFT", "text": "We choose SDFT, a space-scale analysis, to be applied on nucleotide signals which is based on:\n-Dividing the helitron signal [ ] into portions with an overlap .\n-Dividing each portion into frames by multiplication with a sliding window [ ]: "}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof", "text": "To ensure the best accurate smoothed spectrum, the Blackman window was chosen as window type. In addition we can follow the instantaneous frequencies evolution by considering the 2-D spectrogram representation resulting from the following mathematical equation:\nThe final obtained matrix contains the time-frequency information corresponding to the studied sequence. This is an efficient representation to visualize the evolution of periodicities along a nucleotide sequence."}, {"section_title": "Wavelet Transform", "text": "The time-frequency nucleotide image with three color channels (Red, Green, Blue) is the best way to visualize the different patterns that can differentiate the sequences. If the pixels luminance in nucleotide image changes between two images, we can determine the modified patterns. To reach this goal, we choose the wavelet transform as an analyzing technique which present the nucleotide signal into a nucleotide image. Our choice is based on the performance of the wavelet transform which have been especially used in data related to the biological domain [22, 24, [26] [27] .\nIn this paper, the complex Morlet wavelet (CWT) has been used as a wavelet type which is the best one in terms of time-frequency domains localization. The method's principle consists of decomposing a nucleotide signal into a sum of basic functions called wavelets. These wavelets are issued from the mother wavelet by expansion and translation operations. These wavelets analysis technique applied to a given signal takes into account both time and frequency variations. Unlike the mother wavelet that only has a time variation parameter expressed by the function \u03c8(t), the daughter wavelet depends on time (a) and scale parameters (b) and it is generated by the expression given by the following equations, where * indicates the conjugate complex and is the oscillation\"s number that must be greater than 5\n(admissibility condition). [28] [29] [30] :\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\nThe CWT of a DNA signal is a matrix which contains the continuous wavelet coefficients.\nThe DNA scalogram (2D) is a representation of the modulus | |.\nAfter obtaining the matrix of each sequence, for example SARS-COV-2 and RATG13, we develop a new algorithm which detects the nucleotide variation that exists between these sequences.\nThe new algorithm we have developed is based on computing the correlation value between two matrices corresponding to two different genomes with a variable window. The following figure (Fig.2) shows a flowchart methodology to extract similar nucleotide sequences in two genomes, example of SARS-COV-2 and betacoronavirus RATG13. The aim here is to find similar sequences and the modified nucleotides in two genomes by computing the correlation values and shifting one position to the next base pair if not equal to 1 until obtaining similar matrices.

Here, the idea is to characterize each genome independently of their length with a specific specter (1D signature) and spectrum (2D signature) which indicate the variation region if it exist between more of genomes. Exploring the latent periodicities of global genomes using SDFT method can play a key role in the homology detection between these viruses\" classes.\nFor more investigation, we visualize the sequences in 1D spectrum and 2D spectrogram representations by applying the SDFT to the FCGS2 signals. These representations reflect the time-frequency signatures of each sequence which may differentiate each genome or indicate the similarities between them by highlighting its periodicities. In this work, the \"Blackman\" window was chosen as window type and we consider as the frames length, with a shift index , for the sub-frames, we take , with . The major effect of windowing is guarantee the converting the frequency response discontinuities into transition bands between values on either side of the discontinuity. The spectral representation (1D) of different genomes and the 2-D spectrum representation are presented in Figure 6 and supplementary figure 2.\nThe superposed spectra presented in Figure 6 For more interpretation, we can use the Neighbor joining (NJ) clustering which is an alternative method for hierarchical cluster analysis [32] . Here, we can draw phylogenetic trees of the SARS-Cov-2 and other investigated viruses using the calculated spectra correlation values between SRS-Cov2 and other viruses (B to T) mentioned in \"supplementary figure 3\". The dendrogram in figure 7 was developed using the Past PAleontological Statistics program version 3.23 [33] . It shows the homology viruses degree to SARA-Cov2 generated from phylogenetic relationships using the spectra from SDFT method The combination of bioinformatics and signal processing tools applied to genetic sequences show that SARS-Cov-2 is highly related to RATG13 Betacoronavirus and Pangolin coronavirus isolate MP789 with 96% and 86% identity along the whole genome. This global result is similar to result obtained by BLAST platform. To highlight these results, we analyzed nucleotide modification positions of both viruses in comparison with SARS-Cov-2 genome. We developed a new algorithm based on the scalogram images resulting from wavelet transform applied to the genomic signal. Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "We can clearly see the great modification number in S gene which with 271 (7.09%) for RATG13 genome and 323 (8.45%) for Pangolin coronavirus genome. Comparing the scalogram images of S gene of SARS-Cov2 to RATG13 and Pangolin coronavirus genomes, we find that the homology changes depending on selected regions in this gene. For this reason, we adopted our analysis algorithm according to the region where the similarities in the alignment are strong (Table 3) . Between the nucleotide positions [1251-1600] pangolin sequence showed the lower nucleotide modification than RATG13. These result suggest a possible recombination event in the S gene. Our results of the comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and Cov-RATG13 along the genome, showed 1,173 nucleotide modifications dispatched as shown in the following figure 9 .\nThe minimum mutation ratio is for the nucleotide G that becomes C with 1.22% ratio, corresponding to numbers of 6 mutations. The minimum mutation ratio is for the nucleotide T that becomes C with 1.22% ratio. The global results are presented in the \"supplementary results\" file. Figure 9 : Dispatching of mutation between SARS-COV-2 and betacoronavirus RATG13 genomes ratios found using our methods\nOver all obtained results, signal processing tools highlight the high homology of SARS-Cov-2 and other betacoronavirus than other families and more precisely with Cov-RATG13 and Pangolin coronavirus isolate MP789 genomes. However, the Yak coronavirus strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 seems to be different [13] . These results show evolutionary evidence of the SARS-CoV-2-from Bat and Pangolin coronaviruses as a consequence of accumulation of mutations and also acquisition of new genomic region by recombination events.\nPrior scientists searched the evolutionary history of the Wuhan COVID-19 virus [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [34] [35] .\nThey discovered that three bat SARS-like coronaviruses, Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45\nand bat-SL-CoVZXC21, were closely related to SARS-Cov-2 [35] .\nNevertheless, it was not clear, till now, if the COVID-19 arose from a recombination event or no between those viruses [12] . Others scientists suggested possible genesis of COVID-19 virus through recombination between Bat [10] [11] and Pangolin coronaviruses [14] [15] "}, {"section_title": "Recombination analysis result", "text": "To confirm occurrence of recombination between RATG 13 and pangolin MP789 sequences, we assessed Simplot analysis. Figure 10 shows The used methods are an alignment free method, requesting only a sequence database and a bioinformatics and signal processing knowledges [16] [17] [18] . Those methods transformed every nucleotide sequence in numerical form. CGR technique has been used because it has a remarkable capacity to differentiate between genetic sequences belonging to different species [17] . Comparing to alignment- This study shows that based on genomic signatures representations, we can easily assess automatic homology identification between genomes and thus they allow rapid genomic characterization when we are compressed by time, such as this critical period during the outbreak of this novel viral. It permits to rapidly mobilize appropriate methods for diagnostic and medical care specific to the identified viruses.\nFurthermore, it\"s also crucial to the choice of appropriate preventive methods and contingency plans. In the future, alignment free methods can also be advanced and adapted to specific biological tasks and biologist needs in different fields."}]
