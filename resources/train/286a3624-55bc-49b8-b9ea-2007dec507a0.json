The ability to measure resilience is necessary to developing our understanding of what influences resilience. In this paper, we develop a new, two-dimensional quantitative measure of resilience using observed differences between expected and actual employment in a region following a shock and distinguish the response to the shock from random variation. We demonstrate one application of this metric to U.S. county-level employment data to compare county responses to the 2007-2009 national recession and discuss how different regions of the United States responded to the shock of the Great Recession in terms of resilience.

INTRODUCTION In light of the Great Recession and a spate of natural disasters, researchers are increasingly\ninterested in the causes of observable local variation in responses to these and other shocks. How regions respond to shocks reflects their relative economic resilience, a concept that has enjoyed increased attention in the academic literatures of economics, economic geography, and regional science. However, many researchers have indicated a need to formalize the concept of economic resilience in the literature. This has fueled ongoing discussion on how to define economic resilience and, given the respective definition, how to quantitatively measure resilience, a discussion we seek to contribute to with this paper.\nHistorically, the often-implicit goal of economic development has been to simultaneously encourage income growth while reducing volatility, two goals that some argue are often at odds with one another and are fundamentally different concepts (Spelman 2006; Chiang 2009; Lucas 1987; Quigley 1998). The concept of economic growth has historically been a central theme of macroeconomic research and has given rise to the sub-discipline of growth theory (Solow 1956; Romer 1990). Conversely, the causes and nature of economic volatility and stability, while encompassing a fairly deep literature, have enjoyed less attention than economic growth theory (Deller and Watson 2016; Wagner and Deller 1998). The causes of variation in the rate of growth and in a system's responses to shocks have also received relatively little attention but are central to the resilience discussion (Fingleton et al. 2012).\nThe structure of regional economies is changing, with a growing interconnectedness between regions and the larger global economy, making many regions more susceptible to external shocks than they have been historically. Understanding the varying ability of regional economies to survive disruptive events and persist in a world increasingly characterized by change and uncertainty seems vital to current discussion on how to guide and shape modern economic development strategies.\nDespite the growing literature concerning economic resilience, there is currently no single agreed-upon definition of regional economic resilience (Sensier, Bristow, and Healy 2016). A precise definition of economic resilience is important to avoid the term becoming a vacuous buzzword from overuse and ambiguity (Rose 2004). Also, a precise and consistent definition is important to measure well the concept (Bristow et al. 2016). In the next section we review different definitions of resilience in the academic literature and some methods used to measure it. We can advance, however, that most definitions of economic resilience relate to an economy's response to a shock, which can be economic, environmental, or political in nature.\nIn this article, we develop a quantitative resilience metric that builds on strategies used in existing efforts to measure resilience. We produce scores of relative regional resilience based on regionally specific shock response metrics (i.e. changes in employment). We create a two-dimensional measure which captures aspects of both the depth and duration of each region's response to the shock, as well as\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We take the additional step of adjusting our response measure by accounting for each region's underlying volatility to distinguish the response to the shock from random variation. We demonstrate the use of this resilience metric by applying it to U.S. county-level monthly employment data from 1990 to 2015 to capture the response of counties to the economic shock of the 2007-2009 national recession. The metric, however, allows for some customization and flexibility in its application, allowing researchers to adapt its use in the future to reflect the definition of resilience they want their results to reflect.\nIn the application we use within this paper, we calculate resilience based on total employment behavior during the months from a county's local peak, associated with the beginning of the shock response, to six months after the trough, to include both the magnitude of the impact of the recession locally and the beginning of recovery. The six month window is consistent with the post trough window employed by Han and Goetz (2015) and provides a consistent measure of how a county performed subsequent to their recession lows. We discuss potential alternative applications of this metric, namely how one could use the same calculation process on monthly employment change data to obtain a result that reflects recovery as a return to a pre-shock employment growth rate, rather than a return to an employment level based on the pre-shock growth path (i.e. the level of employment that would have been expected if the region had not deviated from its original growth path). Our measure provides a means of comparing the local impact of the recession in each county. We share the results of our application, compare them with results from previous studies on U.S. county resilience to the 2007-2009 recession, and examine spatial, structural and typological differences in how specific groups of counties responded to the Great Recession. I. RELATED LITERATURE Defining Economic Resilience\nOne general definition of resilience is \"the ability of something to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change\" (Merriam-Webster 2016). The application of resilience in theoretical and empirical regional economics research requires that such broad definitions be thoughtfully adapted and refined. This has motivated discussion in regional economics regarding what resilience is, how it relates to existing concepts in the field, how it can be measured, and what forces influence it. The existence of other closely related terms, like stability and robustness, further complicates this discussion. There is currently disagreement as to whether stability, robustness, and resilience should be treated separately or as fully interrelated concepts (Rose 2004; Han and Goetz 2015; Bruneau et al. 2003). The relationship of these terms and others to resilience requires greater clarification and agreement. While some have advocated for greater inclusion of adaptability in regional resilience (Pike et al. 2010; Christopherson et al. 2010; Simmie and Martin 2010; Pendall et al., 2010; Martin et al. 2015), others have criticized the use of\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Furthermore, arguments have been made for the inclusion of a political or societal dimension to incorporate the role of government and human agency in economic resilience (Bristow and Healy 2015 ; Davies 2011; Briguglio et al. 2009; Hassink 2010; Pike et al. 2010) and others debate whether shocks should also include chronic \"slow burn\" trends (Pendall et al. 2010; Foster 2007; Martin et al. 2015). For a more in-depth review of the academic discussion surrounding the concept of regional economic resilience, see Martin and Sunley (2015).\nIn an early definition of economic resilience, Rose (2004) describes economic resilience as \"the inherent and adaptive responses to disasters that enable individuals and communities to avoid potential losses.\" In the last decade, additional definitions of economic resilience have been proposed, but there is lack of consensus over which definition is most appropriate for describing regional economic resilience (Bristow and Healy 2015; Martin and Sunley 2015). Currently, definitions of economic resilience are related to one of three types of resilience: engineering resilience, ecological resilience, and adaptive (or evolutionary) resilience (Martin 2012). Not all definitions of resilience fit cleanly into one of these categories, but the differences between these groups of definitions represent several central points of tension in the regional economic resilience discussion.\nEngineering resilience refers to a system's ability to resist a shock and return or recover to its preshock state, implying that recovery is a return to the pre-shock development path (Holling 1973; Martin and Sunley 2015). Using this framework, Foster (2007) defines economic resilience as the ability of an economy to return to its previous growth path after the shock. Similarly, Hill et al. (2008) describes economic resilience as \"the ability of a region...to recover successfully from shocks to its economy that either throw it off its growth path or have the potential to throw it off its growth path.\" These definitions, in line with assumptions in mainstream economics, suggest that there exists some equilibrium state and that underlying forces will push an economy back toward equilibrium if it shifts out of that state (Fingleton et al. 2012). By this definition, resilience could be a negative characteristic if a system is on an undesirable development path but is resistant to change (Hill et al. 2011; Bristow and Healy 2015). The concept of engineering resilience can be restrictive, and some argue it is unrealistic to apply the assumptions of this definition to systems as complex as regional economies (Simmie and Martin 2010; Fingleton et al. 2012; Christopherson et al. 2010). It does, however, lend itself well to measurement.\nEcological resilience refers to the amount of disturbance that a system can absorb before it begins to change form or function (Holling 1973). Walker et al. (2004) describe resilience as \"the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the\nThis article is protected by copyright.

This introduces the possibility of hysteresis, where a shock can cause a system to move to a new path rather than return to the original (Cross 1993).\nAdaptive (or evolutionary) resilience places added emphasis on a system's ability to continually adapt and evolve in response to change. Under this definition, Simmie and Martin (2010) describe resilience as an \"ongoing process rather than a recovery to a (preexisting or new) stable equilibrium state.\" Research on this type of resilience sometimes borrows from the literature on complex adaptive systems (CAS), employing a CAS framework to analyze the response and adaptation of a system in response to a shock or crisis (Bristow and Healy 2015).\nThe approach presented in this article most closely relates to engineering and ecological resilience, but we keep the other points of the regional economic resilience discussion in mind as we develop our measure and discuss its limitations. Engineering resilience, as defined by Martin (2012), lends itself well to this type of analysis as it is readily quantifiable, yields economically interpretable results, and has been used in previous economic resilience analysis (e.g. Foster (2007) and Hill et al. (2008)). An economic resilience metric using the engineering framework described by Martin (2012) provides an estimate of a region's resist a shock and recover from a shock, it aligns well with an economic understanding of resilience.\nMeasuring Economic Resilience Some efforts use regional characteristics to measure economic resilience (Sensier, Bristow, and\nHealy 2016). For example, Briguglio et al. (2009) create an economic resilience index based on macroeconomic stability, microeconomic market efficiency, good governance, and social development characteristics. Kahsai et al. (2015) create a county economic resilience index based on industrial diversity, entrepreneurial activity and business dynamics, human and social capital, scale and proximity, and physical capital. Lu and Dudesing (2015) create also a county economic resilience index using changes in sales by industrial sector. An advantage of using an index of regional characteristics is that it captures the unique and complex nature of each region. The primary drawback is that the choice of variables and weighting procedure is someway subjective (Briguglio et al. 2009).\nOther efforts measure economic resilience by analyzing the behavior of an economic statistic representing economic activity such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), personal income, and employment to observe the shock response (Fingleton et al. 2012; Davies 2011; Han and Goetz 2015; Martin 2012; Hill et al. 2008). For example, Fingleton et al. (2012), Martin (2012), Augustine et al. (2013), and Han and Goetz (2015) study regional economic resilience using employment data, while\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Some of these studies also correlate an indicator of regional resilience with some indicators of regional strength. For example, Augustine et al. (2013) use income equality, economic diversification, regional affordability, and business climate to explain economic resilience (or resistance) to downturns. Crespo et al. (2013) use local knowledge network structure to explain regional resilience. Lewin et al. (2017) use income inequality and other county economic drivers to explain resilience (or the probability of entering recession).Our measure of regional economic resilience, following the approach taken by Fingleton et al. (2012), Martin (2012), and Han and Goetz (2015), is aimed solely to quantify regional response to shocks. Dimensions of an Economy's Response to a Shock\nThere are several dimensions of a region's response to a shock, as reflected by output or employment data, which are repeatedly discussed in the literature. Martin and Sunley (2015) provide an extensive review of these dimensions and refer to them collectively as the \"anatomy of resilience.\" We will discuss some of those dimensions here as they apply to employment data and will help our presentation. These dimensions are illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Dimensions of an Economy's Response to a Shock\nThe first dimension is the decline in employment levels following a shock, or the drop. This can be measured as the actual drop from peak employment leading into the recession (actual employment at time 0) to the trough (actual employment at time 1) where a region hits its minimum level of employment following the start of the recession (Drop #1) or, following Han and Goetz (2015), as the difference between actual employment and the expected employment at the trough based on pre-recession growth path (the value of pre-shock trend employment at 1 ) (Drop #2). Measures of drop capture the depth of the response. The second dimension of the response, duration, measures the time between the employment peak and trough, represented by the difference between 0 and 1 in Figure 1. The third dimension is often some measure of recovery, but resilience definitions put forth different views of what recovery means. This makes selecting a method of measuring recovery tricky. Possible measures include a return to the peak level of employment, a return to the original growth path, a return to the original growth rate, or the adoption of a new, favorable growth path (Martin and Sunley 2015). Han and Goetz (2015) represent a region's rebound as the rate of employment change in the six months following a region's trough, rather than defining recovery as a certain employment level to reach or a return to a preshock trend.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

County employment volatility varies and we argue that if a resilience measure generated by observing the response of employment levels to the recession does not account for a county's own expected variation, it could bias the results. Therefore, we incorporate a step into our resilience score calculation that nets out expected variation.\nIII. DATA We use U.S. county-level monthly employment data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau\nof Labor Statistics (BLS) for the years of 1990 through 2015.1 We use monthly employment data for all counties and county equivalents with a few exclusions, using a total of 3,137 U.S. counties in our analysis.2 We seasonally adjust the monthly employment data using the U.S. Census Bureau's X-13 ARIMA prior to the application of our resilience metric.\nEmployment data was chosen for this analysis because of the availability and completeness of the data for the past 25 years at the county-level and because it provides an opportunity to observe how the 2007-2009 recession affected county economic growth. Han and Goetz (2015) also use county-level employment data to observe region responses and measure resilience to the shock of the 2007-2009 Recession. One primary limitation of using employment is its dependence on population. While this does not necessarily compromise our efforts to measure resilience, it does influence the behavior of total employment levels. In using counties as our regional units, we are able to observe in greater detail the spatially unbalanced nature of local responses to the national recession. Limitations to using counties are that these are not economically autonomous regions. Geographic regions are increasingly interwoven economically, on a national and global scale, which poses a challenge to all research in regional economics over how to define economic regions. Looking at recession responses in county employment\n1 As of July 2016, this data can be accessed online at http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm. 1990 is the earliest date available for county-level monthly employment data series from the BLS and this is the primary reason we chose this starting date. We felt that establishing a long run growth trend was most appropriate for calculating a resilience score. However, we also ran our analysis using alternative starting dates and found fairly consistent results. Specifically, the correlation coefficient between the resilience scores using a starting date of in 1990 versus 1993 was 0.95. The correlation coefficient between start dates of 1990 versus 1995 was 0.85. 2 Over the years of 1990 to 2015, there have been some code and county definition changes and we merged and appended data series to match these changes. We merged eight counties and excluded four for insufficient data or definitional changes. Following Han and Goetz (2015), we merged two counties into the Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska which was split in 2007 and merged two counties into the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, Alaska which was split in 2008. We merged two pairs of counties that underwent name changes during this time period (Wade Hampton Census Area, Alaska became Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska and Shannon County, South Dakota became Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota in July 2015). We also merged two pairs of counties that retained their names but whose FIPs codes changed during the period (Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri and Park County, Montana). We excluded Clifton Forge City, Virginia, Broomfield County, Colorado, Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska and Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, Alaska.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We can use these surface-level observations to expose the currents and underlying forces that are not bound by geography.\nIV. METHODS The central goal of our resilience measure is to capture the variation in employment in response\nto the recession that exceeds what we can attribute to random variation. To do this, we must first identify the central tendency (first moment) of the data and variation around this central tendency (second moment). We have elected to measure variation around a pre-local recession long-term growth trend. We calculate this trend by performing a simple linear regression of monthly employment levels over time from January 1990 up to the month of local peak employment.\nTo generate pre-local recession trends for each county, we first identify each county's month of peak employment that is followed by entry into a local recession. To do this, we begin by following a method used by Han and Goetz (2015) and identify peak employment by county as the maximum level of employment occurring between two years before and two years after the national employment peak. This allows for the fact that some counties led in this recession, entering a local recession before the nation, and some counties lagged, entering local recession after the nation. For consistency, we also use employment data to identify the start of the national recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines the 2007-2009 recession as beginning in December 2007 and lasting until June 2009. This definition is based in large part on the behavior of real gross domestic product (real GDP) and real gross domestic income (real GDI) data. We find, according to our seasonally-adjusted employment data, that national employment levels peaked in December 2007 and experienced a trough, or end to the national recession, in February 2010. The NBER confirms the employment levels began to recover later than the real GDP and real GDI (NBER 2010). For the purposes of this paper, we therefore define the national recession as beginning after December 2007 and lasting until February 2010 and identify peak employment for the counties as maximum local employment occurring between December 2005 and December 2009.\nWe identify each county's trough as the point of minimum employment after peak employment and prior to the end of 2015. Figure 2 shows total employment and the pre-recession employment trend for the United States on the left and on the right, an example county: Kootenai County, Idaho. In the graph showing United States employment, the first solid vertical line (left) marks the national peak followed by entry into recession and the second solid vertical line (right) marks the end of the national recession. In the graph of Kootenai County, Idaho, the beginning and end of the national recession are again represented by the solid lines and the dashed lines represent the beginning and end of Kootenai County's local recession, based on our criteria.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Comparison of Local Recession for Kootenai County, Idaho to National Recession\nWe seek to combine elements of drop and duration into one two-dimensional measure, by calculating the area of the deviation of actual employment below expected employment (based on a prelocal recession trend) during a specified time period following the start of the local recession. This application of our metric reflects engineering resilience and the idea that a resilient economy is one that returns to its original growth path employment level. Alternatively, if we were to use employment change data rather than total employment to represent economic activity, a resilient economy could be one that returns to its pre-recession growth rate, or a higher one, rather than to its original growth path. Based on our application, both the U.S. and Kootenai County, Idaho are penalized for each month that they have not returned to their original path, but both return to a similar or improved growth rate following their employment troughs which some would argue is one form of recovery.\nIn applying this metric, one must decide what criteria to use to determine the period for response measurement. During the months from January 1990 to December 2015, counties exhibit a wide variety of behaviors. Some were in overall steady decline prior to the recession while others grew steadily over the entire period. Some exhibit a relatively high level of volatility and some counties experienced a double-dip, entering a short recovery and then falling into recession again (Han and Goetz 2015). It is difficult to design a \"one size fits all\" set of criteria to identify county-specific time periods for measuring county responses to the recession while also including some element of recovery. We elect to measure resilience over the period from the local peak to six months, or two quarters, beyond the local trough in demonstrating one application of our metric. This window relies on our criteria for identifying local peaks and troughs and other researchers might choose to vary these criteria and their window for measuring resilience.\nWe begin by calculating the area under the trend during the months from the local peak to six months after the local trough. Figure 3 illustrates this area for Kootenai County, Idaho, represented by the shaded region between the local peak and start of the local recession () and six months beyond the end of the local recession (+6).\nFigure 3. Example of Area Calculations for Kootenai County, Idaho\nTo calculate the gross area of these shaded regions, we calculate the difference between the integral of the plotted actual employment line and the integral of the trend line for each one month to month period. We then sum all of the individual month to month integral differences, or areas, for which actual\nThis article is protected by copyright.

This process in represented by Equation 1.3\n\n+6 =\n\n +6\n= \n\n\n\n  -1  - -1  0\n\n   \n\n(1)\n\nTo address the need to separate variation in employment in response to the recession from random variation that might have occurred in the absence of a shock, we calculate an area representative of the expected variation for across the length of the local recession plus six months () for each county. We base our calculation of expected variation on pre-local recession behavior and begin with the same process used to perform the gross area below trend calculations explained above. We sum up the areas of all dips of actual employment below the pre-recession long-term growth trend occurring from January 1990 up to the month of each county's local peak employment (the shaded regions between  1990 and  in Figure 3), which will be cumulative but not continuous. We then divide this total by the number of months from January 1990 to each county's local peak ( 1990 to ) to get an average area below the trend per month up to the month of peak employment. We then multiply this pre-local recession average monthly below-trend area by the number of months in each county's local recession plus six months. These values represent the area below the trend that we would expect to see and attribute to random variation. The process of calculating this expected variation for each time period is represented by Equation 2.\n\n\n\n=\n\n=1990\n\n  (\n\n\n\n-\n\n 1990)\n\n \n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n-\n\n+6\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe adjust our gross area (+6) by netting out the expected variation for each time period. To do this, we subtract the expected variation () from the gross area (+6 ). This process is\nrepresented by Equation 3 below.\n\n+6 -  =       ( +6)\n\n(3)\n\n3 NOTE: Periods when actual employment crosses from above to below or below to above the trend line are handled differently. The portion of each of these periods where actual employment was below the trend is isolated and the area below the trend and above actual employment is calculated separately and included in the summations that yield our +6 values. This also applies to the process we use to calculate expected variation.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved\n\n\fAuthor Manuscript\n\nTo make the area of recession impact comparable between counties of different sizes, we take an additional step and divide each net area of recession response by each county's respective employment level at its peak.\n\n+6\n\n=\n\n+6-  \n\n(4)\n\nThe resulting value, +6, shown in Equation 4 is our resilience measure. A positive value signifies that the variation of actual employment below the expected employment (based on a pre-local recession trend) was less than the amount of variation that could be attributed to randomness. A negative value signifies that the amount of variation observed in actual employment dipping below the preprecession trend exceeded that which could be attributed to random variation. Therefore, negative values signify that there was an observable response to the shock of the recession in county employment levels. If a county has a positive resilience score, it was resilient to this particular recessionary shock. If two counties have negative resilience scores, the county with the smaller absolute value would be considered relatively more resilient to the recession than the county with the larger absolute value.\nOur resilience measure represents a preliminary attempt to represent local responses to a recession through the calculation of an area and adjustment for expected variation.\n\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAccording to our seasonally adjusted employment data, national peak employment in the U.S. occurred in December 2007 and hit a trough in February 2010, marking the beginning and end of a 26month national recession. In discussing our peak, trough, and duration results, we exclude counties whose maximum employment between December 2005 and December 2009 was not a local peak and those counties whose identified trough was not a confirmed local minimum. Of those counties excluded for not meeting the traditional local peak criteria, 117 hit maximum employment in December 2005, the first month of our peak identification period, but were already in decline from the previous month(s) and 11 counties hit maximum employment in December 2009, the last month of this period, but had employment levels increase in the month that followed. All 106 counties whose troughs were not confirmed local minima experienced their troughs in December 2015, the last month within our dataset, so we cannot confirm that employment increased in the subsequent month. After excluding counties in these two categories (229 total, 5 appeared in both), we have 2,908 counties that we use to produce summary statistics and analyze patterns in county peaks, troughs, and recession duration.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Of the remaining counties, 4.5 percent hit peak employment in December 2007, entering a local recession at the same time as the nation, and 40.6 percent hit peak employment after December 2007, entering a local recession after the start of the national recession. The months with the most counties hitting peak employment are December 2007 (4.5 percent) and August 2008 (3.9 percent). By year, 3.5 percent hit peak employment in 2005, 27.9 percent in 2006, 28.0 percent in 2007, 31.9 percent in 2008, and 8.7 percent in 2009.\nThe majority of U.S. counties, 61.1 percent, experienced their trough and end to their local recession after the nation, while 6.3 percent experienced their trough in the same month as the nation and 32.6 percent experienced their trough before the nation. The greatest number of counties, like the nation, hit their trough in February 2010 (6.3 percent), followed by December 2009 (4.3 percent). By year, 0.2 experienced their trough in 2006, 0.8 percent in 2007, 1.9 percent in 2008, 25.6 percent in 2009, 24.5 percent in 2010, 13.0 percent in 2011, 8.3 percent in 2012, 7.9 percent in 2013, 7.6 percent in 2014, and 10.3 percent in 2015.\nOn average, county local recessions lasted longer than the national recession, but varied greatly. On average, local recessions for counties lasted 46.6 months compared to the nation's 26 months. The distribution of county recession durations, however, is widespread, with a minimum of 1 month, a maximum of 119 months, and a standard deviation of 28.1 months. Considering duration in years, 7.8 percent of county recessions lasted one year or less, 18.7 percent lasted between one and two years, 17.4 percent lasted between two and three years, 15.9 percent lasted between three and four years, 10.6 percent lasted between four and five years, 8.9 percent lasted between five and six years, and 20.8 percent lasted more than six years. It is possible that counties that show particularly long recessions, based on this criteria, may have been experiencing other trends that were contributing to their long-term decline.\nPrior to the start of the national recession, the nation had a positive long-term growth trend. Out of all 3,137 counties, 84.6 percent of counties had positive long-term growth trends and 15.4 percent of counties had negative long-term growth trends. Of the 3,009 counties that experienced peak employment meeting the local peak criteria, 85 percent had positive long-term growth trends and 15 percent had negative long-term growth trends prior to their local recession.\nWe also calculated post-recession trends using a simple regression of employment over the time in the months following each local recession to the end of 2015. To calculate post-local recession trends for counties, counties who had not experienced a trough by June 2015 are excluded to ensure that post-\n4 One reason for this is that there are many more rural counties that there are urban counties in the United States and economic activity is not evenly distributed across counties.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

There are 2,710 counties that satisfy these criteria of the 2,908 that satisfied local peak and trough criteria. Of these, 37.8 had lower post-local recession growth rates and 62.2 percent of counties had higher growth rates after the end of their local recession than they had going into their local recession.\nOur application of our resilience metric reflects the wide variation of responses to the 2007-2009 recession observed at the county level. Here again we look at the 2,710 counties that met local peak and trough criteria and hit their trough by June 2015 so the full local recession plus six months window is captured. The resilience score for the nation was -1.94 and the average county resilience score was -3.92 with a standard deviation of 5.19, a minimum of -38.47 (Manassas Park, Virginia), and a maximum of 5.40 (Nicholas County, Kentucky). Many counties with high positive scores have negative pre-local recession trends and some dramatic variation, often a drop, in employment during their pre-local recession years causing expected variation values to be relatively high. A strongly negative pre-local recession trend can result in actual employment being above the trend-projected employment for the entire period of our resilience calculation. Out of the 2,710 counties whose resilience scores we analyzed, a total of 148 counties were above their pre-local recession trend for the entire response measurement period.\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of the resilience scores based on our application. Once again, a positive value signifies that the variation of actual employment below expected employment (based on a pre-local recession trend) was less than the amount of variation that could be attributed to randomness whereas a negative value means that the amount of variation observed in actual employment dipping below the pre-local recession trend exceeded that which could be attributed to randomness.\nFigure 4. Distribution of U.S. County Resilience Scores\nWe use regions from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), rural-urban continuum codes developed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS), and county typology information from the ERS to see how different subsets of counties performed compared to one another. Based on mean resilience scores, the Mideast (-2.61), Southwest (-2.81), and Far West (3.03) regions appeared to be the most resilient to this recession and the Great Lakes (-5.27), Southeast (4.79), and Rocky Mountain (-3.71) appeared to be the least resilient. For comparison, Han and Goetz (2015) found that the Southwest and Plains had great resilience based on their resilience measure, which incorporates measures of drop and rebound, and found that New England and the Mideast had low\nThis article is protected by copyright.

There is wide variation in the resilience scores of counties within the same BEA regions, observable in the standard deviations of scores within each BEA region and the visible variation seen in Figure 5.\nFigure 5.\nWith the use of the rural-urban continuum codes, we can observe how resilience scores differed between metropolitan counties of varying population size and nonmetrolitan counties classified by their population size and whether or not they are adjacent to metropolitan areas (ERS USDA 2013). Based on each group's mean score, nonmetro, not metro-adjacent counties with urban populations of 20,000 or more appeared to be the most resilient (-2.74) while nonmetro, but metro-adjacent counties with an urban population between 2,500 and 19,999 appeared to be the least resilient (-4.95). When we divide counties into metro counties, nonmetro counties that are metro adjacent, and nonmetro counties that are not metroadjacent, disregarding population size, metro counties appear to be the most resilient (mean resilience score equal to -3.41) while nonmetro, metro-adjacent counties appear to be the least resilient (mean resilience score equal to -4.55). With that said, there is still great variation within each of these categories and when comparing the mean resilience scores for all metro counties with all nonmetro counties using a t-test (for all U.S. counties and counties by BEA region), we do not find that their means are statistically different.\nThe industries that a region depends on can influence their resilience to economic shocks, and retrospective analyses of the Great Recession have found that U.S. agriculture appeared to fare relatively well as an industry through the 2007-2009 recession (Sundell and Shane 2012). Our resilience results reflect this. Farming-dependent counties tended to fair better than non-farming-dependent counties. The ERS provides typology data for two periods occurring within our 25-year dataset: 1998-2000 and 20102012. In the data for 1998-2000, farming-dependent counties are those that either had an annual average of 15 percent or more total county earnings coming from farming or 15 percent or more of employed residents working in farming. There are 350 counties out of our 2,710 that classify as farming-dependent during this period. In the 2010-2012 data, farming-dependent counties were those where farming accounted for 25 percent or more of total county earnings or 16 percent or more of employment. There\n5 The counties excluded in figure 5 were due to either the reasons presented in footnote 2 or for not meeting the local peak criteria, i.e. counties whose maximum employment between December 2005 and December 2009 was not a local peak and those counties whose identified trough was not a confirmed local minimum.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Among counties classified as farming-dependent during the 1998-2000 timeframe, the average resilience score was -2.71, compared with an average resilience score of -4.11 for non-farming-dependent counties. Among counties classified as farming-dependent during the 2010-2012 timeframe, the average resilience score was -2.92, compared with an average score of -4.11 for those that were not farming-dependent.\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nWhen we reintroduce the rural-urban continuum codes while accounting for farming-dependency, we begin to see statistically significant differences between groups that we did not see when looking at rural-urban status alone. Using our three broad rural-urban categories (i.e. metro counties; nonmetro, metro-adjacent counties; nonmetro, not metro-adjacent counties), we perform pairwise comparisons of the means of county groups based on which rural-urban category they belong to and whether or not they are farming-dependent (see Table 1 for results of all comparisons). We find that farming-dependent counties outperformed their non-farming-dependent counterparts within every rural-urban category. Nonmetro, metro-adjacent, farming-dependent counties and nonmetro, not metro-adjacent, farming-dependent counties both showed positive mean differences that are statistically significant at the 0.05 level when compared with non-farming-dependent counties of the same rural-urban status. When nonmetro, metroadjacent and nonmetro, not metro-adjacent farming-dependent counties were compared with one another based on the 1998-2000 typology data, nonmetro, not metro-adjacent, farming-dependent counties appeared to be more resilient with a statistically significant mean difference.\n\nAmong non-farming counties, metro counties strongly outperformed both groups of nonmetro counties with mean differences that are statistically significant at the 0.01 level for groups using both the 1998-2000 and 2010-2012 typology data. Interestingly, however, these non-farming-dependent metro counties were not more resilient than nonmetro, not metro-adjacent counties that were farming-dependent. Nonmetro, not metro-adjacent farming-dependent counties appeared to be more resilient than nonfarming-dependent metro counties with a mean difference that is statistically significant at the 0.05 level using both time periods of typology data. In the results of all these pairwise comparisons of means (Table 1), we can see that these rural, remote, farming-dependent counties consistently showed higher levels of resilience compared with all other groups, often with statistically significant mean differences.\n\nTable 1.

This too is reflected in our resilience scores, though not as strongly as the relative resilience of farming-dependent over non-farming-dependent counties. In the ERS typology data for 1998-2000, manufacturing-dependent counties are those where manufacturing accounted for an annual average of 25 percent or more total earnings during the associated time period. There are 780 counties out of our 2,710 that meet this criteria during this period. In the 2010-2012 data, manufacturing-dependent counties were those where manufacturing accounted for 23 percent or more of the county's earnings or 16 percent of the average employment of that time period. There are 447 counties out of our 2,710 that meet this criteria during this period. Among counties classified as manufacturing-dependent during the 1998-2000 timeframe, the average resilience score was -4.93, compared with an average resilience score of -3.52 for non-manufacturing-dependent counties. Among counties classified as manufacturing-dependent during the 2010-2012 timeframe, the average resilience score was -4.41, compared with an average score of 3.84 for those that were not manufacturing-dependent.\n\nWhen we perform pairwise comparisons of the means of county groups based on their rural-urban status and whether or not they are manufacturing-dependent, we find further evidence that manufacturingdependent counties were particularly hard hit by this recession (see Table 2 for results of all comparisons). Non-manufacturing-dependent metro counties appear more resilient than all manufacturing-dependent counties, regardless of rural-urban status, with statistically significant mean differences for both sets of ERS typology data. Nonmetro, not metro-adjacent manufacturing-dependent counties appeared to be less resilient than their non-manufacturing-dependent counterparts, though the pairwise mean difference was only statistically significant using only the 1998-2000 typology data. Among manufacturing-dependent counties, metro counties appeared to be the most resilient, however the mean differences were statistically significant only when compared to both groups of nonmetro counties based on the 1998-2000 typology data.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We look at the presence of agriculture and manufacturing as a first glance at the relationships of two large U.S. industries to resilience to the 20072009 recession. Undoubtedly, there are much deeper and less visible forces that contribute to community resilience and vulnerability that will require further and more complex analysis to uncover.\n\nThe choices that we made in the application of our resilience metric inform the type of resilience that our results reflect. Our use of total employment data and choice to compare actual employment to a long-term employment trend based on pre-local recession behavior, treating those that stick closely to or even above their growth path as more resilient, reflects the engineering definition of resilience. Again, we could choose to use other economic statistics, or in this case, even different forms of employment data, like monthly employment change. In running the same calculation process, but with employment change data, we obtain slightly altered resilience rankings as this method places more emphasis on the idea of recovery being a return to an original growth rate or adoption of a higher one. If counties deviate from the original growth path, but return to or exceed their original growth rate, they are no longer penalized in this alternative application even if they never return to their original growth path. This would reflect an idea of resilience that is closer to the concept of ecological resilience and is an example of just one alternative application of our resilience metric.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved\n\n\fAuthor Manuscript\n\nDescribing and quantifying regional variation in resilience is a critical first step to understanding what factors contribute to a region's ability to resist and recover from economic shocks. In understanding how to foster the desirable attributes of resilience, we can provide better guidance to policy makers and community leaders as they try to strengthen their communities and prepare them for internal and external shocks that they may not be able to predict.\nOur measure of resilience builds on previous literature and proposes a two-dimensional response to a shock based on first and second moment conditions in the data and subtracting out variation due to randomness. This metric corrects for estimates of resilience in counties which have endogenously higher volatility, therefore disentangling behavior due to this general volatility from resilience. Much of the previous literature has argued that resilience and volatility are distinct concepts, therefore it is imperative that our measure of resilience correct for this endogenous volatility. Furthermore, the two-dimensional nature of our measure combines both the central trend (first moment condition) and variance around that trend (second moment condition) into a singular measure of resilience. In other words, our measure of resilience is neither deviations from a growth path or volatility, but rather an interaction between these two measures that nets out expected volatility based on historic variation.\nThe primary limitations of the work and results that we have shared in this article are related to specific choices we have made in the application of our metric. Our choice of using total employment to measure economic activity and a long-term, linear pre-recession trend to project expected employment in the absence of the 2007-2009 recessionary shock make this measure of resilience most reflective of equilibrium-based definitions, particularly concepts of engineering resilience. Our choice to measure resilience over the months of each county's local recession and the six months following allows us to capture the beginning of recovery, but somewhat minimally. Some existing resilience metrics measure recovery or post-local recession behavior separately or as a rate. Alternative applications of this metric may be able to credit counties more for strong recovery behavior, or at least reduce the penalization to regions for the absolute loss in response to the recession if a similar or improved growth rate develops in the time of recovery. Finally, this measure of resilience does not speak to the overall resilience of regions, but rather to the resilience of U.S. counties to this particular shock, the 2007-2009 recession. Changes in the application of this metric can ameliorate some, but not all, of these limitations.\nDeveloping measures of resilience allows us to identify how regions perform relative to one another when exposed to the same shock. With this ability to compare responses, we can begin to explore the possible explanations for variation among responses which could ultimately inform recommendations for fostering resilience through targeted economic development strategies.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We found the most pronounced differences when looking at farmingdependency and manufacturing-dependency, confirming other studies findings on the strong performance of agriculture and waning manufacturing industry leading up to and during the recession. Farmingdependent counties largely outperformed non-farming-dependent counties of the same rural-urban status and nonmetro, not metro-adjacent farming-dependent counties appeared the most resilient of these, also on average, performing better than metro counties that were not farming-dependent. Among manufacturing-dependent counties, metro counties appeared the most resilient, but all manufacturing counties were outperformed by not manufacturing-dependent metro counties. In addition, both metro and nonmetro, not metro-adjacent manufacturing-dependent counties were outperformed by their nonmanufacturing-dependent counterparts of the same rural-urban status.\nWhile we recognize that this is far from the last and definitive word on the topic, we hope that this measure of resilience will further add to the discussion of what it means for a region to be \"resilient\" and how we can effectively measure that quality. We also believe that this measure provides some insights into geographic differences in resilience and with further development, can be used in future research exploring the causes and nature of this geographic variation in regional economic resilience scores.\nReferences Barker, M.B.
