According to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the pathogenic cascade begins in patients with the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 ; the major constituent of neuritic plaques) into oligomeric and fi brillar assemblies, leading to neuroinfl ammatory changes, synaptic dysfunction and loss, accumulation and phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (the main constituent of neurofi brillary tangles), and neuronal degeneration. 1 In accordance with the prevailing biomarker model of Alzheimer's disease, 2 evidence of amyloid plaque deposition can be detected by brain imaging and CSF analysis about 10-15 years before clinical onset (increased fi brillar A\u03b2 as measured by PET and reduced CSF A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations). There is then biomarker evidence of neuronal dysfunction and synaptic loss (eg, regional reductions in cerebral glucose metabolism on PET and altered patterns of functional connectivity on functional MRI, 3 alterations in regional brain activity during memory encoding and novel viewing tasks on functional MRI, and reductions in grey matter and cortical thickness on MRI). Biomarker evidence of neuro fi brillary tangles, neuronal degeneration, and neuronal loss is also noted (eg, raised CSF total and phosphorylated tau concentrations and MRI measurements of hippocampal atrophy). 2, 4 We have previously characterised functional diff erences in the brain of young adult carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele, the major susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, 5 and have shown that those diff erences occur before neurochemical and histo pathological evidence of A\u03b2 accumulation can be detected. 6 The functional brain diff erences were apparent almost fi ve decades before the estimated average age of clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease, but did not seem to progress until older ag es. 5 Findings from other studies have shown that young APOE \u03b54 carriers have reduced regional grey matter vol umes 7 and altered functional connectivity compared with demographically matched, young, non-APOE \u03b54 carriers. 3 According to the Alzheimer Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Database, more than 200 mutations of the presenilin 1 (PSEN1), PSEN2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease with almost certain clinical onset before the age of 65 years. In contrast to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has been associated with increased A\u03b2 production, as shown by increases in plasma A\u03b2 concentrations or increase in plasma A\u03b2 :A\u03b2 1-40 ratios, or both. [8] [9] [10] The study of mutation carriers provides a unique opportunity to characterise the preclinical changes associated with predisposition to Alzheimer's di sease. 11 We have begun to use brain imaging and quantifi cation of CSF biomarkers to detect and track changes in presymptomatic PSEN1 E280A (Glu280Ala) mutation carriers from the largest known autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred. Residing in Antioquia, Colombia, this kindred is estimated to have approximately 5000 living relatives, including about 1500 mutation ca rriers. 12 Carriers from this kindred have an estimated median age of 44 years (95% CI 43-45) at onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 49 years (49-50) at onset of d ementia. 13 We previously reported that cognitively normal PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers have f unctional 14 and structural brain changes 15 in the late preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, which are similar to those reported by others in the late preclinical stages of autosomal dominant Alzheimer 's disease 16, 17 and late-onset Alzheimer 's disease. 18, 19 In this study, we compared func tional and structural MRI, CSF and plasma measure ments in a cohort of 18-26 year-old PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and non-carriers. We sought to test the hypotheses that young adult mutation carriers have raised CSF and plasma A\u03b2 42 con centrations, consistent with A\u03b2 overproduction and the absence of A\u03b2 plaque deposition. We also sought to test the hypothesis that young adult mutation carriers have functional and structural MRI diff erences, even before biomarker evidence of A\u03b2 plaque deposition."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "Our study is a cross-sectional study to characterise early biomarker changes associated with predisposition to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.

Func tional and structural MRI pulse sequences were done on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto scanner.

Our study shows some of the earliest known brain changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers, which suggest that these changes might begin before evidence of A\u03b2 plaque deposition. 10 and in contrast to previously published fi ndings from patients in late preclinical and clinical stages of late-onset 23 and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. 24 They are also consistent with cellular evidence of increased A\u03b2 1-42 :A\u03b2 1-40 ratios in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, [8] [9] [10] including an association between the PSEN1 E280A mutation and increased production and se cretion of A\u03b2 . 25 The raised CSF and plasma amyloid concentrations seem to precede the reduced CSF A\u03b2 concentrations that have been reported in the subsequent preclinical and clinical stages of both late-onset and familial Alzheimer's disease and that are thought to be a result of deposition of diff use and neuritic plaques in the subsequent preclinical stages. 26 However, mutation carriers had a signifi cantly lower CSF total tau:A\u03b2 1-42 and phospho-tau:A\u03b2 1-42 ratios, in contrast to the raised ratios reported in the clinical and late preclinical stages of late-onset 23 and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease; 24 these lower ratios are mostly attributable to raised CSF A\u03b2 concentrations in the mutation carriers in our cohort.\nThe 18-26 year old PSEN1 mutation carriers also had functional and structural MRI abnormalities (eg, signifi cantly greater activation in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions and less grey matter volume in parietal regions compared with non-carriers) similar to those found in late preclinical stages of autosomal dominant PSEN1 mutation carriers and other familial mutation carriers 16, 17 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, 18, 19 and in children, adolescents, and young adults w ith APOE \u03b54 mutations. 7 These brain abnormalities occurred before the ages at which fl orbetapir PET or CSF evidence of A\u03b2 plaque accumulation are detected in the mutation carriers from this Colombian kindred. 27 However, in the absence of neuropathological data, we cannot exclude the possibility that PET and CSF fi ndings might under estimate the accumulation of diff use amyloid plaques in carriers of the mutation; nor can we exclude the possibility that the raised CSF concentrations in the young adult carriers have already begun to decline. Using a linear mixed model to characterise the trajectory of diff erent biomarkers in a cross-sectional study of different autosomal Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers and non-carriers over a larger age range, investigators from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) recently suggested that CSF A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations begin to decline 25 years before the cohort's estimated age of Alzheimer's disease clinical onset, although no signifi cant diff erences were reported in the 13 carriers and non-carriers who were studied more than 20 years before their estimated age at clinical onset (panel). 11 Still, our fi ndings, along with those reported previously in APOE \u03b54 carriers evaluated decades before their anticipated age at clinical onset and before any evidence of increased fi brillar or soluble A\u03b2 in the brain, 5 raise new questions about the earliest brain changes associated with the predisposition to autosomal dominant and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nAdditional studies are needed to clarify several issues: the extent to which the structural and functional abnormalities identifi ed in young adults at genetic risk for autosomal dominant or late-onset Alzheimer's disease precede A\u03b2 plaque deposition; whether these changes are neuro degenerative or developmental; whether or not the raised CSF A\u03b2 42 concentrations are already in decline by this early age; whether or not there is any cerebral fi brillar A\u03b2 deposition in deceased young adult mutation carriers (even in the absence of PET or CSF biomarker fi ndings); the extent to which brain changes implicated in the MRI studies provide a foothold (ie, cause brain regions to be vulnerable to) the subsequent A\u03b2 or tau pathology; whether our fi ndings are relevant to other genetic and non-genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease; and the extent to which they are the consequence of soluble A\u03b2 or other molecular species (including, but not limited to, increased A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations or A\u03b2 1-42 :A\u03b2 1-40 ratios in people at risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease). In previous studies, we have suggested that the functional brain abnormalities we noted in you ng adult APOE \u03b54 carriers were apparent in brain samples from deceased young adult \u03b54 carriers before demonstrable increases in soluble A\u03b2 concentrations, A\u03b2 plaques, or substantial tau pathology, 6 and that the abnormalities did not progress between young adulthood and late middle age, 28 but that those changes preceded other progressive brain changes and the earliest A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the late preclinical st ages of Alzheimer's disease. 5 Other researchers have reported similarities between the brain regions associated with high metabolic activity and aerobic glycolysis in young adults and those associated with A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the late preclinical and the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease; 29 that these brain regions correspond to the default-mode network that is most active in a person's resting state; 30 and that synaptic activity is involved in the production, secretion, and regional deposition of A\u03b2. [31] [32] [33] We postulate that the reductions in regional grey matter are related to a very early age-related or neurodevelopmental reduction in the density of terminal neuronal fi elds innerv ating the implicated regions, which could help account for the similar pattern of metabolic reductions reported in \u00b9\u2078F-fl uorodeoxyglucose PET studies of people with PSEN1 mutations who are at risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease 5 and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's diseas e. 34 Regardless of whether these reductions begin before or after A\u03b2 plaque deposition, increases in hippocampal activity during a memory encoding and novel viewing task could be a result of the eff ort to compensate for neuronal or synaptic impairments or an ineffi cient inhibition of synaptic functions. 14 This study has several strengths. We studied young adult members from a large and extensively studied kindred of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers who, in the absence of an eff ective prevention treatment, are certain to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and have well characterised trajectories of cognitive decline. The homogeneous nature of the disease in carriers of this mutation might enable characterisation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease with improved statistical power and greater confi dence in relating the brain changes to the estimated age at clinical onset. Additionally, we compared several diff erent brain imaging and fl uid biomarker measurements in mutation carriers and non-carriers to characterise some of the earliest biomarker changes associated with the predisposition to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.\nThis study also has several limitations, including small sample size, absence of longitudinal data, and uncertainty in the extent to which our fi ndings are generalisable to other causes of autosomal dominant and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Although there were fewer participants with CSF and plasma samples than with structural and functional MRI scan, we were able to detect signifi cant increases in A\u03b2 concentrations in the mutation carriers. Although the regional grey matter fi ndings should be regarded as exploratory, the uncorrected signifi cance levels, bilateral pattern, and resemblance to the pattern reported previously in patients with Alz heimer's disease 35 reduce the likelihood that they are attributable to the type I error associated with multiple regional comparisons. Although our fi ndings are currently limited to PSEN1 E280A carriers, we have sought to harmonise our biomarker measure ments and undertake biological fl uid assays in the same laboratory used by DIAN investigators in the study of other autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease m utation carriers and noncarriers, 8, 11 thus providing comple mentary data and converging evidence in the preclinical study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.\nAfter this study was completed, we characterised the age-related trajectory of A\u03b2 plaque deposition in a "}, {"section_title": "Systematic review", "text": "We searched PubMed iteratively with the terms \"preclinical familial Alzheimer's\", \"dominantly inherited\", and \"early-onset\" and \"cerebral spinal fl uid\", \"MRI\", and \"PET.\" As of Aug 20, 2012, 18 articles reported brain imaging and CSF biomarker fi ndings in more than one autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carrier before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (appendix).
