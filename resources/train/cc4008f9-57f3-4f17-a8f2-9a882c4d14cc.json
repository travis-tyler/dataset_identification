[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The issues of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) are believed to affect the curriculum design to adjust student learning (Co\u015fkun, Kay\u0131kc\u0131, & Gen\u00e7ay, 2019; Fung, 2019; Lan & Vu, 2018; Lieu, Duc, Gleason, Hai, & Tam, 2018) . The IR 4.0 requires the standards of learning processes and output in global competition. Hence students' mathematics skill is recently required to be assessed by using international scale of evaluation (Chow & Ekholm, 2018; Moyer-packenham et al., 2018) . Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) are usually used to measure international mathematical skills. PISA is used to measure the reading literacy, math literacy and science literacy. The term of literacy in PISA is related to the readiness of students on the future workplace, i.e. the ability to apply knowledge and skills to a subject that includes analysis skills, give reason and make an effective communication for various problems in different situations (OECD, 2013) . TIMSS is used to measure Mathematics and Science achievement (Mullis, Martin, Ruddock, Sullivan, & Preuschoff, 2009) . Hence, the results of PISA and TIMSS can compare capability of different students on mathematics among countries. Those international tests show the rank of country on the result of their students' scores on PISA and TIMSS.\nThe PISA scores of Indonesian students showed that the literacy score is under the average of OECD. Their TIMSS score indicated that their mathematics skill has got lower and lower from 1999 to 2011. In the period of 1999/ 2000, the rank of Indonesian students among all the participating countries was 39 in 41 (95.12) (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Arora, 2011; OECD, 2013 OECD, , 2015 . Hence these PISA and TIMSS achievements encouraged the education policy makers to develop the mathematical learning system to reach higher achievements. Scholars were also promoted to investigate various antecedents related to the international test results."}, {"section_title": "Rationale for the Study and Design", "text": "Since various approaches to mathematics tests are designed by education policy makers, the curriculum is believed to increase the international test scores. The curriculum is designed to increase students' achievement in mastering various abilities on a subject (Dekant, Sungur, & Yerdelen, 2018; Mullis et al., 2009 ). The results of PISA and TIMSS are used to evaluate and re-formulate the education policies by various countries (Carnoy, Khavenson, Loyalka, Schmidt, & Zakharov, 2016; Jansen, Schroeders, L\u00fcdtke, & Marsh, 2019) . Accordingly, it is plausible that this study aimed to investigate the effect of the result of national tests on international ones, where the curriculum and type of mathematics tests are used to moderate the model. Hence, the contribution of test type and curriculum on the model is clearer. The novelty of this study is to examine and verify the contribution of different type of PISA and TIMMS, and different curriculum of KTSP (stand for Kurikulum Tingkat Satuan Pendidikan or Education Unit Level Curriculum) and K13 (stand for Kurikulum 2013 or Curriculum 2013).\nScholars believed that theoretically national test scores are related to international scale of mathematics achievement (Carnoy et al., 2016; Stacey, 2011) . Hence the mathematic test in the level of nation policy is designed to predict the international scale one. It is found that when students achieve a higher score of the school or nation test, they also get a better TIMSS score (Kaleli-Y\u0131lmaz & Hanci, 2015) . Accordingly, governments try to include the PISA and TIMSS test type in their national test to increase international mathematics' test score. The total items of PISA and TIMSS type tests were increased in national tests to adapt students, and similarity of those tests on the international test types were also increased (Kaleli-Y\u0131lmaz & Hanci, 2015; Retnawati, 2017) . Replication of Yilmaz & Hanci is needed to demonstrate the relationship between national and international test scores (Kaleli-Y\u0131lmaz & Hanci, 2015) . However, few researches investigated the effect of national test score on international test score. PISA and TIMSS tests have a different objective to measure (Wu, 2010) . The content of PISA and/or TIMSS within national test is believed to have various effects both in national and the international test scores. Empirically, different achievements of Indonesian students on international mathematics score could be predicted by various antecedents. Many researchers found that characteristics and quality of school and students contribute to student achievement. They argue that learning opportunity and teacher quality have different effects on mathematics score of students. The number of students in a class and socioeconomic status of school is indicated to be a strong predictor of PISA score (Argina, Mitra, Ijabah, & Setiawan, 2017; Carnoy et al., 2016; Lam & Lau, 2014; Mcconney & Perry, 2010) . Hence the study of the effect of national test scores on international test scores in different types of tests is needed.\nCurriculum is believed to influence the mathematics skills of students. Scheerens found that educational effectivities are related to student achievement (Scheerens, 2019) . The intended, implemented, and achieved curriculum are used to plan, control, and evaluate student achievement (Martin & Mullis, 2016) . The KTSP and 2013 curriculum is used in different ways to apply education in Indonesia. The difference of both curriculum types is related to knowledge and skill intention, and learning and evaluation system (Retnawati, Hadi, & Nugraha, 2016) . The 2013 Curriculum is close to a student-centered rather than a teacher-centered approach. It uses authentic tests to assess student attitudes, knowledge and skill whereas KTSP tend to use knowledge and skill test. Those different types of curriculum are argued to have various results in student achievements as well as PISA and TIMSS score. The 2013 curriculum type is used as an alternative of KTSP type to increase international mathematics skill. However, both curricula used national tests to measure the mathematics score of student achievement in the scale on national area. Hence, it is plausible if the 2013 curriculum achieves a better score of international tests rather than KTSP. However, the studies of evaluation of international mathematics score on both curricula are not conducted. Thus, there is a need for a study investigating the influence of different curriculums on the effect of national test scores on international mathematics score.\nThis study aimed to investigate the different types of test and curriculum on the effect of national test scores on international mathematics score. It is hypothesized that the score gained from national test of mathematics has an effect on the score of international tests and different types of curriculum (K13 and KTSP), and international test types (PISA and TIMSS) have different effects on the national-international test scores. Concordantly, this study is significant in three aspects. Firstly, it strengthens the evidence of the importance of the effect of national mathematics test score on international score. Secondly, it may explain the significant contribution of International Mathematic Test Type on the effect of National Test Score on International Mathematic Test Score. Finally, it can make significant contributions to curriculum difference on the effect of national test score on international mathematic test score."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The moderation model was used to investigate the different types of tests and curriculum to predict the international mathematics test score based on the national test scores. Multiple regression was used to analyze the model. The moderation effect of curriculum and test types were analyzed by using the multiple regression (Hayes, 2013) . (Mullis et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The data were gathered from the scores of students' tests of mathematics course in public and private schools. The schools that apply K13 and KTSP curricula were chosen in this study. The Test of Kl-Smirnov showed that the unstandardized residual of the model was .104, the result of ANOVA showed significance value was higher than .05, and tolerance result was higher than 0.1. Hence, the data showed normality, linearity, multicollinearity, and heteroskedasticity of the model. The average score of national mathematics test was 28.71 with a minimum score of 3.23 and maximum score of 96.77. The average TIMSS score was 8.6 with minimum score of 1 and the maximum of 30, and average PISA score was 5.9 with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 18. The descriptive analysis revealed that the average national mathematics score was higher for public schools rather than the private ones (32.37 vs. 25.86), whereas TIMSS score was higher in public schools rather than private ones (9.78 vs. 7.75), and PISA scores for public schools were higher than private ones (6.63 vs. 5.36)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the hypotheses. The result of this study showed that initially, the National Test Score had a significant effect on International Mathematics Test Score (\u03b2=.545***; \u0394R 2 =10% Figure 2 explains that PISA type of tests contributes to have a better effect of national test score of mathematics on the international one rather than TIMSS. Hence, the hypotheses were proven. Figure 3 shows that interestingly, the National Test Score had a consistent effect on International Mathematic Test Score on different curriculum (\u03b2=,486, \u0394R 2 =10%). A higher score of national tests indicated a better international score of mathematics skills. The different curricula had a significant effect on International Mathematic Test Score (\u03b2=,353, \u0394R 2 =2%). The interaction of national test score and test type had a significant effect on International Mathematic Test Score (\u03b2=,195, \u0394R 2 =12%). The contribution of the model (\u0394R 2 =12%) revealed sufficient data to explain the different findings of the effect of National Test Score on International Mathematic Test Score. Figure 2 explains that KTSP type of curriculum contributed to better effect of national test score of mathematics on the international one rather than the 2013 one. Kaleli-Y\u0131lmaz & Hanci, 2015) . A higher score of national indicated a better international score of mathematics skills. The reasons are national tests have an equal function with the international one to qualify the mathematical abilities of students, objectives of competencies of national and international test are related (Carnoy et al., 2016; Stacey, 2011) , the type of national test of mathematics is widely imitated to mathematics national test (Retnawati, 2017) , and the trend of national and international test scores are equal.\nThe findings indicated that different types of mathematical problems (PISA/TIMSS) are likely to have different impacts of national examinations on international math tests. PISA and TIMSS results showed that the rank on PISA was equal to the ratings on TIMSS. Thus, this confirms the fundamental difference between PISA and TIMSS in measuring mathematical ability (Wu, 2010 OECD, 2013 OECD, , 2015 . However, the scores of PISA are likely to increase. This result seems opposite to the findings of Wu (Wu, 2010) . He found that most of the students in Asia and east European countries performed better at TIMMS type than the PISA, yet the western countries concerned for the PISA type.\nDifferent types of curriculum were also found to have different effects of national to international score of mathematics test. This finding supported Scheerens findings (Scheerens, 2019) . Hence, it is plausible that the development of curriculum aimed to increase the result of the learning processes. The KTSP type of curriculum was found to have a better effect of national on international score of mathematics test. It seems to contradict with the concept of the curriculum development objectives. It is expected that application of KTSP had deeper concerns on knowledge rather than 2013 version of curriculum which was stressing on attitude and skill (Ilma & Pratama, 2015; Retnawati et al., 2016) . It is related to the previous findings indicating that teachers have reached no optimal level of 2013 curriculum implementations (Amat Jaedun, V. Lilik Hariyanto, Nuryadin, 2014; Trisnawati, Gunawan, & Nongkeng, 2016) . Hence, the implementation of 2013 version should be evaluated.\nIt is concluded that both different curriculum and test types of mathematics have a significant effect on the influence of national to international mathematics test score. The higher effect of national to international mathematics test scores depended on the context of the curriculum and test type used. Hence school leaders must pay more attention on the implementation of curriculum and choice of the type of test. However, the sample of this study was limited to the specific region in Indonesia. The conclusion of this study shows the effect of national test scores on international test scores is higher when the type of international test is PISA rather than TIMSS, and school which apply KTSP curriculum on their learning process have a better effect of national test scores of mathematics on international test scores rather than 2013 Curriculum.\nThe result of this study recommends following studies to investigate broader sampling which represents the model in Indonesia. The implementation of the 2013 curriculum is still in development. Hence, the application of 2013 curriculum in ideal stage is needed to represent the concept of the 2013 curriculum. Different objectives of PISA and TIMSS are challenging. Accordingly, the future research is suggested to employ a bigger sample implementing the 2013 curriculum, and to analyze the details of PISA and TIMSS domain."}]
