[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coastal bays or back-barrier estuaries are common features along the U.S. east coast. They are shallow coastal embayments separated from the ocean by extensive systems of barrier islands. Bay and mainland flood risk during extreme events has severe socioeconomic repercussions [Nicholls et al., 2007]. Offshore sea level is often the main driver of water level fluctuations in semienclosed back-barrier bays during storms and also controls tidal exchanges [Keulegan, 1967;Chuang and Swenson, 1981;Garvine, 1985]. Long-lasting fluctuations (e.g., storm surge, sea level rise) are more effectively transferred from the offshore into the bays than short-period fluctuations (e.g., semidiurnal tides). Smaller inlets restrict transfer of offshore fluctuations into bays [Keulegan, 1967]. If offshore water level were maintained for long periods, enough water would flow through the inlets, overcoming the frictional restrictions, and the water level in the bays would match the offshore level [Chuang and Swenson, 1981;Aretxabaleta et al., 2014]. The response of bay water level to offshore forcing has been previously studied in a number of coastal settings. Wong and Wilson [1984] found that the substantial subtidal sea level fluctuations in Great South Bay were forced primarily by a strong bay-shelf coupling effect. In Lake Pontchartrain, a similar bay-inlet system, Chuang and Swenson [1981] found that coupled coastal ocean-bay response was dominant at subtidal frequencies. Garvine [1985] showed using a simple analytical model that remote effects dominate over local effects in estuarine systems with large enough openings. Wong and DiLorenzo [1988] found that inland bays in the Delaware Bay system were forced primarily by coastal sea level fluctuations at both tidal and subtidal frequencies. During large storm events, the bay system is affected by the offshore storm surge but the barrier island system prevents the water level in the back-barrier bays from fully matching the offshore level, as the size of the inlets that constrain the flow remains mostly unchanged and frictional forces limit the exchange. Only when added connections between ocean and bay are created (breaching) and/or when the barrier island is overtopped (overwash), is there additional transfer from the ocean side. In the Fire Island system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [2001] suggested that breaching of the barrier island could increase tidal range as much as 0.3 m along the mainland in Great South Bay with larger effects on storm surge (0.6 m higher water levels). Ca\u00f1izares and Irish [2008] compared simulations with/without breaching and overwash during the 1938 Hurricane and suggested that the effect of Moriches Inlet on the flooding of Moriches Bay was as large 0.75-1 m of excess water level in some locations. van Ormondt et al. [2015] suggested a much lower impact of breaching and overwash (0.1 m additional water level) in a simulation of Great South Bay during Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Sandy caused record flooding along the coast of the northeastern U.S. Overwash and subsequent breaching of the Long Island barrier islands during Sandy resulted in geomorphic change and new inlets across Fire Island, New York, at Cupsoque County Park (inlet closed November 2012), at Smith Point County Park (inlet closed November 2012), and at Old Inlet south of Bellport, New York (inlet open as of September 2016). In a previous study, Aretxabaleta et al. [2014] showed that the water level transfer function in an analysis extending from October 2007 to October 2013 did not show significant differences between before and after Hurricane Sandy conditions. In this study, we analyze observed water level in the bays of southern Long Island to characterize temporal changes in bay response to offshore fluctuations. A analytical model with linear friction and idealized inlet geometry is introduced to explore the dominant factors affecting water level in bays, reproduce the transfer of water level from offshore, provide approximations to the water level response in bays that lacked observational data, and allow for the examination of alternative response scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Regional Description", "text": "The study area is in southern Long Island, New York along the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1).

[1999] suggest a generic value of r510 24 m s 21 for shelf environments with no waves and r510 23 m s 21 for conditions with active waves (e.g., surf zone). As inlet linear friction is flow dependent, a value applicable to every environment should not be expected. Instead of choosing a value of friction from the literature and considering that the largest fraction of the flow variability through the inlet is associated with the semidiurnal tide (Table 3), we chose a value of friction for the analytical model to match the transfer of the tides at the M 2 frequency. The ratio between offshore and bay M 2 amplitudes was obtained from the harmonic analysis. We used the analytical model for single-bay systems assuming the connections between adjacent bays were too shallow, long, and narrow (long distance for strong frictional effects to reduce flow) to significantly affect bay response to offshore forcing. Differential phase lag between the contributions of multiple inlets could result in additional uncertainty in the linear friction coefficients.\n"}, {"section_title": "10.1002/2016JC012318", "text": "shallow interconnected bays to the north from the Atlantic Ocean. The main bays are Jamaica Bay (connected to the ocean by Rockaway Inlet), Great South Bay (connected to the ocean by Fire Island Inlet and other smaller inlets), Moriches Bay (connected to the ocean through Moriches Inlet), and Shinnecock Bay (connected to the ocean by Shinnecock Inlet). These bays have widths that vary from a few hundred meters to 8 km. They are separated from each other by narrow connections except for Jamaica Bay, which is not joined with the bays to the east. Prior to Hurricane Sandy, six inlets bisected the barrier islands. From west to east, these inlets were: Rockaway, East Rockaway, Jones, Fire Island, Moriches, and Shinnecock. The first four inlets predate the earliest available surveys of 1825, while the remaining two inlets were formed in the twentieth century. All inlets migrated naturally until arrested by jetties and dredging in the later part of the last century [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2001]. During Hurricane Sandy, a new inlet (Wilderness Breach hereafter) was opened by the storm in the area of the Fire Island High Dune Wilderness at Old Inlet south of Bellport and remains open to-date. The study area (Figure 1) can be separated into a set of six bay systems mainly controlled by their nearest inlet. From west to east, the bay systems are: Jamaica Bay, East Rockaway Inlet bay system, Jones Inlet bay system, Great South Bay, Moriches Bay, and Shinnecock Bay. Jamaica Bay has an area of approximately 50 km 2 with a mean depth of 4 m. The bay connects with the ocean to the west through Rockaway Inlet. The inlet has an average depth across the entire inlet of about 5 m with large spatial differences ranging from about 7 m along the axis of the channel (being as deep as 16 m off Floyd Bennett Field) and less than half a meter on the shoals. The bay contains numerous salt marsh islands that are being lost at the rate of 0.1-0.16 km 2 yr 21 [Hartig et al., 2002] affecting the inundated area of the bay. The East Rockaway Inlet Bay system has an area of approximately 45 km 2 with a mean depth of over 2 m. The bay system comprises multiple small bays and channels. The bay system is connected to the ocean mainly through East rockaway Inlet and to adjacent bay system (dominated by Jones Inlet) predominantly though Reynolds Channel. The Jones Inlet bay system has an area of approximately 20 km 2 with a mean depth of about 2 m. The system includes the bays between the East Rockaway Inlet bay system and Great South Bay. The system connects to the ocean through Jones Inlet and is also connected to Great South Bay to the east. There was a large dredging project of Jones Inlet in December 2007 to March 2008 (491,000 m 3 of sand removed) to improve navigation safety and another project of similar magnitude (520,000 m 3 ) in March-May 2014 to mitigate the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Great South Bay (GSB, Figure 1) is a shallow (average depth is 1.3 m), long (around 40 km), and narrow (between 2.5 and 8 km) bay and is the largest bay in southern Long Island (approximately 250 km 2 ). The main connection with the ocean is directly through Fire Island Inlet, located at the western end of Fire Island. Great South Bay also connects to the ocean through Moriches Bay to the east and the Jones Inlet bay system to the west. Fire Island Inlet has existed continuously since at least the late 1600s [Johnson, 1983] but was migrating westward until stabilization around 1950. Fire Island Inlet was dredged in 2008 (474,000 m 3 of sand removed between December 2007 and March 2008), 2013 (646,000 m 3 between February and April 2013), and 2014 (1,758,000 m 3 of sand removed between November 2013 and March 2014). Hurricane Sandy caused two breaches on Fire Island: one at Old Inlet (Wilderness Breach) and another in Smith Point County Park. Closure of the breach at Smith Point County Park was completed in November 2012. The breach within Fire Island National Seashore's wilderness area could not be immediately closed due to protective stipulations in the Park. The National Park Service (NPS) monitored the breach to determine if the breach would close naturally. Between January and March 2013, a series of winter storms caused the new inlet to migrate west and its channel deepened. The cross-sectional area of the inlet grew from approximately 100 m 2 after the storm (December 2012) to values oscillating between 300 and 400 m 2 (February-November 2013) and to maximum areas over 600 m 2 in May and October 2014. In June 2014, it decreased to values less than 500 m 2 . The last measurements collected in July 2015 showed areas around 450 m 2 (http://po.msrc.sunysb.edu/GSB/).\nMoriches Bay has an area of about 35 km 2 and an average depth of 1.7 m. It connects to the ocean through Moriches Inlet, which was formed by a Nor'easter in 1931 splitting Westhampton Island from Fire Island. Shinnecock Bay is the eastern-most bay along the outer barrier bay system, with an area of about 30 km 2 , and a average depth of 1.8 m. The main connection with the ocean is through Shinnecock Inlet, which was formed by the 1938 hurricane.\nThe transfer function ( Figure 5) between Sandy Hook (SH) and Lindenhurst (LIN) showed small changes in the 5 years of data considered (two before and three after Hurricane Sandy). The transfer curves were consistent with the previous analysis of Aretxabaleta et al. [2014]. The transfer of the offshore fluctuations was 60-80% at periods between 2 and 10 days, about 40-50% at diurnal periods, and about 20-30% at semidiurnal periods. While the transfer for 2011 (November 2010 to October 2011) and 2013 (November 2012 to October 2013) were quite similar, the values for 2012 (year before Hurricane Sandy) were lower for tidal and subtidal frequencies. The transfers for 2014 (November 2013 to October 2014) were higher than other years at most frequencies. The values for 2015 (November 2014 to October 2015) were smaller and represented a partial return to the pre-2014 conditions. The transfer function at the M 2 frequency for 2014 was outside the uncertainty envelope for the long-term mean but still within the envelope for 2015. The water level transfer in the storm band (2-5 days) during the period between Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy (2012) was significantly smaller (outside the uncertainty envelope) than during any of the other years. The remaining differences between years were within the uncertainty envelope using the Bendat and Piersol [1986] formulation at most frequencies, suggesting that while differences existed they are not significant. The bimonthly percentage change in transfer function for 2008-2015 ( Figure 6) demonstrates that the bay response was generally stable at all frequencies with relatively small magnitude fluctuations. The changes at frequencies less than 0.5 day 21 were quite noisy as the spectral estimates for subsets of bimonthly intervals contained limited observations. The period between Hurricanes Irene and Sandy was characterized by smaller transfer coefficients at most frequencies especially the semidiurnal tides and, immediately after Irene, the storm band (2-5 days). The enhanced transfers at semidiurnal frequencies after Hurricane Sandy were most evident during the period February 2014 to September 2014 and represented a 5-15% increase in transfer. Semidiurnal transfer values were mostly within 5% of average by the end of the record (October 2015). The diurnal tidal frequencies showed increases in both early 2014 and 2015, returning to average values after a few months. The timing and relative magnitude of the percentage changes in the tidal bands ( Figure  6) were consistent with the changes described in the harmonic analysis (Figure 4). The transfers in the storm band peaked around October 2014 and sharply decreased after then. The analytical model (section 4) was fit (in a least square best fit) to obtain a linear friction coefficient for the period before Hurricane Sandy (October 2007 to October 2012) when only the Fire Island Inlet was open and prior to the dredging in 2013 and 2014. The resulting coefficient was r 5 0.017 m s 21 and the associated frictional adjustment time was around 5-10 min. The analytical curve ( Figure 5) matched the transfer function shape for most frequencies, consistent with the transfer being dominated by the size of the inlet and area of the bay and not by the size of the fluctuations at a specific frequency. The analytical curve overestimated the transfer for periods between 1 and 2 days (water level energy less than 10 24 m 2 in that band) and underestimated the fluctuations around the O 1 tidal frequencies, while matching the K 1 tide. The mismatch at the O 1 frequency might be associated with additional effects inside the bay that contribute to enhanced diurnal oscillations. The natural frequency of the Bay was 0.5 h 21 and did not affect the frequencies considered in this study. Figure 5. Transfer function between Sandy Hook (SH) and Lindenhurst (LIN) for 5 years (each ''year'' starts in November the previous year, so for instance, the 2012 curve includes data from November 2011 to October 2012). The solid blue line is the analytical model from this study with a single-opening representing Fire Island Inlet (linear friction r 5 0.017 m s 21 ). The dashed-dotted blue line includes the analytical model with both Fire Island Inlet (r 5 0.017 m s 21 ) and the Wilderness Breach (r 5 0.034 m s 21 ). The inset is a zoom in the semidiurnal frequencies and includes the uncertainty envelopes [Bendat and Piersol, 1986] of each yearly transfer estimate.\nWhen the dimensions of the Wilderness Breach for June 2014 (600 m 2 cross-sectional area, http://po.msrc. sunysb.edu/GSB/) were added to the analytical model using two inlets and the 2007-2012 friction coefficient for both inlets, the theoretical curve matched the 2014 transfer function for subtidal frequencies, improved the match at the diurnal frequencies, but slightly overestimated the transfer of the semidiurnal tides by 0.01. A larger friction coefficient (0.034 m s 21 ) at the Wilderness Breach was needed to match the semidiurnal tide magnitude with the analytical model. However, matching the M 2 tide resulted in a slight underestimation of the response in the storm band. If the smaller Wilderness Breach cross section from the period immediately following Sandy (or after 2015) was used (400 m 2 cross-sectional area), then the needed frictional enhancement was smaller. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318\nWhen the Wilderness Breach was considered as an additional connection with the offshore, the transfer enhancement was limited to Great South Bay (approximately 10% increase in magnitude from no-breach case) with negligible effects (less than 1% change in magnitude) in Moriches Bay and the Jones Inlet Bay system. To match the tidal enhancement at Lindenhurst (2014-2015 average), the friction in the analytical model that included the breach needed to be adjusted by around 10%. If instead of modifying the friction, the dimensions of Fire Island Inlet were altered, a similar effect was achieved.\nduring extreme events from that predicted for the average geometry and friction coefficient. Nevertheless, the estimate of the difference in transfer for large and small events of order 10% suggests that the transfer may not be vastly different, especially if the basic geometry remains unchanged. The analytic model provides a framework to assess the potential magnitude of changes in transfer caused by inlet geometry or friction; changes in bay response could also be addressed with a fully nonlinear threedimensional hydrodynamic model simulation. The biggest constraint for evaluating transfer during extreme events is the uniqueness of each event and the lack of observations during them."}, {"section_title": "Observations and Methods", "text": "Water levels measured at eight stations in the southern Long Island region ( Figure 1 and Table 1) are used in this study. The stations started recording in October 2007 except Hog Island Channel, which began in 2010, and Sandy Hook, a long-term NOAA water level station operational since 1910. Most of the analysis uses the 2007-2015 data sets (5 years before Hurricane Sandy and 3 years after). The low-frequency offshore water level exhibits small horizontal differences along the length of Long Island with coherence squared between Sandy Hook (SH) and Montauk Point (easternmost point of Long Island) being greater than 0.9 for most subtidal frequencies and transfer function being close to one [Wong and Wilson, 1984]. The coherence and transfer coefficient between pressure observations at a station on the inner-shelf from December 1999 to April 2000 [Butman et al., 2003] and SH water levels were also close to unity. The SH gauge is located in Raritan Bay and is connected with the adjacent shelf by a 8 km wide and over 10 m deep opening. The high coherence with offshore observations and the deep and broad connection to offshore justify using Sandy Hook observations as a proxy for offshore water level along the southern coast of Long Island. Bathymetry to calculate bay areas and inlet dimensions was obtained from NOAA (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ mgg/coastal/crm.html) and updated with recent (2012-2014) bathymetric surveys by U.S. Geological Survey [Brownell et al., 2015]. The average values used in the study are included in Table 2. The width and depth of the inlets were estimated by assuming a single channel of uniform size that represented the average of multiple cross sections. The length of the channel in some inlets extends beyond the island coastline into the bay to include shallow regions in the proximity of the inlet. The chosen length cutoff was the cross section for which the area in the deeper part of the channel was equal to the area in the shallow part of the cross section. The water level spectra and transfer functions between offshore and bay water level were calculated using a Hanning 29 day window with overlapping (50%) data segments. The length of the window was chosen to provide estimates near the main tidal frequencies. Spectral transfer functions between water levels offshore (input, SH) and in the bays (output) were computed to determine the bay response to offshore forcing. Bendat and Piersol [1986] provided a formulation to estimate the uncertainty envelopes for the transfer function. A harmonic analysis using T_Tide [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] was conducted for monthly (October 2007 to October 2015) and yearly (from 1 November to 30 October) intervals to provide estimates of the changing tidal amplitudes in time. Tidal constituent inference [Forrester, 1986] was necessary for the monthly harmonics based on the ratios obtained from the yearly analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Two-Inlet Analytical Model", "text": "The bay response to ocean sea level forcing can be represented using a simple analytical model of a generic bay connected to the offshore by two separate inlets (Figure 2a). The analytical model is designed as a simplification of the water level exchange between the offshore and Great South Bay through Fire Island Inlet and the Wilderness Breach (after Hurricane Sandy). The model assumes that the bay water level responds as a level surface to ocean forcing from the inlets and thus is limited to bays with modest horizontal extent. The approach is an extension of the formulation proposed by Chuang and Swenson [1981] for a single inlet connecting to a bay. This model is mostly appropriate for the examination of the first-order response of the bay to ocean fluctuations, as local forcing in the bay is not included. The along-channel depth-averaged momentum equation for the first and second channel (inlets) based on the balance between frictional effects and the elevation gradient between offshore and bay are and the continuity equation for the bay/channel system based on the changing volume of the bay as water flows through the inlets is where A e is the surface area of the bay; g e the sea level in the bay; g o the sea level in the ocean; with h n the water depth; W n the width and L n the length of channel n and r is the linear drag coefficient. Thus, the linearized bottom stress is s b n 5r n u n , for n 5 1,2. Assuming g5ge ixt and u5ue ixt yields the system of equations: for n 5 1,2. The ratio between linear friction and depth of the channel, x f 5 rn hn , can be defined as the characteristic frequency of frictional dissipation in the channel. The frequency of frictional dissipation is the inverse of the frictional adjustment time [Csanady, 1981] from linear drag. The ix term represents the phase shift between the frictional effect and the pressure forcing. Substituting into the continuity equation yields Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans The resulting expression for the water level in the interior of the bay is The denominator in the expression provides an approximation to the natural frequency of the bay in the absence of friction (Helmholtz frequency): is the natural frequency since the response of the bay will reach infinity as x ! x N . Several studies described the water level conditions for fluctuations near the Helmholtz frequency in single inlet-single bay systems [Sorensen and Seelig, 1977;Kowalik and Murty, 1993;Spaulding, 1994] and even multiple inletssingle bay systems [Freeman et al., 1974]. In general, for N number of inlets, we can define hn 1ix for n 5 1; . . . ; N and the resulting expression is In the case of offshore fluctuations of comparable size to the inlet depth, the term K n can be redefined to take into account the effect of the excess elevation affecting the depth of the inlet: An approximation to the increased response in frequencies near the natural frequency [Garrett, 1972;Sutherland et al., 2005] can be estimated as: To use the analytical model, an estimate of the linear friction coefficient was necessary. Scott and Csanady [1976] used a value of r58 3 10 23 m s 21 for a location off Long Island at 32 m bottom depth. Wong and DiLorenzo [1988] used the same value for their analytical model of two interconnected bays. Meanwhile, Figure 2.

However, in such a sizeable bay, amplitude and phase changes are expected in different areas of the system caused by the local balance between pressure gradient force, surface wind stress, and bottom friction. Analysis of the spatial pattern of water level requires model simulations and additional water level observations. While storms strongly contribute to the extreme elevation events, tides remain the main source of variability ( Figure 3) to the water level in GSB (over 50% of the variance at LIN is  Table 1 for key to station abbreviations. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318 explained by the tides). The tidal influence in GSB was much smaller than offshore (tides are about 90% of the variance at SH). Water level energy at LIN ( Figure 3) was smaller than at SH or at any of the other stations considered for all frequencies except long periods (greater than 10 days). The predominant tidal component at Lindenhurst is the M 2 with yearly amplitudes ranging 0.16-0.19 m (Table 4). The yearly M 2 amplitude at LIN was at an 8 year maximum in 2014 and at a minimum in 2012 (Table 4). The M 2 amplitude for 2013 was not significantly different than the average of the previous years 2008-2012 (consistent with Aretxabaleta et al. [2014]), whereas the amplitude for 2014 (November 2013 to October 2014) was significantly larger than previous years (P 5 0.05). A monthly time series of M 2 amplitude ( Figure 4a) showed a decrease in magnitude after a peak in May 2008 until reaching a minimum in January 2012. The amplitude remained stable during 2012 with a slight decrease after Hurricane Sandy (December 2012). There was an increase in magnitude starting in February 2013 (3 months after Hurricane Sandy) with a peak (0.195 m) in May 2014 and a decrease in magnitude since then. The maximum monthly amplitude change (0.01 m) occurred between March and April 2014. The second largest monthly increase occurred between January and March 2013. The amplitude of the M 2 was at an 8 year minimum in 2012 (Table 4). The monthly minimum occurred 2 months after the passage of Hurricane Irene (August 2011). The change in monthly M 2 amplitude was approximately 5% of the total monthly average. The amplitude of the next largest tidal constituent, K 1 (Figure 4d), was much smaller (0.04 m) than the M 2 and the RMS monthly variability was 0.005 m. The amplitude of the other main diurnal constituent, O 1 (Figure 4e), was less than 0.03 m. The next largest constituent, N 2 ( Figure 4b), with average amplitudes slightly larger than 0.03 m, had much smaller fluctuations than the other semidiurnal constituents included. Finally, the amplitude of the S 2 semidiurnal tide ( Figure 4c) was also slightly less than 0.03 m. The percentage changes of tidal amplitude for the remaining constituents considered were much larger (around 10-15%) than the M 2 changes in relation to their respective average value. The correlation between the fluctuations of M 2 amplitude and the other constituents were less than 0.2 (not significant). The monthly estimates of M 2 phase at LIN oscillated between 688 and 758 (3.58 uncertainty). Peaks in phase (increased lag) occurred 1-3 months after the hurricanes (48 increase after Irene and 28 after Sandy). However, the phases returned to average values after 2-3 months. Although small changes in phase lag after the two hurricane events were observed, there were changes of similar magnitude during nonstorm periods. The S 2 , N 2 , and K 1 tidal constituents had larger phase fluctuations but the errors in phase calculations were also much larger than the M 2 phase. The overtides and compound tides of the principal tidal constituents may be significant in some areas where nonlinearities dominate. The amplitude of the M 4 (0.018 m) and M 6 (0.012 m) tidal constituents at Lindenhurst were of a similar magnitude as at SH (0.015 and 0.016 m, respectively), but they are expected to be more sizeable in the proximity of Fire Island Inlet (no data available). The similar sizes of the overtides offshore and in the Bay suggest that the nonlinear frictional effects on the tide were only about 10% in the Bay and less than 2% in the ocean. The small overtides suggest that the linear drag coefficient in the inlet and bay used in the simple analytical model was appropriate, as nonlinear frictional effects might result in a much larger increase in the size of the overtides.

The tidal fluctuations at the JB station exceeded the offshore values and explained 93% of the Bay water level variance. The amplitude of the main tidal constituent, M 2 , was 0.79 m with less than 1% (not significant) interannual differences (Table 4). The M 2 was enhanced around 8% between offshore and the inlet (FRF) and about 16% between offshore and the Bay. The other main components of the tide at JB were N 2 (0.18 m), S 2 (0.15 m), K 1 (0.11 m), and O 1 (0.05 m). The ratio of the semidiurnal tides to the diurnal amplitudes was intensified compared to offshore conditions. There was no relationship between monthly variations in tidal amplitude and the timing of Hurricane Sandy or any other large storm. The overtides at FBF were around the same size as at SH suggesting small nonlinear contributions. Inside the Bay, the overtides were enhanced from values at SH by 60-80%. (M 4 , 0.027 m; M 6 , 0.027 m). The natural frequency of Jamaica Bay was about 2 h 21 and thus not a factor at the frequencies considered in this study. The response of Jamaica Bay to offshore forcing was investigated with the transfer function between SH and JB ( Figure 7a) and between SH and FBF. The transfer function between SH and FBF was close to unity (not shown), consistent with minor attenuation between the ocean proxy and the bay entrance. Bay water levels at JB were greater than offshore at most frequencies larger than 1 day 21 . The Rockaway Inlet channel is deeper than 10 m in many areas and thus frictional effects that reduce water exchange are small. The transfer values for periods between about 2 and 15 days were around 90% and fairly constant. The transfer for periods shorter than 45 h exceeded unity for diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies. The highfrequency transfers were enhanced inside Jamaica Bay and the small frictional effect was not sufficient to attenuate the oscillations. There was small interannual variability in the transfer function to JB with no significant change associated with any of the large storm events (hurricanes). The analytical model (Figure 7a), using a linear drag coefficient to provide a best least squares fit at the semidiurnal tidal transfer for all years (r 5 0.009 m s 21 ), overestimated the transfer at most other frequencies. The primary mismatch in the predicted transfer was at low frequencies, where the model Figure 7.

The solid blue line is the analytical model (section 4) with one single opening and a linear friction coefficient matching the M 2 transfer for the average of all years for (a) Rockaway Inlet, (b) East Rockaway Inlet, and (c) Jones Inlet. The dashed blue line represents the analytical model adjusted to match the transfer at zero and M 2 frequencies. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318 predicted a full transfer of water level at zero frequency, as offshore fluctuations would have infinite time to enter the bay. The observations suggested only around 90% of the low-frequency offshore fluctuations were present at JB. The analytical model was adjusted to provide the best fit in the least squares sense to the observed transfer at zero and M 2 frequencies. The resulting linear drag coefficient was r 5 0.014 m s 21 . The predicted transfer function more closely matched the 90% transfer at low frequencies, and continued to closely match at M 2 (95% of the energy). The linear friction for the adjusted model was close to the value for GSB and was likely more realistic. The resulting model approximated the observed diurnal transfer and only slightly overestimated transfer in the storm band. The skill of the analytical model is limited by the assumption that the bay water level is controlled by inlet friction. In Jamaica Bay, water level, especially the semidiurnal tide, behaves more like a reflected cooscillation between offshore and bay."}, {"section_title": "East Rockaway Inlet Bay System", "text": "The East Rockaway Inlet bay system includes the areas directly affected by the flow through East Rockaway Inlet (ERI). The inlet is directly connected with the narrow (200 m) and long (5000 m) Reynolds Channel. The length and width of the channel might suggest strong frictional effects, but these geometric constraints are compensated by the small area of the adjacent bay system. The dominant tidal amplitude at Hog Island Channel (HIC) was the M 2 with values around 0.64 m and small interannual changes (Table 4). The maximum annual amplitude of the M 2 constituent at HIC was in 2012, but the monthly maximum was in June 2014, the same time as the maximum observed at LIN. While the overtides were small (M 4 , 0.003 m; M 6 , 0.015 m) in the proximity of the inlet at ERI, they were slightly enhanced (M 4 , 0.016 m; M 6 , 0.024 m) in the interior of the Bay. The transfer function between SH and HIC ( Figure 7b) was close to unity (between 0.9 and 1) for all frequencies. There were some interannual differences but mostly in frequencies with limited energy (Table 3) and high uncertainties (low coherence between the time series). While transfer of the diurnal tides exhibited some interannual changes (smaller O 1 transfer during 2011), the transfers at semidiurnal frequencies for all years were similar in magnitude. There was a slight (not significant) transfer enhancement in periods around 18-21 h, but the energy in that band was small (0.002 m 2 , Table 3) and the uncertainty quite high (up to 30% in that band). About half of the attenuation between SH and HIC occurred between the East Rockaway Inlet (ERI) station and HIC. The analytical model (Figure 7b) overestimated the transfer at low frequencies (periods larger than 2 days), while slightly under predicting the diurnal transfer values. The long Reynolds Channel caused a minimum change in transfer across the spectrum and resulted in low linear friction estimates for the analytical model (r 5 0.009 m s 21 )."}, {"section_title": "Jones Inlet Bay System", "text": "The bay system to the west of Great South Bay includes the areas directly affected by the flow through Jones Inlet. The dominant tidal amplitude at Hudson Bay at Freeport (HBF) was the M 2 with values around 0.56 m and interannual changes on the order of 4% (Table 4). The largest yearly M 2 amplitudes (Table 4) (Figure 8) were of the same size as the M 2 changes, but much larger in proportion to their respective average amplitudes. The transfer function between SH and HBF ( Figure 7c) was between 75 and 95% for all frequencies (except in some bands of very low energy). Most of the reduction in transfer occurred between SH and Point Lookout (PL) as the transfer between PL and HBF was close to unity except for a 5% reduction of the semidiurnal tides. The transfers in the storm band were between 80 and 95% with higher values during 2011 and 2014. For the diurnal tides, the O 1 transfer was smaller during 2011 than any other year (as in HIC). The transfer at the M 2 frequency was slightly smaller during 2012 (change was around 1%), which was consistent with the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318 M 2 amplitudes from the harmonic analysis (Figure 8a). The interannual changes in the other semidiurnal frequencies were smaller than 5% and with no clear temporal pattern. The analytical model (Figure 7c) with a friction coefficient that provided the best fit in the least squares sense of the transfer of the M 2 tide (linear friction of 0.02 m s 21 ) overestimated the transfer at periods longer than 2 days, but reproduced the diurnal transfer (similar to Jamaica Bay). The observations suggested that between 90% and 95% of the near-zero frequency offshore fluctuations were present at HBF. If the analytical model was adjusted (r 5 0.011 m s 21 ) to provide a best fit of the observed transfer at zero and M 2 frequencies (95% of the energy), the resulting transfer approximated the observed storm band transfer but underestimated the diurnal tidal transfer."}, {"section_title": "All Connected Bay Systems", "text": "A formulation that considered all the inlets and channels between connected bays (all except Jamaica Bay) in the southern Long Island bay system was developed (section 5). The multibay formulation permitted the simultaneous calculation of water level transfer for all bays and also allowed for the estimation of the transfer in both Shinnecock and Moriches Bay, where observations were not available. The results of the multibay formulation ( Figure 9) were consistent with the transfers described in the previous section. The analytical model captured the diurnal and semidiurnal transfers at HIC and HBF and showed skill in the tidal transfers at LIN (with the exception of the enhanced O 1 transfer as described previously). It slightly overestimated the transfer in subtidal frequencies at LIN and overpredicted the subtidal response at HIC and HBF (because of the observed transfer at very low frequencies not matching unity as predicted in the theory). The friction coefficient was 0.016 m s 21 for all connected bays except an enhanced friction of 0.035 m s 21 for the Wilderness Breach. The modeled transfer response in Moriches Bay was around 55% at semidiurnal frequencies (consistent with offshore/bay tidal gradients from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, [2001]), between 65 and 70% at diurnal frequencies, and 80-90% at storm frequencies. In the case of Shinnecock Bay, the estimated transfer coefficients were slightly higher with 90-95% transfer at storm frequencies, approximately 70% transfer at semidiurnal frequencies (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [2001] provided tidal differences between offshore and bays corresponding to 70-75%), and 80-85% transfer at the diurnal frequencies. These values were sensitive to the choice of linear friction used for the analytical model. If the offshore to bay semidiurnal tidal amplitude ratio from offshore to Moriches and Shinnecock Bays from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [2001] was used to estimate the friction coefficient at Moriches Inlet and Shinnecock Inlet, the resulting friction was 0.014 m s 21 at Moriches Inlet and 0.013 m s 21 at Shinnecock Inlet.

The strength of the M 2 amplitude at LIN (Figure 4) ranged from 0.16 m to about 0.19 m over the period 2008-2015. Increases in M 2 at LIN of about 0.01 m in April 2008 and April 2014 followed dredging of Fire Island Inlet and Jones Inlet. An increase of about 0.02 m in February to March 2013 occurred following dredging of Fire Island Inlet, and a simultaneous increase in the cross section of the Wilderness Breach by a factor of 3-4 (from around 100 m 2 in December 2012 to almost 300 m 2 in February 2013 and over 400 m 2 in March 2013, http://po.msrc.sunysb.edu/GSB/). Nearly identical minimum M 2 amplitudes (0.157 m) over the period 2008-2015 followed Hurricanes Irene and Sandy by about 1 month. Decreases in tidal amplitude occurred after major storm activity (-0.01 m in September 2011 after Hurricane Irene; 20.003 m in December 2012 after Hurricane Sandy). The correlation between M 2 amplitudes at LIN and Wilderness Breach cross-section area after December 2012 (15 observations) was R 2 5 0.81 (P < 10 25 ). There was no clear change in the N 2 , S 2 , K 1 , or O 1 constituents at LIN associated with the M 2 events; however, the amplitude of the diurnal (K 1 , O 1 ) and the other semidiurnal (N 2 and S 2 ) amplitudes was less than 0.04 m (60.01 m), making it difficult to identify changes smaller than 0.01 m. The correlation between the amplitudes of N 2 , S 2 , K 1, and O 1 constituents and the breach cross section was between 0.05 and 0.3. One of the minima in M 2 amplitude at HBF also occurred during the period between Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. The increase in M 2 amplitude at HBF in early 2008 occurred at the time of a dredging project in Jones Inlet. The monthly amplitude peak at HBF in May 2014 occurred after the spring 2014 Jones Inlet dredging. The correlation between M 2 amplitudes at HBF and Wilderness Breach cross-section area was R 2 5 0.24 (P 5 0.06). The timing of the dredging projects appears to be associated with an increase in the amplitude of the dominant tidal component (M 2 ). The largest changes in the M 2 at LIN and HBF were observed in the 1-2 months after dredging was reported in Jones Inlet and Fire Island Inlet. The effect of dredging subsides after periods Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318 between a few months and a year. Fluctuations in the size of the Wilderness Breach also appear to have affected the increase in M 2 amplitude in Great South Bay after Hurricane Sandy (high correlations), but they cannot explain the changes at LIN before the opening of the inlet or the changes at HBF. While we are able to evaluate the effects of dredging at times when no breach is present, to separate the contribution of the changing breach size we would need a case when a breach was present without any dredging intervention, but such a case was not available in the observed record. The combined impacts of Hurricanes Irene and Sandy caused erosion of the modern sediment deposit on the inner shelf offshore of Fire Island, with sediment transported in a general southwesterly direction [Schwab et al., 2013[Schwab et al., , 2016. Surveys of the shoreface and subaerial components of Fire Island indicate that the eroded sediment was not transferred to the shoreface or adjacent barrier [Schwab et al., 2016]. Some of the mobilized sediments were likely deposited in the Fire Island Inlet system in the months following Sandy. The additional sediment would have altered the size and effective depth of the inlet resulting in smaller water level transfer in the months after the Hurricanes Irene and Sandy."}, {"section_title": "Independence of Transfer From Fluctuation Amplitude", "text": "To evaluate changes in vulnerability due to the size of storm-induced fluctuations, we consider the possibility that water level associated with intense storms might have larger proportional effect (i.e., larger transfers) in the bays than smaller oscillations. Aretxabaleta et al. [2014] showed that the daily maximum subtidal water levels for large events recorded during the period 2007-2013 followed the same linear relationship as the subtidal water level of smaller fluctuations. To test the effect of the size of the fluctuations on the transfer response, we separated times with large and small low-frequency fluctuations. Two time series of unfiltered observations were created for LIN: one including times when low-pass filtered data (5 day low-pass filter) exceeded 0.1 m and another for times when the filtered data were below 0.1 m. Time series of unfiltered SH observations were also created for the periods of large and small fluctuations identified in the two LIN series. The transfer between SH and LIN was calculated for both time series using the unfiltered data ( Figure 10). The differences in tidal frequencies were negligible (less than 2%). The transfer of small fluctuations was 10-30% smaller in the low-frequency band because the 0.1 m cutoff limited the size of observations in that band. There were also reduced transfers around the inertial band likely as a result of the limited inertial effects in the bay. The uncertainty in the inertial band was also large. In the storm band (2-5 days), the values of transfer of large fluctuations were sometimes higher (up to 10%) and sometimes lower (less than 28%) than the values for small fluctuations. The differences in the storm band averaged 2.5% and were within the uncertainty envelope [Bendat and Piersol, 1986]. The analysis highlights the independence of the transfer from the magnitude of the fluctuations at a specific frequency. An underlying assumption for the predictive capability of the model for extreme events is that the physics of the inlet/bay system remain the same even during large fluctuations. During extreme storm events (e.g., 1938 Hurricane, Hurricane Sandy), the conditions in the inlet might be altered (e.g., increased bottom roughness caused by waves, increased inlet depth caused by surge and wave setup) and the barrier island might over top. Some of the effects might be partially offsetting (deeper inlet results in less bottom friction, while waves cause higher friction due to increased roughness). However, these effects could alter bay water level response Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "Comparison With Alternative Analytical Model", "text": "The model proposed in section 4 matched the transfer relationship obtained with the Chuang and Swenson [1981] formulation (Figure 11) when only a single inlet was considered. The inclusion of the second inlet to GSB in the analytical model provided information regarding the different frictional character of both inlets (Wilderness Breach was more frictional). Additionally, the analytical model can be compared with other formulations. Garrett [1972] proposed a simple model for a bay system in near-resonance connected to the open ocean. The Garrett formulation has been applied to multiple systems (Juan de Fuca Strait [Sutherland et al., 2005]; Bay of Hudson [Arbic et al., 2007]). After some simplifications, the water level ''enhancement'' can be expressed as Dg e 5 cos \u00f0 1 4 The linear friction parameter, r b , in this model is the friction that attenuates the near-resonance fluctuation inside the bay rather in the channel. The resulting curve applied to GSB ( Figure  11) matched the presented model in the semidiurnal frequencies after minor frictional adjustments (Garrett model required less friction to match semidiurnal transfers), but slightly overestimated the transfer at low frequencies. While both models differ in their representation, they included some common physics and comparable assumptions and thus produced similar results. The similar behavior of the models in GSB could be explained by the fact that most of the bay friction in the Garrett model is likely to occur in the vicinity of the inlet. The Garrett model represents a better approximation to systems where the inlet friction contribution to bay water level dynamics is more limited (e.g., current geometry of Jamaica Bay). A complementary method to address the robustness of the linear approach will be a comparison with a fully nonlinear threedimensional hydrodynamic model simulation, but such modeling is beyond the scope of this study."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Model Application: Factors Controlling Transfer in Jamaica Bay", "text": "Over the last several decades, there has been a reduction in marsh and seagrass beds in Jamaica Bay due to human impacts [NYCDEP, 2007]. The surface area of the bay has been reduced from 101 km 2 in the mid nineteenth century to 53 km 2 , while the volume of the bay has increased 350% [NYCDEP, 2007]. Increases in tidal ranges seem to be a consequence of natural and engineering modifications that occurred in the bay during the first half of the twentieth century. Swanson and Wilson [2008] proposed that there was a relation between Figure 11. Predictions of sea level transfer coefficient for Great South Bay for various models and friction coefficients.

The analytical model (Section 4) was used to estimate the relative importance of changes in area and water depth on the water level response of the bay. Using conditions valid for the 1800s (approximately double bay area and about half of the inlet depth [NYCDEP, 2007]), the model predicted a slight reduction in the bay response (less transfer). The reduction resulted from the combined effect of the larger area and additional friction along the shallower Rockaway Inlet. Under current bay conditions, the increased water depth along the inlet and the maintenance of the navigation channel though periodic dredging resulted in a larger transfer of water level from offshore (close to unity in the storm band). The larger inlet depth and width appear to be the controlling factors that facilitated the exchange with the offshore and might have affected the marsh and seagrass beds in Jamaica Bay. The analytical results are consistent with hydrodynamic modeling simulations of the area [Orton et al., 2015] that quantified the effect of narrowing and shallowing Rockaway Inlet. The potential benefit of different restorative approaches (e.g., inlet narrowing and/or shallowing and bay shallowing) are now being explored (http://adaptmap.info/)."}, {"section_title": "Additional Mechanisms Affecting Water Level in Bays", "text": "The most relevant cause of the bulk exchange between the bay and the shelf is the remote forcing by winds and tides. Meanwhile, local wind forcing can dominate the transport and exchange inside the bay. The contribution of local wind acting directly on the surface of the bay also causes current fluctuations and water level setup, especially in large bays. Wong and Moses-Hall [1998] found remote effects were more important to the bulk estuary exchange (e.g., water level) in Delaware Bay, while local effects controlled the transport and distribution of materials. In the presence of strong stratification, vertical shear in velocity is expected as a response to local wind stress [Garvine, 1985;Wong and Moses-Hall, 1998;Janzen and Wong, 2002] affecting the frictional balance and slightly affecting water level. Lateral changes in bathymetry over the cross section of the bay alter the pressure gradient balance in the bay affecting water level and currents [Csanady, 1973;Signell et al., 1990]. Additionally, wave setup associated with intense wind events (e.g., nor'easters and hurricanes) might be present offshore along the coast and can also be transferred into the bays and enhance water level response in the bay interior [Olabarrieta et al., 2011]. During intense storm events, the barrier island might overtop (overwash) resulting in additional transfer from the ocean into the bays. Under these conditions, the assumption of inlet dynamics being the only constraint to the flow into the bay will no longer be valid."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Considerations", "text": "While several processes control offshore sea level (tides, wind, current, and pressure systems), long-term sea level rise [Douglas, 1991;Church and White, 2006;Ezer, 2013] has a larger effect on the response of barrier islands to water level. Published sea level rise rates at a nearby station (New York The Battery), range from 5 mm yr 21 for the long-term rate, to 8 mm yr 21 for the trend after the year 2000 [Ezer, 2013]. The bay water level trend for the period 2007-2015 was 6.3 mm yr 21 at LIN, while at SH was 7.4 mm yr 21 (compared to the estimates of 13.5 mm yr 21 at LIN and 10.6 mm yr 21 at SH for 2007-2013 in Aretxabaleta et al. [2014]). The reduced trend in water level rise was a result of a drop in 2015 that can be at least partially explained by the effects of the intense 2014-2015 El Ni\u00f1o. When the rates were calculated for 2007-2014 (excluding the 2015 data), the rates were 11.8 mm yr 21 at LIN and 9.3 mm yr 21 at SH. The relatively short-term trends calculated need to be taken with caution as sea levels along the northeast show significant year-to-year fluctuations [Goddard et al., 2015] and can result in overestimations of sea level rise rates. However, these rates are consistent with recent trend estimates in the MAB [Church and White, 2006;Ezer, 2013] and are faster than the global rate of sea level rise [Douglas, 1991;Sallenger et al., 2012]. The magnitudes of the changes in M2 tidal amplitudes (order 0.02 m) during the 8 year study period were about one-third the changes caused by sea level rise (order 0.06 m)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The water level response in semienclosed bays in southern Long Island, New York to offshore forcing was explored using observations from several water level stations and an analytical model. The main drivers of water level fluctuations in the bays are offshore tides, storm surge, and longer-term changes such as sea level rise. The area of the bay and the number and size of the connections with the offshore determine the magnitude of the transfer of offshore fluctuations into the bays. Fluctuations at tidal frequencies were reduced in bays with large areas and small connections (e.g., Great South Bay) and sometimes enhanced in Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2016JC012318 small area bays with large connections (e.g., Jamaica Bay). The transfer of low-frequency fluctuations in all bays was near unity and thus long-term sea level rise was fully transmitted into the back-barrier bays. In the analyzed period, the average response of the bays is independent of the magnitude of the offshore fluctuations at a specific frequency. Changes in M 2 tidal constituent amplitudes following intense storms, such as Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, were small. A ten percent increase in the M 2 tidal amplitude at Lindenhurst (0.02 m) in spring 2014, coincided with dredging in nearby Fire Island Inlet and Jones Inlet and occurred during an increase in cross section of the Wilderness Breach. The relative importance of the near-simultaneous geomorphological changes in bay water level after December 2012 was difficult to separate. An increase of 0.01 m in April 2008 occurred following dredging of Fire Island and Jones Inlet. These observations suggest dredging can increase the amplitude of the M 2 tide in these back-barrier bays. The sea level rise-induced increase in water level exceeded 0.06 m during the period 2007-2015, 3 times larger than observed fluctuations in M 2 amplitude. Enhanced transfer (at most frequencies) between the offshore and bays, especially in Great South Bay and the areas surrounding Jones Inlet occurred during and following geomorphic changes (e.g., dredging) within the bays and inlets. An analytical model, based on the balance between friction and pressure gradient in the inlet, predicts the transfer of offshore sea level fluctuations to back-barrier bays as a function of the size of the inlets, the area of the bays, and friction in the inlets. The model was matched to the observed transfer from offshore at most spectral frequencies by adjusting the value of the linearized friction. The model is applicable to any bay system for which inlet friction acts as the main controlling factor of the water level exchange into the bays. An expanded model that included the multiple connections with the offshore and between the bays was developed and allowed for estimates of the transfer response in Moriches and Shinnecock bays, where observations were unavailable. The model provides a simple framework for the study of the water level changes in back-barrier bays caused by changes in geomorphology, storm events, and sea level rise."}]
