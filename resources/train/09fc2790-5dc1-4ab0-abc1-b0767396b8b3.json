[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Confidence assessment (CA), in which students state alongside each of their answers a confidence level expressing how certain they are, has been employed successfully within higher education. However, it has not been widely explored with school pupils. This study examined how school mathematics pupils (N=345) in five different secondary schools in England responded to the use of a CA instrument designed to incentivise the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings in the topic of directed (positive and negative) numbers. Pupils readily understood the negative marking aspect of the CA process and their facility correlated with their mean confidence with r=.546, N=336, p<.001, indicating that pupils were generally well calibrated. Pupils' comments indicated that the vast majority were positive about the CA approach, despite its dramatic differences from more usual assessment practices in UK schools. Some pupils felt that CA promoted deeper thinking, increased their confidence and had a potential role to play in classroom formative assessment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Fluency in important mathematical procedures is now recognised as a critical goal within the learning of school mathematics (Gardiner, 2014 ; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2014) . Rather than constituting a threat to conceptual understanding, procedural fluency is its natural partner (Foster, 2013; Hewitt, 1996; Kent & Foster, 2015; Kieran, 2013) . Indeed, procedural and conceptual learning are now increasingly seen to be interrelated and inseparable (Baroody, Feil, & Johnson, 2007; Star, 2005 Star, , 2007 , since security with fundamental procedures offers pupils increased power to explore more complicated mathematics at a conceptual level (Foster, 2014) . East Asian countries with impressive performances in large-scale international assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) succeed in emphasising the development of mathematical fluency without resorting to the low-level rote learning of procedures (Askew, Hodgen, Hossain, & Bretscher, 2010; Fan & Bokhove, 2014; Leung, 2014) . Finding ways to support the meaningful learning of mathematical procedures and the development of robust fluency with important mathematical skills is an urgent priority for Western mathematics education. The new national curriculum for mathematics in England, for example, emphasises procedural fluency as the first stated aim (Department for Education [DfE] , 2013) and provides a political imperative in the UK for developing this important aspect of learning mathematics.\nProcedural fluency involves knowing when and how to apply a procedure and being able to perform it \"accurately, efficiently, and flexibly\" (NCTM, 2014, p. 1) . Written mathematics assessments generally focus on competence with procedures, but an important concomitant of procedural competence is the pupil's confidence in the answers that they give (Kyriacou, 2005) . If a pupil's performance of a mathematical procedure does not result in an answer that the pupil believes is very likely to be correct, then it is not a useful tool for them; under such circumstances it would be better to approach the problem by some other method, seek help or use a calculator or computer to give a reliable answer. Thus for secure development of procedural fluency it is important not only that a pupil can obtain the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time but that they have an accurate sense of their reliability with the procedure.\nIt is common in preparation for summative assessments for school pupils to be instructed to guess any answers of which they are unsure. This may be presented as an aspect of \"examination technique\", since leaving a blank response is guaranteed to result in the award of no marks, so any answer is better than none (Foster, 2007) . However, in any practical circumstance beyond an educational setting, a person's knowing whether they know is extremely important, as it determines whether additional support (from other people, a computer or a reference source) is required. For example, it is much better to know that you do not know the value of \u22122 + 7, although you think that it might be \u22125, than it is to be sure that it is \u22125 when in fact it is 5. In the classroom too, it is clearly extremely valuable for the teacher to know whether a pupil's incorrect response is a wild guess or whether it might constitute evidence of a deep-seated misunderstanding or misconception. Thus knowing how strongly the pupil believes in the answer that they are giving can be potentially very helpful formative assessment for the teacher in judging what subsequent learning activities or interventions might be most appropriate.\nThis important kind of confidence is unlikely to be captured by pupils' global judgments of their feelings of confidence for mathematics or particular topics within the mathematics curriculum. Much research has been carried out in the field of affect, such as explorations into the interplay between cognition, beliefs and attitudes (Di Martino & Zan, 2011; Hannula, 2011; Pepin & Roesken-Winter, 2014) . However, broad constructs at the subject level, such as \"mathematics confidence\" (Pierce & Stacey, 2004) , are too general for the purpose here. Even a topic-level perception of confidence, such as \"I am good at negative numbers\", is of limited usefulness when faced with a specific calculation such as \u22122 + 7. Within any particular topic, competence may vary significantly at the level of detail of particular questions, so it is important to explore pupils' confidence at a similarly fine-grained level. Pupils whose confidence and competence are strongly correlated are said to be \"well calibrated\": An individual is well calibrated if, over the long run, for all propositions assigned a given probability, the proportion that is true is equal to the probability assigned. For example, half of those statements assigned a probability of .50 of being true should be true, as should 60 % of those assigned .60, and all of those about which the individual is 100 % certain. (Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1977, p. 552) It follows that in order to remain well calibrated, a pupil whose competence varies across some domain needs also to have varying confidence levels across that same domain.\nIn this study I examine the relationship between the confidence and competence of school pupils within an important secondary mathematics topic: directed (positive and negative) numbers. I explore how well calibrated pupils are within this topic by using an instrument designed to incentivise the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings. I examine pupils' comments on the use of this instrument and discuss what roles such tools might be able to play in formative and summative assessment within school mathematics."}, {"section_title": "Confidence and competence", "text": "Within the mathematics education literature, confidence has been construed in different ways. The Confidence in Learning Mathematics Scale within the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales (MAS) (Fennema & Sherman, 1976) has been used extensively to study pupils' attitudes towards mathematics (Lim & Chapman, 2013) . Taking a social perspective, Burton (2004, p. 360 ) saw confidence as \"a label for a confluence of feelings relating to beliefs about the self, and about one's efficacy to act within a social setting, in this case the mathematics classroom\". More specifically, Galbraith and Haines (1998) \nStudents with high mathematics confidence believe they obtain value for effort, do not worry about learning hard topics, expect to get good results, and feel good about mathematics as a subject. Students with low confidence are nervous about learning new material, expect that all mathematics will be difficult, feel that they are naturally weak at mathematics, and worry more about mathematics than any other subject. (p. 278) Similar to this, Pierce and Stacey (2004, p. 290 ) defined mathematics confidence, as \"a student's perception of their ability to attain good results and their assurance that they can handle difficulties in mathematics\". Some of these notions of confidence encompass mathematical self-efficacy, which is a pupil's belief in advance about their likelihood of successfully performing a particular mathematical task. Bandura (1977) argued that a person's self-efficacy is a major factor in whether they will attempt a given task, how much effort they will be prepared to put in, and how resilient they will be when difficulties arise. More recently the construct of mathematical resilience has been developed to capture the ways in which pupils overcome barriers to learning mathematics (Johnston-Wilder & Lee, 2010) .\nMany factors, both within and outside the classroom, are likely to be important in affecting a pupil's mathematical self-confidence. A meta-analysis of studies on gender differences in mathematics (Frost, Hyde, & Fennema, 1994) found that girls had lower mathematics selfconcept/confidence than boys and greater mathematics anxiety, although the effect sizes were small. Girls' self-confidence is lower in general (Hannula, Maijala, Pehkonen, & Nurmi, 2005; Leder, 1995) , and there is evidence that this effect is more marked in higher-attaining sets (Jones, 1995) . In a case study of two schools, Boaler (1998) found that at the school where pupils were taught mathematics in attainment sets and used a traditional, textbook approach, boys showed greater confidence than girls. However, at the school which used all-attainment classes and open-ended activities there was no difference between boys' and girls' confidence. It is likely that multiple factors are important, so drawing simplistic conclusions from this one study should be avoided.\nHowever, in contrast to research in which confidence is viewed broadly as an overall perception of learning mathematics, the focus in this paper is on pupils' confidence with regard to their responses to specific items. Whereas mathematical self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977) involves a pupil's anticipatory judgment about their likelihood of successfully answering a particular mathematical item, in this study pupils were invited to ascribe a confidence level after the item was completed. This is quite different, since at this point the mathematics called on, and its demands, are known, and the reasonableness of the answer can also be assessed (Morony, Kleitman, Lee, & Stankov, 2013) . Stankov, Lee, Luo and Hogan (2012) defined confidence as \"a state of being certain about the success of a particular behavioral act\" (p. 747), and in this study I consider a pupil's \"confidence of response\" as how certain they are that the answer that they have just given is correct. Unlike self-efficacy, this kind of confidence is after-the-fact and can even be ascribed to answers produced by another pupil.\nIt is natural to see the variables confidence and competence as defining a two-dimensional space (Fig. 1) . Well-calibrated pupils (Fischhoff et al., 1977) , whose confidence closely matches their competence, would be located near to the diagonal line in Fig. 1 , with overconfident and under-confident pupils taking positions on either side. Viewed in this way, traditional assessments which measure only competence give a partial and perhaps misleading picture. Gattegno (1987) \"2+3\" with a querying intonation \"Five?\" as opposed to a more declamatory \"Five!\", interpreting these as manifestations of differing levels of confidence that could require quite different teacher responses. Both for summative and for formative purposes, it may be extremely important to know where pupils are positioned horizontally in Fig. 1 , as well as vertically.\nPupils' responses in the classroom (both oral and written) can range from a wild guess to an assured answer, and the level of confidence has a potential role to play within formative assessment (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall, & Wiliam, 2003; Black & Wiliam, 1998 , 2009 Clark, 2015; Warwick, Shaw, & Johnson, 2015) . Gardner-Medwin and Gahan (2003) described students with different levels of belief regarding a true statement as being in a state of \"knowledge, uncertainty, ignorance, misconception [or] delusion\", commenting that ignorance is \"far from the worst state to be in\" (p. 147). The teacher might choose to intervene in quite different ways with two pupils with similar competence but very different confidence. A pupil with high competence but low confidence (represented by the dot in the top left of Fig. 1 ) might be encouraged to return to ideas with which they are confident and build from there, whereas a pupil with high but misplaced confidence (represented by the dot in the bottom right of Fig. 1 ) might benefit from experiencing some cognitive conflict to challenge relevant misconceptions (see the arrows in Fig. 1 ). In both cases, movement towards better calibration is desired, but this might be effected in quite different ways."}, {"section_title": "Confidence assessment", "text": "Confidence is difficult to assess reliably, since pupils may be inclined to exaggerate their confidence in order to win the approval of the teacher (or fend off unwanted attention) or raise their status in the eyes of their peers (Hannula, 2003) . The common classroom practices of asking pupils to indicate by raising their hands whether they are sure (yes or no) or to specify their level of confidence using traffic lights (red/amber/green) both suffer from this problem of over-reporting. Inviting pupils to explain their reasoning can be a powerful technique for formative assessment of confidence, but may become repetitive and unengaging for the rest of the class -and explanations can be rote learned as well as procedures (Kent & Foster, 2015) .\nConfidence-based assessment (CA) is one practical solution to the problem of accurately measuring pupils' confidence, and this now plays an important role in higher education in the study of medicine and related disciplines (Gardner-Medwin, 1995 , 2006 Schoendorfer & Emmett, 2012) . It is easy to see the need for medical practitioners to recognise when they are uncertain of a course of action, as mistakes can be costly in human terms. Such assessment practices seek to reward self-awareness by giving marks for confidence in correct responses while subtracting marks for misplaced confidence in incorrect responses. Typically, students are asked to give a confidence level of 1, 2 or 3 for each of their responses. If their response is correct, the number of marks that they receive for that question is the same as their chosen confidence level. However, if their response is incorrect, they instead receive a penalty of 0, 2 or 6 marks respectively (Gardner-Medwin, 1998) . Thus, more confident responses are rewarded more highly if correct but penalised more severely if incorrect. The particular values used here are calculated so that a person behaving rationally and seeking to maximise their expected score will be motivated to state their true confidence level and not be rewarded for either excessive timidity (underreporting their confidence) or excessive bravado (exaggerating their confidence).\nIt has been found that university students tend to be poorly calibrated and in general overestimate their performance, being unaware of their own ignorance (the Dunning-Kruger effect: Ehrlinger, Johnson, Banner, Dunning, & Kruger, 2008) , but this seems to improve with practice (Gardner-Medwin & Curtin, 2007) . The effect of CA over time should self-correct, because if a CA is well designed a pupil cannot do consistently well by guessing or by systematically over-or under-reporting their confidence level. Studies have found that asking university students to consider how sure they are about an answer prompts them to question why they believe it to be correct, leading to self-checking, self-explanation and higher-level reasoning (Gardner-Medwin & Curtin, 2007) . CA has been found to encourage students to focus on understanding rather than just performance and to think more carefully before giving an answer, with students sometimes changing their answer in response to a request for a confidence level (Issroff & GardnerMedwin, 1998) . Little personality or gender effect among university students has been found (Gardner-Medwin & Gahan, 2003) .\nIt seems likely that if CA can be adapted appropriately for school mathematics pupils then some of these benefits might carry across. However, there are possible barriers to implementing CA in schools. Pupils experience anxiety in relation to most kinds of assessment, and this could influence their perceptions of confidence. Negative marking protocols that penalise guessing can be complicated and unfamiliar to school pupils and their teachers. The practice of negative marking can be viewed as punishing pupils for what they do not know, as well as rewarding them for what they do know, and thus could be thought to conflict with a \"positive\" classroom ethos (Foster, 2007) . It might also be feared that CA could weaken pupils' self-confidence; however, this is desirable when that confidence is misplaced. CA attempts to increase appropriate levels of self-confidence and to support realistic self-awareness in order to facilitate future growth (Dweck, 2000) . It is an empirical question to what extent CA might be successfully applied to school mathematics. So, as part of a larger body of work exploring different aspects of mathematical fluency, in this study I seek to answer the research questions:\n1. How do school mathematics pupils respond to the use of a CA instrument designed to incentivise the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings? How easy or difficult do they find it to understand? How readily or not do they accept it as a formative assessment tool? 2. What is the relationship between school mathematics pupils' confidence and competence within the topic of directed (positive and negative) numbers? In particular, how well calibrated are pupils within this topic?"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "A mixed methods approach was taken so as to take advantage of the complementary strengths of quantitative and qualitative perspectives and mitigate the limitations of each (Ercikan & Roth, 2009 ). The overall intention was to obtain a more complete understanding of pupils' responses to the CA instrument than would be provided by either approach alone. A 10-item instrument was designed in order to measure pupils' responses and confidence levels for directed numbers items so that the correlation between facility and confidence could be calculated in order to determine how well calibrated the pupils were. The instrument also contained a space for open comments regarding the process, which would be analysed qualitatively in order to elicit in an open-ended way pupils' perceptions on the convenience, usefulness and acceptability of the CA approach."}, {"section_title": "Instrument", "text": "The instrument (Fig. 2) consisted of 10 items involving calculating with directed numbers (positive and negative numbers and zero). Directed numbers was chosen as the mathematical topic because it is on the school curriculum for a wide range of ages and it was felt that a useful connection might be made between the mathematics and the CA scoring system for the pupils' responses. It was hoped that this would help the pupils to understand the details of the negative marking of the CA approach more easily, since this would be their first encounter with such a system. Pupils were asked to write down for each item whatever response they thought was correct and to state for each response how confident they were that it was correct. They were asked to give a whole number from 0 to 10 inclusive to indicate how sure they were of each response. It was explained that their total mark would be calculated as the sum of the \"how sure\" values for the correct responses minus the sum of the \"how sure\" values for the incorrect responses. It was intended that pupils would regard the confidence scale as linear, since every extra mark that they staked on a response would increase or decrease their total by 1. Although scoring confidence on a 0-10 scale might suggest very fine discernment of confidence levels, a 0-10 scale (rather than, for example, a 1-3 scale, as mentioned above) was intended to simplify the interpretation for the pupils, since the maximum possible score for the 10 items would be 100, as in more familiar school tests which give a percentage total mark."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Fourteen classes of pupils in five secondary schools in three different cities in the UK completed the task.

Classes from Year 7 (age 11-12), Year 8 (age 12-13) and Year 9 (age 13-14) were used. In most schools in the UK, mathematics classes are set by attainment, and this was the case for all of the schools in this study apart from school A, which operated a mixedattainment policy for these year groups. Teachers reported on the attainment of each class, and these were described as \"high\", \"middle\" and \"low\", indicating the relevant tertile within the school."}, {"section_title": "Administration", "text": "The instructions given orally to pupils by their teachers were:\nPlease do this sheet on your own and without using a calculator or any books or number lines.

This tells the teacher that you're comfortable, when you're not\" (Pupil 203)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We will now consider the findings under the headings of the research questions given earlier.\n6.1 How do school mathematics pupils respond to the use of a CA instrument designed to incentivise the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings? How easy or difficult do they find it to understand? How readily or not do they accept it as a formative assessment tool?\nIt is clear that pupils understood the CA instrument very readily. The observed large correlation (Cohen, 1992) between facility and confidence implies that pupils were attempting to give true confidence levels, and the clear impression from the comments given was that students were concerned to maximise their score by deploying their confidence ratings appropriately. This means that the confidence responses can potentially be of considerable value to teachers for formative assessment purposes, since they offer a reliable way of probing pupils' confidence at an item-level. However, some caution is needed here because the schools and teachers participating in this study were a convenience sample and may not be representative of schools and teachers more generally.\nThe vast majority of pupils strongly accepted the CA approach, despite its dramatic differences from usual assessment practices in UK schools. The overwhelmingly positive nature of the comments indicate that on the whole the pupils welcomed its potential benefits to themselves and their teachers. Pupils recognised the importance of assessing their confidence and on the whole felt that the instrument did so fairly. Several pupils suggested that the CA process prompted deeper thinking about their answers and increased their confidence. Further study would be needed to determine whether these perceptions were accurate and to assess teachers' perceptions of the usefulness of the instrument.\nIt seems likely from this that a CA approach could give teachers reliable data on pupils' genuine confidence levels by disincentivising pupils artificially inflating their expressions of confidence in order to make a positive impression on the teacher. Having more accurate information about the pupils' real confidence levels could enable the teacher to intervene in more effective ways to help move pupils towards better calibration. The CA approach is likely to discourage guessing answers and instead contribute to greater pupil self-awareness, highlighting to pupils, as well as to the teacher, when they would benefit from additional support.\n6.2 What is the relationship between school mathematics pupils' confidence and competence within the topic of directed (positive and negative) numbers? In particular, how well calibrated are pupils within this topic?\nAlthough caution is needed because the schools and teachers used were a convenience sample, the large correlation of .546 between the pupils' facility and their confidence (N=336, p<.001) does indicate that pupils were generally well-calibrated in this topic area. The fact that the correlation, though high, is by no means perfect might be seen positively: teachers should not feel that lowering the difficulty of the questions that they pose is the only way to raise pupils' confidence. Girls demonstrated lower confidence than their facility would justify whereas boys were over-confident, which is consistent with previous findings (Frost et al., 1994) . Further study is needed to determine to what extent the calibration and gender effects might be similar across other mathematical topics. Additionally, facilities were generally high with this instrument and further work will reveal whether similar results are obtained when more difficult items are used and pupils are less sure of their responses. Further work might also reveal any associations with setting practices in schools.\nIt might be anticipated that with regular use of a CA approach pupils' calibration across various topics would improve over time (Gardner-Medwin & Curtin, 2007) , and longitudinal studies would be needed to determine whether this is the case. Many pupils' comments indicated that they would give different confidence ratings if they had the opportunity to attempt another CA, suggesting that they had gained some insight into their reliability in this topic."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Mathematics, among all school subjects, presents a uniquely tantalising prospect of certainty. Russell (1956, p. 53 ) described how in his youth he \"wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith\", and that he \"thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere\". Yet very few school pupils experience mathematics as a place of secure certainties. Mathematics teachers want their pupils to experience the confidence of knowing and understanding mathematics but do not want to engage in assessment practices which encourage pupils to pretend to be confident when they are not. In helping pupils to develop better calibration with regard to procedural competence, CA offers a powerful and easily implemented way to support pupils' realistic appraisals of their own confidence. Such an approach rewards honest disclosure of confidence and contrasts starkly with \"guess-and-hope\" strategies that pupils are frequently reported resorting to (Holt, 1990) .\nIt is evident that pupils easily grasped the negative marking aspect of the CA process and showed good calibration. Their comments were overwhelmingly positive about the approach, despite it contrasting strongly with more usual assessment practices in schools. It is encouraging that some pupils felt that CA promoted deeper thinking, increased their confidence and could be useful for formative assessment.\nAs discussed earlier, the CA approach employed in this study does not attempt to address conceptual confidence. It is possible for a pupil to be very confident that their answer will be marked correct (high procedural confidence) without possessing an underlying sense of confidence in the mathematics behind it. Boaler (2009, p. 121 ) described a mathematics pupil getting the answer right but not understanding what she was doing: \"We just plugged into it. And I think that's what I really struggled with -I can get the answer, I just don't understand why\". Such a pupil might show high levels of procedural competence and procedural confidence and, being regarded as a successful pupil, their lack of enjoyment and disinclination to pursue the subject in a post-compulsory phase might appear puzzling to the teacher. Thus there is a need to expand CA to find ways of eliciting truthful expressions of confidence in concepts, so that the teacher might be assisted in supporting pupils' growth in conceptual confidence too. However, ascertaining and supporting pupils' procedural confidence is an important first step."}]
