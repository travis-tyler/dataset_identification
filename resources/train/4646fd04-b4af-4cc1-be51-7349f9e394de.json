Age, sex, education (years) and the first three principal components from the population substructure analysis were included as control variables. ROIs with an uncorrected p-value of 0.1 are shown on the inflated surface of the template subject \"fsaverage\" and overlaid on the sulcal/gyral pattern in gray. The medial surface is shown on the left and the lateral surface is shown on the right.\nOnly the isthmus of the cingulate exhibits a statistically significant association (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The remaining ROIs that have a very subtle association are consistent with AD-vulnerable regions and include the orbito-frontal and inferior temporal cortices. Other cortical regions exhibited no significant associations. Given the Bonferroni correction, power to detect associations is limited. Figure 3 .
