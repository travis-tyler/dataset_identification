See Among these children from low-income households, 89 percent of infants and 88 percent of toddlers have additional risk factors -racial/ethnic minority status, non-English home language, and/or low maternal education (see Figure 6 for distribution of infants).\nNote: There was not a statistically significant difference between infants from Spanish-speaking homes and infants from Englishpeaking homes on the cognitive assessment.\nNote: There were not statistically significant differences between the infants with mothers who had a high school degree or some college on the cognitive assessment when compared to infants with mothers who had a Bachelor's degree or more.\nThe most prevalent risk factors are low family income and low maternal education at both 9 and 24 months.\nOf the 34 percent of low-income children at 9 months with an additional risk factor (see Figure 6 ), 73.5 percent (that is, 25% of the 34% of low-income infants with one additional risk factor) both live in a low-income household and have a mother with low educational attainment. Of the 32 percent of lowincome infants with two additional risk factors, 87.5 percent (i.e., 28% of the 32% of low-income infants with two additional risk factors) are living in a low-income household, have a mother with low educational attainment, and are of racial/ethnic minority status. A similar pattern is true for children at 24 months of age.\nThe more risk factors a child has, the wider the disparities across outcomes.\nDisparities grow larger with the number of cumulative risk factors at both 9 and 24 months (see, for example, Figure 7 )."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Start Early -Meaningful differences are being detected as early as 9 and 24 months; this speaks to the need to intervene early in children's lives to address the gaps in development. In particular, research suggests that interventions should be high-quality, comprehensive and continuous for children ages 0 to 3 as well as ages 3 to 5.\nTarget Low-income Children -As income is the most prevalent risk factor at 9 and 24 months, children in low-income households should be the main targets of early interventions aimed at improving children's health and well-being.\nEngage and Support Parents -Given that maternal education is also noted as a prevalent risk factor, early childhood interventions should include a parental education component. A promising avenue is to promote the education of parents of infants and toddlers about issues related to early childhood development. In addition, interventions that support parents in their own educational attainment and/or income self-sufficiency are also pertinent.\nNote: There were no significant differences between the low-income +1 risk group and the low income only reference group on the cognitive assessment for infants or for toddlers. (2) high-quality early care and education has the potential to moderate the effects of demographic risk factors for young children. In particular, it is important to ensure a safe, supportive and stimulating environment for young children. Two promising ways to address the quality of early care environments would be to focus on curriculum development and professional development within both home-based and center-based settings that serve infants and toddlers."}, {"section_title": "Improve the Quality of Early Care Settings", "text": "-Research indicates that (1) most infants and toddlers, especially those who are from low-income households, are cared for in home-based settings; and"}, {"section_title": "ABOUT THE DATA SOURCE USED IN THIS BRIEF", "text": "The data used for this brief were obtained from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), gathered by the National Center for Education Statistics within the U.S. Department of Education. The ECLS-B is a nationally representative longitudinal study of approximately 11,000 children born in 2001. Data for this brief were collected at the 9-and 24-month data wave. Analyses of the 9-month sample were limited to children aged 8-11 months and analyses of the 24-month sample were limited to children aged 22-25 months.\nIn order to produce national estimates, person-level weights constructed for the ECLS-B were used for the analyses. The weights account for the probability of sampling the child in a given household, and adjust for the probability of sampling the child from among all eligible children in a given domain.\nAnalyses were used to compare characteristics of infants/ toddlers in the sample on indicators of cognitive mastery, general health, and social emotional development. Findings discussed in the brief are statistically significant at the .05 level unless otherwise noted. The magnitudes of differences in average scores, using the most advantaged infants/toddlers as the reference group, are presented in terms of standard deviations.\nThe cognitive mastery indicators included both an age-normed composite score on an adaptation of the Bayley cognitive assessment. One indicator of the infant/toddler's general health was included. This indicator was based on parent/caregiver report of children's overall health with responses ranging from excellent to poor. Indicators of social-emotional development included a composite score on an index of positive behaviors (9-and 24-month analyses) and an observational assessment indicating whether the child displayed a secure attachment to their primary caregiver (24-month analyses only)."}]
