VLM here varies over relatively short time scales amid changing patterns of subsurface water and hydrocarbons extraction. \uf0b7 RSL rise rates of 5 mm/year or more aided by weak acceleration in Louisiana and Texas project a total RSL rise of between 0.4 and 0.5 meter above 1992 Mean Sea Level (MSL) by the year 2050; other Gulf and East Coast locations will experience equal or greater rise if upward trends in acceleration continue. \uf0b7 Low and mostly downward trends in RSL rise rate at central U.S. West Coast locations have recently reverted to a pattern of upward trends with higher rise rates. Rise rates prior to 2013 appear to have been restrained by deceleration now trending toward acceleration. \uf0b7 A combination of tectonic plate convergence and glacial isostatic adjustment makes the non-contiguous U.S. coastal state of Alaska unique with regard to RSL trends. Land emergence, rather than subsidence, produces consistent trends of falling RSL in Alaska. I-1"}, {"section_title": "I. THE ANTHROPOCENE: NEW TRENDS IN A WARMER WORLD?", "text": "In recent years, geoscientists viewing mounting evidence of human influence on the earth and its environmental processes have begun to consider a revision of the geologic time scale. A revision not of an earlier period but of the present bringing closure to the Holocene, the latest interglacial epoch that began nearly 12,000 years ago, to be followed by a new epoch -the Anthropocene. This compound word combining 'anthropo' (human) and 'cene' (recent) was first popularized by Nobel laureate P.J. Crutzen (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000;Crutzen, 2005), who introduced it following his research on the destruction of stratospheric ozone by man-made halogen compounds, principally chlorofluorocarbons. In the time between the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century and the new millennium, human activities had not only produced an alarming hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica but also doubled the amount of methane in the atmosphere and increased carbon dioxide to levels higher than any found over the last 400,000 years (Monastersky, 2015). Increases in these and other greenhouse gases have led to dramatic changes in earth's climate system since the 1950s: the atmosphere and oceans have warmed, snow and ice have been lost and global sea level has risen at increasingly higher rates. These facts have been clearly established by the observational data presented in the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) as illustrated in Figure I "}, {"section_title": "I-2", "text": "Although man's impact on the global environment is now unmistakable, it is difficult to assign a definite starting point in time; exactly when the Anthropocene epoch may have begun has been a matter of debate (Monastersky, 2015). However, from an observational viewpoint, most of the processes depicted in Fig. I-1 suggest that a change in many of earth's environmental systems was underway by the mid-point of the twentieth century, including sea level whose world-wide rate of increase over time has accelerated, although with no clear inflection point. While the global sea level anomaly as presented in Fig. I-1 offers muted support for a precise mid-century origin for the Anthropocene epoch, sea level rise rates starting earlier are clearly less than those starting later in the twentieth century. In its Fourth Assessment Summary, IPCC Working Group I (WGIAR4) reported that global mean sea level (GMSL) rose at an average rate of 1. Local Sea Level -A different assessment is found when investigating local sea level, particularly in certain regions along the U.S. coastline. Here, sea level rise rates relative to the land are usually calculated in one of two ways: either by applying a local correction for vertical land movement to an accepted globally-averaged rise rate, or directly as trends derived from a time series of water level measurements from tide gauges. Only the second method permits a datadriven evaluation of rise rate variations over time and between locations, but questions have been raised concerning record length. Some investigators have argued that tide gauge records 75 years or more in length are required to obtain a valid estimation of sea level trends (Douglas, 1997(Douglas, , 2001; Houston and Dean, 2011). However, this presupposes that an underlying trend exists in the data that is completely stationary, even for records exceeding a century in length. From a purely physical standpoint, an underlying sea level trend that remains at all stationary in the presence of rapidly rising tropospheric temperatures and ocean heat content from the mid-twentieth century onward (right side of Fig. I-1) is hardly immune to challenge. One of the first challenges came from Sallenger, Doran, and Howd (2012) who found post-1950s 'hot-spots' on the U.S. NE Atlantic coast with rise rate increases 3-4 times higher than the global average. They attributed higher rates observed at tide stations north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to local forcing by dynamic processes involving changes in ocean circulation, variations in water temperature and salinity, and re-distribution of ocean water mass. Using a new analytical technique, empirical mode decomposition, Ezer and Corlett (2012) found sea level acceleration in Chesapeake Bay. Boon (2012) noted a coherent pattern of increasing rise rates beginning in 1987 north of Cape Hatteras as shown in Fig. I-2. The serial trends shown in this figure are derived as straight-line fits to successive time series windows, each 36 years in length shifted forward a year at a time. The trend value applies at the mid-point or median year of each moving window; thus the 1987 inflection shown occurs in a window whose starting point began 18 years earlier in 1969."}, {"section_title": "I-3", "text": "Very recently, East Coast tide station data analyses by Davis and Vinogradova (2017) found post-1990 sea level accelerations ranging from near-zero to about 0.3 mm/year 2 due to ice-mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as ocean dynamics, in agreement with physical models. The term 'epoch' can be used to describe any distinctive development that persists for a time as part of earth's history. There is now almost certainly a new sea level epoch in existence marked by accelerations in the rate of sea level rise. However, like the Anthropocene epoch itself, some uncertainty exists over what time of origin to assign. Ezer, Haigh and Woodworth (2016) applying two different methods of analysis, conventional quadratic curve fitting and empirical mode decomposition, to long-term sea level records from western Europe found accelerations of 0.014 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.012 \u00b1 0.004 mm/year 2 , respectively, over the past 150 years, rates which they noted as being close to the global average during this period.  applied Bayesian analysis to quadratic trend parameters derived from post-1969 tide gauge records and found much higher accelerations over the most recent 46-year period (1969-2014) at a number of U.S. East and Gulf Coast locations; e.g., 0.271 \u00b1 0.087 mm/year 2 at Eastport, Maine and 0.157 \u00b1 0.094 mm/year 2 at Naples, Florida. The question that remains is whether any period of analysis adopted at present will faithfully characterize the future behavior of changing sea level trends. The past is not always the key to the future. Both studies cited above addressed the uncertainty introduced by cyclical components present at interannual to multidecadal time scales, a consequence of ocean-atmosphere exchange. In a discussion article, Boon and Mitchell (2016) pointed to a controlling effect by spatially coherent, low-frequency variations in monthly mean sea level (MMSL) in modulating quadratic projections of sea level height forward to the year 2050. These quasi-periodic MMSL variations, herein referred to as the decadal signal (Hong, Sturges and Clark, 2000;Sturges and Hong, 2001), appear to account for a high percentage of the variance noted in 2050 sea level projections made over an extended series of years starting in 1969 and updated annually since 2004. To the extent future observations bear this out, there is a compelling reason to study the history of post-1969 trends in sea level rise rate and acceleration. In this report, sea level observations described in Section II are used as the basis for linear and non-linear trends derived using a quadratic model of sea level change as described in Section III.

MEASURING LOCAL CHANGE IN SEA LEVEL", "text": "Space-based technology has offered many benefits and advantages in present day monitoring of the physical, chemical and biological processes of the world's oceans. By comparison, the task of measuring water level with an electromechanical device mounted on a dock or pier appears mundane. But in past centuries some of the best scientific and technological minds were occupied with this task and with understanding the data it produced. Today's efforts toward understanding sea level change owe more than a little gratitude for the perseverance of those who kept, and still keep, many years of meticulous records from the water level monitoring device commonly known as a tide gauge. This name is somewhat misleading, as changing water levels are driven by many other factors besides the astronomical tides, including varying surface winds, changes in atmospheric pressure, changes in ocean water temperature and salinity, fresh water storage and discharge from land, vertical land movement -and sea level rise. Relative Sea Level -A tide gauge measures water level relative to the land at one location. For coastal residents concerned with flooding at or near that location in real-time, this is the measurement that counts as compared to a global metric referencing the center of the earth or a reference ellipsoid. At such times a further breakdown is unnecessary; to be told that part of the water entering a home during a storm event may be attributed to land subsidence over time offers no immediate benefit. At other times an evaluation of contributing factors is clearly worthwhile, and this frequently calls for processing treatments that strip tide gauge records of unwanted components -starting with the tide itself through averaging! The smoothing that results leads to what may be more properly termed a sea level height. In this report, trends in sea level height are examined after removing day-to-day variations and some month-to-month variations that are unrelated to longer-term patterns of change in sea level. Monthly Mean Sea Level (MMSL) -Averaging water levels over a calendar month removes much of the so-called 'weather' tide in addition to the regular cycles of the astronomical or predicted tide that repeat at intervals ranging from a solar day to a lunar month. Averaging over the calendar year (YMSL) further removes a less-regular, cyclical component called the seasonal cycle that has both an astronomical and a meteorological origin. However, the seasonal cycle can also be isolated and removed from a time series of MMSL heights using an analytical method (harmonic analysis). Subsequent numerical filtering can then be used to obtain the decadal signal, the low-frequency component introduced in Section I and a key factor in interpreting the sea level trend analyses presented later in this report. A more detailed description of the analytical methods employed in treating the seasonal cycle and the decadal signal in MMSL time series is given in Appendix A. Where to Find MMSL Data -The primary source for sea level observations worldwide is the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level located in Liverpool, England (www.psmsl.org). Here monthly and annual mean values of sea level are available from nearly 2,000 tide gauge stations at locations around the world. The original source of observations made in the United States and its territories is the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These observations can be obtained from NOAA's website (www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov) under products/water levels."}, {"section_title": "II-2", "text": "Selecting a Reference Datum for MMSL Heights -Although the PSMSL in Great Britain is widely recognized as the preferred data source for international studies on changing sea level, the MMSL time series heights used in this report are taken from the abovementioned NOAA site. The NOAA site is preferred here for two reasons: The latest MMSL heights recorded at U.S. tide stations, and verified for their accuracy through rigorous NWLON quality control procedures, are available much sooner than the corresponding heights from the PSMSL site -an important consideration when examining very recent trends. Secondly, NOAA MMSL heights are available referenced to Mean Sea Level (MSL), a tidal datum that is specifically defined in and for the United States in accordance with Federal law (Gill and Schultz, 2001;Parker, 2007). MSL and other U.S. tidal datums are computed as water level averages over a specific 19-year period known as the National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE). As sea level continues to change, the NTDE is updated as needed, or roughly every twenty-five years, to keep abreast of this change. The current NTDE is based on the series 1983-2001 whose median year is 1992. Thus, the MSL vertical reference approximates where sea level stood in 1992 at the center of the current epoch. Datum Origin -Associating a vertical datum with a time origin is not always a consideration. As stated on its website, the foremost PSMSL objective is the establishment of a world-wide common datum for referencing water levels. Tide station data provided to the PSMSL are reduced (using datum information from submitting authorities) to heights above Revised Local Reference, a vertical datum set exactly 7 meters (m), or about 23 feet, below an arbitrarily fixed mean sea level whose epoch is unspecified. Often, it is simply the rate of sea level change that is of interest, the only requirement being that the vertical reference in use must remain unchanged over an unlimited span of time, past and present. But when investigating nascent trends over a limited span, specifically one conforming to the proposed Anthropocene epoch, it is important to be able to answer the question: The amount of rise since when? Since the year 1992 in this case. Trends Derived from Observations -Unlike the very predictable astronomical tide, accurate prediction of sea level far into the future is a nearly impossible task, especially at individual locations. That said, trends that appear in a 'scatter plot' of MMSL heights over a sufficient period of time can serve as useful guides in the near-term. Most often the trend shown is a linear one defined by a straight line fitted to the data. Many U.S. examples can be found at the NOAA website (www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov) under products/sea level trends. However, as in most situations where analytical results are presented, a careful reading of the text describing the underlying data, and how they are being interpreted, is important. For example, a recent online NOAA graphic employing colored arrows on a map to compare and contrast sea level trends at a glance presently identifies Eugene Island, Louisiana, as the U.S. locality where sea level is rising most rapidly at 9.65 \u00b1 1.24 mm/year. A statement is added that this is the equivalent of 3.17 feet (0.966 m) of rise in 100 years; an additional footnote lists a 36year series from 1939 through 1974 as the basis for this trend. Supposing that another location also has a 36-year series but from 1969 through 2004; would a comparison between these locations whose record origins differ by thirty years still be valid? Is it misleading to make any inference at all regarding a century of sea level rise based on a single tide gauge record? To compare trends from different locations over the same period of time is the more reasonable choice along with qualified statements regarding future trends and projections. III-1"}, {"section_title": "III. LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR TREND COMPONENTS", "text": "Various ways exist to perceive trends in time series data, a set of measurements ordered in time. Simply looking at a data plot may suggest upward or downward movement. When background noise makes this difficult, a smoothing procedure is often applied to bring out the hidden features of a trend -assuming there is one. But to both identify and enumerate a specific trend requires a mathematical model with a statistical component. The most basic of these is the general linear model that fits a straight line to the data using the method of least squares. Its next level extension is the quadratic model, which fits a curve defined by the quadratic equation. Trends derived from the quadratic model are represented by a pair of parameters that give the user two important pieces of information: These are the rate of change, up or down, and the acceleration (or deceleration -a decrease) in the rate of change with time. However, the information has limits. Whether a linear or quadratic model is chosen to represent these aspects of relative sea level (RSL) change, there is one fundamental requirement: Even as sea level changes with time, both rate and acceleration are assumed constant as applied in the model -an assumption often difficult to justify in practice. Model estimates are made with the aid of statistical confidence intervals (see Appendix B). Quadratic Model of RSL Change -In this model, sea level height h is represented at time t by a quadratic equation of the form In the present application, time is measured in years relative to 1992, and height is measured in millimeters (mm) relative to the tidal datum of mean sea level (MSL) as computed by NOAA for the current NTDE (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). Given a time series of observed MMSL heights with the seasonal cycle removed (as noted in Section II), estimates of the three parameters \u03b2 0 , \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 are obtained using the method of least squares, a 'best fit' technique that minimizes the square of the error term \u0125 h \uf065 \uf03d\uf02d where h is an observed height and \u0125 is the corresponding height predicted by the model using the first three terms on the right side of Eq. III-1. Assuming random error, \u03b5 can be either positive or negative following a normal distribution with zero mean. It follows that the parameter \u03b2 0 in Eq. III-1 representing the predicted height \u0125 for 1992 (t = 0), may deviate from MSL datum (h = 0). The rate of RSL change is found as the derivative of Eq. III-1, Eq. III-3 shows rate has two components: A linear rate of change in mm/year given by parameter \u03b2 1 and a non-linear rate of change in mm/year 2 given by parameter \u03b2 2 . The second parameter, if positive in value, is the acceleration (deceleration, if negative) as represented by the model. Model Application -Two examples of the quadratic model applied to MMSL observations (with seasonal cycle removed) for Norfolk, Virginia, are shown below using a 36-year series from 1969 through 2004 ( Fig. III-3) and a 49-year series from 1969 through 2017 ( Fig. III-4).    Both of the above graphs show linear and quadratic trends derived from least-squares estimates of \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 in Eq. III-1. Although both trends are shown extending through the year 2050, the widening 95% confidence intervals apparent in Fig. III-3 are a clear sign that a 2050 projection is unwarranted for the 36-year series. In Fig. III-4, the projected width of the 95% confidence intervals is almost the same all the way out to 2050. As explained in Appendix B, the intervals will include approximately 95% of the MMSL observations in any one year; counting the total number of observations that do fall between the dotted bands confirms this to be true on average. The bands therefore provide a useful guiding principle when making near-term projections: Look for the vertical interval between bands to remain roughly the same going forward in time. Further guidance is given by changes in the amplitude and phase of the decadal signal described in Section I and Appendix A, specifically whether the signal is trending high or low during the most recent MMSL observations as it modulates the projected RSL trends. Changing Rates -As an empirical model applied to a series of observations, Eq. III-1 relies on the assumption that both the linear rate of rise (fall) represented by \u03b2 1 and the acceleration (deceleration) represented by \u03b2 2 remain constant throughout the model's applied time domain. Comparing the RSL rise rate and acceleration values given in Figs. III-3 and III-4 suggests that this assumption is not entirely justified (not unusual for a time series), but it conforms to our belief that neither rise rate nor acceleration are static expressions of an underlying trend. Using the full 90-year record available for Norfolk (Appendix B, Fig. B-1C) produces a lower linear trend estimate (\u03b2 1 = 4.61 mm/year) and a much lower quadratic trend estimate (\u03b2 2 = 0.017 mm/year 2 ). Observations going forward would have to overcome the considerable weight of these older trends before they could possibly detect new ones. Over geologic time, global sea level has experienced numerous successions of high stands and low stands that could not have occurred without intervening periods of acceleration and deceleration. Evidence supporting the designation of a new geologic epoch with faster rising sea levels underscores the potential for acceleration that has only become evident over the last few decades, not centuries. In that context, the quadratic model given by Eq. III-1 can be tailored to properly search for significant acceleration, evaluate its short-term history, and make limited projections for the near-term future -considering that acceleration need not be long-lasting in order to have a significant impact on sea level heights within the present century. Relative Sea Level Report Cards -Repeated application of the quadratic model as each new year of MMSL observations become available further describes the short-term history in a way that may reveal the progress of relative sea level change -a type of sea level report card. Imagine a student presently failing a subject in school, yet a series of recent report cards shows steady improvement in the student's grades, inferring that a likely transition from failure to success lies ahead. Likewise, a downward linear trend presently marked by RSL deceleration may show less and less deceleration with time until the trend eventually reverses. Success here may mean that a coastal community receiving these reports will be able to use the information to its advantage when revising or updating its flood defense plans.  IV-2 Norfolk has maintained a substantially higher RSL rise rate than Wilmington and other locations farther south along the U.S. East Coast. However, since 2012, Norfolk's rise rate has remained flat at around 5 mm/year, whereas the rate at Wilmington has increased from about 1.5 mm/year to slightly more than 2.5 mm/year as seen in Fig. IV-2A. The increase coincides with renewed acceleration at Wilmington -from almost no acceleration to 0.17 mm/year 2 in the six years since 2011 ( Fig. IV-2B). In contrast, Norfolk's previously high acceleration has steadily declined over the same six-year period. An important feature that emerges from the Norfolk-Wilmington comparison is the cyclical element evident in their RSL acceleration histories ( Fig. IV-2B). Although the histories cover only a little more than a decade, the interval between highs and lows in acceleration correspond roughly to highs and lows in their respective decadal signals (Figs. IV-3,4). Particularly striking is the fact that these quasi-cyclic variations appear out of phase: RSL acceleration is decreasing at Norfolk while increasing at Wilmington. Comparisons between other East Coast locations show that this pattern is not at all unique to these two stations.   Further insight into the nature of the relationship between locations and their RSL experiences may be gained through an analysis of the similarity in RSL rise rate and acceleration histories.       "}, {"section_title": "IV-7", "text": "The central Gulf Coast is a sub-region known for its high rates of subsidence. As noted in Boon and Mitchell (2015), the Houston-Galveston area in southern Texas was a prime example of high subsidence rates until the mid-seventies when municipal and industrial ground water extraction were widely restricted and replaced by overland supplies. The RSL rise rate at Galveston decreased thereafter and remained steady at about 5.5 mm/year until the year 2014 when it began an upward trend ( Fig. IV-9A). A similar history is found at Grand Isle, Louisiana, although its upward trend appears to have begun earlier in 2011. However, Fig. IV-9A shows very different histories for Rockport and Port Isabel, Texas, further west. The rise rate increased initially at Rockport before leveling off at 6 mm/year then resuming an upward track in 2014; Port Isabel has similar but more uniform rise rates varying between 4 mm/year and 5 mm/year.  At least three locations in Louisiana and Texas now have RSL rise rates in excess of 6 mm/year. If present trends continue, these rates will result in RSL gains of more than 0.30 m (1 foot) above 1992 levels by the year 2050 without acceleration. Along the U.S. East Coast, only Norfolk, Virginia, comes close to this mark (Table IV- 1). After RSL acceleration is taken into account, year 2050 projections increase significantly -except at Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Galveston, Texas, where acceleration accompanying their higher rise rates is presently near zero. But if past history is any guide, this could change: note the durable upward trend in acceleration at Grand Isle and Galveston and the 2014 trend reversal at Rockport. Quadratic projections based on 1969-2017 observations (Table IV-   Of the three U.S. coastal regions examined, none has a greater deficit of tide stations with adequate post-1969 water level records than the Gulf Coast -or a greater history of losing them to coastal storms. It will be important to follow carefully the future RSL history provided by the ones remaining, including Galveston and Grand Isle, for signs of increasing RSL acceleration. U.S. West Coast Comparisons -RSL change along the western boundary of the U.S., including Alaska, is influenced by a number of factors associated with an active continental margin -one characterized by converging tectonic plates. In addition to its convergence with the major Pacific plate near the coastline from California to Alaska, the North American plate also converges with the smaller Juan de Fuca plate (the remnant of an older, largely subducted plate) off Washington state and western Canada. Both vertical and horizontal land movement occurs sporadically in fault zones in and around plate boundaries; e.g., the San Andreas transform fault in California. San Diego, California (on the Pacific plate) presently has the highest RSL rise rate on the U.S. West Coast while Crescent City, California (on the North American plate) has the lowest ( Fig.  IV-12A). The history of RSL change in Alaska is defined by an emergent coast, a consequence of both plate convergence and post-glacial rebound. In contrast to the contiguous U.S. coastal regions, sea level in Alaska is either near-zero or falling relative to the land -falling at a very high rate at Juneau and Yakutat, Alaska (Fig. 12B). While negative RSL rise rates characterize much of Alaska, the central West Coast region from California to Washington state has experienced both rise and fall rates of relatively low magnitude ( Fig. IV-12A). With the GMSL rise rate reported as 2.8 to 3.6 mm/year over 1993-2010 (IPCC, 2013) this raises the question: What has prevented a similar RSL rate of rise in the region during this time? Aside from coastal emergence as a possible factor at some locations (e.g., Crescent City, California), the long-lived Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) appears to have a role here through its connection with the earth's foremost climate driver, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as described by Newman, Compo, and Alexander (2003). Bromirski et al. (2011) cite a dramatic change in wind stress patterns following a mid-seventies regime shift from the cool to the warm phase of the PDO as a factor contributing to West Coast sea level suppression, noting that acceleration and a resurgent RSL rise could soon occur following an expected shift to the PDO cool phase. A B"}, {"section_title": "IV-10", "text": "Figure IV-13A suggests that Bromirski et al. (2011) may be correct in their prediction of renewed RSL rise given recent trends toward acceleration. The figure shows persistent RSL deceleration up until a slight RSL acceleration is found in the 1969-2015 record at San Diego, California, followed by Seattle, Washington, whose 1969-2016 data point crosses the zero threshold. These minor crossing points by themselves, it should be noted, are statistically not different from zero. However, taking all points together the upward trends shown in Fig. IV-13A are revealing -especially at San Diego (highlighted in blue) where a trend toward acceleration beginning at slightly less than -0.3 mm/year 2 moves upward in value toward its zero-crossing point in an almost straight line. After 2013, the remaining three stations north of San Diego do the same in a highly coherent pattern. Much less coherent are the trends shown for the four locations in Alaska, three of which are now converging to about -0.1 mm/year 2 with one (Yakutat, Alaska, highlighted in blue) oscillating around -0.4 mm/year 2 ( Fig. IV-13B). RSL rise rate histories for the central U.S. West Coast are very similar from San Diego, California, to Seattle Washington, ignoring rise rate magnitude ( Fig. IV-14). Their common pattern, flatness or gentle decline followed by a synchronous upturn in 2013, suggests decadal signal modulation but may also reflect a more persistent upward trend based on the strength of the rise in acceleration after 2013 ( Fig. IV-15). If so, this implies that, except for Alaska, West Coast RSL acceleration may soon see a shift in magnitude from mostly negative to mostly positive, which will further enhanced the magnitude of RSL rise rates. As for Alaska, its history of RSL fall will no doubt continue for compelling tectonic reasons as well as glacial isostatic adjustments. A B IV-11  "}, {"section_title": "IV-12", "text": "Factor Analysis of Trend Similarity -Varying degrees of compositional similarity are noted in the sea level histories introduced in this section. Where a high degree of similarity is found between locations within a given coastal region -or sub-region -it may be assumed that the geophysical processes governing sea level change there are correspondingly uniform. Moreover, considering MMSL observations from each location to be a random sample of sea level change in the region, greater compositional similarity lends added confidence in the overall pattern of RSL trends revealed by the observations. These patterns can be compared and contrasted using factor analysis. The type of factor analysis employed here, termed Q-mode, examines the structure of a data matrix using eigenvectors to determine the relationship between locations based on their sea level histories. The analysis permits each location to be represented graphically as a vector positioned by factor loadings on a limited set (usually two or three) of independent (mutuallyorthogonal) vectors -the factors that best explain the variation in the data. A detailed description of the analytical methods employed, including factor rotation, is presented in Appendix D. East Coast Rise Rates: Figure IV-16 shows the relationship between U.S. East Coast locations based on rotated factor loadings derived from an analysis of their respective RSL rise rate histories using a three-factor solution. In Fig. IV-16A Jacksonville, Florida, 'loads' highest on factor 1 whereas Portland, Maine, projects highest on factor 2. Very little variation among locations is shown by the loadings on factor 3, all of which occur near the factor origin ( Fig. IV-16B).

In view of loadings uniformly near 1 on factor 1, the scores for factor 1 (Fig. IV-19A) could very well stand as the one RSL acceleration history best representing the entire U.S. northeast coastal sub-region from 1969 through 2017, subject to differences in magnitude. Although the loadings on factor 2 are not as high, the scores for factor 2 yield a reasonable characterization of the RSL acceleration history at all U.S. southeast locations except for Key West, Florida -a location that, as will be shown, properly belongs to the U.S. Gulf Coast region in terms of its history of sea level change. In sum, the factor analysis just presented supports the hypothesis that U.S. East Coast rise rate and corresponding acceleration histories since 1969 have been modulated over time but with a 180 o difference in phase between the northeast and southeast sub-regions, respectively, north and south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. This is most evident in the factor scores for RSL acceleration presented in Figs. IV-19A and IV-19B. Gulf Coast Rise Rates: Sea level change along the U.S. Gulf Coast is somewhat unique. Q-mode factor analysis applied to RSL rise rate histories at the nine locations selected for the present study fails to effectively distinguish more than one factor (the reason for this is discussed in Appendix D). The factor loadings shown in Fig   A B"}, {"section_title": "IV-16", "text": "Gulf Coast Acceleration: More than one factor is found in the analysis of Gulf Coast RSL acceleration histories. As seen in Fig. IV-21B above, Key West, Florida, has a loading of 1 on factor 2, which implies that the scores for factor 2 ( Fig. IV-22B) should be identical, except for scaling, to the RSL acceleration history for Key West shown in Fig. IV A more pronounced drop-and-rise is seen in the scores for factor 3 (  West Coast Rise Rates: Factor analysis of West Coast RSL rise rates separates locations into two distinct groups with one obvious outlier as shown in Fig. IV-23. The outlier (Astoria, Oregon) has a high loading on factor 2 whereas the other eleven locations are separated into two groups by factors 1 and 3. The first group, with loadings highest on factor 1 and intermediate (negative) loadings on factor 3, include west coast locations from San Diego, California, to Seattle, Washington, with one exception: Crescent City, California. Crescent City falls into the second group that includes four locations on the emergent coast of Alaska, suggesting that Crescent City also has experienced significant uplift. Scores for factors 1-3 ( Fig. IV-24) emphasize the upturn and near-linear increase in RSL rise rates since 2013, a feature previously noted on p. IV-10.   West Coast Acceleration: Unlike rise rates, factor loadings for acceleration at West Coast locations are not as tightly clustered -or divided into groups that hint at alignment with a particular sub-region. Nine locations have their highest loadings on factor 1, combined with lowto-intermediate negative loadings on factors 2 and 3; two locations in Oregon (South Beach and Astoria) have high loadings on factor 2 with Sitka, Alaska, displaying a high loading on factor 3. Scores for West Coast acceleration factors (Fig. IV-26) also highlight a ubiquitous 2013 upturneven at Sitka, Alaska, where RSL acceleration was in sharp decline from 2006 to 2013 before beginning a modest rise, a trend captured by factor 3. Factors 1 and 2, though compositionally independent (their vectors in variable space are orthogonal), nevertheless display a resemblance in the position of highs and lows in the sequence of their respective scores -a sign that nearby locations (as vectors in factor space) are a mixture mostly of factors 1 and 2.  Summation: Q-mode factor analysis, a computational technique used here to explore the relationship between U.S. coastal locations by means of their respective relative sea level (RSL) rise rate and acceleration histories, offers new insight into trends unfolding in the Anthropocene epoch based on recent observations. Far from a display of randomness, similar groups are found within each coastal regional that mirror the geophysical processes governing RSL trends locally. One of the most obvious groupings is found between the sub-regions of the U.S. East Coast north and south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; despite differences in magnitude, RSL acceleration histories at seven locations from Maine to Virginia are extremely uniform and therefore offer valuable guidance and insight on near-term RSL projections within this sub-region. Sub-regions are also found on the U.S. Gulf Coast that reflect the complex task of evaluating the likely contribution of acceleration to observed rise rates, and consequent near-term RSL projections, due to ongoing vertical land movement (VLM) resulting from mineral extractions (ground water and hydrocarbons) and associated faulting. On the U.S. West Coast, very recent trends away from RSL deceleration toward RSL acceleration appear likely to initiate a new phase of RSL rise in locations where sea level trends have been flat until now. Compositional end-members derived as factors through Q-mode factor analysis will continue to serve as references against which future sea level histories can be compared as new observations become available. Background of processes that affect rates of sea-level rise and acceleration A number of processes have been linked to long-term variations in sea level rise. These vary in spatial scale, with some processes acting on a very local level, while others affect global rise rates. Two main processes explain global sea level rise: steric and eustatic. Steric sea-level changes are changes in ocean volume resulting from thermal expansion (thermosteric) and salinity (halosteric) changes. One study suggests that geographic variations in these processes are responsible for some of the variation in relative sea level rise seen globally (Cazenave and Nerem, 2004). Eustatic sea level change results from the addition of water mass to the oceans from melting ice sheets and glaciers, as well as atmospheric exchange from land storage. Gravitational and rotational processes can cause this additional water to distribute unevenly (Mitrovica et al., 2009), also contributing to the variation in relative sea level rise seen globally. These steric and eustatic variations suggest that different water bodies may have different rates of sea level rise; therefore, in this report we examine each coastline separately and compare only between stations in the same body of water. Regional processes affect sea level rise rates on portions of a coastline and can lead to sea level variability on interannual-to-decadal time scales. These processes include vertical land movement (VLM) due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), inverted barometer effects, and ocean dynamics, frequently related to atmospheric shifts. GIA is the response of the earth's surface to the unloading of ice sheet and glacial mass, resulting in upward motion (rebounding) in areas previously covered by ice and subsidence of the land surface in adjoining areas (glacial forebulge collapse, Figure V-1). The inverted barometer effect is the response of ocean height to atmospheric pressure. Consistent wind stress patterns can produce a similar effect. Both effects are more related to temporal variability than long-term sea level changes, but they may affect the V-2 trends seen in historic gauge analyses and therefore need to be considered. Ocean dynamics can also contribute to temporal variability, but some shifts, such as changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, are hypothesized to be trajectory responses to climate change rather than temporal variations (Jackson et al., 2015). Relative sea level (RSL) rise can also be affected by local subsidence due to groundwater/hydrocarbon withdrawal or tectonic faulting and uplift (other VLM processes). These processes are likely to affect only one or two tide stations in the same way, and therefore, contribute greatly to variation in RSL rise along a coast. Understanding the magnitude and impact of this process is critical for adaptation and management efforts, since it can be relatively easily controlled. Past subsidence can also greatly impact RSL trends and must be carefully considered when choosing the appropriate length of record to analyze. Important processes are summarized in Table V-1. trends in the processes as reflected in the primary literature but not attempting to quantify their contribution. Impacts of these processes to East Coast tide gauge records are summarized in Table V-2 and explicitly discussed in the following sub-sections. Vertical land movement is measured through both geologic records (giving long-term averages) and GPS (giving Anthropocene movements). GIA is a long-term process and therefore is captured in both datasets, although the GPS record also captures shorter VLM processes (see next section). According to analyses of these records, all East Coast tide stations are in areas of subsidence that has been attributed in part to GIA, except for Eastport, Maine, Portland, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts, which fall near the zero line of subsidence, and Fernandina Beach, Florida, which vertical GPS suggests is slightly uplifting but not necessarily due to GIA (Sella et al., 2007). Models of GIA recovery, based on GPS measurements suggest that maximum subsidence due to GIA is found around 39\u02daN and is estimated to be 1.5 mm/year (Karegar et al., 2017). The inverted barometer effect (IB) has been put forward as an important control of inter-annual sea level variation along the East Coast (Piecuch and Ponte, 2015). There is some implication that it may be affecting sea level rise projections due to recent low-pressure systems that resulted in extreme sea level rise events. Piecuch and Ponte (2015) suggest that IB may be responsible for ~50% of sea level rise in New England during 2008 and 2010 and 10-30% of multidecadal sea level accelerations in the mid-Atlantic \"hot spot\" (Boon, 2012; Ezer and Corlett, 2012; Sallenger et al., 2012). However, when the IB contribution to Anthropocene sea level rise acceleration was evaluated, both its contribution and variability were small (0.0-0.05 mm/year rising from south to north; Davis and Vinogradova, 2017). Therefore, we consider this to be a more important control of temporal variability than sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "B. Gulf Coast Stations", "text": "In addition to steric changes, the dominant process affecting sea level rise variability along the Gulf Coast of the United States is groundwater and hydrocarbon withdrawal (Gabrysch and Coplin, 1990;White and Tremblay, 1995;Morton et al., 2006;Kolker et al., 2011). Groundwater and hydrocarbon withdrawal rates have undergone multiple shifts in magnitude between 1969 and 2017, affecting measured changes in sea level rise acceleration. Table V-3 shows that variability in magnitude of each process along the coast results in varying rates of RSL rise. Many of these rates are difficult to measure, and different assessments of their contribution to RSL rise can be found in the literature. Therefore, we are identifying the trends in the processes as reflected in the primary literature but not attempting to quantify their contribution. Impacts of each process to Gulf Coast tide gauge records are summarized in Table  V-3 and explicitly discussed in the following sub-sections. Ocean dynamics Global models suggest that ocean dynamics will contribute little to variability in sea level trends along the Gulf Coast stations (Kopp et al., 2014). While the along-shore currents in the Gulf are unlikely to contribute much to variability among Gulf Coast stations, it is worth noting that analysis of past trends will be unable to fully capture the dynamics changes incurred after aperiodic anomalies (such as hurricanes). Hurricanes are likely to impact the land-water interface due to the warmer waters of the Gulf increasing the intensity of land-falling storms in this region. This potentially could shift the currently-projected minimal variability between Gulf Coast stations to observe a greater perceived rate of RSL rise in areas frequented by future storm systems, such as Texas and Louisiana. In a Gulf Coast Analysis of National Estuarine Research Reserves, it was noted that a 2-m increase in sea level would result in tidal inundation from Mississippi through the Florida Panhandle to increase by 1472 km 2 (Kidwell et al., 2017). This is equivalent to 20% of the present-day total surface area of the bays within the Eastern Gulf region. Thus, barrier islands in this region are projected to have increased shoreline and dune erosion under higher rates of sealevel rise, suggesting that storm surge response to sea level rise will be an increasingly non-linear issue that is likely to have lasting effects on the Gulf Coast's future RSL rates. resulted in excessive subsidence rates (120 mm/year, 1964-1973; Gabrysch and Coplin, 1990). These rates slowed dramatically following the reduction of groundwater pumping in the early 1970s (Gabrysch and Coplin, 1990). However, those high rates are still captured in the beginning of the sea-level-rise histories presented here. Continual subsidence was derived from tide gauge records from both Galveston, Texas and Grand Isle, Louisiana from 1950-1990 but with steadily declining subsidence rates following 1970. By 1990, subsidence appears to have effectively stopped (Kolker et al., 2011). This subsidence was linked to oil production for Grand Isle, Louisiana, which began to decline in the 1970s and was minimal by the 1990s, and to groundwater withdrawal for Galveston, Texas (Kolker et al., 2011). Subsidence rates near the points of withdrawal are substantially higher than surrounding areas (Morton et al., 2006), suggesting that Rockport, Texas and Port Isabel, Texas probably did not experience the high levels of subsidence at any point in their history."}, {"section_title": "Other factors", "text": "The Texas Gulf coastline has significant faulting, and periodic shifts occur along these faults (White and Tremblay, 1995). The effect of these seismic shifts on tide gauge records has not been examined but potentially could affect acceleration rates. In Galveston, Texas slippage was most active during the period 1960-1970 of the records studied (Kolker et al., 2011). In contrast, the tide gauge station at Pensacola, Florida sits on a stable carbonate platform and is considered to be tectonically stable (Gonzalez and Tornqvist, 2006; Kolker et al., 2011). Barometric anomalies affect sea levels at Gulf Coast stations. During years of high pressure, resulting wind fields drive water towards the northern Gulf, while in years of low pressure, winds are driven to the south (Kolker et al., 2011). Sediment loading can affect subsidence. Grand Isle, Louisiana has higher rates of sea level rise than the surrounding Gulf Coast stations, which has been attributed in part to its thick Holocene sediment layer that is thinner in Texas and completely absent in Florida (Penland and Ramsey, 1990).\nTectonic effects (post-earthquake deformation) contribute to uplift in parts of Alaska, although these are temporally and spatially variable in magnitude. In southeastern Alaska, tectonic deformation has been found to be less important than the GIA-induced deformation (Sato et al., 2012). In the northwestern part of Alaska, Yakutat Block is colliding with southern Alaska, causing deformation and uplift (Elliot et al., 2010). It is unclear how far-reaching the effect of this collision is along the coastline. Locally high rates of subsidence (exceeding 10 mm/year) due to compacting of artificial landfill and Holocene mud deposits have been documented in northern California (Shirzaei and B\u00fcrgmann, 2018) near the San Francisco and Alameda tide gauges. However, there is extensive spatial variability in the subsidence rates and there has been no suggestion that high subsidence is currently affecting either tide gauge record.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK MANAGEMENT", "text": "Relative sea level (RSL) histories and projections can be used to inform management and reduce future flood impacts. RSL histories can be used to help understand which forcing processes are most important to the long-term record and how stations may vary from others along their coast. RSL projections can be used to anticipate future flood risks; allowing accommodation and adaptation measures to be taken. However, there are important considerations to address before using this information: 1) Some of the processes forcing the RSL history are temporally variable, 2) the further a projection reaches into the future, the more uncertainty is inherent in the projection, 3) projections are given as heights above mean sea level (MSL), but sea level varies annually and inter-annually in expected ways. These issues are discussed below, with some practical recommendations for handling them. RSL histories -The histories show that along a coast, there are certain trends that are fairly coherent between stations, while other trend are unique to one or two stations. It is likely that the coherent trends are attributable to global and regional forcing processes. For the global and many regional forcing processes affecting RSL rise, it is reasonable to consider past trends as informing near-future trends. The local forcing processes, in particular groundwater and hydrocarbon withdrawals, tend to be locally variable and controlled through local management actions. In areas where these processes have greatly contributed to past subsidence (e.g., Grand Isle, Louisiana and Galveston, Texas) great care should be taken in extrapolating sea level histories. A regional process, the potential suppression of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, requires that California stations also take care extrapolating past trends to the future. Although essentially flat for a long time, recent acceleration trends suggest that RSL projections at these stations may be underestimating future water levels. Continual monitoring of RSL and comparison to the RSL histories and projections will allow for early detection of changes in the trajectory. RSL projections for 2050 should be updated annually and the history of the shifts in those projections should also be examined to see if any patterns or trends occur. Projecting RSL -In this study, we extend almost 50 years of historical data into projections for approximately 30 years in the future. Further extension of the past trends into the future is questionable and will result in increasing uncertainty of the projections. RSL histories highlight the importance of decision-making on RSL. Water withdrawal and storage can change local vertical land motion, and these changes can be reversed through further management decisions. In addition, processes such as ice sheet melting are inherently non-linear. If there are management actions requiring longer outlooks (e.g., 2100), climate model projections such as those provided by the National Climate Assessment should be used. Using RSL projections -The graphs shown in Appendix C give the yearly mean sea level (YMSL) expected in 2050 for both linear and quadratic RSL projections based on 1969-2017 monthly mean sea level (MMSL) observations. Of course water levels both higher and lower than YMSL in the year 2050 will likely occur during any given day; most of this variation will be due to the very predictable astronomical tide. What will not be so predictable, then as now, is the often substantial change in average water level from one month to the next due to weather. A part of this monthly variation is accounted for through the seasonal cycle, which is normally included in tidal predictions as described in Appendix A. The MMSL observations used for the RSL projections in Appendix C, however, have had the seasonal cycle removed."}, {"section_title": "VI-2", "text": "High Water Vulnerability Index -What is left after the seasonal cycle is removed from an MMSL series is the non-tidal change -the part that cannot be predicted well in advance other than through a statistic such as a confidence interval. The tidal part consists entirely of water level change that occurs at known tidal frequencies, making it predictable far in advance. A ratio of the two can be formed by dividing the 95% MMSL confidence interval on quadratic projections by the diurnal tide range (GT) available for U.S. locations under datums at www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov. The dimensionless interval/range ratio, herein called the High Water Vulnerability Index (or HiVI), is a measure of the weather-induced RSL change likely to occur at a location compared to a known amount of RSL change due to the astronomical tide. Index values are given for the 32 locations of the present study in Table VI-1. At locations with a low vulnerability index (e.g., Eastport, Maine) it implies that coastal residents and planners there can more easily adapt to less predictable 'weather tides' when they are small in comparison to the astronomical tides they experience day in and day out. At Rockport, Texas, residents accustomed to building near the water's edge in an area with a very small diurnal range were highly vulnerable to the storm surge from Hurricane Harvey in 2017."}, {"section_title": "VI-3", "text": "As noted in Appendix B, the 95% confidence interval -the RSL height difference between the upper and lower confidence limits -includes approximately 95% of the MMSL heights expected relative to YMSL in any given year. MMSL observations made during the 1969-2017 period confirm this expectation. That leaves 5% on average that will be higher or lower than the limit interval, including months with an unusual storm surge adding to whatever MMSL height is present at the time. Although resistant infrastructure including roads that can take some temporary flooding may be built in the zone between YMSL and the upper confidence interval limit, it is recommended that this practice be avoided for all other construction. The RSL trends presented in this report contribute additional value when coupled with a hydrodynamic model adding storm surge. This can be done by collecting the observation data record at a nearby tide gauge for a specific past storm event, and using the projected linear or quadratic trend (or accompanying 95% confidence intervals) from this or other studies to project the RSL trend to the desired future date to reanalyze the impact of a similar strength storm in the future. An example is illustrated in Loftis et al. (2016) at NASA Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, using a hydrodynamic model ( Figure VI-1). "}, {"section_title": "VI-4", "text": "While bathtub models and viewers can reanalyze selected storm effects (as further discussed in the next sub-section), they do not account for wind-driven slope impacts on the free surface of the water, friction differences induced by fluid flow over variable terrain types or wind direction, rainfall flow aggregation, storm drainage infrastructure, or soil infiltration, all of which are of paramount importance for accurately modeling storm surge in urban environments (  Communicating RSL rise impacts -Tracking and communicating water levels is one of the best ways to minimize flood impacts. Sensors installed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) account for most sensors in the U.S. capable of water level observation and tidal prediction, respectively. However, there are also several regional water authorities who monitor and maintain archived records of water levels for increased density of data resources, including the California Department of Water Resources, the Iowa Flood Center, the Harris County Flood Control District (in and around Houston, Texas), and StormSense (in and around Hampton Roads, Virgina), to name some examples. To elaborate on an ongoing example in Coastal Virginia, StormSense is an (Internet of Things) IoT-enabled inundation forecasting research initiative and an active participant in the Global City Teams Challenge. The project aims to enhance flood preparedness in the smart cities of Hampton Roads, Virginia for flooding resulting from storm surge, rain, and tides (Loftis et al., 2017). In this study, we present the results of the new StormSense water level sensors to help establish the \"regional resilience monitoring network\" noted as a key recommendation from the Intergovernmental Pilot Project. Visualizing RSL flood risk -Based upon the availability of sensor data to communicate RSL in multiple locations throughout a region, there are a number of websites that allow mapping of sea level rise, however, flood events occur on top of sea level changes and can be harder to communicate. If sensors are densely populated in a region, it is likely that a meaningful interpolation (with shoreline barriers) could be automated for a richer interpretation of water levels in a region. Integration of data from multiple networks can be useful in the context of data viewers and portals via dynamic visualization to attempt to communicate the risks of RSL rise (Loftis et al., 2018b). RSL data are communicated through many sea level rise viewers and most provide the ability to access different types of data through a single server. Portals are typically aimed at users who want to do their own analyses and provide information to un-synthesized data. Viewers provide mapped and synthesized data tools for resilience planning. From a nationwide perspective, three prominent portals are commonly used to address resilience planning and evaluate sea-level rise scenarios: From a state-wide perspective, many states have resilience planning portals, which are used to guide informed management decision-making. For example, in Virginia, AdaptVA (http://www.AdaptVA.org) is a website dedicated to providing climate-related data specifically curated for adaptation efforts in Virginia ( Figure VI-4). It provides both a data geo-portal and synthesized information, targeting different users with each. The geo-portal is primarily built to deliver Virginia specific data, but will also search ArcGIS.com for global data. All of the synthesized data tools are specific to Virginia (VIMS CCRM, 2017). Guiding resilience efforts in the face of increasing RSL -Resiliency requires both a clear understanding of the problem posed by RSL changes and management strategies that are adaptable to those changes. In this section, we will highlight some best practices to achieving resiliency to sea level change. The value of the data presented in this VIMS special report is that a trend analysis cannot be deciphered and interpreted to provide future predictions without a record of the past. The same applies for the flooding and inundation events that occur now and in the future. The USGS provides storm-specific data records for hurricanes that make landfall in the U.S. through their interactive mapping platform; however, little is currently being done to address a more frequent issue, tidal flooding. Often branded as simply a nuisance, the cost that frequently flooded coastal cities are incurring is considerable. Thus, around the coastal U.S., communities are striving to get a better handle on the highest of these tidal flooding events, called king tides, in hope of preparing for sea level rise. Scientists, planners, environmentalists and journalists have launched projects that involve everyday residents documenting how high the king tides rise. In one example of citizen-science community support, Hawaii Sea Grant has organized a multi-island In another recent example, from coastal Virginia, \"Catch the King\" Tide was a successful citizen-science GPS data collection effort that took place during the king tide on November 5, 2017, focusing on Hampton Roads, Virginia. Other communities in Miami, Florida, Charleston, South Carolina, Outer Banks, NC, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, contributed data during the king tide along the U.S. East Coast. An interactive story map (http://bit.ly/2A6xh7c) and web application (http://bit.ly/2zcS7Ba) recruited interested volunteers and superposed the GPS observation data with the predicted flooding extent image services to provide cross-platform flood predictions to interested volunteers regardless of device type. Both pages resulted in more than 10,000 page views (each) within the first three months after they were released. Over 600 volunteers mapped the king tide's maximum flooding extent to validate and improve predictive models and future forecasting of increasingly pervasive 'nuisance' flooding. Nearly 60,000 GPS high water marks and over 1200 geotagged pictures of inundation were captured using the Sea Level Rise mobile application to drop GPS breadcrumbs tracing the floodwaters. Response from the event's dedicated volunteers, fueled by constant media coverage leading up to the event, caused \"Catch the King\" to become the largest flood-related crowdsourcing data event in the world (Loftis, 2017  A hydrodynamic model developed by VIMS was used to predict the timing of tidal flooding, while extents were also estimated with the assistance of a topographic bathtub model in areas outside the street-level model's coverage in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The accuracy of the model forecasts for predicted tidal flood depths were found to be accurate to 1.4 in (3.5 cm) via root mean squared error (RMSE) and within an aggregate RMSE 19.3 ft (5.9 m) for tidal flooding extents measured by the nearly 60,000 GPS high water marks. In the context of future flooding, the true value of monitoring the king tide is to improving hydro-correction in digital elevation models for areas occluded from airborne Lidar (such as those canopied by tree cover or streams under bridge overpasses or culverts). The user-reported flooding extent data provided geospatial model validation and highlighted areas where these predictions were inaccurate and could be improved. Once the extent of the projected changes can be reasonably comprehended, it should be incorporated into coastal planning efforts through an emphasis on adaptable solutions. An example of an adaptable coastal solution is the use of natural shoreline treatments (\"living shorelines\" or \"natural and nature-based features\") for shoreline stabilization ( Figure VI-6). As a flood defense, natural shoreline strategies have been shown to be more sustainable, costeffective, and have fewer side effects than conventional (hardening) strategies (Temmerman et al., 2013). Natural features, such as marshes, also have the capacity to move and elevate with changing water levels. Therefore, they are a recommended strategy for coping with RSL risedriven erosion and flooding (Bilkovic et al., 2016;Bilkovic et al., 2017). Under changing conditions, natural features are considered a \"low regret\" option for shoreline stabilization and should be prioritized (Mitchell et al., 2013). "}, {"section_title": "VI-10", "text": "Summary of Management Recommendations -1. RSL should be monitored on an annual basis and consistently compared to year 2050 RSL projections. 2. RSL rise projections should be limited to approximately 30 years in the future, since changing processes and decision making will affect longer term projections in ways not anticipated by their histories. 3. Construction will be safest when placed above the elevation of the upper 95% confidence interval, rather than above the 2050 RSL projection itself. In locations with a high HiVI score, storm activity raises water levels above yearly mean sea level (YMSL) frequently enough to warrant consideration of including these higher water levels in planning efforts. In these areas, it is important to add a storm \"buffer\" above the upper 95% MMSL confidence interval into future planning efforts. 4. Mapping RSL changes is critical to integrating these changes into management actions. Given limited funding, prioritization of flood issues can help localities address problems in a logical fashion. 5. Resiliency to RSL changes is dependent on communication with all stakeholders, a good understanding of the rate and direction of the change, and the incorporation of RSL change impacts into coastal planning. A-1 Appendix A -Estimating The Seasonal Cycle and Decadal Signal The Seasonal Cycle -Seasonal variations in monthly mean sea level (MMSL) recorded by tide gauges have both an astronomical and a meteorological origin. The astronomical component arises from cyclic variations in the sun's declination and distance from the Earth which have periods of half a year and one year, respectively. This component is represented in predictions of the astronomic tide by the solar annual (Sa) and solar semiannual (Ssa) tidal constituents. However, changes due to earth-sun gravitational interactions are relatively minor in comparison to weather-induced variations, principally the annual cycle in solar heating and expansioncontraction of the ocean water column. Because most of the amplitude of the Sa and Ssa constituents derives from meteorological forcing, which changes noticeably from one year to the next, an average is usually taken over several years. One way of representing the seasonal cycle uses water level averages computed separately for each calendar month of the year over a period of up to 19 years. Another method derives it by least-squares harmonic analysis applied directly to a detrended multidecadal MMSL series (Parker, 2007). The latter method was used here for the seasonal cycle, shown in Fig. A-1 as it appears over a typical decade at Norfolk, Virginia; typical except for a rare MMSL high that appears in February, 1998, coinciding with the expected low in the seasonal cycle for this month. The high noted is an example of the diverse effects of weather and the importance of averaging. The seasonal cycle is removed by subtracting its detrended monthly values from those of a raw MMSL series downloaded from www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov referencing NOAA's MSL tidal datum for the 1983-2001 epoch. Water level variance occurring at tidal frequencies makes no net contribution to the trend itself in a MMSL time series spanning multiple decades. By removing it, one final source of variance at known tidal frequencies is eliminated. A typical example of the reduction in variance can be seen in the MMSL series comparisons presented in Fig. A-2. The Decadal Signal -Quasi-periodic variations in sea level associated with varying surface winds and ocean-atmosphere exchange are of considerable interest here because they are often highly coherent from one coastal location to the next with amplitudes as high as 10 cm (Boon, Brubaker and Forrest, 2010). Unlike the fully periodic seasonal cycle with nearly the same amplitude, the decadal signal has no fixed interval of recurrence for its highs and lows. Sturges and Hong (2001) state that, in normal usage, the term 'decadal' loosely applies to spectral energy found at frequencies corresponding to periods \"longer than a year out to ten years and beyond.\" This precludes its derivation by least-squares harmonic analysis or similar methods dealing with fixed frequencies. It is derived in this report by applying a third-order Butterworth digital filter with cutoff period of 24 months (using MATLAB function butter in combination with function filtfilt, which performs zero-phase digital filtering by processing input data in both forward and reverse directions). Although a decadal signal derived by filtering can be displayed superposed on a time series of MMSL heights, it is questionable whether it can be removed from the series in the same way as the seasonal cycle; i.e., without affecting the linear -and especially the quadratic -trends subsequently obtained from the reduced series. Unlike least-squares harmonic analysis deriving variance at fixed frequencies, filtering removes variance from a detrended series over a range of frequencies leaving the decadal signal in a residual form that may include part of a trend. Superposing the decadal signal provides visual clues for understanding the effect of a recent decadal high or low in modulating RSL projections in the near term (see Appendix C). The decadal signal shown in Fig. A-3 has ten 'zero-up' trend crossings spread over almost 50 years, an average recurrence period of about 5 years for the decadal highs (or lows) in this segment. The digital filter used to derive the decadal signal has a 24-month cutoff period, its span being one more than the number of data points lost at the series ends. In this case, eleven months are given up at either end of the series as seen in the figure below. While this is unavoidable, enough of the signal phase (trending high or low) can be seen to judge its effect in modulating the quadratic trend projection going forward in time. For the 1969-2017 segment shown in Fig. A-3 the decadal signal begins and ends in a neutral position, neither high nor low. Confidence Interval for \u03b2 1 -The linear rate of sea level rise in millimeters per year is represented by the parameter \u03b2 1 in the regression equation where Y i represents the i th sea level height, X i is the corresponding fractional year and i \uf065 is the i th error or deviation from regression in a time series of n values. Using overbars to represent the series mean of Y i and X i , the unknown parameter \u03b2 1 is estimated as with \u03b2 0 estimated as b 0 = \u0305 \u2212 1 \u0305 . The estimated standard error for b 1 is where s is the standard deviation of the series heights, Y i , and the quantity in the denominator is computed as the root sum of squares for the series of years X i , i = 1,n. The confidence interval on b 1 is then computed as the product of a value from the t -distribution and Se, the estimated standard error. At the 95% level of confidence, Example Computation for Norfolk, Virginia -The following is an illustration of the limitations of a confidence interval when applied to sea level time series trends. A 90-year record was selected beginning in 1928, the first complete year of monthly mean sea level (MMSL) available at Sewells Point in Norfolk, Virginia (from www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Starting with the first ten years of record (i = 1,120), the linear trend parameter, b 1 , was calculated using Eq. B-2 with Y i in mm above MSL datum and X i in years relative to 1992. From Eq. B-3, the ratio of the standard deviation of Y i (denoted as SDY) to the root sum of squares of X i (denoted as RSSX) produces the standard error of the trend: Se = SDY/RSSX. The computations were then repeated adding new data in 10-year increments. No corrections were made for serial correlation likely to be present in a time series of sea level height. B-2 Figure B-1(A) illustrates the apparent benefit of longer records in reducing trend standard error. Figure B-1(B) shows how that benefit is achieved; not by a reduction in SDY (it increases gradually with record length) but through a sharp increase in RSSX, recalling that trend standard error is defined as the ratio SDY/RSSX. This means there is nothing in the added measurements themselves contributing to a smaller confidence interval on sea level rise rate at Norfolk; it is simply the result of adding years independent of the data they present. Although it may be considered valid to write the \u00b1 numbers shown in Figs. B-1(C) and B-1(D), the implication that an infinitely long record will yield high confidence in a single precise number representing sea level rise is unsettling if not obscure. Trends can and do change over time. Confidence Intervals for Predicted Heights -Not to be confused with confidence intervals on the rate of sea level rise, the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals shown as curving black lines above and below the red trend line in Y enabling inclusive bands to be drawn with the classic 'bow-tie' appearance over the full range of times X i ; e.g., Fig. B-1D. Confidence Intervals for MMSL observations -Confidence intervals derived with Eq. B-7 apply only to the predicted mean heights that lie on the trend line of best fit to the MMSL observations. In some situations, it may be of greater interest to know the likely range in deviation from trend of the individual observations across X i and beyond. This can be achieved using the following equation in place of Eq. B-7, The 95% confidence intervals on height derived with Eq. B-8 will thus be wider and more uniform than those obtained with Eq. B-7 and will enclose approximately 95% of the MMSL observations as shown in Fig. B-2(A). This interval can be a valuable guide where flooding is a concern as it informs the user of the amount of sea level deviation from trend to expect in any one month. If a decision is made to project a trend forward in time beyond the latest observation, Eq. B-8 may be useful in another way. When a projection to time X 0 extends too far into the future, the numerator of the third term inside the large brackets, 2 0 () XX \uf02d , will become large in comparison to the sum of squares of X, causing the 95% confidence intervals to expand more than is reasonable. The intervals will expand even further and eventually 'blow up' if the span of the time series of observations is too short compared to the length of the projection.  Estimates of \u03b2 1, \u03b2 2 obtained using MATLAB -Both graphs in Fig. B-2 above are based on the quadratic model, a second-order polynomial equation that is usually written as Note that Eq. B-9 differs slightly from Eq. III-1 in Section III of this report. The fraction \u00bd placed in front of \u03b2 2 in Eq. III-1 signifies that \u03b2 2 there is meant to represent acceleration, positive or negative, in the quadratic model for sea level change. If using Eq. B-9, the form that appears in most texts and commercial computing algorithms, be aware that acceleration is twice the value of the coefficient b 2 returned as an estimate of \u03b2 2 in those algorithms. The MATLAB function polyfit was used here to find estimates of \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 after centering and applying a scaling transformation to the input data to improve the numerical properties of both the polynomial and the fitting algorithm. The function polyval further provides error estimates and predictions using the output from polyfit. A confidence interval can be calculated on the acceleration estimate but it would have limited value in the present application. If high confidence in an underlying linear trend in sea level rise long-term appears misplaced, it is more so for an underlying non-linear trend whose variation over time is even more apparent. Among assumptions that apply in parametric statistics, the parent population being sampled is expected to follow a normal distribution with fixed mean and standard deviation. A normal distribution governing heights at a fixed time X 0 in Eqs. B-7 and B-8 is a reasonable assumption but less so for parameters \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 where the sampled population is often not a stationary one, especially if it is subject to change driven by environmental factors. For this reason confidence intervals on estimated sea level rise rate (b 1 ) and acceleration (2b 2 ) are not included in this report. Norfolk (Sewells Point), Virginia B Norfolk (Sewells Point), Virginia A B-5 In the near-term, estimates b 1 and 2b 2 can be useful guides by themselves concerning trends in rise rate and acceleration when the temporal context for change is understood. As illustrated in the two graphs in Fig. B-2, the decadal signal begins and ends with roughly the same neutral phase, which helps to explain why the quadratic trends are similar -each projecting about a halfmeter of rise by 2050 -even though the height confidence intervals for the quadratic trend projection based on the shorter series of observations quickly become unreasonable. It can be seen that even a slight addition of data beyond 1994 brings about a different ending phase for the decadal signal with implications regarding the accompanying quadratic trend projection to be expected.  APPENDIX D: Q-mode Factor Analysis Q-mode factor analysis is one of a number of computational procedures for interpreting multivariate data using eigenvector methods. Several of these procedures are related but bear different names, including empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), principal components analysis (PCA), principal coordinates analysis, and R-mode factor analysis. To begin, factor analysis requires a collection of observations (measurements) of a fixed number of variables m, made on a fixed number of objects n, forming an n x m data matrix where n>m. Variables can consist of any type of repeated measurement that may, or may not, have the same units as another variable in the analysis being performed. In the present study, the variables are the fourteen RSL measurements in a sea level history where all units are either mm/year or mm/year 2 . The 'objects' are the geographic locations where the measurements were made. where [Q] is a square-symmetric n x n matrix. Instead of treating [Q] as a variance-covariance equivalent, a similarity metric known as cosine \u03b8 is often used for the purpose of understanding the relationship between objects rather than variables. After first standardizing the objects by dividing the elements x k=1,n in each row of [X] by the root sum of squares for that row, the compositional relationship between objects can be derived as cosine \u03b8 ij = when \u03b8 ij = 90\u00b0 the vectors are orthogonal (cosine \u03b8 = 0) indicating completely dissimilar variable composition. Note that, although there are only m summations in Eq. D-3, the cosine \u03b8 matrix that results is of size n x n with n>m. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Given a data set consisting of measurements on three variables, a 3-D plot of the measurement vectors on three right-angle coordinate axes can be visualized as defining an ellipsoid with major and minor axes positioned at angles to the coordinate axes. A linear combination of weighted original variables can be found that produce new vectors coinciding with the ellipsoid axes. These are the eigenvectors whose lengths may be determined from their corresponding eigenvalues. Eigenvectors are ranked according to the amount of variance accounted for when the original measurements are projected onto their axes in variable space. Given a large number of variables, it often happens that two or three eigenvectors alone can account for a high percentage of the total variance or 'information' in the data set. And while there is often correlation among the original variables, there is none between the variables projected onto orthonormal, mutually-independent eigenvector axes -axes called components in PCA and compositional end-members in Q-mode factor analysis. Factor analysis basically differs from PCA by assuming the existence of a fixed number of underlying factors p (where p<m) that explain most of the data variability observed. The factor analyst must then judge from independent information, or experience, whether to specify a twofactor solution or some other number for p in advance of the analysis. In Q-mode analysis as performed here, the elements of an eigenvector obtained from the cosine \u03b8 matrix previously described are factor scores that represent the composition of that factor and its position as an object in variable space. Q-mode scores are converted into factor loadings by multiplying each vector element by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue 1 . At this point a decision can be made to rotate the first p factor axes about their origin, one pair at a time, so as to maximize the loadings on each retained factor axis while ignoring m-p others. The object vectors keep the same orientation with respect to each other throughout. A procedure called varimax is described in text books on statistics that accomplishes factor rotation. Computing packages such as MATLAB provide the functions that perform matrix operations and obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues. An Example from the U.S. Gulf Coast: Given the RSL rise rates observed at nine U.S. Gulf Coast locations, rotated factor loadings from a Q-mode analysis specifying a three-factor solution (p = 3) are shown in Figure D-1 below. The loadings in this case illustrate a situation in which there is effectively only one factor. The object (location) vectors have a very narrow spread and, as vectors of unit length, their position on the red circle of unit radius means they have zero loadings on a third factor perpendicular to the page but have high commonality with factors 1 and 2. However, a further rotation about the axis origin could align the vectors equally well with either factor 1 or factor 2 due to the narrow spread. Although narrow, the loadings vectors do suggest an order among locations with least compositional similarity between Cedar Key and the Grand Isle-Galveston-Port Isabel group of locations."}]
