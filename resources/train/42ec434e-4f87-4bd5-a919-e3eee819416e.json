Heterologous expression of any vaccine candidate protein has very 418 promising scopes for developing such low cost vaccine, providing that all essential properties for 419 antigenicity, immunogenicity and functional configuration are being conserved to mimic the 420 structural and functional property of the actual antigen 34 .
