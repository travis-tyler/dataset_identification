[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We used capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models to estimate population trends (mean annual population change, \u03bb ) in western North America for 86 landbird species from 15 years (1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) of data from the MAPS program (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship; www.birdpop.org/pages/maps.php). The mean \u03bb for 26 temperate-wintering migratory species that winter in the North Temperate Zone was significantly <1.0 (decreasing), nonsignificantly >1.0 (increasing) for 40 migratory species wintering in the neotropics, and nonsignificantly <1.0 for 20 permanent resident species. Values of \u03bb for the 86 individual species were positively correlated with the 1992-2006 trends for those species according to the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and the pattern of means of \u03bb from the two sources was similar for all three migration classes. For migratory species, we compared the 1992-2006 pattern of \u03bb from MAPS with the 1966-1991 and 1979-1991 population trends derived from BBS data. The result suggests that patterns of population change remained much the same from 1966 through 2006, but populations tended to decrease more during the most recent 15 years of those 4 decades. For four species selected as case studies, we used MAPS data to estimate apparent survival of adults and recruitment from CMR models, and to index adults' population density, productivity, and post-breeding effects from generalized linear mixed models. For each of those four species we then examined temporal pairwise correlations among the annual estimates of \u03bb , population density of adults, apparent survival of adults, productivity, and postbreeding effects to make inferences regarding the proximate demographic drivers of population change. These correlations led us to hypothesize that the 1992-2006 population decreases for the Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) were driven primarily by decreases in adult survival, for the Orange-crowned Warbler (Oreothlypis celata) by that and decreases in productivity. For the \"Western\" Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis/occidentalis), however, we hypothesize that population decreases were driven primarily by first-year survival, as apparently were increases in the Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus) population. We suggest such population changes can be tested, and that the ultimate environmental drivers of population change for these and other species can be identified by integrated modeling of BBS, MAPS, and other demographic data in conjunction with local and landscape-scale data on habitat, weather, and climate."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "evolved intricate adaptations to multiple environments in different geographical areas during their annual cycle. Sedentary species also may not be immune to such environmental changes, because their habitat flexibility and dispersal capabilities may be limited.\nTo best manage and conserve landbird species, we must monitor changes not only in their abundance and distribution on appropriate temporal and spatial scales (Bart 2005 , Sauer et al. 2008 but also in their primary demographic parameters (e.g., vital rates such as productivity and survival). These values may allow us to understand the proximate demographic correlates of population change and determine the stage(s) of the annual cycle when and where these changes are being effected (DeSante et al. 2001, Saracco and . We must also develop demographic models using environmental covariates (e.g., habitat, weather, climate) to determine the ultimate environmental drivers of those demographic changes (DeSante et al. 2005a) . Understanding the contribution of the various vital rates to the dynamics of bird populations not only has important conservation implications, it is fundamental to our basic understanding of avian population dynamics (Sillett et al. 2000 , Sillett and Holmes 2002 , Julliard 2004 .\nThe challenges to determining population trends are formidable, particularly because of the inherent difficulty of counting landbirds accurately. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models, however, enable estimation of the annual rate of population change (\u03bb) without a count of the number of individuals in the population (Pradel 1996) . In addition, transient Cormack-JollySeber CMR models (Pradel et al. 1997 ) provide estimates of apparent survival (true survival minus emigration) of resident adults and derived recruitment rates. Moreover, if the CMR data-collection protocol is standardized over many capture stations, and each station's size and capture effort are held constant throughout the station's operation, indices of population density and productivity may be obtained from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) (Peach et al. 2004) .\nThe Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program was established in 1989 by The Institute for Bird Populations to provide estimates of population change and the vital rates that are the demographic correlates of that change, including apparent survival of adults and productivity. The MAPS protocol became standardized in 1992, and over 1200 stations have been established and operated since then. Here, using data from the 1992-2006 operation of MAPS stations in western North America, we demonstrate that population trends can be estimated from these data for a large number of landbird species. We also examine these trends as a function of the species' migration strategies. We then compare these estimates of population change to analogous population trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS; Sauer et al. 2014) and to estimates of population change during the preceding 13-year (1979-1991) and 26-year (1966-1991) periods (DeSante and George 1994) . Then, for four species selected as case studies, we use Cormack-Jolly-Seber CMR models to estimate apparent survival of adults and derive estimates of recruitment, following the ad hoc approach of Pradel et al. (1997) to account for transients. We also use GLMMs to estimate indices of adults' population density and productivity (number of young/number of adults) and to derive an index of post-breeding effects (recruitment/productivity). Finally, we examine pairwise temporal (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) correlations among annual estimates of \u03bb , population density of adults, apparent survival of adults, productivity, and post-breeding effects, from which we infer the demographic drivers of population change for these selected species."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MAPs dAtA", "text": "Data from the MAPS program come from the annual operation of a network of stations that extends across the continental United States and southern Canada. The overall design and the general field methods of this program were standardized in 1992 as described by DeSante (1992) and DeSante et al. (1995 DeSante et al. ( , 1996 DeSante et al. ( , 2004 DeSante et al. ( , 2014 . In general, MAPS stations are 20-ha study areas established where long-term mist netting is practical and permissible and where the habitat is expected to remain undisturbed for at least 10 years. Typically, ten mist nets, 12 m long with 30-mm mesh, are distributed rather uniformly through the central portion of each station and left open for a consistent time during 6-10 mornings (fewer at more northerly latitudes) spaced at approximately 10-day intervals through the breeding season. The times of opening and closing the nets and beginning each net run are standardized and recorded each day so that netting effort can be calculated for each 10-day period each year.\nEach bird captured is marked with a uniquely numbered aluminum leg band provided by the U.S. Geological Survey or the Canadian Wildlife Service and, if possible, its sex and age are determined according to guidelines developed by Pyle (1997) . Measures of physical condition (body mass, wing chord, and fat content), breeding condition (cloacal protuberance and/or brood patch), and body and flight-feather molt (including feather wear and molt limits) are recorded for all birds captured, including recaptures, with standardized codes. The station's operator identifies whether each species seen or heard (including species not captured) breeds at the site by criteria similar to those employed for breeding bird atlases.\nFollowing computer entry, all MAPS data are vetted (MAPSPROG; Froehlich et al. 2006) for (1) the validity of the codes used in all records; (2) internal consistency of each banding record by comparison of the criteria for aging and sexing and data on breeding and molt to the resulting identifications to species, age, and sex; (3) consistency of these determinations for all records of each band number; and (4) consistency among data on banding, effort, and breeding status for all records.\nWe defined western North America to include all continental U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories west of the eastern boundaries of Yukon territory, Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. We analyzed data from all stations within this area that were operated for at least 4 years during the 15-year period 1992-2006 and for which no more than 2 consecutive years were missed during the period of operation. To include data from a station for any given year, we required that the effort must have been sufficient for the data to be usable for analyses of both survival and productivity (i.e., operated with at least half of the standardized effort during at least five 10-day periods distributed throughout the season). A total of 286 stations fulfilled these requirements during the period 1992-2006; data from these stations form the basis for the analyses reported here.\nWe included data for any given species only from those stations at which the species was a \"usual breeder,\" that is, a summer resident and presumably attempting to breed at the station (i.e., at least a portion of its territory fell within the station boundaries) during more than half of the years that the station was operated from 1992 to 2006. Finally, we limited our analyses to species that were captured at 6 or more stations, for which a total of at least 75 adults were captured, banded, and released during the 15-year period 1992-2006, and at which at least 10 individuals were recaptured during that period at least one year after being banded. We realize that 75 adults is a very small sample for use in assessing rangewide population change, but we were interested in exploring the range of sample sizes from which the rate of population change could be estimated and how such estimates would compare with estimates from the BBS. A total of 103 \"species\" satisfied these criteria and were included in the analyses. Because of the difficulty of distinguishing the Alder (Empidonax alnorum) from the Willow (E. traillii) Flycatcher, and the Pacificslope (E. difficilis) from the Cordilleran (E. occidentalis) Flycatcher, we combined data for each of these two species pairs and analyzed them as two \"species,\" \"Traill's\" Flycatcher and \"Western\" Flycatcher, respectively.\nTo investigate potential patterns, we grouped species into three categories according to their distance of migration: N (neotropical), migratory, <50% of the population wintering north of the U.S./Mexico border; T (temperate), migratory, >50% of the population wintering north of the U.S./Mexico border; R (permanent resident), nonmigratory, the species making only irregular, irruptive, or minor (<<50% of the population) movements during the nonbreeding season."}, {"section_title": "estiMAtion of \u03bb", "text": "For each of the 103 species, we applied Pradel reverse-time CMR models (Pradel 1996) to the data to estimate the population's annual growth rate (\u03bb) for each of 14 intervals during the 15-year period 1992-2006. A value of \u03bb <1.0 indicates a decrease, >1.0 an increase. We used the \"Pradel survival and lambda\" routine in program Mark (White and Burnham 1999 ) and used the package \"RMark\" (as described by Laake 2013) in R version 2.10.1 (R Development Core Team 2009) to estimate \u03d5 (apparent survival of adults) and \u03bb. We considered three basic linear models for each of these two demographic parameters, with a log link for \u03bb and logit link for \u03d5: (1) time-dependent (t, for which we considered year as a fixed effect, calculating a year-specific estimate for each of the 14 intervals); (2) a linear function of time (T, in which an intercept and slope [\u03b2] were estimated over the entire 15-year period and year-specific estimates were calculated from the intercept and slope); and (3) time-constant (i.e., intercept only, in which a single estimate was calculated over the entire 15-year period). In addition to three temporal models each for \u03bb and \u03d5, we considered four logit-linear models for the \"nuisance\" parameter, p, probability of recapture, as: (1) time-constant (\u00b7); (2) time-dependent (t); (3) a function of the station-specific mean number of captures of individual birds within a season over the entire 15-year period (CAPCOV); and (4) both time-dependent (t) and a function of the station-specific mean number of captures of individual birds within a season (CAPCOV + t). There were thus a total of 36 models in the set of Pradel reverse-time CMR models, (3 for \u03bb) \u00d7 (3 for \u03d5) \u00d7 (4 for p). We selected models based on the Akaike's information criterion (Burnham and Anderson 1992 ) corrected for small sample size (AIC c ; Burnham and Anderson 1998) . In addition to calculating parameter estimates as above, we also calculated fully model-averaged parameter estimates by using AIC c weights (w i ; Burnham and Anderson 1998). We did not assess goodness of fit or attempt to estimate overdispersion for these models as no methods specific for the Pradel model are available.\nWe excluded (i.e., considered unusable) a yearspecific estimate of \u03bb if its standard error (SE) was 0, if its lower 95% confidence limit (LCL) was 0 or upper 95% confidence limit (UCL) was infinity, if its SE was larger than the estimate, if its value was <0.3 (the approximate value of \u03bb if all three demographic rates contributing to \u03bb [productivity, survival of young, and survival of adults] were simultaneously 60% lower than in the previous year), if its value was >2.1 (the approximate value of \u03bb if all three demographic rates were simultaneously 60% higher than in the previous year), or if it was associated with recruitment estimates (see below) <0. If we excluded an estimate of \u03bb, we also excluded the corresponding estimate of recruitment. We further analyzed only the 86 species for which we obtained a usable (not excluded) year-specific model-averaged estimate of \u03bb for at least 10 of the 14 intervals (pairs of years) between 1992 and 2006.\nFor each of these 86 species, we calculated the geometric mean of the usable fully model-averaged year-specific estimates of \u03bb, which were weighted by the number of unique adults captured each year. We used this geometric mean estimate (\u03bb ) as our measure of the species ' overall 1992-2006 population trend according to the MAPS data. Then, with the package \"msm\" (Jackson 2011) in R (R Development Core Team 2009), we used the variance-covariance matrices of the year-specific estimates of \u03bb and the delta method (Oehlert 1992) to calculate the SE of the geometric mean and subsequent 95% LCL and UCL.\nTo investigate potential patterns in population trends, we grouped species by their trends from 1992 to 2006 as decreasing (D), \u03bb < 0.99; or 0.99 < \u03bb < 1.0 and \u03bb < 1.0, stable (S), 0.99 < \u03bb < 1.01 and 95% CI of \u03bb contains 1.0, or increasing (I), \u03bb > 1.01; or 1.0 < \u03bb < 1.01 and \u03bb > 1.0.\nTo examine potential differences among the three categories of migration, we created a histogram of \u03bb and calculated the unweighted grand mean and 95% CI for the species within each category.\nWe also used the estimate of the slope of the linear-time model \u03bb T as a measure of the log-linear temporal trend in the population growth rate over the period [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] , and considered the trend to be statistically significant if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated slope ( \u03b2 ) did not contain 0."}, {"section_title": "CoMPArison of MAPs \u0302 with BBs PoPulAtion trends", "text": "For each of the 86 species for which we estimated \u03bb from the 1992-2006 MAPS data, we also obtained the survey-wide population trend estimated from BBS data for the same period (Sauer et al. 2014 ).

We were able to estimate \u03bb from MAPS data for the subsequent 15 years (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) for 59 of these species (37 wintering in the neotropics, 22 in the temperate zone). Because of the differences between DeSante and George (1994) and our analysis in the manner in which we identified a species' population as stable (no trend), we could not compare the numbers or proportions of species with decreasing or increasing trends in the two sets of data directly. Instead, for each time period (1966-1991, 1979-1991, 1992-2006) , we excluded all species with stable populations and calculated the resulting proportion of species with decreasing trends among those with any trend, considering only the 59 species in common between the studies. We did this for each migratory group (wintering in the neotropics or temperate zone) and for both groups combined. We also compared the three groups (neotropical, temperate, combined) relative to the proportions of species whose trend changed between time periods. We defined a change in trend as more negative (change from increasing to stable, increasing to decreasing, or stable to decreasing), more positive (change from decreasing to stable, decreasing to increasing, or stable to increasing), or not changing (decreasing to decreasing, increasing to increasing, or stable to stable). We then calculated, for each migratory group and both groups combined, the proportion of species whose trend had become more negative among all species whose trend had changed (positively or negatively) between periods.\nestiMAtion of other vitAl rAtes for seleCted sPeCies A population's growth rate (annual population change, \u03bb t ) is defined as the population size in year t + 1 divided by the population size in year t. There are two processes whereby the size of a bird population changes from year t to year t + 1. These are apparent survival of adults and recruitment. Apparent survival of adults is defined as the difference between two processes: true survival of adults (the complement of mortality) minus emigration of adults. In contrast, recruitment is the result of the addition of two processes: recruitment of young plus immigration of adults. Recruitment of young itself is the product of two other processes: productivity times first-year survival. Thus, recruitment can be described as\nwhere \u0192 is the recruitment rate, IM is the immigration rate of adults, RI is productivity, and S HY is the first-year survival rate of the young (hatching-year) birds. This can be rearranged as\nThe recruitment rate (\u0192) and the reproductive rate (RI) can be obtained from MAPS data (see below). First-year survival, however, generally cannot be estimated by CMR models from MAPS data because distances of natal dispersal of most landbirds, especially migratory species, generally exceed the diameter of a 20-ha MAPS station (Sutherland et al. 2000) . Furthermore, MAPS data do not directly yield an estimate or index of the rate of immigration of adults. However, we can define a new index, post-breeding effects, PBE = \u0192/RI, which comprises everything that affects \u0192 after the young have become independent of their parents. Thus the above equation becomes\nModeling with actual MAPS data has shown that PBE is significantly correlated with S HY regardless of whether the immigration rate, IM, is modeled as zero, constant (0.15 or 0.25), variable but negatively correlated with adult apparent survival, or variable and random (DFD unpubl. data) . Therefore, we suggest that correlations between PBE t and \u03bb t , or between PBE t and other vital rates, should be similar to and can inform analogous relationships between S t HY and \u03bb t , or between S t HY and those other vital rates.\nTo demonstrate how MAPS data can be used to investigate the demographic correlates of population change, we selected four species as case studies for estimating three important vital rates (\u03d5, RI, and PBE). The four species included three that winter in the neotropics, breed widely in western North America, and often co-occur at MAPS stations. Two of these, the \"Western\" Flycatcher and Orange-crowned Warbler (Oreothlypis celata), were decreasing according to MAPS data, while the third, the Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus), was increasing. The fourth, the Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), is an irruptive species wintering in the temperate zone and decreasing per MAPS data."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of Apparent Survival of Adults", "text": "Estimates of apparent survival of adults, \u03d5, from Pradel reverse-time CMR models will be biased (low) if the population contains transient individuals such as passage migrants, dispersing birds, and floaters (sensu Brown 1969) whose probability of returning to the station is effectively zero. Because of this potential bias, we estimated year-specific apparent survival rates of adults ( \u03c6 ) with CJS models that account for the presence of transients (Pradel et al. 1997 , Hines et al. 2003 . We also used these modified models to estimate the \"nuisance\" parameter residency (\u03c4), the proportion of residents among newly captured adults of unknown residency (i.e., those that were not recaptured at least 7 days later in their first year of capture). These models provide estimates for \u03c4 by combining two survival rates, \u03d5 U1 , the first period survival rate for individuals not captured 7 or more days later in their first year of capture (a mix of resident and transient individuals), and \u03d5 M , the survival rate of residents. We can then let \u03d5 M serve as our No. 3 estimate for \u03d5 tr and hereafter refer to it simply as apparent survival of adults (\u03d5). Again, we modeled all combinations of \u03d5 U1 and \u03d5 M each as time-constant (\u00b7), time-dependent (t), or a linear function of time (T); we also added two models in which the two parameters (t or T) vary in concert. Thus there were 11 biologically meaningful models describing time variation (or lack thereof ) in \u03d5 U1 and \u03d5 M . We modeled time variation in recapture probability, p, with the same four models that we used for p in the Pradel models, as described above. Thus the set of CJS models adjusted for transients numbered 44, (11 for \u03d5 U1 and \u03d5 M ) \u00d7 (4 for p). We also calculated fully model-averaged estimates of \u03c6 on the basis of AIC c model weights. Assessment of goodness of fit was complicated by missed days of netting at some sites, so we did not attempt to adjust the models' likelihoods for overdispersion (Danner et al. 2013, Brown and Graham 2015) .\nWe excluded, as unusable, estimates of \u03d5 = 0 or 1, and those with SE = 0, LCL = 0, or UCL = 1. Also excluded were estimates of \u03d5 associated with estimates of \u03c4 >1 or with estimates of f <0.

Under this assumption, we calculated year-specific estimates of the recruitment rate for the four selected species a\u015d tr = \u03bb \u2212 \u03c6 tr , where \u0302t r represents an estimate of the year-specific number of new individuals in the population in year t per individual in year t -1, based on \u03bb from Pradel reverse-time models and \u03c6 from the CJS models adjusted for the length of stay of transients. Although demographic contributions to trends could be inferred from survival and recruitment estimates derived solely from Pradel reversetime models , we believe that combining information from the Pradel and CJS models, as we have done, provides a more appropriate basis for assessing demographic components of trends. Therefore we refer to \u0302t r simply as recruitment \u0302 . We were unable to calculate confidence intervals for derived parameters (e.g.,\n) because those parameters were not modeled explicitly and so did not have associated variance-covariance matrices.

To calculate correction offsets for missed or excess effort, we used regional spatial replication of sites and incorporated the offsets into the linear models. For the effort-corrected indices of capture and productivity of adults, we used the models' predictions based on the exponent of the intercept plus year effect, such that predictions for adults (Ad) were expressed as number of adults per station and productivity (RI) was expressed as the number of young birds per adult bird per station. We estimated the SE of these year-specific indices by the delta method (Oehlert 1992 ), which we implemented in R by following Jackson (2010), and we approximated 95% confidence intervals from these SEs.

Also, as with the temporal CMR models, we used AIC c weights for selecting models but, in contrast to the analysis with the CMR models, we could not provide meaningful model-averaged estimates of Ad or RI.

For 71 of the 86 species, the estimated slope ( \u03b2 ) from the linear-time model was not significantly different from 0, suggesting that there was no directional change in the population growth rate during the 15 years. For 8 of the 86 species, however, the temporal trend in the growth rate was significantly negative, while for 7 it was significantly positive (Table 1) . Among all 86 species, estimates of the population growth rate (\u03bb ) ranged from 0.867 to 1.196 (Table 1) , with a grand mean of 0.994 (CI = 0.983-1.004), indicating no overall pattern of decreasing or increasing populations across western landbirds. The frequency distributions of the species-specific population growth rates differed, however, based on migration category of the species (Figure 1) . The grand mean population growth rate showed no overall pattern of decreasing or increasing populations among either the 40 migratory species wintering in the neotropics (1.003, CI = 0.988-1.019) or the 20 permanent resident species (0.993, CI = 0.968-1.018; Figure 2 ). Among the 26 migratory species wintering in the temperate zone, however, the grand mean population growth rate was significantly <1.0 (0.980, CI = 0.965-0.995), suggesting a pattern of overall decline in this group of species. Nevertheless, the proportions of decreasing, stable, and increasing species in the three categories of migration did not differ significantly (\u03c7 2 = 4.81, df = 4, p = 0.31), suggesting that the lower mean population growth rate among migrants wintering in the temperate zone may have reflected differences in the magnitude of the decreasing population trends compared to those of species in the other two groups."}, {"section_title": "CoMPArison of MAPs \u0302 with BBs trends", "text": "For the 86 species, mean values of \u03bb based on MAPS data from 1992 to 2006 were positively correlated with the population trends according to the BBS (Sauer et al. 2014) (Figure 3 ; see Appendix 1 for four-letter species codes and scientific names).

Both sources indicated no overall pattern of decline or increase among western landbird populations. Moreover, the proportions of the 86 species with \u03bb <1.0 according to the two data sets were also very similar: 47 (55%) for MAPS, 48 (56%) for the BBS. Trends for individual species according to the BBS were much more precise (mean 95% credible interval for 86 species = 0.025) than were those based on MAPS (mean 95% confidence interval of weighted geometric means of fully model-averaged annual \u03bb for the same 86 species = 0.267, although that for the year-constant [\u00b7] model for the 86 species = 0.132).

This is also reflected in the range of the species-specific mean values of \u03bb (0.867 to 1.196 for MAPS versus 0.967 to 1.044 for the BBS).\nFinally, the patterns of the mean values of \u03bb derived from the two sources for the three migration classes were similar (Figure 2 ).

This proportion increased during the period 1992-2006 according to MAPS data ( Figure 4A) . Increasing species dominated the latter category during all three time periods but slightly less so in more recent periods ( Figure 4A ). Similar results were also reflected in the changes in the proportion of migratory species for which the population trend became more negative ( Figure 4B ).

These estimates of MAPS \u03bb were positively correlated with these species' trends according to the BBS for the same period, although for 16% of the species one source indicated a decrease while the other indicated an increase.\nBecause MAPS stations can be established only where constant-effort mist-netting is possible, permissible, and sustainable over many years, and so cannot be sited as randomly as BBS routes, it is not surprising that trends based on the two sources sometimes differed substantially. Moreover, MAPS stations are typically sited well away from roads, whereas BBS routes follow tertiary roads. Given these conflicting requirements for siting MAPS stations and BBS routes, the positive correlation between the two sources implies that both methods yield information on large-scale trends in landbird populations. This general concordance also suggests that MAPS data may provide fairly representative samples, at least at the spatial scale of western North America, a prerequisite for reverse-time CMR models to be able to provide accurate estimates of the annual rate of population change. These results have Estimates of \u03bb based on MAPS data tended to be substantially less precise than trends estimated from the BBS. This too is not surprising because samples for MAPS data (number of resident adults captured per station per year) tend to be smaller than analogous samples for BBS data (number of adult birds counted on a 25-mile, 50-stop route per year). The CMR models by which \u03bb is estimated from MAPS data are well known for being data hungry.\nThe slope of the linear regression line for the relationship between estimates of population change from the two sources was slightly greater than 1.0. This line intersected the line for BBS \u03bb = 1 slightly below the line for MAPS \u03bb = 1 (Figure 3) , suggesting that estimates of population change from MAPS tended to be slightly lower (more declining) than those based on the BBS, and that this difference was more pronounced for decreasing than for increasing species. In a post hoc analysis of 47 species with decreasing trends based on MAPS data (i.e., \u03bb < 1.0), the values of \u03bb were negatively correlated with their SEs (r = -0.50, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with the number of adult individuals banded (r = 0.32, p = 0.03), suggesting that species with strongly decreasing trends had high SEs because their data were deficient. For 39 species with \u03bb >1.0, the analogous correlations were only marginally significant or not significant, suggesting that species with strongly increasing trends according to MAPS data did not necessarily have high SEs and were not necessarily data deficient.\nBoth sources indicate that populations of landbirds in western North America from 1992 to 2006 tended to be decreasing: on the basis of MAPS data, 47 (55%) of the 86 species had \u03bb figure 4. Comparison of population trends for migratory landbirds in western North America by three periods, 1966-1991, 1979-1991 <1.0, and the mean for these 86 species was 0.994. Similarly, on the basis of the BBS, 48 (56%) of the 86 had \u03bb <1.0, with a mean of 0.998. Most of this mean decrease from both surveys was attributable to the 26 migratory species wintering in the temperate zone: on the basis of MAPS data, 17 (65%) of the 26 species had \u03bb <1.0, and the mean for the 26 species was 0.980, which was significantly <1.0. In contrast, the 40 migratory species wintering in the neotropics had a mean \u03bb of 1.003, and 20 (50%) species had \u03bb <1.0, while the 20 permanent resident species had a mean \u03bb of 0.993, and 10 (50%) species had \u03bb <1.0.\nThe pattern of species wintering in the temperate zone declining more than those wintering in the neotropics characterized both the previous 13-year and 26-year periods (DeSante and George 1994) as well as the more recent 15-year (1992-2006) period, indicating that the pattern of population changes among migratory bird species in western North America has remained consistent over some 4 decades . This suggests that the factors driving the population trends of migratory landbirds in western North America may also have remained much the same over that 40-year period. These factors likely included habitat destruction and degradation, particularly of riparian and grassland habitats, but possibly also of forest habitats, as well as the introduction of invasive species (DeSante and George 1994). The effects of these processes on landbird populations, however, appear not to have remained constant over these 40 years, at least for migratory species wintering in the temperate zone. Populations of these species tended to decline much less during the middle 13-year (1979-1991) period than during the previous 13-year (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) period (DeSante and George 1994), then tended to decline much more strongly during the final 15-year (1992-2006) period. This pattern suggests that temporal variation in \u03bb may be cyclic, but considerably more than 1\u00bd cycles are needed to confirm such a pattern. This pattern of temporal variation in the rate of decline of these species might also suggest a connection with weather or climate, a hypothesis that could be tested with data on large-scale, long-term climate cycles. Indeed, MAPS data have been used to confirm relationships between both productivity and survival and various climate cycles including the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation , LaManna et al. 2012 )."}, {"section_title": "identifiCAtion of PossiBle teMPorAl drivers of PoPulAtion ChAnge", "text": "The greatest value of MAPS data lies not in their ability to provide estimates of population trends but in their ability to provide estimates of other demographic parameters (vital rates) that may be driving those population trends.

Nevertheless, these results suggest that some degree of density dependence may have characterized the population dynamics of most of these species from 1992 to 2006.\nFor the Orange-crowned Warbler, Western Flycatcher, and Golden-crowned Kinglet, the negative correlation of the estimated population density with the estimate of apparent survival was stronger than with any other vital rate. For the Orange-crowned Warbler and Golden-crowned Kinglet this correlation was significantly negative, which suggests that in these species density dependence was effected primarily through adults' survival, likely during the nonbreeding season, probably on the wintering grounds.\nFor all four species, the estimate of productivity was also negatively correlated with estimated population density. But none of these correlations was significant, suggesting that density dependence may have been effected secondarily and weakly by productivity on the breeding grounds.

We suggest that a significant positive temporal correlation between \u03bb and annual estimates of any of these three basic vital rates implies that temporal variation in that vital rate may be an important driver of temporal variation in \u03bb. It also may suggest that the overall mean trend for any given period (i.e., whether the population is decreasing or increasing during that period) may also be driven by that vital rate. It is possible, however, that annual variation in \u03bb may be driven by annual variation in one vital rate (e.g., productivity), while a different vital rate (e.g., adults' survival) may be low and not balanced by recruitment every year, so that the latter is fundamentally the cause of \u03bb being <1.0. As a result, interpretations of temporal correlations between \u03bb and other vital rates, in conjunction with consideration of the estimated mean values of those vital rates, especially in comparison to related species that have similar ecologies, must be considered hypotheses in need of testing with more sophisticated demographic models. Nevertheless, these hypotheses can be important in driving further research.\nApparent survival of adults is the result of two processes. First is mortality, which likely is driven by factors acting during the nonbreeding season away from the breeding grounds, either on the wintering grounds or during migration. Second is emigration, which is likely driven by factors acting during the breeding season on the breeding grounds. Because of breeding landbirds' territorial behavior and generally strong site fidelity, and MAPS stations being sited at locations where the habitat was expected to remain free of human-caused disturbance for at least 10 years (DeSante et al. 2014), we suggest that temporal variation in apparent survival of adults was likely driven more by processes affecting mortality away from the breeding grounds than by emigration from the breeding grounds. We note, however, that short-to medium-term climatic variation on the breeding grounds (such as drought) could alter relevant conditions, affecting emigration or even mortality on the breeding grounds. Thus, again, we must consider suggestions, such as that above, as hypotheses in need of testing with more sophisticated demographic models.\nFurthermore, even though modeling has shown that first-year survival of young is positively correlated with post-breeding effects, post-breeding effects are the result of two processes. One of these is survival of young in their first year, which, like survival of adults, is likely driven by factors acting away from the breeding grounds. The other is immigration of adults, which over large spatial scales must be roughly equal to emigration of adults, and is likely driven by factors acting on the breeding grounds. Because survival of young is likely to be lower than survival of adults, we suggest that temporal variation in post-breeding effects is likely driven more by processes acting away from the breeding grounds than on the breeding grounds. Again, however, we must consider this suggestion to be a hypothesis in need of testing. It might be presumed that temporal variation in productivity is driven by processes acting exclusively on the breeding grounds. Considerable recent evidence, however, suggests that productivity is often driven by effects carried over from a previous stage in the annual cycle , Rockwell et al. 2012 , Drake et al. 2014 ). This possibility further justifies the testing of hypotheses derived from correlations among vital rates based on MAPS data with more sophisticated demographic models. With these considerations in mind, we examine the temporal correlations among vital rates for the four selected species and suggest demographic drivers of the observed temporal variation in their population change."}, {"section_title": "Case Studies", "text": "Orange-crowned Warbler. The significant, positive correlations between annual rates of population change (\u03bb ) and both the apparent survival of adults and productivity suggest that annual variation in \u03bb (and, likely, the resulting population decline) was driven by annual variation in both of these vital rates, especially by that in apparent survival of adults ( Figure 5 ). Because annual variation in apparent survival likely reflects primarily annual variation in true survival, the factors that drove annual variation in \u03bb through annual variation in adults' survival likely acted during the nonbreeding season. We suspect that these factors involve the interaction of weather in late winter and early spring on habitats used by the birds during winter and migration. Indeed, initial results for the Orange-crowned Warbler from the program Monitoreo de Sobrevivencia Invernal (MoSI; DeSante et al. 2005b) suggest that many birds wintering in western Mexico move to higher and wetter habitats in mid-to late winter as the dry season advances. Thus mortality of Orangecrowned Warblers may be high in late winter as a result of the dryness of the winter range at that season. Or it may be high during spring migration, either as a result of body condition worsening on the winter grounds or adverse conditions on the migration route itself.\nThe Orange-crowned Warbler's decline, linked to a decrease in adults' survival, may reflect a drying trend in western Mexico over the past few decades related to global climate change. Precipitation in the region is expected to decrease further (Neelin et al. 2006 , Karmalkar et al. 2011 . This decrease may affect many migratory landbirds wintering in that region. Indeed, LaManna et al. (2012) showed a strong correlation between ENSO and apparent survival of adult Swainson's Thrushes breeding on the Pacific slope of the United States and Canada, a correlation apparently driven by late-winter/early-spring precipitation on the species' spring migration route.\nOne might assume that annual variation in productivity, which was also a significant correlate of annual variation in the Orange-crowned Warbler's population change, resulted from factors operating on the breeding grounds. However, showed that productivity in migratory landbirds wintering in the neotropics and breeding in the Pacific Northwest was significantly correlated with ENSO as well as with the resulting late-winter/early-spring precipitation in western Mexico. This suggests a carry-over effect on productivity for these species similar to the carry-over effect on timing of breeding and productivity documented for a number of species breeding in eastern North America and wintering in the neotropics (e.g., Rockwell et al. 2012) . Drake et al. (2014) also showed that the survival, timing of breeding, and productivity of Yellow Warblers breeding in British Columbia was related to ENSO and apparently affected by wind conditions during spring migration. It thus seems likely that future population trends of many western landbirds wintering in the neotropics will depend heavily on interactions between winter and spring weather conditions and characteristics of nonbreeding habitat as modified by climate change.\nBecause for the Orange-crowned Warbler \u03bb was positively correlated with estimates of both apparent survival and productivity, the significant positive correlation between those variables was expected ( Figure 5 ). Although \u03bb showed virtually no correlation with post-breeding effects, productivity was negatively correlated with post-breeding effects, suggesting a strong negative correlation between the number of young produced and their survival in the subsequent year. Again, because productivity and adults' apparent survival were positively correlated, it was not unexpected that the latter variable and post-breeding effects were also (almost significantly) negatively correlated ( Figure 5 ). These three correlations suggest some degree of density dependence of survival away from the breeding grounds. Indeed, both adults' apparent survival and productivity were negatively correlated with their population density, significantly so for the former ( Figure 5 ). Clearly, temporal correlations among the Orange-crowned Warbler's vital rates can lead to testable hypotheses regarding the demographic and environmental drivers of the species' population decline and, perhaps, management to reverse the decline.\nWestern Flycatcher. Not for all declining species wintering in the neotropics are temporal correlations between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival likely to be strongly positive. For the Western Flycatcher, for example, we found only a weak nonsignificant negative correlation between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival but a strong and highly significant positive temporal correlation between \u03bb and post-breeding effects ( Figure 6 ). This suggests that annual variation in population change (and, likely, the resulting population decline) was driven by annual variation in first-year survival of young. The latter factor has been implicated in the declines of a number of European landbirds, including the Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos; Baillie et al. 2014) , and it may be a fairly frequent driver of population declines in North American landbirds as well. The temporal correlation between \u03bb and productivity of the Western Flycatcher was also positive but was weak and nonsignificant, suggesting that productivity played at best only a minor role in the species' population decline. Like that of the Orange-crowned Warbler, however, productivity of the Western Flycatcher tended to be positively correlated with adults' apparent survival; post-breeding effects were negatively correlated with both productivity and, especially, adults' apparent survival, for which the correlation was strong and highly significant.\nEnvironmental drivers of the population decline of the Western Flycatcher may have been similar to those for the Orange-crowned Warbler, but, because the flycatcher winters in wetter habitats (DFD unpubl. data), it may be less affected by dry years and conditions. If, however, adults tend to exclude conspecific young birds from the wetter, more favorable habitats, then population declines could be driven during dry winters by poor firstyear survival of young birds forced into drier suboptimal habitats, a result in agreement with the correlations among vital rates discussed above. This is another testable hypothesis generated from the relationships among demographic parameters.\nWarbling Vireo. Although MAPS data imply the Warbling Vireo's population increased from 1992 to 2006, the pattern of temporal correlations among this species' vital rates (Figure 7 ) was similar to that for the Western Flycatcher. This suggests that the temporal variation in population change (and, perhaps, the resulting population increase) was driven by annual variation in postbreeding effects (first-year survival of young), which was positively correlated with \u03bb . Annual variation in productivity may have contributed secondarily, as it showed a positive though nonsignificant correlation with \u03bb . In contrast to the Western Flycatcher, for which the negative correlation between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival was weak and not significant, for the Warbling Vireo this correlation was significantly negative.\nA significant negative correlation between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival may seem counterintuitive, because it suggests that when adults' apparent survival is high, \u03bb is low and the population tends to decrease, or at least to increase less rapidly. However, a simple model shows that if adults returning to their breeding or wintering territories use more or better habitat than do young birds or immigrating adults, a negative correlation between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival can result, as well as a negative correlation between adults' apparent survival and post-breeding effects. This is exactly what temporal correlations showed for the Warbling Vireo. However, if the quantity or quality of habitat in the breeding or winter range is increasing so that the survival of young birds and immigrating adults is increasing relative to the survival of adults returning to their territories, then a positive relationship between \u03bb and post-breeding effects can result, which can drive an increasing \u03bb despite the negative relationship between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival. This also is what temporal correlations showed for the Warbling Vireo. This is also a hypothesis that could be tested with multi-year age-specific survival data from both the breeding and wintering grounds. As with both the Orange-crowned Warbler and Western Flycatcher, post-breeding effects for the Warbling Vireo were negatively correlated with both adults' apparent survival and productivity, but, in contrast to those two species, significantly so with both.\nNotably, none of the relationships between adults' population density and any vital rate for the Warbling Vireo was significant. Only productivity showed even a weak negative correlation, and \u03bb showed virtually no correlation, which suggested very little or no density dependence for this species. This may not be unexpected for a species with an increasing population.\nGolden-crowned Kinglet. In this decreasing species that winters in the temperate zone, the temporal correlation between \u03bb and adults' apparent survival was positive and significant. Correlations between \u03bb and both productivity and postbreeding effects were also positive but weaker and not significant (Figure 8 ). This suggests that apparent survival of adults played a major role in driving population change, but that productivity and post-breeding effects may have played minor positive roles as well. Also, all four vital rates were negatively correlated with the population density of adults, with the correlations for \u03bb and adults' apparent survival being strongly and significantly negative. These relationships suggest a very high degree of density dependence that was effected primarily through adults' apparent survival. In the West, the Golden-crowned Kinglet is an irruptive migrant; in some autumns large numbers of birds move downslope and south, in others many fewer (Gaines 1988) . The patterns of relationships among vital rates based on MAPS data suggest that these irruptions are density dependent, are related to major declines in some important resource (probably food), can strongly and negatively influence survival of both adults and young, and, if they are frequent or severe enough, can drive population declines. Interestingly, in 4 of the 12 intervals for which we had usable estimates, apparent survival of adults was much lower (<0.1) than during the other 8 intervals (mean 0.233) (Figure 8 ). Is a frequency of 4 years of low survival out of 12 greater than expected in a stable population? Or is intermittent annual survival <0.1 less than expected in a stable population? Additional years of data may answer this question.\nThe positive (but not quite significant) temporal correlation between estimates of adults' apparent survival and productivity suggests that the declines in resources that trigger autumn irruptions may begin during the breeding season, so that when productivity during a summer is low, adult's apparent survival the following winter may also be low. The significant negative correlation between productivity and post-breeding effects may suggest a density-dependent relationship between the number of young fledged and their subsequent first-year survival characteristic of this species (which typically lays a large clutch). Moreover, this negative correlation may not be driven by the factors that drive the irruptions."}, {"section_title": "PossiBle ProBleMs And shortCoMings of this work", "text": "Several possible problems and shortcomings detract from our use of correlations among vital rates to infer the drivers of population change. First, while we used fully model-averaged parameter estimates for annual population change in our determination of mean \u03bb across the entire study period, we used estimates from the time-dependent model for \u03bb (and for the other five demographic parameters) when we evaluated pairwise correlations among them, despite the time-dependent model being selected for only 36% of the 86 species. Although a linear-time or time-constant model was often selected as better for estimating \u03bb, especially for species with smaller samples, we suggest that the time-dependent model provided the best year-specific estimates available, and we used those estimates in our correlations. Thus it is possible that the values for correlations with \u03bb could have been affected by lack of fit of the time-dependent model. In particular, the timedependent model was the model selected for the Warbling Vireo and Golden-crowned Kinglet, but not for the Western Flycatcher and Orangecrowned Warbler, for which the time-constant model was selected. The same situation could have existed for adults' apparent survival, for which the time-dependent model was selected only for the Western Flycatcher and Orange-crowned Warbler, while the linear-time model was selected for the Warbling Vireo and Golden-crowned Kinglet. This potential problem likely did not affect Ad \ufffd t or R\u00ce , because the time-dependent model was very strongly selected for both parameters for all four demonstration species. Models could not be selected for PB\u00ca because it was a derived parameter, not directly estimated.\nA second potential problem with our use of correlations among vital rates is that correlation structure could have been imposed to some extent by covariation in sampling and constraints of the models (Anderson and Burnham 1981) . As mentioned earlier, we did not consider correlations between annual population change and recruitment, because the manner in which recruitment was calculated (as the difference between population change and adults' apparent survival) assured that population change and recruitment would always tend to be highly positively correlated. The Pradel models that we used allowed the survival component of the model to be temporally constrained, and this may have further enforced a structural relationship between population change and recruitment. Although effects of these issues on inferences are largely unknown because our methods do not allow separation of sampling from process variances and covariances, we suggest that effects may have been minimal for species with reasonable sample size. Given these potential problems and shortcomings, we suggest that our inferences regarding possible causes of annual variation in \u03bb and the possible extent and role of density dependence must be considered hypotheses in need of testing, not definitive pronouncements on the strength and nature of relationships among demographic parameters."}, {"section_title": "the wAy forwArd", "text": "The four species discussed above demonstrate how temporal correlations among vital rates estimated from MAPS data can lead to hypotheses regarding the proximate demographic drivers of population change. These data and results can inform research designed to test those hypotheses. They also can be used to populate integrated demographic models that could include environmental variables, such as site-specific and remotely sensed habitat data and spatially explicit weather and climate data, and be designed to identify ultimate environmental drivers of population change. The results of such models can then be used to formulate species-specific conservation strategies and management directed at reversing population declines and maintaining stable or increasing populations of landbirds.\nThe same methods we have used to model temporal variation in population change and examine temporal correlations between population change and other vital rates can also be employed to model broad spatial variation in population change and other vital rates and to examine spatial correlations among those demographic parameters. On the basis of MAPS data, both temporal and spatial (at the scale of North American Bird Conservation Regions; nabci-us. org/resources/bird-conservation-regions-map/) modeling and examination of temporal and spatial correlations of MAPS estimates of population change and other critical vital rates have been completed at the continental scale for over 158 species. The results of these analyses are available at www.VitalRatesOfNorthAmericanLandbirds. org (DeSante et al. 2015) . These results reveal that, for some species, the vital rate(s) that appear No. 3 to be the primary drivers (correlates) of annual variation in \u03bb are not the vital rates that appear to be the primary drivers (correlates) of spatial variation in population change. This should not be surprising, as it is easy to imagine a situation where annual variation in \u03bb is driven by annual variation in one vital rate (e.g., productivity), while spatial variation in \u03bb is driven by a different vital rate. For example, adults' survival rates may differ in different portions of the winter range, as a result of localized interactions of weather and habitat.\nWhile the MAPS program can provide some of the data on vital rates needed for integrated demographic models, additional information is needed before this effort can truly be successful. Two types of data are most crucial. The first is demographic data regarding survival rates of both young and adult birds on the winter grounds and during migration, and the relationship of these rates to habitat and weather. The MoSI program, established in 2002 (DeSante et al. 2005b ), aims to provide data on habitat-specific survival rates, both within a winter and between successive winters. The program addresses landbirds wintering in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America (Ruiz-Gutierrez et al. 2016) . It or similar programs need to be expanded. Although the neotropics often dominate discussion of the winter survival of North American landbirds, our results imply that western migrants wintering north of the U.S./Mexico border are suffering population declines greater than those wintering in the neotropics. Analogous work on western landbirds wintering in the temperate zone would be very useful.\nThe second pressing need for the successful conservation and management of migratory landbirds is more extensive and more precise information on migratory connectivity. Over the past 15 years understanding of this topic has improved thanks to such techniques as stablecarbon isotopes (Marra et al. 1998) , light-level geolocators (Skutchbury et al. 2009 , Cormier et al. 2013 , high-resolution genetic markers (Ruegg et al. 2014) , and GPS data loggers (Hallworth and Marra 2015) .\nThe relationships among demographic parameters derived from MAPS data suggest that inadequate survival of young and adult birds likely plays an important role in driving the declines of migratory landbirds. Understanding the role of weather-dependent survival in driving population changes, as well as the interactions of weather with habitat, will be key to successful conservation of migratory birds, especially in the face of continuing climate change (Robinson et al. 2007 ). The challenges for accomplishing this are daunting but will be surmounted only by extensive demographic data from both the breeding and nonbreeding ranges, coupled with detailed connectivity data. All these data must be analyzed with integrated and spatially explicit demographic models, yet to be developed."}]
