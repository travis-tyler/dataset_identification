[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. By the time an individual has been diagnosed with AD, it may be too late for potential disease modifying therapy to strongly influence outcome. Therefore, it is critical to develop better diagnostic tools that can recognize AD at early symptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic stages. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), introduced to describe a prodromal stage of AD, is presently classified into early and late stages (E-MCI, L-MCI) based on severity. Using a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method to integrate multimodal brain imaging data and select valid imaging-based predictors for optimizing prediction accuracy, we developed a model to differentiate E-MCI from healthy controls (HC) for early detection of AD. Multimodal brain imaging scans (MRI and PET) of 174 E-MCI and 98 HC participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were used in this analysis. Mean targeted region-of-interest (ROI) values extracted from structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer V5) and PET (FDG and Florbetapir) scans were used as features. Our results show that the graph-based SSL classifiers outperformed support vector machines for this task and the best performance was obtained with 66.8% cross-validated AUC (area under the ROC curve) when FDG and FreeSurfer datasets were \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011 \u00a7 Address correspondences to knho@iupui.edu or asaykin@iupui.edu. ** Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

AD is predicted to affect 14 million Americans by the year 2050 (www.alz.org) and has become a national priority. The detection and diagnosis of AD at the earliest possible stage is of fundamental importance as early intervention could potentially delay progression to AD and achieve effective disease modification. One of main challenges is to identify and validate biomarkers of AD progression leading to an improved early diagnosis at early symptomatic and especially presymptomatic stages. To this end, the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was introduced [2] . MCI can be classified into early and late stages (E-MCI, L-MCI) based on severity. MCI is thought to be a precursor to the development of early AD, and subjects with late amnestic MCI have a highly elevated probability of developing AD with a conversion rate of approximately 15% per year [3, 4] .\nNew approaches to the search for specific biomarkers to detect MCI/AD compared to healthy controls (HC) have been developed, with neuroimaging (MRI and PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers showing particular promise [5, 6] . However, in most studies, only patients with L-MCI and AD have been assessed [7] . In order to identify better diagnostic tools that can recognize AD at early symptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic stages, we developed a graph-based semi-supervised learning model to differentiate E-MCI from HC for early detection of AD using multimodal brain imaging scans (MRI and PET) of participants from the ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\nThe semi-supervised learning (SSL) which recently emerged in the machine learning domain, employs a strategy halfway between supervised and unsupervised learning schemes to improve classification performance [8] [9] [10] [11] . In particular, the graph-based SSL takes advantage of computational efficiency and representational ease for the biomedical data. Because of the graph structures, it is easy to integrate different types of data for better explaining clinical outcomes [12] . The learning time of graph-based SSL is nearly linear with the number of graph edges while the accuracy remains comparable to the kernel-based methods that suffer from the relative disadvantage of a longer learning time [13, 14] . In addition, the interpretation of biological phenomena can be improved because of the graph structure [15] [16] [17] , which naturally fits into the graph-based SSL."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Samples-The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative initial phase (ADNI-1) was launched in 2003 to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), position emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuro-psychological assessment could be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. This multisite longitudinal study was intended to aid researchers and clinicians develop new treatments for MCI and early AD, monitor their effectiveness, and lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The ADNI-1 has been extended to its subsequent phases (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2) for follow-up for existing participants and additional new enrollments. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical and neuroimaging protocols, and other information about ADNI have been published previously and can be found at www.adni-info.org [18] [19] [20] . Demographic information, raw scan data, APOE and GWAS genotypes, neuropsychological test scores, and diagnostic information are available from the ADNI data repository (http:// www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). Individuals included in this study were 174 E-MCI (early MCI) and 98 HC (healthy older adults) participants in ADNI-GO or ADNI-2.\nImage processing-All available baseline 3T structural brain MRI scans were downloaded from the ADNI database. As detailed in previous studies [18, 19] , two widely employed automated MRI analysis techniques were independently used to process MRI scans: whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software to extract mean grey matter (GM) density for target regions of interest (ROIs) and FreeSurfer version 5.1 to extract mean cortical thickness and volumetric measure for target ROIs. Pre-processed Florbetapir (also known as AV-45 and Amyloid) PET scans to assess brain amyloid \u03b2 burden were downloaded from the ADNI database. For each scan, mean regional SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) values were extracted for target ROIs using MarsBaR in SPM8, as detailed in previous study [7, 18] . FDG-PET was used to measure the brain's rate of glucose metabolism with the tracer [ 18 F] Fluorodeoxyglucose. FDG-PET ROI data was downloaded from the ADNI database. All MRI ROI values were adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education, and intracranial volume (ICV) using a regression model, prior to analyses. All the ROI values of Florbetapir and FDG PET were adjusted for the baseline age, gender, and education."}, {"section_title": "Classification of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (E-MCI)", "text": "The semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data to improve on the performance of supervised learning. There are several types of SSL algorithms, and the graph-based SSL was used in our study. If two patients' samples were more closely related to others, the algorithm assumed that the diagnosis of E-MCI from those two patients is more likely to be similar. Thus, the classification of E-MCI can be enhanced by considering similarities between patient samples. A natural method of analyzing relationships between entities is a graph, where nodes represent participants and edges show their possible relations. Figure 1 represents an example graph, which was conducted using the brain imaging data. An annotated participant is labeled either by '-1' or '1', indicating the two possible clinical outcomes, either 'healthy older adult' or 'E-MCI'. In order to predict the label of the unannotated patient '?', the edges connected from/to the patient play an important role in influencing propagation of the relation between the patient and its neighbors. This idea can be easily formulated using a graph-based semi-supervised learning [8] . Edges represent relations, more specifically similarities between participants that may be extracted from different brain imaging data. Different brain imaging data produce different graphs. Thus, the classification of E-MCI can be benefit by integrating diverse graphs from multimodal brain imaging data, i.e., incomplete information and noise. Technically, the data-setup of our experiment for the binary classification can be rephrased as where x n \u2208 R d (d is the number of features and N is the number of participants) and y n \u2208 {\u22121, 1}.\nGraph-based semi-supervised learning-In the graph-based SSL [8] , a participant x i (i = 1,...,n) is represented as a node i in a graph, and the relationship between participants is represented by an edge. The edge strength from each node j to other node i is encoded in element w ij of a n \u00d7 n symmetric weight matrix W. A Gaussian function of Euclidean distance between participants, with length scale hyperparameter \u03c3, is used to specify connection strength: (1) Nodes i and j are connected by an edge if i is in j's k-nearest-neighborhood or vice versa. Thus, nearby participants in Euclidean spaces are assigned large edge weights.\nThe labeled nodes have labels y l \u2208 {-1, 1}, while the unlabeled nodes have zeros y u = 0. The graph-based SSL will output an n-dimensional real-valued vector , which can be thresholded to make label predictions on f l =f 1 ,...,f n after learning. It is assumed that f i should be close to the given label y i in labeled nodes (loss condition), and overall, f i should not be too different from the f i of adjacent nodes (smoothness condition). One can obtain f by minimizing the following quadratic functional [8, 9, 11] : (2) where y=(y 1 ,...,y l , 0,...0) T , and the matrix L, called the graph Laplacian matrix [21] , is defined as\nThe parameter \u03bc trades off loss versus smoothness. The solution of this problem is obtained as (3) where I is the identity matrix."}, {"section_title": "Integration of Multi-Modal Brain Imaging Dataset", "text": "In order to combine the graphs from multimodal brain imaging data, four graphs can be integrated from finding optimum combination coefficients. Information from each graph is regarded as partially independent from and partly complementary to others. Reliability may be enhanced by integrating all available data sources using the graph-based SSL, which has been applied to the extended problem of protein function prediction [22] and clinical outcome prediction using multi-levels of genomic data [12] . Based on the method, the integration of multiple graphs is used to find an optimum value of the linear combination coefficient for the individual graphs (Fig. 2) . This corresponds to finding the combination coefficients \u03b1 for the individual Laplacians of the following mathematical formulation: (4) , where K is the number of graphs and L k is the corresponding graph-Laplacian of graph G k . Similar to the output prediction for single graphs, the solution is obtained by (5) 3 Results"}, {"section_title": "Experiment Setting", "text": "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots sensitivity (true positive rate) as a function of 1-specificity (false positive rate) for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied [23] . An ROC score of 0.5 corresponds to random prediction, and an ROC score of 1.0 implies that the model succeeded in putting all of the positive examples before all of the negatives. For each dataset, we calculated area under the curve (AUC) of ROC as a performance measure. In order to avoid the overfitting, five-fold cross-validation was conducted. Since some of the brain imaging dataset is high dimensional and noisy, and contains many redundant features, which may incur computational difficulty and low accuracy, a Student t-test based feature selection method was used [24] . Even though there are many feature selection techniques such as filter, wrapper, and embedded method [25] , a simple univariate feature selection method was used in order to emphasize not the effect of feature selection but the effect of integration of multimodal brain imaging data. The values of SSL model parameters, k from Equation (1) and \u03bc from Equation (3), were determined by the results of search over k \u2208 {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30} and \u03bc \u2208 {0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 10, 100, 1000}.

Among four types of brain imaging dataset, the performance of FreeSurfer dataset showed the best single modality performance with 0.6576 AUC. In Figure 3 , AUC increases in the order of the following dataset, FreeSurfer > VBM > FDG > Florbetapir."}, {"section_title": "Integration Effects", "text": "Since different brain imaging data contain partly independent and partly complementary information content, we integrated across multi-modal brain image datasets for better prediction of E-MCI. We found that multivariate integration across different brain imaging modalities increased the prediction performance for patients with EMCI. Figure 4 shows the results of the integration with all combination of different types of brain imaging dataset. The model combining Florbetapir and VBM (0.6322 AUC) outperformed the model with VBM only (0.609 AUC). In addition, the integration with FDG and FreeSurfer showed the best performance among all combination of four different types of brain imaging dataset with 0.6681 AUC. However, the integration with all four types of brain image data included did not show the best performance."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with SVM", "text": "The performance from graph-based SSL classifiers was compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) performance. SVM involves finding an optimal decision boundary, i.e., maximizing the margin by finding the largest achievable distance among the separating hyperplane and the data points on either side. If the data points are separated by a non-linear hyperplane because of some intrinsic property of the problem, it is more appropriate to map the input feature space to a high-dimensional feature space where the data points are separated by a linear hyperplane. This mapping process is conducted by kernel functions. Among kernel functions, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used with a wide range of sigma, from 10 \u22126 to 1, in order to select the best model. In order to fairly compare the performance, we used the same set of features, which was used in the graph-based SSL. The models from the graph-based SSL outperformed the models from SVM except for Florbetapir data ( Table 1 ). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the significance level of difference in performance between the results of the graph-based SSL and SVM [26] . The model with FreeSurfer dataset from the graph-based SSL showed significantly better than the one from SVM."}, {"section_title": "Discussions and Conclusions", "text": "Using automatic whole-brain ROI analysis techniques and a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method, we developed a classification model to differentiate E-MCI from HC for early detection of AD. In this study, we used MRI (FreeSurfer and VBM) and PET (Florbetapir and FDG) scans from 174 E-MCI and 98 HC in the ADNI cohort. The graphbased SSL technique was used to integrate multi-modal brain imaging data and select imaging-based phenotypes for optimizing E-MCI prediction accuracy. The data integration framework for multimodal brain imaging data has scalability to easily extend to additional types of brain imaging data. In addition, it preserves type-specific properties from the brain imaging data since the matrices from different types of brain imaging data were not simply merged but combined after conversion into a graph for the integration (Fig. 2) .\nOur results showed that 1) the graph-based SSL classifiers outperformed support vector machines (SVM) for this task; 2), we obtained the best results when using ROI values extracted by FreeSurfer from structural MRI scans; (3) the overall best performance was obtained with 66.8% cross-validated AUC when FDG PET and FreeSurfer data were combined; (4) the integration with all four types of brain image data included did not show the best performance; and (5) selected imaging-based phenotypes included ROI values extracted from temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala. It has been showed that regional brain atrophy occurs initially and most severely in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus before spreading throughout the neocortex [27] . These findings suggest that the predictive model may be combined with various data sources from different types of brain imaging data. Integration of independent or complementary information content may improve the chances of successful early diagnosis of AD. The graph-based SSL approach with multimodal brain imaging data has substantial potential for enhanced early detection of AD. Graph representation of brain imaging data between participants.

In this example, the negative labels indicate samples from 'healthy older adults'. On the contrary, the positive labels indicate the samples from 'E-MCI'.
