[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Evaluation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treatment-resistant major depression (TRMD) in Veterans offers unique clinical trial challenges. Here we describe a randomized, double-blinded, intent-to-treat, two-arm, superiority parallel design, a multicenter study funded by the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP No. 556) of the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods: We recruited medical providers with clinical expertise in treating TRMD at nine Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers as the trial local investigators. We plan to enroll 360 Veterans diagnosed with TRMD at the nine VA medical centers over a 3-year period. We will randomize participants into a double-blinded clinical trial to left prefrontal rTMS treatment or to sham (control) rTMS treatment (180 participants each group) for up to 30 treatment sessions. All participants will meet Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4 th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression and will have failed at least two prior pharmacological interventions. In contrast with other rTMS clinical trials, we will not exclude Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or history of substance abuse and we will obtain detailed history regarding these disorders. Furthermore, we will maintain participants on stable anti-depressant medication throughout the trial. We will evaluate all participants on a wide variety of potential predictors of treatment response including cognitive, psychological and functional parameters."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent in about 10% of American medical outpatients in any given year [1] . As many as 20% of these patients respond incompletely, or do not respond at all, to successive trials of multiple classes of antidepressant and mood stabilization medications and psychotherapy [2, 3] . Thus, within the Veterans Affairs (VA) population, there are roughly 100,000 patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRMD). In such cases, the general treatment strategy is usually to advance treatment delivery in a way that increases response rates, albeit at the expense of increased risks and increased side effects. One example would be the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Another preferred treatment modality for TRMD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) [1, 4] . However, despite being the most effective antidepressant in the acute setting, ECT usage is limited by posttreatment amnesia and confusion, the medical risks of general anesthesia, the high costs associated with inpatient hospitalization, general apprehension about the procedure among candidate patients, and some administrative impediments. Such approaches may be reasonable for those depressed patients who are suicidal or who have the most severe symptoms. However, for the majority of patients with TRMD whose symptoms are moderate, the decision to escalate treatments is more difficult. Thus, new TRMD treatments are needed, preferably without major safety concerns or side effects as seen with aggressive polypharmacy or ECT.\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of major depression rTMS is a method of delivering brain stimulation with neither the seizures or risks associated with ECT, nor the potential side effects and risks of pharmacological augmentation strategies, such as MAOI therapy. It may offer a viable alternative to ECT for some patients. Several studies, including a systematic review and metaanalysis of the studies to date, appear to show a positive effect in TRMD [5] with an effect size of Cohen's d of about 0.65 (moderate effect). This is comparable with that of contemporary antidepressant medications. The most recent large-scale clinical trial using advanced coil designs documented an effect size of 0.76 [6] . With a minimal side-effect profile, and the rarity of untoward events and side effects [5] , safety concerns about the use of rTMS are considerably fewer than for ECT. Importantly, rTMS may be less expensive to administer than ECT (largely due to not requiring anesthesia) [7] . Thus, there is the potential for a significant advance in VA mental health care, with associated cost savings, if rTMS were to be shown effective in treating TRMD in VA patients."}, {"section_title": "Importance of efficacious anti-depressant treatment in Veteran populations", "text": "Despite these positive studies of rTMS in civilian populations, research suggests that Veterans may experience a differential response to mental health treatments compared to the response seen in civilians. This finding has been well-documented in studies of treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which Veterans did not show evidence of the treatment gains seen in civilians in both pharmacological and psychotherapy trials [8, 9] . The reasons for this treatment disparity are most likely multi-factorial in nature. Clinical trials of new antidepressant treatments are initially tested in highly selected patients, free from comorbid conditions, and not taking other antidepressant medications. Yet, compared to civilian populations, Veterans experience a greater preponderance of medical and psychiatric comorbidities that complicate their clinical presentation and negatively impact their response to therapeutic intervention [10] . For example, in the national Veteran population that carries a diagnosis of a depressive disorder (N = 946,342 in the 2005 outpatient file), over 80% have at least one additional psychiatric diagnosis with the most common dual-diagnoses being PTSD (39%) and substance use disorder (45%). Most of these patients are already taking one or more psychotropic drugs. Furthermore, the VA has a special concern about treating potentially suicidal Veterans. Thus at this time, it is not clear if the results from the positive rTMS studies in civilian populations will translate into similar effects in the VA practice setting with all its comorbidities, multiple medications and risk for impulsive behavior. Given the fixed resources available for mental health treatment in the VA, rational allocation of resources is best guided by clinical trials in the exact population in which the treatments will be utilized, which led to several challenges in study design."}, {"section_title": "Methods/design", "text": "A specialized rTMS clinical trial in Veterans must satisfy several conditions. These include selection of a representative population of Veterans with TRMD with appropriate consideration of VA-centric mental health comorbidities (e.g., PTSD, substance use disorders, and suicidality), careful development of a control (sham) rTMS procedure, and attention to moderators and mediators of treatment response. Thus, we designed the trial to enroll 360 Veterans diagnosed with TRMD at nine VA participating medical centers over a 3-year period. All nine participating medical centers have been reviewed and approved by the VA Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) with the reference number of 10-08. We randomize all participants in a double-blinded clinical trial to left prefrontal rTMS treatment or to sham (control) rTMS treatment (180 participants each group) for up to 30 treatment sessions. We evaluate all participants on a wide variety of measures including cognitive, psychological, and functional parameters. The primary dependent measure will be remission rate (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24) \u2264 10), and secondary analyses will be conducted on other indices including economic measures.\nWe follow the NIH protocol procedures for administration and certification of the HRSD ratings. This will include the use of a prepared script to help administer the HRSD. Certification of all raters at a participating site will be verified prior to enrollment. This will be done by shipping recordings of mock interviews (nonpatient) to the sites where trained raters have determined a \"gold standard HRSD score\". Site raters will then submit their scores. Following NIH procedures, large deviations will be noted, and a rater can have an additional test. This can be repeated for a total of three times until the site is told they must find another rater.\nFollowing NIH procedures, to ensure that HRSD do not \"drift\" over time, one HRSD recording will be circulated to evaluators at all participating sites every 6 months. The evaluators will be asked to rate this recording and to return their ratings. Evaluators who drift by more than 3 points on the HRSD total score will receive a telephone consultation followed by one additional HRSD recording.\nWe will compare the rTMS and the sham groups at the end of the acute treatment phase to test the primary hypothesis. The study will last 3.5 years, with a 3-year enrollment period. Participants engage in study procedures for a total of approximately 30-39 weeks (2-4 weeks of screening, 4-11 weeks of the acute treatment phase and the 24-week follow-up phase).

We will not exclude Veterans with PTSD or history of substance use and we will obtain detailed history on these disorders. Participants will remain stable on their antidepressant medication regimen throughout rTMS treatment.\nWe designed the inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify patients with TRMD who exhibit a full range of the manifestations of that condition. Furthermore, we intend our recruited population to represent the VA pool of patients with TRMD. Table 1 shows the detailed inclusion/ exclusion criteria.\nPotential participants will be recruited through a number of methods. These include, but are not limited to, referral by primary providers, referral by mental health providers, flyers posted in common areas such as canteens at VA hospitals, review of the VA administrative databases containing information for both outpatient and inpatient encounters, which are housed in the Austin Information Technology Center, sending IRB- approved messages to providers twice a year, and posting basic information about the study in local VA SharePoint sites.

Patients who sign the Informed Consent Form and meet the study eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be randomized to either rTMS or sham rTMS. We use an adaptive randomization scheme to approximately equate numbers of patients randomized to each treatment group within several important subsets. These subsets include enrollment site and whether patients have a substance use disorder and/or PTSD. We will make treatment assignments using a \"biased coin\" procedure that should improve overall balance across subsets. We calculate imbalance by summing the marginal totals for these three factors for each treatment group and calculating the difference, D. If the imbalance is < 3, we will assign to rTMS or sham rTMS with equal probability; otherwise, we will assign to the group that increases imbalance with probability, 1/D. We incorporate this approach into our electronic data capture system.\nTo randomize a patient into the study, the SI or the Study Coordinator (SC) will submit the electronic randomization form. This computerized system, after verifying eligibility, will randomize a patient to either the rTMS or to the sham rTMS treatment group. A nonsequential treatment number will be assigned.

Threshold will be determined using an adaptive procedure (ClinicalResearcher software, Knoxville, TN, USA). Treatment will be delivered at a pulse frequency of 10 Hz, length of each pulse train of 4 seconds, time between pulse trains of 10 seconds, and length of treatment of 25 minutes for each treatment session. Units of five treatment sessions will be delivered over a minimum of 5 calendar days and a maximum of 12 calendar days. Patients will receive a minimum of 20 sessions of treatment and, for those not clinically remitting, up to a maximum of 30 sessions. In addition, participants meeting criteria for remission after 20-30 sessions will receive six additional taper treatments delivered over a 3-week period. Thus, patients will receive up to a total of 144,000 stimulation (sham or active) pulses in the study."}, {"section_title": "Treatment control", "text": "The credibility of the study depends on the development of a highly believable sham treatment. Sham treatment will be accomplished by using the inactive side of the Cool-B65-A/P coil that functions both as an active (A) and placebo (P) coil. The coil is completely symmetrical and does not distinguish the A and P sides. Treatment condition (A vs P) is determined electronically in the software of the device, based on a predetermined random treatment assignment table hard-coded in each device's memory and which is not accessible to study staff. The coil has a built-in position sensor and a symmetrical mechanical design with no markings that would differentiate the active or placebo sides. At the start of each session, a participant's randomization number is entered into the device, triggering the device to instruct the TMS administrator on how to orient the coil based on a built-in position sensor and the treatment assignment (active/placebo) associated with the randomization number. Consequently, it is not possible for the operator to see or hear which side is used. Additionally, for each treatment session, whether sham or active, each patient will wear scalp electrodes through which a low-voltage, low electric current (2-6 mA at no more than 100 V) will be passed in order to provide cutaneous stimulation that mimics the sensation of actual rTMS. At the same time, we use a stimulation-synchronized white noise generator to mask the \"click\" noise from each stimulation. Both the patient and the treatment administrator receive the masking noise. We make every attempt to well-mask the patient, the treatment administrator, and all personnel at each treatment site to the treatment group assignment."}, {"section_title": "Stimulation site: the 6 cm rule", "text": "We define the standardized treatment location over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by moving the TMS coil 6 cm anterior to the MT location along the left superior oblique plane with a rotation point about the tip of the patient's nose [20] [21] [22] . Our decision to move 6 cm rather than 5 cm reflects an evolution over several clinical trials. The optimal stimulation site, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is believed to be in Brodmann's areas 9 and 46 and the vast majority of TMS studies move 5 cm rather than 6 cm anterior from the MT site. Traditionally this approach is called the \"5 cm rule\". Unfortunately, a previous MRI study found that in a substantial number of patients the location was in the premotor rather than dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, these patients in whom the localization was inaccurate had an inferior treatment response [23] . The OP-TMS trial adopted a hybrid approach to targeting using this 5 cm rule [24] but also performing MRI and moving 1 cm anterior, to adjust for patients in whom there was inappropriate localization to the premotor cortex [25] . This hybrid approach led to fewer patients with inaccurately selected targets and an associated inferior treatment response. This current study adopts a 6 cm rule but also performs a separate study using MRI in patients from six of the nine sites for verification of accuracy and effect on treatment response (VA Funding CS R&D CX000604). Stimulation locations will also be related to potential functional MRI targets to assess this rule as an alternative to image guidance in patients in whom MRI is not feasible. Consistency in targeting across TMS sessions and in evaluating the accuracy in the MRI will be accomplished by marking the stimulation on a cloth cap (Magventure). A separately funded MRI protocol (see above) will collect additional data on the 6 cm rule as implemented here. That study will use T1-weighted, structural MRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to compute the accuracy of the location using the TMS stimulation location marked with a fiducial marker as in Herbsman et al. [23] . This T1 structural image will also allow measurement of the distance of TMS coil from the cortex (skull-to-cortex distance). This variable has been demonstrated to be an important potential moderator of treatment response because there is a substantial decrease in the strength of the magnetic field with increased distance of the coil from the brain in older patients with brain atrophy [26] . There has also been success with targeting based on image guidance [27] , so that both active and resting state fMRI protocols from the functional Brain Imaging Research Network are being collected [28] and relative proximity of the 6 cm rule to these alternative targets will be computed.\nThe patient's participation in the study may be terminated at any time if the SI deems that the patient has not been following the protocol. This will generally be done only when the protocol violation significantly increases the risk associated with continuing to participate in the study. Any female participant who becomes pregnant during the acute treatment phase of the study will discontinue the study treatments for safety reasons, as the effects of rTMS on the unborn fetus is not known at this time, and she will immediately enter the follow-up phase. Any female participant who becomes pregnant during the follow-up phase of the study will continue to be followed up in accordance with the protocol and will complete all assessments."}, {"section_title": "Assessment and analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "text": "The primary outcome for this trial will be remission as defined by a score of 10 or less on the HRSD24.

The selection of these measures was based upon their use in previous studies of rTMS in TRMD. The detailed outcome collection scheme and data elements are shown in Tables 2 and 3 .\nThere is growing evidence to suggest there are neurocognitive benefits of rTMS in TRMD. Specifically, improvements in verbal memory were demonstrated, seemingly independent of the antidepressant effects of rTMS. Additional improvements in verbal learning and psychomotor speed are also evidenced, though these are more likely the result of reduction of depressive symptoms [29, 30] .

Such information is important for \"personalized treatment\" of patients and for the proper allocation of resources. Better understanding of the mediators help explain how a treatment works. Understanding the mechanisms of action may be important for enhancing our ability to interpret clinical findings. If for example, we find little clinical impact of an \"active\" treatment and this were our only analysis, we would not be able to determine if the outcome were the result of \"insensitive\" outcome measures, a \"weak\" treatment, or a faulty design. However, if the treatment does in fact have significant effects on measures relevant to the proposed mechanism of action (e.g., changes in a relevant biological marker or psychological test), but is not accompanied by a change in clinical outcome, a strong argument can be made that the treatment \"worked\" on the proposed mechanism, but that it was not the appropriate mechanism to target. While there is growing support for the use of rTMS in the treatment of TRMD, there are patient characteristics (e.g., patient age, gender, type of depression, and severity of psychiatric symptoms) that potentially moderate the treatment response. Several studies have shown that older patients have poorer outcomes after rTMS treatment compared to younger patients and younger patients also required fewer rTMS treatments to achieve remission [34] . It has also been suggested that gender may impact treatment response, as some studies have shown the antidepressant effect of rTMS to be greater in female than male subjects [35] . To date, most studies of rTMS have been conducted in those with unipolar depression, though there is some suggestion that participants with more complex presentations or severe psychiatric symptoms may evidence a different treatment response. Specifically, patients with psychotic depression and those with more severe symptoms of depression may experience significantly less improvement with rTMS treatment [36, 37] . These are important points for the current study as the typical Veteran with TRMD is a man in his mid-50s with a complex presentation of depression."}, {"section_title": "Sample size and analysis plan", "text": "Based on the literature review, the study planning committee felt that a 10% difference between treatments would be of clinical relevance given the severity of the illness. With a sample size of 180 per group, the proposed study will have a power of 81% to detect an absolute difference between groups of 10% in the percentage of those participants who remit (6% sham and 16% rTMS). Thus, a total of 360 patients will be required from nine potential VA sites. Each site will be expected to randomize approximately 40 eligible patients over the recruitment period of the study.\nAll statistical tests will be two-sided, and tested at a 5% level of significance. All the statistical analyses will be conducted with SAS statistical analysis software, version 9.4 or later version (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The primary hypothesis of the study is that there is a difference in the remission rate between the two interventions at the end of the acute treatment phase in VA patients with TRMD. The primary outcome measure in this study is success or failure to achieve remission from depression as defined by a score on the HRSD24 of 10 or less. The primary analysis will be done as an \"intent-to-treat\" analysis, i.e., patients will be analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized and dropouts will be considered treatment failures. The primary hypothesis will be addressed using a logistic regression model with PTSD diagnosis, history of substance use, and site as covariates. Site effects will be tested using logistic regression analysis examining the effect of treatment in a model that includes site and the interaction of site and treatment. Baseline comparability among the treatment groups will be evaluated with respect to such variables as demographics (e.g., age, gender, and race), baseline values of the outcome measures (e.g., the HRSD, quality of life (QOL) measure(s), suicidality, etc.), and the antidepressant currently being used, etc. The chi-square test and analysis of variance techniques will be used as appropriate to determine any differences in distribution of the variables across the treatment groups. Any variable that appears to be different between the groups (p < 0.10) will be evaluated to determine whether such imbalances had any effect on the conclusions.\nIn addition to the main analysis, using the entire randomized or intent-to-treat cohort, logistic regression models will be used for \"completers\" and also for \"fully compliant\" subjects to provide further information about treatment effects. For example, it would be expected that if rTMS had a significant clinical effect, its effect would appear greater in completer and totally compliant cohorts, than in the entire randomized cohort. Other analyses will be performed on secondary measures to further provide useful clinical information. Some secondary outcome measures, such as sustained response rate (\"recovery\") and response on secondary outcome measures, can also be analyzed using logistic regression models. Other potential secondary analyses include change in suicidality, change in cognitive function, and change in QOL. The effect of rTMS on such measures will be determined using random regression and similar techniques that maximize the use of available data in repeated measures designs. At the end of the study, cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed.\nThe primary endpoint analysis will be based on the primary outcome measurement at the end of the treatment. Secondary outcome analyses are focused on the three time points, i.e., baseline, end of the treatment, and end of the follow up. However, the measurements from all time points will be used to illustrate the trend of outcome measurement changes across time.\nSubjects who drop out during the treatment phase will be considered as treatment failures for the purpose of the primary analysis and the missing values will not be imputed.

Typically, patients with TRMD at the VA present with more psychiatric comorbidities such as PTSD, history of substance use, and suicidality. Traditionally, these complex cases have been excluded from both large industry and NIH studies; thus, the relevance of these prior findings to the VA patient with TRMD is limited. As the typical Veteran patient with TRMD is not likely to be seen in the ongoing rTMS trials, it is not known how typical VA patients will fare with rTMS. The proposed trial will be able to answer this question as it will include patients with some suicidal ideation; it will include typical VA patients with dual-diagnosis TRMD who may also present with PTSD and/or a history of substance use disorder, and will address issues of accessibility of care that often prevent effective treatment of TRMD and suicidal ideation in VA patients.\nIn addition to meeting a great need within the VA healthcare system, this trial also has numerous innovative techniques that are valuable for inclusion into other clinical trials. This is the first multisite study of rTMS to treat depression using the 6 cm rule for targeting, but the technique has been used in at least one other study of pain rTMS. The sham and active coils are integrated as one and deployed with a switch guided by the treatment number. Rather than exclude patients based on comorbid conditions, this study includes a vast amount of demographic data, which can serve to guide future studies in diverse patient groups. The goal will ultimately be to promote personalized treatment through the tailoring of brain stimulation based on the needs of the patient."}, {"section_title": "Future work on mechanisms of action, genetics, and rTMS in Veterans", "text": "While the current study is addressing several important potential moderators of treatment response and proposed mechanisms of action, we acknowledge there are additional potential mechanisms of action. Response to treatment may depend on several genetic and biochemical moderators, including brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) [38] , Apolipoprotein E (APOE) [39] , serotonin transporter genes [40] , and polymorphisms in Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) [40] . While these targets are beyond the scope of the current trial, they are worthy of future investigation as an understanding of these moderators could help determine both the best course of treatment for an individual and the mechanisms of rTMS in cell signaling.\nWe also acknowledge that there will be groups of Veterans who do not qualify for this trial, but could potentially obtain great benefit from rTMS. These groups include those Veterans with more mild levels of depression and those Veterans with significant cognitive impairment due to various forms of dementing illnesses and the residual effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, it will be important for future trials to include these groups in their design."}, {"section_title": "Trial status", "text": "This trial has not completed patient recruitment at the time of submission."}]
