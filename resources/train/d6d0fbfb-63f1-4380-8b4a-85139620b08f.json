According to this approach, impairment is typically defined by scores 1-1.5 standard deviations (SD) or more below the mean for age-and educationmatched peers on culturally appropriate normative data.\nHowever, this method has shown vulnerability to false-positive diagnostic errors [2] [3] [4] . With this approach, Edmonds et al. [4] observed a falsepositive MCI diagnosis in as many as 34 .2% of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MCI cohort, and false-negative diagnostic errors in 7.1% of ADNI's cognitively normal control group. Due to these actuarial diagnostic problems, Loewenstein et al. [2] , Jak et al. [5] , and Bondi et al. [3] used an alternative classification. The Jak/Bondi criterion requires two or more tests in the same cognitive domain to be at least \u22641 SD below the demographically normative mean scores [3, 5] . Longitudinal findings show that, compared to the traditional criteria, this alternative criterion identifies more subjects that progress clinically and produces fewer subjects who return to normal neuropsychological function at follow-up [3] . One explanation for the poor diagnostic accuracy of the \"one reduced test\" approach is that cognitively healthy individuals may acquire poor test scores by chance when several cognitive tests are administered [6] . Of note, studies of patients with brain impairment of other etiology than neurodegenerative disease, do also suggest that the best balance between sensitivity and specificity is achieved with a mild cut off for impairment of 1 SD below the normative mean [7, 8] .\nWhile comprehensive neuropsychological assessment may be qualitatively better than a brief assessment with fewer tests [3] , a disadvantage is that comprehensive testing is time consuming, which makes it less efficient and thus less available. For efficiency, many memory clinics therefore employ brief cognitive assessments and use the prevailing definition for MCI [1] , despite evidence of diagnostic superiority of more comprehensive assessment with alternative impairment criteria [2] [3] [4] .\nIn the study of patients presenting with neurodegenerative diseases, the most meaningful outcome is a valid prediction of longitudinal cognitive change. In a cross-sectional validation study of cognitive impairment criteria, a biomarker signature considered a risk factor for development of AD can be a surrogate for this goal. The US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) suggested in 2011 a \"preclinical stage of AD\", defined as patients without impaired cognition on standard assessments but positive biomarker evidence for AD [1] . According to this suggestion, stage 0 implies both amyloid and tau markers negative; stage 1 being lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloidbeta (A\u2424) 42 concentrations but negative tau markers; stage 2, lowered CSF A\u2424 42 concentrations and elevated tau concentrations; and stage 3, biomarker pattern as in stage 2 with 'subtle cognitive decline' as evidenced by reduced neuropsychological test performance. In a recent longitudinal study (n = 122) following memory clinic patients on average 4 years without objective cognitive impairment, we found that biomarker-based classifications according to the NIA-AA 'preclinical AD' stage 2 was the best predictor of cognitive decline, dementia, and AD dementia [9] . A similar finding was reported in a five-year follow up [10] where a progression rate to probable mild dementia (CDR \u22650.5) was 26% in participants classified as stage 2 at baseline, and 56% in those classified as stage 3. In a smaller 6-year longitudinal study of 81 memory clinic patients that only displayed subjective cognitive decline (SCD), findings suggested that pathological CSF A\u2424 42 (similar to stage 1), predicted conversion to dementia [11] . This is in line with other studies [12, 13] . With regard to prognosis of amnestic versus non-amnestic MCI, our previous longitudinal studies revealed that MCI with memory impairment, either as a single domain deficit or in the context of a multi-domain deficit, is a stronger predictor of cognitive decline and dementia than non-amnestic MCI [15, 16] . Based on the findings described above, we chose to validate different cognitive MCI criteria against the biomarker pattern of NIA-AA stage 2 (lowered CSF A\u2424 42 concentrations and elevated CSF tau concentrations). We hypothesized that a MCI criterion, including mild amnestic deficit (Memory score 1 SD or more below normative mean), would show a stronger association with the biomarker pattern of NIA-AA stage 2, than both the conventional NIA-AA MCI criterion and an MCI criterion similar to the criterion suggested by Jak et al. and Bondi et al. [3, 5] ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The study was approved by the regional medical research ethics committee. All participants gave their written informed consent before taking part.

[3, 4] . Amnestic MCI was the only MCI criterion that was significantly associated with the biomarker pattern of NIA-AA stage 2 in multivariate regression analysis. While the odds ratio for occurrence of NIA-AA stage 2 was high (OR: 4.4) for patients classified according to amnestic MCI, it was associated with a low probability of NIA-AA stage 2 (OR: 0.5) for patients classified according to the conventional NIA-AA MCI criterion. Age at inclusion was also slightly associated (OR: 1.1) with the biomarker pattern of NIA-AA stage 2.\nSimilar results were also evident when the same independent variables (age, years of education and abnormal levels of CSF T-tau, P-tau, and A\u2424 42 ) were tested independently in multivariate analysis against the employed MCI criteria. Of particular interest is that the conventional MCI criterion was not associated with any of the independent variables in the multivariate analysis.\nThe NIA-AA stage 2 has been found to increase the risk of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with no or only subjective cognitive decline at baseline [9, 10] . The rather mild amnestic impairment criterion used in this study showed a stronger association with the biomarker-pattern characteristic of this stage, than the most commonly used NIA-AA MCI criterion [1] and a variant of the Jak/Bondi criterion [5, 3] . This suggests that the amnestic MCI criterion as applied here is precise and possibly predictive of later cognitive decline in cases where a brief neuropsychological protocol is available. The association of the amnestic MCI criterion with lowered CSF A\u2424 42 concentrations and elevated CSF tau concentrations (as in NIA-AA stage 2), suggests that those who display mild memory impairment are most likely to also display hallmark AD biomarker pathology, according to the NIA-AA suggestion from 2011. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that the amyloid cascade hypothesis, implying lowered CSF A\u2424 42 concentrations as the initial sequence of events in AD, recently has been challenged. Studies have found low correlations between AD biomarkers across disease stages [27] , a considerable proportion of subjects with MCI develop AD in the absence of pathological amyloid [10, 28] , and many elderly have lower CSF A\u2424 levels but normal cognitive function [29] . A recent Swedish study found that 46% of cognitively well-functioning 70-year-olds had at least one pathological AD biomarker [30] . While associations between MCI classifications and biomarkers are informative, the true test and validation of MCI criteria requires longitudinal follow up. With slightly different test batteries, our previous longitudinal studies showed that MCI with memory impairment, either as a single domain deficit or in the context of a multi-domain deficit, is a stronger predictor of subsequent cognitive decline and dementia than non-amnestic MCI [15, 16] . This indicates that the present findings may have some interest beyond the association with pathological CSF biomarkers at baseline. In a two-year follow up study, Hessen et al. [15] found that 29% percent of patients with pure amnestic MCI and 59% percent of patients with amnestic, multi domain MCI converted to dementia as opposed to only 10% of patients with non-amnestic MCI. In the present study, both the NIA-AA MCI criterion [1] and a variant of the criterion suggested by Jak et al. and Bondi et al. [3, 5] do not require memory problems and thus, may contain many subjects with possibly more benign non-amnestic MCI.\nThe relatively poor association, in a multivariate context, between the condition similar to the criterion suggested by Jak et al. and Bondi et al. [3, 5] (in this study, at least two tests in any cognitive domain below T-score 40) and the biomarker pattern of NIA-AA stage 2, may be explained by the different preconditions in this study and the original works by Jak et al. [5] and Bondi et al. [3] . They employed somewhat more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment than the brief assessment in this work. Furthermore, their seemingly lenient MCI criterion (only 1 SD below expected mean) is possibly not so lenient, as this criterion differ from other criteria with the requirement of 2 mildly impaired neuropsychological tests scores (-1 SD) in the same cognitive domain. Based on this they achieved a robust MCI score with a higher percentage of stable MCI subjects (i.e., did not revert back to normal test scores at follow up) and a higher percentage of subjects that converted to dementia at follow-up, than patients classified according to more typical MCI criteria [1] . This kind of criterion has also shown distinct cortical atrophy characteristics, not captured by the traditional criteria [31] .\nPrevious reports seem to suggest that a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is superior to brief cognitive assessments. However, this is not universally supported. One study found that single neuropsychological tests can be superior to biomarkers as predictors of cognitive decline, in particular tests of learning and memory [32] . Another study that explored the best combination of multiple AD biomarkers and neuropsychological tests in predicting subsequent decline, found that CSF ttau/amyloid and MRI biomarkers, together with the combination of only two neuropsychological tests of memory and executive function were the best predictors [33] . Among several single-predictor models (biomarkers and neuropsychological test scores), both entorhinal cortex volume and TMT-B had similar predictive utility as multimarker predictors at determining those that would deteriorate clinically over 3 years [33] . Similar utility of neuropsychological testing as compared with neurobiological metrics have been reported in several other studies [34] [35] [36] . Taken together, these findings suggests that the prediction of subsequent decline in the context of MCI do not necessarily require a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, supporting further exploration of the utility of brief assessments in this endeavor.\nThe present study has some limitations. Our motivation for utilizing NIA-AA 'preclinical AD' stage 2 [1] is that this biological profile was the best predictor of cognitive decline, dementia, and AD dementia in our 4-6 year follow up of SCD patients [9] . NIA-AA recently published an updated research framework based on a biological definition of AD to replace the guidelines from 2011 [37] . Imaging and/or biofluid biomarkers for A\u2424 deposition (A), neurofibrillary pathology (T), and neurodegeneration (N) are categorized as separate biomarker signatures [AT (N)], the first two (A,T) as AD-specific whereas the third (N) signifies neurodegeneration that also may be seen in other diseases. Thus, a possible problem with the NIA-AA 'preclinical AD' stage 2 is the inclusion of markers both specific for AD (lowered CSF A\u2424 42 and elevated CSF P-tau) as well markers that also is associated with other etiologies than AD (elevated CSF T-tau) [37] . As the novel research framework allows for better differentiation between AD specific markers and markers associated with suspected non-Alzheimer pathologic change, this framework has a probable advantage over the older classification, and should be validated against cognitive signatures and criteria for cognitive impairment, and tested in future longitudinal studies of persons at risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Another limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design that precludes interpretation of how cognitive functioning develops during the course of the disorder.\nIn conclusion, we found that amnestic MCI based on brief neuropsychological testing and a MCI criterion customized to this test battery is significantly associated with CSF biomarkers for cognitive decline. In contrast, when we used the prevailing NIA-AA MCI criterion, non-significant associations were found. However, since the prevalence of pathological biomarkers for cognitive decline and AD is very common, the clinical significance of the present findings depends on longitudinal validation."}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "text": ""}]
