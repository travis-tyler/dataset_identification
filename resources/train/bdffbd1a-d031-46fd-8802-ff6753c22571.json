These tsunami-like waves were not caused by geologic occurrences but instead by a combination of meteorological parameters coupled with favorable ocean bathymetry. In Japan, they are known as abiki, which translates to \"net dragging waves\" (Asano, Yamashiro, and Nishimura 2012). In the Balearic Islands, rissaga cause flooding and property damage during the summer months (Monserrat, Ibbetson, and Thorpe 1991). In the islands along the northern coast of Malta, Milghuba make navigating harbor entrances difficult for boat captains (Drago 2009). Three major meteotsunamis have been documented along the coasts of Florida, near Daytona Beach during 1992 (Churchill, Houston, and Bond 1995), along the southwest coast of Florida in 1995 (Paxton and Sobien 1998), and near Panama City in 2014 (Edds 2014). It is only recently that a unified theory regarding the propagation of these large waves was outlined. The research regarding meteotsunamis is both novel and sparse considering the number of these events and their global extent."}, {"section_title": "Meteotsunami Description and Identification", "text": "Tsunamis are long period waves that are generated by seismic activity or landslides. Meteotsunamis are similarly long-period tsunami-like waves, but unlike tsunamis, they are generated due to atmospheric pressure changes rather than seismic activity (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). Meteotsunamis are more numerous but more localized than seismic tsunamis and although they are similar to seismic tsunamis in wave period, destructive capacity, and spatial scale, meteotsunamis carry less energy and are thus a more localized phenomena (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). Meteotsunami waves can reach heights of three meters, as in the Daytona Beach, Florida meteotsunami which occurred in July 1992 (Churchill, Houston, and Bond 1995). Meteotsunamis are caused by resonant water wave growth from pressure perturbations moving over shallow water areas. They occur worldwide in shallow continental shelf waters between 0-100m deep. The Gulf Coast of Florida is a meteotsunami development region with a large, broad continental shelf, with depths of less than 100 m. This is a relatively new area for research due to better and more frequent measurements of water levels and atmospheric pressure which has occurred more recently."}, {"section_title": "Distribution and Abundance", "text": "Meteotsunamis have been documented in oceans around the world . In 1954, two meteotsunami events occurred in Lake Michigan, one of which caused seven fatalities (Bechle and Wu 2014). In 1969, a meteotsunami destroyed structures and poultry in Dwaskerbos, South Africa (Okal, Visser, and de Beer 2014). Numerous meteotsunamis have been detected along the coast of Croatia (Belu\u0161i\u0107 and Strelec Mahovi\u0107 2009;Vilibi\u0107 and \u0160epi\u0107 2009). A destructive meteotsunami affected the Nagasaki Bay in 1979 ( Figure 1; Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). A number of meteotsunamis were observed hitting the coast of Finland during July and August of 2010 (Pellikka et al. 2014). Nagasaki Bay in Japan experiences numerous meteotsunamis each year, predominantly in winter (Hibiya and Kajiura 1982 (Whitmore and Knight 2014). In June, 2013, a meteotsunami was detected off the coast of New Jersey 47 minutes before it made landfall (Lipa et al. 2014). In Florida, two meteotsunami events have been studied in detail. Churchill, Houston, and Bond (1995) investigated an ocean wave 3 m higher than the normal tide that struck Daytona Beach, Florida on July 4 th , 1992. The wave injured 75 people and caused significant property damage (Churchill, Houston, and Bond 1995). Paxton and Sobien (1998)  Considering the worldwide distribution of meteotsunamis cited in the literature, and the novelty of meteotsunami research, it is certain that many meteotsunamis have gone undocumented due to a lack of direct or indirect observation of either the meteotsunamis or their effects. Vilibi\u0107, Monserrat, and Rabinovich (2014) note that until recently, meteotsunami events were seen as limited to a few geographical locations, while current research suggests that they can form along any coastline with water depths favorable to the generation of resonance."}, {"section_title": "Formation and Propagation", "text": "As a rapid pressure change moves along the shallow waters of a continental shelf at depths from 0 -100 meters, a resonant feedback within the water column will occur if the atmospheric pressure perturbation is moving at an optimal speed of a shallow water surface gravity wave for the water depth. The rapid pressure changes are often associated with a front, squall line, outflow boundary, or atmospheric gravity wave. Winds associated with these atmospheric pressure disturbances also contribute to generation of oceanic surface gravity waves. The wavelength of the oceanic surface gravity wave generated by the atmospheric pressure disturbance is similar to the length scale of that disturbance in the direction of propagation. As the length scale of that disturbance is typically much greater than the water depth in continental shelf waters, the oceanic surface gravity waves propagate as shallow water waves, with their phase and group speed determined by the water depth as in eq. 3 (Proudman 1929).. When the water depth is appropriate, and the speed of the atmospheric pressure perturbation equals the speed of the oceanic surface gravity wave then resonance occurs. If the water is too deep-the oceanic surface gravity wave outruns the atmospheric forcing. If the water is too shallow-the forcing outruns the oceanic surface gravity wave. The resonance occurs when the air pressure disturbance resonantly transfers energy to the water surface gravity waves (Proudman 1929). The surface gravity waves are subject to refraction across the continental shelf, as the surface gravity wave speed is dependent on water depth. In the case of a meteotsunami propagating offshore, these may reflect back to shore upon reaching the continental shelf edge due to the abrupt change in water depth at the shelf break and corresponding change in wave velocity, with tsunami waves travelling much faster in deeper water. These waves may become trapped in shallow continental shelf waters due to refraction and oscillate back-and-forth over the span of many hours (Paxton and Sobien 1998). Specifically for meteotsunamis to develop, the following conditions must be met. Wavelength is described by the formula: where c is the oceanic surface gravity wave phase speed and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Dean and Dalrymple (1984) describe water wave height where an atmospheric pressure disturbance moving at a velocity that is equal to that of the water wave as: Where H is the surface gravity wave height relative to the mean water level, P is the amplitude of the pressure perturbation, h is the depth of the water, and \u03c1 is the water density. Proudman resonance occurs when the speed of the atmospheric pressure disturbance equals the speed of the oceanic surface gravity waves, with the speed of the surface gravity waves given by: where c represents the speed of the anomaly, g represents the acceleration of gravity and h represents the depth of the sea at any point (Proudman 1929). Waves in an open sea that are atmospherically generated are strongly dependent upon the Froude number (Fr), which is defined as: Where U is the phase speed of an atmospheric disturbance, and = \u221a \u210e, which defines the long wave speed, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the local depth. As Fr approaches 1, Proudman resonance occurs, amplifying the wave. Moving atmospheric pressure disturbances from storms, squall lines, gravity waves, rapid pressure increases, and other similar phenomena moving at the same speed as the water waves have the possibility of creating a resonance with the ocean (Horvath and Vilibi\u0107 2014). Possible sources of this resonance are Proudman resonance, Greenspan resonance, and shelf resonance (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). Greenspan resonance occurs when the speed of the edge wave matches the speed of the atmospheric disturbance, and is illustrated by the formula: where U l is the alongshore component of the atmospheric disturbance velocity, c is the phase speed of waves to the mode j (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). Shelf resonance occurs when the periods and/or wavelengths of the atmospheric disturbance, the wave generated by that disturbance, and the resonant period and/or wavelength of the shelf are equal (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006). Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic (2006) focused on events within a harbor, bay, or inlet with the appropriate resonant qualities, and outlined the conditions that must occur to generate a meteotsunami within those areas ( Figure 1). Those conditions include a strong, small scale atmospheric disturbance that propagates towards the harbor, bay or inlet, external resonance between the atmospheric wave and the ocean waves, and internal resonance between the arriving ocean waves and the waves in the bay, harbor, or inlet (Monserrat, Vilibic, and Rabinovic 2006)."}, {"section_title": "The West Florida Continental Shelf", "text": "The West Florida Continental Shelf is one of the widest shelves in North America (He and Weisberg 2002). The shelf is broader in the south, and the slope of the shelf becomes greater towards the south near the coast but less toward the shelf drop-off ( Figure 2). This shape may affect the resonance of meteotsunamis and could help to funnel water waves propagated in the south in a northerly direction.  Table 1 shows the continental shelf depth at 20 meter increments and optimal speed of the pressure disturbance for that depth. The center column offers inferences on weather system type based on the speed.

This study sought to find the number of meteotsunamis that affected the study area during this period and calculate how many meteotsunamis are likely to occur over a period of time. Once the water level anomalies were identified, the atmospheric pressure, wind, and radar conditions at the time of each anomaly were used to identify possible sources. A model of meteotsunami development parameters was then formulated for the study area. Finally, a meteotsunami forecasting methodology was developed for the study area of the Gulf of Mexico and west coast of Florida.

This area includes 11 Florida counties that include from north to south: Levy, Citrus, Hernando, Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier. Eight NOAA tide gauges are located in this region that collect water level readings and meteorological data every six minutes ( Figure 4, Table 3). Out of the eight tide gauges, five are sheltered in bays and not openly exposed to the Gulf of Mexico. The three tide gauges used in this study that were directly on the Gulf of Mexico    Several gaps are present in the data (see Table 4). Since these gaps are for relatively short periods of time and fairly evenly spaced throughout the year, no error correction has been used when calculating the frequency of meteotsunami events. Meteotsunamis were detected by removing the predicted tide data from the observed tide data to obtain de-tided data. The official NOAA predicted tide calculations are not available for download for large quantities of data; therefore the predicted tide was generated using the U Tide toolbox within the application Matlab (Codiga 2011). A moving average filter was then applied to the data to isolate weather-band frequency events. Figure 5 shows examples of raw tide data, de-tided data, and filtered data from Clearwater Beach which include cases A and B. Case A was a meteotsunami that occurred around the time of high tide. Case B was a meteotsunami that occurred several days later around the time of low tide. These de-tided data were then examined for anomalous wave activity associated with meteotsunamis (see Figure 5). The de-tided water levels were sorted by height, and anomalies with heights greater than 0.3 m were extracted as possible meteotsunami events. The predicted astronomical tides and measured water levels at Clearwater Beach are shown in Figure 6. The blue line shows the predicted astronomical tide as calculated by NOAA, the green line shows the observed water levels, and the red line shown in the legend refers to any preliminary data not yet verified (no preliminary data exists in this graph or any others that appear in this study).These potential meteotsunami events were further investigated to determine if there were any associated atmospheric pressure changes that could have triggered the event. Radar, satellite, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) surface analysis archive, or NCEP model reanalysis data were examined to determine the cause of the atmospheric pressure anomalies, as well as to determine the speed of the system. For the purposes of this study, meteotsunamis were defined as water level increases of more than 0.3 m in less than one hour, when measured from the existing water level in the raw water level data, accompanied by a barometric pressure differential of at least 1.0 hPa in less than one hour. Since the required speed of the system varies based on many factors, including the direction of approach and the water depth along the path of the pressure anomaly, no threshold was set for this variable, and anomalies meeting the water level and barometric thresholds were decided on a case-by-case basis. Similarly, some events were rejected that met the above thresholds based on a review of the existing conditions, such as a previously elevated water level, extremely turbulent conditions before the event, or excessive influence from wind. A possible meteotsunami, shown in Figure 7, which met the thresholds for minimum height and barometric pressure change, but was ultimately rejected because the pattern of the water level suggests this event was primarily a product of wind and associated storm surge. to 2015. The cases were sorted by wave height and then compared to associated wind and pressure data. Cases were sorted further by pressure changes that were minimal, less than 1 hPa per hour, and pressure changes that were greater than or equal to 1 hPa per hour. For the cases with pressure change greater than or equal to 1 hPa per hour, the associated wind direction, wind speed and wind gusts were gathered and graphed and selected cases meeting these criteria were listed below in Table 5. For these cases, the speed of the pressure perturbation over the water was determined by either radar, satellite, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) surface analysis archive, or NCEP model reanalysis data."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "For the tide gauge located at Cedar Key, 138 possible meteotsunamis were identified using the de-tided and filtered data. Of these, eight met the wave height requirements, and none met all of the thresholds. In Clearwater, 227 possible meteotsunamis were identified through the filters, with 61 meeting the wave height requirements, and 42 selected as meteotsunamis once all variables were considered. In Naples, 191 possible meteotsunamis were identified by the model, with 107 meeting the height requirements, and 30 meeting the barometric pressure and other thresholds. In summary, 42 meteotsunamis were recorded by the Clearwater Beach tide gauge, 30 in Naples, and none in Cedar Key.

"}, {"section_title": "Temporal Analysis", "text": "Overall, meteotsunamis were most likely to occur during late winter and especially early spring, with the highest number of occurrences in April, with 19 total occurrences, including ten at Clearwater Beach and nine at Naples (Figure 8). May and September were the least active  The increased numbers of meteotsunamis during the months of March and April are due to the increased likelihood of strong low pressure areas traversing the southeastern U.S. that create squall lines that move from northwest to southeast along the coastline. Storms moving from parallel to the coast, versus perpendicular, have more time to interact with the shallower waters directly adjacent to the coast, allowing more time for resonance to occur. The shallower waters also allow for resonance with slower moving storms (refer to Table 1). The increased number of meteotsunami occurrences recorded at the Naples tide gauge can be attributed to an increased likelihood of storms moving from the south through shallow waters across Florida Bay. Similar to the storms moving from the north, storms moving from the south spend longer periods over shallower waters, leading to increased likelihoods of meteotsunami formation. The shape of the coast directs the meteotsunamis to make landfall near Naples. Each year varying numbers of meteotsunamis occurred during the study period of 2007-2015, with the most meteotsunamis occurring during 2010 with 13 overall, including nine meteotsunamis at Clearwater Beach and four at Naples (Figure 9). The year 2010 also had the highest number of meteotsunami events for Clearwater Beach overall, whereas 2011, 2012, and 2013 were tied for the most active years for Naples, with five occurrences each year. The least active year overall was 2007, with four total events, and two events occurring at both Clearwater Beach and Naples. The average number of meteotsunamis per year for both locations was eight, with an average of 4.67 per year at Clearwater Beach and 3.33 per year at Naples. Meteotsunamis recorded at the Clearwater Beach tide gauge most often occurred from 18:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC, with 14 events, which translates into late afternoon local time, potentially presenting a hazard to beachgoers (see Figure 10). Meteotsunamis were least likely to occur between the hours of 00:00 UTC and 5:59 UTC, when only six events were observed. Meteotsunamis showed no time of day preference at the Naples tide gauge, with seven or eight occurrences during each time window.

The average speed of the barometric pressure anomalies recorded at the Clearwater Beach tide gauge was 16 m s -1 , and the average speed was 16.9 m s -1 for barometric pressure anomalies recorded at the Naples tide gauge. The overall average speed of the barometric pressure anomalies at both tide gauges was 16 m s -1 .

The dependent variable used for the regression was the absolute values of the wave heights of the events, and the independent variables were the absolute values of the changes in barometric pressure and the top speed of wind gusts during each event. The adjusted R-squared of the model was 0.1017, which is low, but considering the sparsity of the data and the lack of representation in the sample, this can be expected.

The barometric pressure fell 0.7 hPa over the course of 18 minutes (Figure 54). Wind speeds rose sharply over this time period, with sustained winds recorded at 3.6 m s -1 at 19:18 UTC and climbing to 8.5 m s -1 by 19:36 UTC with gusts reaching 10.9 m s -1 (Figure 55). Radar imagery showed a frontal system moving at 11 m s -1 from the south (Figure 56). This approach allowed the pressure anomaly more transit time over the shallow water covering the Florida Shelf, and thus helped the formation of this event.

This notification will include the forecasted date, time, location, intensity of air pressure disturbance, orientation, direction of movement and translational speed of the event expected to occur (Figure 57)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 57. NWS Storm Prediction Center notification to the National Tsunami Warning", "text": "Center of potential for a meteotsunami. The NTWC will then evaluate the potential for meteotsunami development, based on SPC input, using tsunami propagation models. If the NTWC determines there is a risk of meteotsunami impact over the tsunami advisory level, they will contact the affected NWS Forecast Offices notifying them of the potential for a meteotsunami event and relay the approximate date/time the event is expected to occur. When the time of the expected event is within 12 hours, NTWC will manually trigger all Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy water level surveillance systems in the area to increase reporting intervals to one minute resolution. Should a meteotsunami signal be detected by a DART or other means, NTWC will again contact the affected WFO(s) via Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System II (AWIPS II) with approximate forecasted wave amplitudes, durations, locations, time window of impacts, and any other pertinent information (e.g. anticipated current strength). Upon receiving this information, the affected WFOs will issue a Special Weather Statement or Coastal Flood Statement or Coastal Flood Warning, depending on severity of the system. These messages will be communicated to the public and media stating that higher than normal water levels are expected at the shore and along coastal inlets, with details of height, timing and impacts. Once the threat is over, the NWS Forecast Offices would send out a follow-up statement announcing what impacts were observed (if known) and that the threat is now over. If no meteotsunami signal is detected by NWTC, an \"all clear\" message would be sent to the affected NWS Forecast Offices."}, {"section_title": "Short Term Detection", "text": "Once a significant weather system with the potential to generate a meteotsunami is approaching the area of interest, these steps would be followed ( Figure 58): 1. Detect and analyze pressure anomaly. Determining the magnitude of the pressure anomaly is a challenge over water areas where pressure observations are scarce. To detect a pressure anomaly, look for the leading edge of a fast moving cloud band on satellite or notable boundaries on radar. In the absence of observations, forecasters will likely use a range of 1-3 hPa to provide a range of potential wave magnitudes. 2. Determine the speed and direction of the pressure anomaly then find the optimal depth for direction and speed that the meteotsunami is moving. 3. Determine if the meteotsunami will interact with the coast. 6. Finally, the coastal water level sites and any coastal beach cameras should be monitored.

CHAPTER 5: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The purpose of this research was to provide a better understanding of meteotsunamis over the eastern Gulf of Mexico along the west coast of Florida and to develop a process for forecasting those events. From 2007-2015 over 500 cases of possible meteotsunami waves, over 0.3 m in height, were found within de-tided data at the three primary NOAA coastal tide gauges at Cedar Key, Clearwater Beach, and Naples. The possible events from the de-tided data were then compared with the meteorological data thresholds set forth for this study that included strong pressure perturbations greater than 1 hPa, moving in excess of 10 m s -1 , over water areas up to around 100 m in depth. Meteotsunamis impinge upon the Florida Gulf coastline several times per year and are most prevalent south of Cedar Key where coastlines are more populated. For the tide gauge located at Cedar Key, 138 possible meteotsunamis were identified using the de-tided and filtered data. Of these, eight met the wave height requirements, and none met all of the thresholds. In Clearwater, 227 possible meteotsunamis were identified through the filters, with 61 meeting the height requirements, and 42 selected as meteotsunamis once all variables were considered. In Naples, 191 possible meteotsunamis were identified by the model, with 107 meeting the height requirements, and 30 meeting the barometric pressure and other thresholds. In summary, 42 meteotsunamis were recorded by the Clearwater Beach tide gauge, 30 in Naples, and none in Cedar Key. Cedar Key data was omitted from the following statistical analyses due to the lack of cases. Cases that met the indicated thresholds were further examined. A majority of the meteotsunami cases were associated with bands of active convection that brought pressure changes and wind changes. The only study using similar methods to this study for an area in the United States was conducted using data obtained from the tide gauge located near Atlantic City, NJ for the period 2007-2011. Rabinovich recorded 40 instances of wave heights exceeding 0.3 m. Of these 40 cases, seven were classified as meteotsunamis (2012). The average number of meteotsunamis per year was therefore 1.2. This is considerably lower than the average numbers of meteotsunamis per year found in this study (4.67 at Clearwater Beach and 3.33 at Naples). The main source for pressure anomalies in the northeastern United States are derechos moving offshore (Lipa et al. 2014). The generated meteotsunamis are then reflected by the edge of the northeast Atlantic Shelf. This more rare and complicated set of generation conditions contribute to the lower numbers of meteotsunamis observed at Atlantic City when compared to this study. Meteotsunamis are random occurrences, so it is impossible to say with any certainty how many can be expected in a given year, and the sample size for this study is small. However, historical averages during the study period predict 4.67 meteotsunamis per year at Clearwater Beach and 3.33 meteotsunamis per year at Naples. There will most likely be no meteotsunamis at Cedar Key. However, these numbers could change drastically in the coming years due to coastal erosion, land subsidence, and sea level rise. A forecast method (currently under development) has been formulated in conjunction with the NWS NTWC, the NWS SPC, the NWS National Tsunami Program Manager, the NWS Eastern and Southern Regions, and coastal NWS WFOs. It was outlined in Chapter 4 above. Several limitations existed for this study. First, although six minute water level data exists for the selected stations from 1996 to the present, barometric pressure and wind measurement records are hourly until 2007. Although five minute data exists via the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), the recording stations are located at various distances away from the tide gauges, and the data is stored in a format that makes interpretation extremely difficult and time consuming. Data is stored in a database by station numbers and years accessed via ftp. There is no search function. Once downloaded, the data is stored in comma separated values files where each line of data can contain varying numbers of observations, making translation of the data extremely difficult on a large scale. Second, there are gaps in the water level and weather data available for the selected tide gauges (refer to Table 4). Third, although thresholds were set, human judgment was still used to verify individual cases, leaving open the possibility of human errors. Finally, this study had a relatively small sample size, making long term statistical analysis inaccurate."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Having a catalog of meteotsunami events along the west coast of Florida will not only increase the scientific understanding of these events, but could also save lives. The cases derived from this research provide a baseline for formulating a forecast methodology. The prediction of meteotsunamis is challenging over the marine environment where sub-hourly pressure and wind observations are generally not obtainable. Two forecast methodologies were derived for longer term periods up to several days using numerical model surface pressure data and a refined methodology for forecasts up to several hours in advance of the impacts using a combination of high resolution weather prediction models to provide a robust environment of atmospheric pressure, wind, and pressure fields for prediction of meteotsunamis over shallow shelf waters and available observations. Outlining a forecasting method could assist emergency responders in clearing beaches and other vulnerable areas ahead of an arriving meteotsunami. Also, areas where meteotsunamis are more likely to strike or have the potential to be larger can be identified so that appropriate safety precautions can be implemented. This research illuminates meteotsunami development and potential hazards related to this phenomenon so that National Weather Service forecasters can recognize these phenomena and transmit specialized messages to the public."}]
