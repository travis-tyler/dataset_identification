Implications for policy are discussed."}, {"section_title": "\"Academic Redshirting\" in Kindergarten: Prevalence, Patterns & Implications", "text": "According to scholarly and popular reports, \"redshirting\" in kindergarten-the practice of delaying a child's entry into kindergarten for a year-is increasingly common (Bazelon 2008; Paul 2010; Weil 2007; Graue and DiPerna 2000) . In the past, nearly all children entered kindergarten at age five, but a recent New York Times article noted that in 2008, 17 percent of kindergarten entrants were at least six years old (Paul, 2010) . The shift towards later school entry is partially explained by changes in school entry laws, but may also be due to an increase in the prevalence of redshirting (Deming & Dynarski, 2008) . Some accounts suggest parents increasingly delay kindergarten entry because they believe their child is not developmentally ready for the increasing demands of school (Cosden, Zimmer, & Tuss, 1993; Graue, Kroeger, & Brown, 2002; Noel & Newman, 2003) . Others argue that redshirting reflects parents' strategic desire to ensure their child enters kindergarten older, taller, and with higher levels of social and cognitive skills than their schoolmates (Frey, 2005; Graue et al., 2002; Matlack, 2011) Our paper attempts to fill a gap in the growing redshirting literature by carefully describing the prevalence and correlates of delayed school entry. Existing research and media reports differ widely in their estimates of the prevalence of redshirting. We are able to provide more credible estimates (and from more recent cohorts) than prior research.\nUnderstanding these patterns has important implications if decisions by some parents to delay their children's school entry affect other children. For instance, high rates of redshirting may influence a kindergarten cohorts' age composition which in turn might shape learning via altered curricula, instruction, or peer relations. The potential for such externalities makes an examination of individual redshirting behavior a matter of public policy interest.\nWe find that between 4 and 5.5 percent of children delay kindergarten, a lower number than typically reported. Male, white and high SES children are most likely to delay kindergarten. Further, at the local level we find high variation in redshirting practices, with schools serving more high-income and white children displaying higher rates of redshirting."}, {"section_title": "Background How Prevalent is Redshirting?", "text": "In the early half of the 20 th century, as kindergarten became institutionalized as part of the public school system, the percentage of five year olds enrolled rose from near 0 to 60 percent (Cuban, 1992) . More recently, however, the trend has reversed. The percentage of six year olds enrolled in first grade or above has gradually dropped from 96 percent in 1968 to 83 percent in 2010 (Deming & Dynarski, 2008; Paul, 2010) . Between 1975 and 2000, 22 states increased the minimum entry age for kindergarten (Stipek, 2002) . However, policy shifts in entry laws only partially explain why children are entering kindergarten at a later age. Changes in the prevalence of kindergarten \"redshirting\"-delaying a child's kindergarten entry for a year for developmental or social reasons-may also play a part.\nIn recent years, several studies have provided estimates of redshirting based on nationally-representative data. Using the Child Health Supplement to the 1988 National Health\nInterview Survey, Byrd, Weitzman, & Auinger, (1997) find that in a national sample of children ages 7 to 17 born in the late 1970s, approximately 12 percent are \"old-for-grade\" and have never repeated grades (their proxy for redshirting). Using parent-reported data from the National Household Education Survey (NHES) of 1993 and 1995 , Zill, Loomis, & West, (1997 report that approximately 9 percent of first and second graders born in the late 1980s delayed kindergarten entry. Lincove & Painter (2006) , who use retrospective data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (a cohort of students born in the mid-1970s), also report redshirting rates around 9 percent but base these estimates only on children with summer birthdays (for whom redshirting is likely most common). Finally, estimates from the kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), which tracks a nationally-representative sample of children who entered kindergarten in 1998 (born in the early 1990s) are lower; 5 percent if calculations are based on children's age at kindergarten entry and 7 percent if parents' reports of are used (Datar, 2006a) .\nThese studies, which place the national red-shirting rate between 5 and 12 percent, rely on data from cohorts born in the mid-1970s through the early 1990s, with the lowest estimated rates for the more recent birth cohorts. Kindergarten entry behaviors may have shifted in recent years due to changes in kindergarten cutoff dates and kindergarten entry exams, increased understanding about child development, large-scale expansions in preschool opportunities and increased school-level accountability (Barnett, Epstein, Friedman, Sansanelli, & Hustedt, 2009; Jacob, 2005; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000; Stipek, 2002) . In addition, these studies rely on retrospective parental reports or fairly crude proxies to identify redshirting and most do not account for differences across states in school entry laws (Datar, 2006a is an exception). To date, none of the nationally-representative studies have used prospective data that includes detailed information about children's abilities and circumstances in the years prior to their school entry decision. The current study leverages prospective, nationally representative data to provide more recent and reliable estimates of redshirting."}, {"section_title": "Who Redshirts?", "text": "The popular press emphasizes that white children, boys, and children from families with more resources are over-represented among redshirters, a claim confirmed by earlier research (Datar, 2006b; Dobkin & Ferreira, 2010; Zill et al., 1997) . Data from the National Household Education Survey of 2007, a survey of parents with children ages 3-5 not yet enrolled in school,\nindicates that 3 percent of parents with a high school diploma or less planned to delay kindergarten entry compared to 12 percent of parents with a Bachelor's degree, and that white parents were more than twice as likely to plan to redshirt relative to Black and Hispanic parents (O'Donnell & Mulligan, 2008) .\nNo study we are aware of has examined whether kindergarten entry decisions relate to measures of children's cognitive, social and physical development before school entry. If the children who redshirt are those with the lowest academic or social skills at the time when they are eligible to enroll, their delayed entry will tend to compress the skill distribution of a kindergarten cohort. Conversely, if those who enter late are disproportionately from more advantaged backgrounds and have higher social and cognitive skills, their decisions may widen the skill distribution of a kindergarten cohort. In the current study we examine whether redshirting children appear \"less ready\" on a variety of parent, caregiver and direct measures of development relative to similar-aged children who start kindergarten when eligible. We also explore whether racial, gender, and socioeconomic differences in redshirting behavior can be partly explained by differences in children's development and school readiness.\nFinally, we provide a simple descriptive analysis of the extent to which redshirting practices differ across schools nationwide. When parents make kindergarten entry decisions they may be influenced by their neighbors and friends, preschool teachers, kindergarten teachers and others. Norms around redshirting likely differ meaningfully across communities. Indeed, in their investigation of delayed kindergarten entry across Wisconsin school districts, Graue and DiPerna (2000) found rates varying from 3 to 94 percent. We therefore supplement our national description of redshirting with a school-level analysis, exploring how much redshirting varies and whether schools' demographic composition explains this variation.\nRedshirting and child demographics. The remainder of Table 2 Because the bulk of non-compliance behavior occurs in the months before and after the cut-off, we focus on children born within three months of their states' cut-off for the regression analyses examining the associations between child characteristics and redshirting behavior. The first two columns of Table 3 show results from a series of linear probability models predicting kindergarten entry in 2006. 10 These models provide information about bivariate relationships between child characteristics and kindergarten entrance behaviors. Each model is numbered, and the results can be read horizontally. For instance, the first row shows the coefficients on \"female\" from the two models predicting redshirting and greenshirting. Among children who will turn 5 in the 3 months before their state's kindergarten cut-off, boys are 6 percentage points more likely to redshirt. Among those who turn five in the 3 months after the state cutoff, gender is not significantly associated with early kindergarten entry. Associations between demographic characteristics and kindergarten entrance are consistent with the patterns in Table 2 .\nIn the lower panel we present results from models that examine whether kindergarten entry decisions are also systematically related to measures of child development collected during the year ECLS-B children turned four. We might expect that parents of children with lower skills would be more likely to delay their child's kindergarten entry, and similarly that children with stronger skills would enter early. In general, we do not observe these patterns. We find no relationship between redshirting or early entrance and children's social skills as measured by either their parents or their teachers. Similarly, there is no relationship between entry behaviors and parents' assessment of their children's basic skills. We do observe a weak association between entrance behaviors and children's direct mathematics and reading assessment: children with higher pre-literacy and -math scores are slightly more likely to redshirt than those with lower scores, though this relationship is only marginally significant (p<.10).\nFinally, children who had very low birth weights are more likely to delay kindergarten.\nIn additional models, not shown, we find no relationship between kindergarten entry timing and their age four height, weight, or body mass index. We therefore posit that the significant relationship with low birth weight and kindergarten entrance may be capturing a host of developmental outcomes rather than a simple measure of physical development. With the exception of very low birth weight and the \"counterintuitive\" (and only marginally significant) mathematics and reading results, our measures of child development are not significant predictors of redshirting or early entrance.\nColumns 3 and 4 report the coefficients from multivariate regression models that include all the demographic and developmental variables within a single model. The gender, race, and socioeconomic differences in redshirting persist mostly unchanged in the multivariate models controlling for developmental characteristics. The results remain largely unchanged if we also account for family structure, poverty, and other family characteristics (results not shown). Once we account for SES and other demographic covariates, children's math and reading ability are no longer related to their likelihood of starting kindergarten on time.\nWe still observe that children with very low birth weight are more likely to delay kindergarten, however, no other measures of child development are related to the entry decision."}, {"section_title": "Does Redshirting Affect the Composition of Kindergartener Cohorts?", "text": "Although individual parents make kindergarten entry decisions based on the costs and benefits they perceive for their own child and family, the aggregated decisions of parents could have ramifications for the learning experiences of all children over and above any individual impacts.\nOne mechanism by which redshirting could impact students' experiences in kindergarten is by influencing the range of children's cognitive, social, and physical development within kindergarten cohorts. 1 In the current paper we describe how redshirting relates to the withinschool distribution of kindergarten students' ages as well as cognitive skills at school entry.\nTo summarize, the current paper adds to the previous literature in several ways. First, we provide more reliable and current information about the extent of redshirting nationwide, and the characteristics of children who delay school entry. Second, we examine whether the decision to delay kindergarten is related to children's demographic characteristics, to measures of their prekindergarten cognitive and social development, and to school contexts. Finally, we examine the extent to which redshirting effects the composition of kindergarten cohorts within schools. Parents also answer similar questions about their child's social skills. We construct an analogous factor and find the correlation with the provider-reported assessments is modest (0.35)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Finally, parents were asked about their child's proficiency on a set of \"basic\" skills which include letter and color recognition as well as counting. We constructed a variable that ranges from 0 to 3 depending on the number of the basic skills the child could demonstrate across the following three measures: (1) child knows (at least) some of the letters of the alphabet; (2) child can identify the colors red, yellow, blue, and green by name and; (3) child can count up to 10 or higher. Just over 70 percent of the children in our sample met all three of these basic skills, and an additional 18 percent met two of three.\nFor the purpose of this study, the key strength of the ECLS-B is that it provides prospective information about an age cohort of children prior to kindergarten entry, and includes several direct measures of child development. It allows us to more accurately measure the correlates of delayed school entry than has previously been possible. A limitation of the dataset, however, is that it does not allow us to observe groups of kindergarteners nested within the same school or neighborhood. Rates of redshirting likely differ substantially across schools and communities. In order to assess this, and to explore whether redshirting impacts the composition of incoming kindergartener's cohorts within their school, we use the Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), which includes data on a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners in Fall 1998.\nOur ECLS-K sample includes all first-time public school kindergarteners with a completed parent survey in fall 1998, a sample of approximately 12,000 children. We define each child as a redshirter if they entered kindergarten for the first time a year or more after they were first eligible, as calculated based on their date of birth and their state's kindergarten entry cutoff in 1998 (Datar, 2006b) . 4 We aggregate the individual redshirting variable for all children attending kindergarten in the same school to construct a school level measure, and we use the same approach to construct measures of each school's racial and socio-economic composition.\nOn average, we observe 18 children per school. We explore whether schools' redshirting rate is related to the age-spread of kindergarteners in a school, defined as the difference between the 10 th and 90 th percentile of the school's age distribution. We also explore whether redshirting rates are related to the spread of school-entry academic abilities, as measured by the withinschool standard deviation of literacy and mathematics test scores on the ECLS-K tests administered in fall of kindergarten.\nFinally, as a check on our estimate of redshirting prevalence, we also use data from the While the ECLS-B allows us to examine child-level correlates of redshirting, we use the ECLS-K to estimate the association between school-level covariates and redshirting rates. We fit a set of random-intercept logit models predicting redshirting based on schools' racial and socioeconomic composition. In these models, we center school characteristics around their state averages, so that the coefficients correspond to average within-state associations between school characteristics and redshirting rates.\nRedshirting and the composition of kindergartener cohorts. Finally, to provide some (admittedly crude) assessment of the extent to which redshirting impacts the range of developmental outcomes within schools, we use the ECLS-K data and fit school-level regression models predicting the range of school-entry cognitive scores (adjusted for each child's month of assessment) based on the rate of redshirting within the school. Table 2 7 On average, these children who enroll \"early\" have kindergarten experiences that are significantly different from \"complier\" children: 14 percent of \"greenshirters\" are home schooled for kindergarten, 18 percent attend private schools, and 22 percent attend transitional classrooms (i.e. transitional kindergarten, two-year kindergarten, prefirst grade, etc.). The comparable figures among children who entered kindergarten the year they were age-eligible are 2, 11 and 2 percent, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Extent of Redshirting", "text": "We find that 4 percent of children redshirted in 2006, according to the ECLS-B data.\nThis is lower rate than reported in other studies (Datar, 2006b; Lincove & Painter, 2006; Stipek, 2002; Zill et al., 1997) . Table 1 , we estimate that eight percent of six year olds fall into this category, 8,9 such that we would expect to see eight percent of six year olds in kindergarten in October, based strictly on their states' cut-off. In addition, the CPS indicates that three percent of six-year-olds are repeating kindergarten, and should not be considered redshirters, as they were five when they first entered kindergarten. After accounting for these kindergarten repeaters and compliers, we are left with approximately 5 percent of six-year-olds who should properly be classified as redshirters. This figure is well-aligned with the evidence from the ECLS-B. Thus, all three of our sources suggest that redshirting rates are between 4 and 5.5 percent."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Redshirting and school context. Next we explore whether there is local variation in redshirting rates. Recall that in order to do this we must turn to an earlier (fall 1998) cohort of kindergarteners. As noted above, we find that in 1998 approximately 5.5 percent of first-time kindergarteners redshirted. There is a great deal of local variation in redshirting, including schools with no redshirters and schools where over 25 percent of sampled children are classified as delayed kindergarten entrants. As shown in Table 4 , school-level racial and family-income composition are strongly predictive of redshirting rates, with higher rates in schools serving greater proportions of high-income and white students. For instance, as shown in Figure 5 , in schools serving students whose mean household income is $20,000, median redshirting rates were approximately 4 percent compared to a median redshirting rate of 7 percent in schools serving students with mean household income of $100,000. One fifth of schools serving highincome students had redshirting rates of 15 percent or greater (if most redshirting students were born in the three months prior to the state cutoff date, this implies that as many as 60% of those born within three months of the cutoff date were redshirters)."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Implications for Cohort Composition", "text": "In this final results section we discuss the implications of redshirting for the within-school distribution of age and cognitive ability at school entry. Using data from the ECLS-K, presented\nin Table 5 , we find that redshirting substantially expands the age distribution of kindergarteners within a school: a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of redshirters widens the 90 th /10 th percentile age range within a school by about three weeks. Somewhat surprisingly however, we find no evidence of an association between within-school redshirting patterns and the distribution of cognitive measures assessed at school entry. Our point estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point difference in the redshirting rate is associated with a roughly 0.001 difference in the within-school reading standard deviation of math or reading scores-a trivial, and statistically insignificant, association. Because these estimates are based on cross-sectional associations, however, they should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence that redshirting has no effect of the variation of test scores within school-based kindergarten cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our investigation of delayed kindergarten entrance adds to the literature on school entry in several ways. First we leverage a large, nationally-representative dataset to provide a detailed exploration of families' decisions to delay kindergarten entry. Unlike previous studies that only observe children once they enter kindergarten or later in life, our study makes use of data on a full age-cohort of five year olds, some of whom do and do not enter kindergarten in 2006. In addition, we have access to parent, care-giver and direct assessments of children's development prior to age five, so we can carefully examine whether parents decisions about kindergarten entry are related to observable measures of child development.\nOur findings show that nationwide approximately 4 to 5.5 percent of children delay kindergarten, a lower rate than previously reported. We demonstrate that the likelihood of redshirting is much higher among children whose birthday falls in the months before the cut-off and that redshirting varies substantially across gender, race and SES. Poor families rarely delay kindergarten despite the fact that they are far more likely to indicate concerns about their children's school readiness at age four. The findings are consistent with our initial hypothesis that low-income families may view redshirting as prohibitively expensive. Giannarelli and Barsimantov (2000) report that, on average, low-income families spend 16 percent of their earnings on child-care. Within this context, the patterns we observe are not surprising.\nWe also examine whether rates of redshirting, as well as the gaps in these rates across groups, are explained in part by observable measures of child development including parent and teacher reports and direct assessments. We find little evidence that this is the case. In fact, children who redshirt tend to perform slightly better during pre-kindergarten than many of their similarly-aged complier peers, although these differences are eliminated if we account for SES.\nThe absence of a relationship between nearly all of the developmental measures and the likelihood of delayed kindergarten entry suggests parents' decisions to red-shirt may be driven more by concerns about their child's relative age or relative physical development in their classroom than by their actual cognitive or behavioral development. The evidence on the impact of relative age on student learning trajectories is mixed, and recent research (Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2008; Deming & Dynarski, 2008; Dobkin & Ferreira, 2010) suggests benefits from delayed school admission may be counteracted by losses associated with one less year in the labor force. Still, parents' desire to give their child an edge in what they perceive as a competitive environment may make it appealing for those who can afford it to give their child the \"gift of time\" (Gesell, 1940) .\nGiven the differences in redshirting practices across groups, it seems plausible that redshirting would lead, mechanically, to exacerbated achievement gaps. In related analyses using the ECLS-B data we find that although redshirting substantially impacts an individual child's initial standing within a kindergarten cohort, it does not meaningfully widen achievement gaps (Bassok & Reardon, 2012) . This is because, at the national level, the incidence of redshirting is low enough that its impact is not large. However, this does not imply that redshirting bestows benefits for selected individuals without causing any negative repercussions for others. It is plausible that in certain communities where redshirting levels are high there are meaningful implications for learning experiences as well as achievement.\nThe ECLS-K data allowed us to measure, first, to what extent redshirting rates vary locally and second whether within-school redshirting rates are related to differences in the composition of kindergarten cohorts. We find that indeed, redshirting rates vary substantially between schools and that the racial and socio-economic composition of schools is strongly related to redshirting. In future work it would be worthwhile to explore how school-level redshirting norms are formed, and to what extent kindergarten teachers (or preschool teachers in the communities surrounding these schools) transmit these norms to parents through their advice about school entry timing.\nFinally, we find a strong relationship between schools' redshirting rates and the range of ages among the kindergarteners within a school, which in turn could translate to meaningful differences in learning experiences. Unfortunately, we do not have data that allows us to explore that hypothesis. We do show, however, that at the school level, redshirting is not related to meaningful differences in the distribution of cognitive assessment scores at school entry.\nThese admittedly crude results show that even at the school level, redshirting is not associated with meaningful changes in cohort composition, at least with respect to the assessment scores we considered. Taken together then, the findings suggest that the policy implications of current redshirting practices are more limited than media reports suggest.\nIt is worth noting that our study, and particularly the within-school analysis, does suffer from several data limitations. In particular, the within-school analysis does not measure the effect of redshirting on school level composition. Unlike the ECLS-B, which allows us to observe redshirters both in the year they were eligible for kindergarten and the year they enrolled, in the ECLS-K we observe a single snapshot of a kindergarten cohort. This means that although we can measure the association between schools' redshirting rates and various characteristics of their incoming kindergarten cohorts, we have no way to compare that to a counterfactual scenario in which redshirters started on time. Further, the children in the ECLS-K started kindergarten nearly 15 years ago, in a period that preceded large state preschool expansions as well as No Child Left Behind. While our analysis provides a detailed account of which types of children redshirt in more recent years, it is difficult to know whether similar patterns existed in 1998. Soon-to-be-released ECLS data from the 2010 will allow researchers to assess changes over time in within-school patterns of redshirting. Note: + 0.10 * 0.05 ** 0.01 *** 0.001; Results shown in columns 1 and 2 are from 10 separate regression models (linear probability models). The first column shows the coefficient from the model predicting redshirting based on all those born within the three months prior to their state's cutoff date. The second shows the coefficient on the covariate from the model predicting greenshirting based on all those born within the three months after to their state's cutoff date. Each model includes a variable indicating the number of months between the child's birthday and the cut-off date. Excluded groups, by model, are: males, white children, none, and western states. The race model includes children who are multiple and other races, but due to small sample sizes, these groups are not shown. For similar reasons, results for the Northeastern region are not shown. Columns 3 and 4 show results from multivariate models. The teacher reported measure of social skills is excluded from these models because it is only available for children who experienced non-relative care at age four, and therefore leads to a substantial drop in sample size. However, models which include this variable provide very similar results. All analyses are weighted. Note: Reported coefficients are log odds estimated using random-intercept logistic regression models. Sample restricted to public schools. Note: Age range is defined as the difference between the 90 th and 10 th percentiles of birthdays. All models include state fixed effects and are restricted to public schools with 10 students or more.\n1 Note that redshirting need not lead to an expansion of the age distribution. For instance, if all children in the bottom 10 percent of the age distribution redshirted, it would make the median age in the cohort older, but would not change the width of the age range. 2 Nine states do not have a state-mandated kindergarten entry cut-off. These states, which typically allow individual districts to determine their own kindergarten entry policies, are omitted from most of our analyses. The sample for the bulk of our analysis includes approximately 5,300 children. This drop in sample size from the Wave 1 sample size of nearly 10,700 stems primarily from attrition over time. Approximately 6,550 children have data available at kindergarten entry as well as cognitive scores from Wave 3. We lose about 1,250 additional children by dropping children residing in states without a set kindergarten entry law in 2005. 3 Because not all children have a regular non-parental care arrangement at Wave 3, this providerreported measure of social development is only available for a subsample of the data (~3,350 children). 4 For students living in a state that allows districts to determine cut-off dates, we use the kindergarten cut-off as reported by the school principal. If this data is unavailable, we classify children based on parent reports of delayed school entry. 5 In practice, our definition of \"kindergarten entry\" in 2006 includes all children who were enrolled in kindergarten or higher, including children enrolled in traditional kindergarten programs, children who skip kindergarten and start school in first grade, children who start homeschooling in 2006, etc. 6 Recall that the ECLS-B provides information on each child's month of birth but not on their day of birth. Ideally, we would like to know each child's actual day of birth to precisely calculate the distance between their exact age and their state's kindergarten cut-off. Instead, we assign each child a birth date at the middle date of the month in which they were born. We then calculate the difference between the assigned birth date and the state cutoff date (in months). In states where the state cut-off is in the middle of the month, we drop children who were born during the cut-off month. For example, in North Carolina the kindergarten cut-off date is October 16 th . We drop children from North Carolina born in October, because we cannot distinguish whether their birth date put them just below or just above their state cut-off. 7 Note that at Wave 3 when the children were age four, approximately 2 percent of parents indicated that their children were already enrolled in Kindergarten. The bulk of these children (70 percent) were born in the first half of 2001, with 15 percent born in January. Despite this, at Wave 4, nearly all these children (86 percent) are coded as first time kindergarteners and only 5 children are coded as first graders. 8 Calculations are available from authors upon request. 9 We exclude states without a state cut-off from this calculation. In those states, approximately 14 percent of six year olds are enrolled in kindergarten or preschool. 10 We present findings from OLS regressions for ease of interpretation. Findings from logit models are quite similar. Results are also robust to narrowing and expanding the distance from the cut-off. 11 None of the multivariate results are sensitive to changes in model specification. For instance, it may be the case that the likelihood of redshirting (or early entrance) also differs depending on when the cut-off occurs. Accounting for cut-off month does not influence our estimates, however. We also run models that include state fixed effects. Estimates from these models describe within-state associations between child characteristics and entry practices. Including the fixed effects ensures that our results are not driven by cross-state variations either in timing of the cut-off or in any other characteristics that differ across states and may influence kindergarten entry decisions. The same patterns persist in the \"within-state\" framework. 12 In additional analyses (available upon request) we find that within schools, individual children's family income is unassociated with redshirting suggesting that community norms may play a role in redishirting decisions. However, racial differences in delayed school kindergarten do persist even within schools."}]
