[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was originally identified as a cytokine inducing hemorrhagic tumor necrosis in mice. Because, TNF has emerged as a critical regulator of tissue homeostasis, inflammation and immune response, as well as mediator of disease conditions, including septic shock, cachexia, insulin resistance and autoimmunity (Lejeune et al., 2006) . Administration of high doses of TNF in combination with chemotherapy through an isolation limb perfusion (ILP) setting induces rapid and extensive regression of advanced melanoma and sarcoma of the limbs (Lejeune et al., 2006) . The antitumor activity of TNF involves selective disruption of the tumor vasculature, and can be enhanced by co-administration of interferon g (IFNg) (Ru\u00a8egg et al., 1998; Lejeune et al., 2006) . At the cellular level TNF elicits two fundamentally distinct responses: cell death (cytotoxic activity) and cell proliferation, differentiation and activation (pro-inflammatory activity) (Beyaert et al., 2002) . TNF-induced death is largely owing to apoptosis initiated by TNF binding to TNF-R1-inducing activation of pro-caspase-8, inactivation of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g. RIP and TRAF-1) and activation of downstream caspases (i.e. caspase-3, -6 and -7) (Thorburn, 2004) . Cell survival and inflammation induced by TNF requires activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB) and de novo protein synthesis (Beg and Baltimore, 1996) . Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt, is a serine-threonine kinase activated by growth factor and adhesion receptors playing a critical role in promoting adhesion-dependent endothelial cell survival (Khwaja et al., 1997) . TNF can activate PKB/Akt to promote protein synthesis and cell survival (Burow et al., 2000) .\nIn this work, we asked the question whether integrin and TNF may cooperate in mediating NF-kB and PKB/Akt activation, or more specifically, and what are the effects on endothelial cell survival. Here we report that integrins play a permissive role in TNF-induced PKB/Akt, but not NF-kB activation, and demonstrate that PKB/Akt play an essential role for the survival of TNF-stimulated endothelial cells independent of NF-kB."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Endothelial cells exposed to TNF require concomitant NF-kB and PKB/Akt activation for survival Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to TNF alone, or with IFNg, a cytokineenhancing TNF cytotoxicity (Balkwill et al., 1987) , does not result in significant death unless de novo mRNA or protein synthesis are inhibited (Nolop and Ryan, 1990) (Supplementary Figure S1) . TNF7IFNg induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkB (Figure 1a) , and phosphorylation of PKB/Akt (Figure 1b) . IFNg alone induced some PKB/Akt, but not IkB, phosphorylation. Wortmannin or LY294002, two inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), an upstream activator of PKB/ Akt, inhibited PKB/Akt but not IkB phosphorylation ( Figure 1a and b and not shown), implying that in HUVEC, TNF activates NF-kB independently of PI3K and PKB/Akt. Inhibition of NF-kB activation with a dominant-negative construct (AdDNIkB) (Brown et al., 1995) suppressed TNF-induced expression of ICAM-1, an NF-kB target gene (Collins et al., 1995) and sensitized HUVEC to TNF7IFNg-induced death, thereby confirming the critical role of NF-kB in survival of TNF-stimulated HUVEC (Figure 1c and d) . The control adenovirus AdLacZ had no effect. Wortmannin and LY294002 treatment did not prevent TNF-induced ICAM-1 expression, but sensitized HUVEC to TNF7IFNg-induced death (Figure 1e ). Expression of constitutive active PKB/Akt did not prevent death of TNF7IFNg-treated HUVEC with suppressed NF-kB activation (Figure 1f ). Collectively, these results demonstrate that in HUVEC, NF-kB and PKB/Akt are independently activated by TNF and that both pathways are required for survival upon exposure to TNF7IFNg.\nHUVEC multicellular spheroids form and survive in the absence of integrin ligation Korff and Augustin (1998) reported that integration of HUVEC in multicellular spheroids prevented anoikis, thereby allowing the study of non-matrix adherent HUVEC over prolonged periods of time. Anti-VEcadherin monoclonal antibody (mAb) or Ca 2 \u00fe depletion prevented spheroid formation for at least 24 h, whereas blocking mAbs against a2, a3, a5, a6, b1, aVb3, aVb5 integrins or PECAM-1, or a peptidic aVb3/aVb5 inhibitor (EMD121974), alone or in combination, did not (Supplementary Figure S2a, and not shown). VEcadherin localized at cell-cell contacts and by electron microscopy we observed electron-dense adherens junctions, consistent with VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (Corada et al., 1999) (Supplementary Figure  S2b) . Adhesion to fibronectin, but not spheroid formation, induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, two signaling protein immediately downstream of integrins (Alghisi and Ruegg, 2006) , consistent with integrin engagement on fibronectin but not in spheroids (Supplementary Figure S2c) . Viability of HUVEC forming spheroids remained stable for at least 24 h (data not shown). From these experiments we concluded that HUVEC multicellular spheroids form and survive in the absence of integrin ligation.\nHUVEC in spheroid bodies are sensitive to TNF-induced death TNF7IFNg treatment caused massive death of spheroids but not of HUVEC on fibronectin (Figure 2a-c) . HUVEC attach to fibronectin via aVb3 and a5b1 integrins (Ru\u00a8egg et al., 1998) . IFNg had no effect on viability (not shown). The protective effect was not unique to fibronectin, since HUVEC cultured on collagen-I, vitronectin, and gelatin, also survived TNF treatment (Supplementary Figure S3) . HUVEC cultured on immobilized anti-aVb3, and to a lesser extent on anti-b1 mAbs, were protected against TNF-induced death, while culture on PLL, a substrate promoting integrin-independent adhesion, was much less effective ( Figure 2d ). We concluded that integrin-mediated adhesion protects HUVEC against TNF7IFNg-induced cell death.\nTNF-induced PKB/Akt but not NF-kB activation requires integrin adhesion and is essential for HUVEC survival Analysis of IkB phosphorylation and degradation, NFkB nuclear translocation (electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)) and cell surface expression of ICAM-1 revealed no significant differences in spheroids vs fibronectin-adherent HUVEC upon TNF7IFNg stimulation (Figure 3a -c, and not shown). A low basal level of PKB/Akt phosphorylation was observed in both adherent and spheroid HUVEC (Figure 3d ), the latter consistent with VE-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion (Spagnuolo et al., 2004) . TNF7IFNg treatment induced a strong transient PKB/Akt phosphorylation in adherent HUVEC, but not in spheroids (Figure 3d ). Expression of constitutive active PI3K or PKB/Akt, but not wild-type PKB/Akt or a control plasmid, protected spheroids from TNF7IFNg-induced death ( Figure 3e ). These data indicate that TNF-induced PKB/Akt, but not NF-kB activation, requires integrin-mediated adhesion and that PKB/Akt activation is sufficient to protect HUVEC spheroids against TNF-induced death.\nIntegrin ligation and PKB/Akt activation suppress TNF-induced JNK activation TNF activates the mitogen/stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 and JNK has been implicated in modulating endothelial cell survival (Laird et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2005) . PKB/Akt activation suppress JNK activity, thereby preventing neuron death (Kim et al., 2002) . We therefore monitored JNK and p38 activation in spheroids and adherent HUVEC7LY294002. TNF7IFNg treatment induced JNK activation in spheroids but not adherent HUVEC. Phosphorylation of p38 was strong in both conditions ( Figure 4a ). Inhibition of PI3K-PKB/Akt activation in adherent HUVEC greatly enhanced TNF7IFNg-induced JNK phosphorylation without affecting p38 phosphorylation ( Figure 4b ). Inhibition of JNK, however, did not prevent TNF-induced death of spheroids and LY294002-treated adherent HUVEC (Figure 4c ). We conclude that integrin ligation and PKB/Akt activation suppress TNF-induced JNK activation, but JNK activity is not required for TNF toxicity.\nThe marked effect of IFNg in enhancing TNF cytotoxicity prompted us to test whether IFNg-induced STAT-1 activation was involved in this effect (Suk et al., 2001; Battle and Frank, 2002) . IFNg treatment induced Y701 and S727 STAT-1 phosphorylation in all conditions, but Y701 STAT-1 phosphorylation was attenuated in spheroids. Expression of p21, a STAT-1 regulated gene shown to induce cell death (Agrawal et al., 2002) , was greatly enhanced in spheroids exposed to TNF/ IFNg, while no upregulation occurred in adherent HUVEC7LY294002 (Supplementary Figure S4) .\nPKB/Akt requires intact actin cytoskeleton to prevent TNF-induced death LY294002 pretreatment decreased integrin-mediated HUVEC adhesion, while constitutive active PKB/Akt enhanced it (Figure 5a ), consistent with the reported integrin affinity modulation by PKB/Akt (Byzova et al., 2000) . As ligated integrins promote actin stress fiber formation (Alghisi and Ruegg, 2006) , we tested whether actin polymerization was necessary for HUVEC survival. Cytochalasin D treatment caused disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions (Figure 5b ), had no effect on HUVEC survival whereas it sensitized HU-VEC to TNF7IFNg-induced death ( Figure 5c ). Cytochalasin D did not perturb TNF-induced PKB/Akt activation ( Figure 5c , inset), but abolished the cytoprotective activity of active PKB/Akt in spheroids (Figure 5d ). Wortmannin or LY294002 treatment did not disrupt actin stress fibers indicating that PKB/Akt activity is not required for actin polymerization (Figure 5b and data not shown). These results demonstrate that actin polymerization is necessary for the survival of HUVEC exposed to TNF7IFNg and for the protective effect of PKB/Akt.\nThe aVb3/aVb5 inhibitor EMD121974 sensitizes fibronectin-adherent HUVEC TNF/IFNg-induced death The aVb3/aVb5 inhibitory RGD-based cyclopeptide (Dechantsreiter et al., 1999) showed antiangiogenic effects in preclinical models (Alghisi and Ruegg, 2006) . We used EMD121974 to test whether inhibition of aVb3/ aVb5 integrins in fibronectin-adherent HUVEC would sensitize HUVEC to TNF-induced death. EMD121974 does not affect the a5b1 component of a5b1/aVb3-dependent adhesion to fibronectin, and does not detach HUVEC plated on fibronectin (Supplementary Figure S5) . TNF7IFNg or EMD121974 alone did not affect survival, whereas combined TNF, IFNg and EMD121974 treatment resulted in increased cell death (Figure 6d ). EMD121974 was ineffective in sensitizing HUVEC to TNF toxicity in the absence of IFNg (not shown). The control peptide EMD135981 was inactive in all conditions tested. These results demonstrate that EMD121974 sensitized adherent HUVEC to TNF/IFNg-induced death in a PKB/Akt-dependent manner. Concomitant exposure to IFNg was required for this effect."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Extracellular cues determining whether TNF kills or activates endothelial cells have remained elusive. This work was initiated to investigate whether integrindependent adhesion may modulate endothelial cell response to TNF and to identify the associated intracellular signaling events. As a main model, we used the endothelial cell spheroid model reported by Korff and Augustin (1998) . It allows bypassing anoikis that rapidly occurs in single-cell suspensions (Meredith et al., 1993) , thereby allowing to keep HUVEC viable for the duration of the experiment under conditions of integrin-independent but VE-cadherin-dependent adhesion (Spagnuolo et al., 2004) . The main conclusions of this work are as follows: (i) Concomitant PKB/Akt and NF-kB activation is essential for the survival of endothelial cells exposed to TNF, and integrin ligation acts permissive for TNFmediated PKB/Akt, but not NF-kB activation. NF-kB activation promotes survival of TNF-stimulated cells, including endothelial cells, mostly by inducing expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as c-FLIP, c-IAPs (Baker and Reddy, 1998; Pober, 1998) . PKB/Akt Integrins modulate TNF activity G Bieler et al prevents death through inactivation of proapoptotic protein, including p53, and expression of pro/antiapoptotic genes (Hermann et al., 2000) . Here we demonstrate that concomitant activation of PKB/Akt and NF-kB is necessary for the survival of endothelial cells exposed to TNF, implicating that in HUVEC these pathways are independently activated by TNF and elicit non-redundant survival responses. This was not an anticipated result, because in breast cancer cells inhibition of PKB/ Akt enhanced TNF toxicity indirectly by attenuating NF-kB activation (Burow et al., 2000) , whereas hepatocytes resist to TNF-induced death with just one pathway active (Imose et al., 2003) . b1 integrinmediated adhesion protects aggressive prostate cancer cells against anoikis or TNF via PKB/Akt-dependent upregulation of survivin (Fornaro et al., 2003) . Activation of Tie-2 by Ang-1 promotes PKB/Akt-dependent endothelial cell survival (Papapetropoulos et al., 2000) , enhances angiogenesis initiated by low doses of TNF and protects endothelial cells against death induced by high doses of TNF (Chen et al., 2004) . Our findings extend these observations by demonstrating a permissive role of integrins in TNF-mediated PKB/Akt activation in endothelial cells. This effect is specific for integrins because VE-cadherin-dependent adhesion occurring in spheroids is not sufficient. Suppressed PKB/Akt activation enhanced TNF-induced JNK activation, but JNK activity was not required for HUVEC death. Our results suggest that the observed suppression of TNF-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells induced by shear stress (Surapisitchat et al., 2001 ) may be due to integrin engagement, because shear stress is detected by integrins at the luminal surface (Shyy and Chien, 2002) .\nThroughout all experiments IFNg enhanced TNF toxicity. IFNg and TNF are known to synergize for many activities, including inhibition of proliferation , expression of adhesion molecules (i.e. E-selectin) (Pober, 1998) , inhibition of aVb3 integrin function (Ru\u00a8egg et al., 1998) , cytotoxic activity in vitro (Mareel et al., 1988) and in vivo (Balkwill et al., 1987) . The molecular basis of this synergy has remained largely elusive. We have explored the possible involvement of STAT-1 in this synergy, and observed that optimal STAT-1 phosphorylation at 701Y requires integrin-mediated adhesion, independent of PKB/Akt activation. Also, p21 expression does not correlate with STAT-1 activation, consistent with studies suggesting that STAT-1 is required but not sufficient for p21 induction (Gooch et al., 2000) . These results suggest that IFNg-activated STAT-1-p21 axis is not critically involved in enhancing TNF cytotoxicity in this system.\n(ii) Pro-survival activity of PKB/Akt requires intact cytoskeleton. Cytochalasin D treatment abolished the protective effect of PKB/Akt, placing actin polymerization downstream of PI3K and PKB/Akt in cell survival. TNFinduced death by cycloheximide has been associated with the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Scanlon et al., 1989) , and recent reports implicate changes in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton to mitochondrial changes in cell death (Gourlay and Ayscough, 2005) . Mitochondria are key to the execution of apoptosis and PKB/Akt controls the expression or translocation of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2, glucose hexokinase) or the inhibition of proapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bad, Bax and Bak) associated with it. The actin cytoskeleton may mediate the regulation/translocation of these proteins in response to PKB/Akt activation.\n(iii) EMD121974 sensitizes endothelial cells to TNFdependent cytotoxicity. This effect is of potential clinical significance because it may open the possibility of enhancing the cytotoxic effects of TNF on aVb3-positive tumor vessels in vivo, and thereby lowering the doses currently administered to patients. Vasoplegia and systemic inflammatory syndrome are life-threatening side effects that have prevented so far systemic administration of TNF (Lejeune et al., 2006) .\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that under normal adhesive conditions, the default endothelial cell response to TNF is survival and activation. Endothelial cell death may be an 'unwanted effect' occurring under conditions of suboptimal adhesion, as it occurs in tissues undergoing extensive remodeling or in angiogenesis. The use of EMD121794 to sensitize selected vascular beds to TNFinduced death and may open new therapeutic perspectives to the clinical use of TNF as anticancer agent."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chemicals, proteins, antibodies and plasmids See Supplementary Information.", "text": "HUVEC culture, electroporation and adenoviral infection HUVEC were prepared, cultured and electroporated as described (Bezzi et al., 2003) .
