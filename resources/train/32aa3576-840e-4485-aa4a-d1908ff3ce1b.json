[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is a multisite, multiracial/ethnic longitudinal study of women initially aged 42-52 (N=3302) designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during the menopause transition and to assess their relations to subsequent health and age-related diseases. Each of seven clinical sites recruited non-Hispanic white women and women belonging to a predetermined racial/ethnic minority (African American, Hispanic, Chinese, or Japanese). Cohort eligibility was determined from a cross-sectional survey of 16,065 women in 1996-97 aged 40-55 who were aged 42-52, had an intact uterus and at least one ovary, and not using hormone therapy. Cohort participants have been assessed in-person approximately annually through follow-up visit 15 in 2017 using a standardized protocol of detailed questions about medical, reproductive and menstrual history; lifestyle and psychosocial factors; physical and psychological symptoms; and anthropometric measurements, reproductive hormones, bone and body composition, and cardiovascular health."}, {"section_title": "THE WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE (WHI): STILL LEARNING FROM 161,808 POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN", "text": "Andrea Z. LaCroix, 1 and Andrea Z. LaCroix 2 , 1. University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States, 2. Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States The WHI enrolled 161,808 women ages 50-79 into 1-3 Clinical Trials (n=68, 132) RBS is an ideal cohort to study healthy aging in women and to examine sex differences in aging. Initiated in 1972, RBS enrolled 82% of adult residents of Rancho Bernardo, a suburb of San Diego. Residents were white, and middle to upper-middle class. Participants have been followed via 12 research clinic visits at ~4 year intervals and 32 mailed surveys. RBS contains detailed assessment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, bone health, biomarkers, physical ability, cognitive function, health and reproductive history, medications, behaviors (smoking, drinking, diet, exercise) and psychosocial measures. Of the 6726 participants, 54% are women and 65% were aged \u226550 at enrollment. Vital status is known for 91% of the cohort; overall mortality is 71%. Death certificates have been coded for cause of death for 91% of decedents. We will discuss contributors to healthy longevity in RBS women (average age of death 86.4 yrs; 29% lived to age \u226590). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), an ongoing continuous enrollment cohort study of normative aging established in 1958 currently conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program, began including women in 1978. To date, nearly 1200 women aged 17-94 at enrollment (median=53 Q1-Q3=40-70) have been followed for up to 21 visits spanning 40 years (median visits=6; Q1-Q3=3-9). Over 3 days, participants receive comprehensive examinations, interviews, imaging and functional and cognitive evaluations; repeat visits occur every 1-4 years depending on age. The BLSA offers opportunities to examine distributions of, change in and interrelationships among several rarely concurrently ascertained parameters (e.g., cardiovascular fitness, resting metabolic rate, glucose challenge response, five-factor personality, brain volumes, and diet) over the life course and across birth cohorts. The BLSA also maintains an extensive biorepository. This talk will summarize the extensive measurement catalogue and timeline and provide illustrative examples from ongoing research on women's aging and health.
