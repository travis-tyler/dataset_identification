[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This report is the second of two publications produced from results of the 1994 Survey of Industrial Research and Development. The first, a Data Brief announcing the availability of survey results, contains analytical information and highlights the decreased share of R&D supported by the Federal Government during 1994. This report, the Detailed Statistical Tables report, contains the full set of statistics produced from the survey. Both publications provide statistics on research and development (R&D) funding for the years 1984-94 and on R&D personnel for the period from January 1985 to January 1995. (Both printed publications also are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nsf gov/sbe/s rs/stats. htm.) This report provides national estimates of the expenditures on R&D performed within the United States by industrial firms, whether U.S. or foreign owned. Among the statistics are estimates of total R&D, the portion of the total financed by the Federal Government, and the portion financed by the companies themselves (or by other non-Federal sources such as State and local governments or other industrial firms under contracts or subcontracts). Total R&D is also separated into its character-of-work components: basic research, applied research, and development. Other statistics include R&D financed by a domestic firm but performed outside the United States, R&D contracted to organizations outside of the firm, and the funds spent to perform energy-related R&D. This report also provides statistics on domestic net sales, number of employees, number of R&D-performing scientists and engineers, and cost per R&D scientist and engineer. The Survey of Industrial Research and Development is an annual sample survey that intends to include or represent all for-profit, nonfarm R&D-performing companies, either publicly or privately held. The survey's primary focus is on U.S. industry as a performer of, rather than as a source of funds for, R&D. Thus, data on Federal support of R&D activities performed by industry are collected and resulting statistics appear in several tables, but statistics on industrial funding of R&D undertaken at universities and colleges and other nonprofit organizations are not T COPY AVALABLE collected and therefore are not included in the tables.' The result of collecting and publishing performerreported statistics is that the federally funded R&D performance totals presented in this report differ from the Federal R&D funding totals reported by the Federal agencies that provide the funds and published in National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Federal Funds for Research and Development report series. One reason for these differences is that performers of R&D often expend Federal funds in a year other than the one in which the Federal Government provides authorization, obligations, or outlays. (For definitions of these terms, see section C under Comparisons to Other Statistical Series.) During the past several years, the differences have widened between the Federal R&D funding reported by performers and that reported by funding agencies. These trends are documented and analyzed in National Patterns of R&D Resources: 1996 (NSF 96-333). Industry statistics in this report are developed from data collected from individual companies or enterprises. Since the survey is enterprise based rather than establishment based, all data collected for the various subparts of each enterprise (plants, divisions, or subdivisions) are tabulated in the major standard industrial classification (SIC) of the company. The resulting industry estimates are reported using the SIC of the companies within each industry. National totals are estimated by summing the industry estimates. All companies that spend more than $1 million annually on R&D in the United States or have 1,000 or more employees receive a survey questionnaire every year. These attributes are determined using information from previous surveys or other sources. Remaining firms are subjected to probability sampling and may or may not receive a questionnaire for a given survey year. Among the organizations purposely excluded from the survey are trade associations and not-forprofit consortia. Although their primary mission is to serve industry, these associations are established as nonprofit organizations. Respondents receive detailed definitions to help them determine which expenses to include or exclude from the R&D data they provide. Nevertheless, the statistics presented in this report are subject to response and concept errors caused by different respondent interpretations of the definitions of R&D activities and by variations in company accounting procedures. The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Science Resources Studies has sponsored and managed a survey of industrial R&D since 1953. The 1953-56 surveys were conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor.2 Since 1957, the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, has conducted the survey.' Census staff conduct the survey under Title 13 of the United States Code, which prohibits publication or release of data or statistics that may reveal information about individual companies. Therefore, in some tables of this report the symbol \"(D)\" is used as a footnote reference to indicate that estimates are being withheld to avoid possible disclosure of information about operations of individual companies. The content of the survey has been expanded and refined over the years in response to an increasing need by policymakers for more detailed information on the Nation's R&D effort. For example, questions on energy R&D were added in the early seventies, following the first oil-shortage crisis. On the other hand, the frequency of collection of certain data items has been reduced in recent years in an attempt to alleviate some of the respondent burden that has been placed on industry from all sources. For large firms known to perform R&D, a detailed questionnaire, Form RD-1L, is used to collect data for odd-numbered years and an abbreviated version, Form RD-1S, is used to collect data for even-numbered years. To further limit reporting burden on small R&D performers and on firms that are included in the sample for the first time, an even more abbreviated form, Form RD-1A, which collects only the most crucial data, is used each year. This 2 See National Science Foundation, Science and Engineering in American Industry: Final Report on a 1953-54 Survey  and Science and Engineering in American Industry: 1956 (NSF 59-50) (Washington, DC: Supt. of Documents, GPO, 1956 and1960). 3 Data obtained in the earlier BLS surveys are not directly comparable with Census figures because of methodological and other differences. 2 report provides data collected from the Forms  Several changes have been made to the survey recently that are of special importance to users of this report. Prior to the 1992 survey, statistics were based on samples selected at irregular intervals (i.e., 1967, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1987). In intervening years a subset of the last sample (called a panel) was used. The most recent sample prior to the 1992 survey was selected and first used for survey year 1987. Original estimates for 1988 through 1991 were based on surveys of approximately 1,700 panel companies that reported R&D activity in the 1987 survey. Beginning with the 1992 survey, statistics are based on samples selected annually. Also, beginning with the 1992 survey, the sample size was increased from approximately 14,000 to nearly 23,400 firms. This increase was made for several reasons: (1) to account better for births of R&D-performing establishments in the survey universe, (2) to more fully and accurately survey R&D performed by nonmanufacturing firms, especially in the service sector, and (3) to gather more current information about potential R&D performers. An analytical overview of the statistics developed from the survey data follows immediately. Tables containing the statistics are provided in section A. Detailed information about the history of the survey, survey methodology, comparability of the statistics, survey definitions, and other technical notes are provided in section B. Survey questionnaires, instructions, and other survey documents are reproduced in section C.

However, after adjusting for inflation, the amount spent for industrial R&D during 1994 decreased 0.2 percent, having declined by 3.5 percent in constant dollars in 1993. This downward trend is only the second since 1953. The first occurred in the early 1970s when total R&D measured in constant dollars began falling and did not regain its 1969 level until 1978. Eighty-one percent of total R&D performed during 1994 was financed by companies' own funds and 19 percent was financed by the Federal Government through contracts and grants, including the two percent of total R&D performed by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) administered by industry. Company funding continued to increase, from $94.6 billion to $97.1 billion, as it has each year since 1953. Federal funding decreased from $22.8 billion to $22.5 billion, continuing a downward trend that began in 1988. After adjusting for inflation, the directions of these changes are the same: company-funded R&D rose 0.6 percent and Federally funded R&D fell 3.5 percent. The share of R&D performed by firms in the nonmanufacturing industries decreased from 26 percent during 1993 to 24 percent, while manufacturers performed the remaining 76 percent. The remainder of this section will focus on the levels and trends of R&D performed by these two groups, with emphasis on the manufacturing industries. Beginning with the 1995 survey, more detailed statistics for the nonmanufacturing industries will be available. Instead of grouping all nonmanufacturingindustries together, as has been done in this and in previous publications, about a dozen subgroups will be added to the 1995 tabulations."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SOURCES OF R&D FUNDS FEDERAL SUPPORT", "text": "Among manufacturing industries, Federal funding accounted for $17.3 billion of total R&D with most of that amount, $8.8 billion, spent on research performed by companies that manufactured aircraft and missiles for the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Although down 6 percent from 1993 levels, these firms received 39 percent of the Government's support of industrial R&D. Makers of professional and scientific instruments and of electrical equipment ranked second and third. Firms in those industries performed $3 billion and $2 billion of Federal R&D, respectively, and accounted for 23 percent of total Federal R&D. Manufacturers of machinery including computers, petroleum extractors and refiners, drug and medicine makers, and other manufacturers received 15 percent of Federal funding and performed $3 billion of the total Federal R&D. Firms in nonmanufacturing industries as a group received $5 billion, a 23-percent share of total Federal support. Most of this support went to computer-related service firms and research, development, and testing firms."}, {"section_title": "COMPANY SUPPORT", "text": "While the Federal government's share of support of R&D to most industry groups declined during 1994, the amount firms contributed to their own R&D efforts continued to grow. Manufacturing industries as a group spent $73 billion on R&D. Among the manufacturing industries, firms in transportationequipment, especially automobile makers, performed the largest amount of R&D during 1994, $18 billion, with chemical manufacturers including makers of drugs and medicines ranking a close second, $17 billion. Manufacturers of electrical equipment, including electronic and communication components, performed $14 billion of R&D. Together these three industry groups accounted for two-thirds of total company-funded R&D performed by manufactur-ers. Makers of professional and scientific instruments, machinery, petroleum extractors and refiners, and other manufacturers performed the rest. Nonmanufacturing firms as a group spent $24 billion on company-funded R&D during 1994. Among nonmanufacturing performers, the largest were computer-related service firms, which spent $6 billion, and research, development, and testing firms, which spent $2 billion. institutions, and hospitals.

Subsidiaries and affiliates of companies in this group financed $2.1 billion of foreign R&D during 1991 (statistics for 1992-94 have been suppressed and are not available because of disclosure') and it is assumed that this industry group also ranked first among the manufacturing industries that financed foreign R&D during 1994."}, {"section_title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF R&D PERFORMERS R&D AND FIRM SIZE", "text": "Performance of R&D by the smallest firms, those with less than five hundred employees, declined 4 percent during 1994 compared with 1993.

For companies with more than one establishment, data were summed to the company level. The firm was then assigned a single standard industrial classification (SIC) code based on the activity of the establishment(s) having the highest dollar value of payroll. This assignment was done on a hierarchical basis. The enterprise was first assigned to the economic division (manufacturing or nonmanufacturing) with the highest payroll, then to the two-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned division, then to the three-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned two-digit industry. The frame from which the survey sample was drawn included all for-profit companies classified in nonfarm industries. For surveys prior to 1992, the frame was limited to companies above certain size criteria based on number of employees.2 These criteria varied by industry. Also, some industries were ex- eluded from the frame because it was believed that these industries contributed little or no R&D activity to the final survey estimates. For the 1992 sample, new industries were added to the frame' and the size criteria were lowered considerably and applied uniformly to firms in all industries. As a result, nearly 2 million enterprises with five or more employees were given a chance of selection. For comparison, the frame for the 1987 sample included 154,000 companies of specified sizes and industries. The initial frame used to select the 1994 sample was similar to the ones used to select the 1992 and 1993 samples. The frame ultimately used to select the 1994 sample differed from the 1993 frame in the following respects. First, the predetermination of companies selected for the survey with certainty was limited to companies with reported or estimated R&D expenditures of $1 million or more and all companies with 1,000 employees or more. For the 1993 frame, external information about the likelihood that a company conducted R&D was used to identify nearly 10,000 companies that were included in the survey sample with certainty. Sources included the 1992 survey, directories that include company information on R&D reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, commercially available directories of R&D-performing companies, Department of Defense directories of contracts awarded for R&D, and various publications and newsletters that highlight firms conducting R&D. In the 1994 frame, these companies were included along with R&D spending reported in the 1993 survey. Their likelihood of selection in the 1994 sample was based on the level of their R&D programs reported in 1993 rather than with certainty. Other modifications to the 1993 frame for the 1994 survey were the partitioning of the frame and the expanded use of simple random sampling. Since the early 1980's, probability proportionate to size (pps) sampling had been used exclusively in the selection of new sample panels for the R&D survey. An examination of 1992 survey results, however, showed that the large influx of small companies into the frame that year resulted in a disproportionate number of small companies being selected for the sample, often with very These industries are listed and discussed under Comparability of Statistics, later in this section. large weights. These companies generally reported little, if any, R&D activity. This disproportion was caused primarily by the application of the minimum probability rule (see below under \"Sample Size and Weighting\") which resulted in increased probabilities of selection for several hundred thousands of these smaller companies."}, {"section_title": "75", "text": "As a result, the 1994 frame was split into \"large\" and \"small\" company partitions. Probability proportionate to size (pps) sampling continued to be used for the large partition. However, more efficient simple random sampling (SRS) was used to sample the small company partition. Simple random sampling is more efficient than independent pps sampling when little variability exists in the size of the variable being measured. Payroll was the basis for determining the partition between large and small, and the analysis of payroll was performed for each of the 165 defined sampling strata. Within each stratum, companies were sorted by payroll. Companies previously designated as certainties were defined as large regardless of their payroll (that is, all predetermined certainties were included in the pps frame). With that parameter, cumulative payroll values were computed until 90 percent of the stratum total was reached. Companies contributing to the 90 percent share were defined as large, and the remaining companies were defined as small. In total, the large partition contained about 640,000 companies. The small partition contained about 1.2 million companies. An additional benefit of these design changes was a reduction in the maximum allowable weight for selected companies."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SELECTION PROBABILITY PROPORTIONATE TO SIZE", "text": "The distribution of companies by payroll and estimated R&D in the large partition was skewed as in earlier frames. Because of this skewness, pps sampling used in previous designs was an appropriate selection technique for this group. That is, large companies had a higher probability of selection than did small companies. For this survey it would have been ideal if company size could have been determined by its R&D expenditures. Unfortunately, except for the companies that were in a previous survey or for which there was information from external sources, it was impossible to know the R&D expenditures for every firm in the universe. Consequently, the probability of selection for most companies was based on estimated R&D expenditures. Since total employment was known for each company in the universe, it was possible to use an already-observed relationship between employment and R&D to estimate an amount for R&D expenditures to use as a measure of size. This was the same strategy employed in all sampling operations since 1981. For 1994 sampling, data collected in the 1993 survey were used to derive this relationship separately for singleunit companies and multiestablishment companies. The effect in all cases was to give firms with a large number of employees higher probabilities of selection since the assumption was that large companies were more likely to perform R&D and that the amount of R&D was proportionate to the size of the company. Estimated R&D values were computed for companies in the small partition as well. The aggregate of reported and estimated R&D from each company in both the large and small partitions represented a total universe measure of R&D expenditures. However, assigning R&D to every company resulted in an overstatement of this measure. To adjust for the overstatement, the universe measure was scaled down using factors developed from the relationship of the universe measure of 1993 R&D and the 1993 survey estimate. These factors, computed at levels corresponding to published industry levels, were used to adjust originally imputed R&D values so that the new frame total for R&D at these levels approximated the 1993 published values. This adjustment provided for better allocation of the sample among these levels."}, {"section_title": "SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING", "text": "In the small company partition, the use of simple random sampling implied that each company within a stratum had an equal probability of selection. Stratum definitions were the same as for the large partition. The total sample allocated to the small partition was dependent upon the total sample specified for the survey and upon the total sample necessary to satisfy criteria established for the large partition. Once determined, the allocation of this total by stratum was made proportionate to the stratum's payroll contribution to the entire partition."}, {"section_title": "78", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE STRATIFICATION AND RELATIVE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STANDARD ERROR CONSTRAINTS", "text": "The particular sample selected was one of a large number of the same type and size that by chance might have been selected. Statistics resulting from the different samples would differ somewhat from each other. These differences are represented by estimates of sampling error. The smaller the sampling error, the more precise the statistic. Primary concern was placed on the large company partition since it was believed that nearly all of the R&D activity would be identified from this sector. To control sampling error in the statistics resulting from this portion of the frame, parameters were specified to allocate the sample across various levels, or strata, that corresponded to industry groupings. These parameters permitted the sample size to be varied to achieve a desired level of sampling error for each stratum and were assigned so that estimated errors of total R&D expenditures for industries in these strata did not exceed certain levels. Sample sizes among the strata were only constrained by the limit placed on the total sample size dictated by the available budget. For sample selections prior to 1992, the stratum designations were the published industry categories. The sample was allocated across these industry categories to provide high, medium, and low levels of precision. For the 1992 sample the criteria for this allocation were modified. In order to gather information to review and evaluate the appropriateness of the published industry groupings, the allocation of the sample was controlled for levels of industry detail below those traditionally published. The result was that the frame was partitioned into 140 manufacturing industry strata and 25 nonmanufacturing strata. The manufacturing strata corresponded to the 140 three-digit industries that comprised manufacturing. For nonmanufacturing, 12 strata corresponded to three-digit nonmanufacturing industries that represented a current level of publication or that had a high concentration of scientists and engineers, and 12 strata corresponded to two-digit nonmanufacturing industries where R&D activity was considered likely. These nonmanufacturing strata thus identified newly emerging industries or industries where improved coverage was desired. The final stratum was the balance of nonmanufacturing industries that had not been included in previous sampling frames or for which there was little indication of R&D activity. This same stratification was used for the 1993 and 1994 samples. For 1994, the following criteria for the relative standard error of estimated R&D expenditures were established for the 165 strata of the large company partition: a. Relative sampling error not to exceed 2 percent: all 140 three-digit manufacturing strata, 12 three-digit nonmanufacturing strata, and 3 two-digit nonmanufacturing strata. b. Relative sampling error not to exceed 5 percent: the remaining 9 two-digit nonmanufacturing strata, and the 1 stratum corresponding to the balance of nonmanufacturing. These criteria, which differed from the criteria established for the 1993 survey, suggested a total sample size of approximately 17,600 companies from the large partition. A limitation of the sample allocation process for the large partition should be noted. The sampling errors used to control the sample size in each stratum were based on a universe total that, in large part, was improvised. That is, as previously noted, an R&D value was assigned to every company in the frame, even though many of these companies actually may not have had R&D expenditures. The value assigned was imputed for the majority of companies in the frame and, as a consequence, the estimated universe total and the distribution of individual company values did not necessarily reflect the true distribution. Estimates of sampling variability were nevertheless based on this distribution. The presumption was that actual variation in the sample design would be less than that estimated, because many of the sampled companies have true R&D values of zero, not the widely varying values that were imputed using total employment as a predictor of R&D. Previous sample selections indicate that in general this presumption holds, but exceptions have occurred when companies with large sampling weights have reported large amounts of R&D spending. Thus, in general, the 2-percent and 5-percent error levels described earlier are conservative. See table B-2 for a list by industry of the actual standard error estimates for selected items. For the small partition, the same 165 strata were identified. Also included was a separate stratum of approximately 8,700 companies that could not be assigned to a stratum because of incomplete industry   -42, 44-49, 50-59, 60-65, 67, 701, 73, 75-76, 78-79, 80-81, 83-85, 87, 89 Distribution by size of company: (Based on number of employees)  "}, {"section_title": "125", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE    -42, 44-49, 50-59, 60-65, 67, 701, 73, 75-76, 78-79, 80-81, 83-85, 87, 89 Distribution by size of company: (Based on number of employees) Total   identification in the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL).

The sample initially allocated to a given stratum was proportionate to its share of total payroll for the small partition. In addition to sampling error, the estimates are subject to nonsampling error. Errors are grouped into five categories: specification, coverage, response, nonresponse, and processing. For detailed discussions on the sources, control, and measurement of each of these types of error, see the technical reports.'"}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SIZE AND WEIGHTING", "text": "The total sample size initially specified for the R&D survey was approximately 22,000, and, as described above, was based primarily on compliance with predetermined sampling error constraints established for the large partition. The actual sample size was 23,541 companies which differed from the target for several reasons. First, the frame for the large partition was subjected to independent sampling. Each company in the frame had an independent chance of selection, based on its assigned probability, i.e., selection of a company was completely independent of the selection of any other company. In independent sampling, sample size itself is a random variable. Theoretically, a sample of size zero or a sample the size of the entire universe is possible, but the probabilities of these extremes are so small that these are nearly impossible situations. The actual sample size is usually quite close to the specified size. If there is too much deviation, the selection is repeated. Second, a minimum probability rule was imposed for both partitions. As noted earlier, for the large partition, probabilities of selection proportionate to size were assigned each company, where size is the reported or imputed R&D value assigned each company. Selected companies received a sample weight which was the inverse of their probability of selection. Selected companies that ultimately report R&D expenditures vastly larger than their assigned values can have adverse effects on the statistics, which are based on the weighted value of survey responses. To lessen the effects on the final statistics, the maximum weight of a company was controlled by specifying a minimum probability that could be assigned to the company. If the probability, based on company size, was less than the minimum probability, then it was reset to this minimum value. The consequence of raising these original probabilities to the minimum probability was to raise the expected sample size. Similarly, a maximum weight for each stratum was established for the simple random sampling of the small partition. If the sample size initially allocated to a stratum resulted in a stratum weight above this maximum value, then the sample size was increased until the maximum weight was achieved. It is likely that most of the difference between the size of the target sample and the sample actually selected was because of these rules. Third, a minimum sample size was established for each stratum of the small partition. If the proportionately allocated sample size fell below the minimum value for a given stratum, then the sample size was set equal to this value. Finally, between the time that the frame was created and the survey was prepared for mailing, the operational status of some companies changed. That is, they were merged with or acquired by another company, or they were no longer in business. Before preparing the survey for mailing, the operational status is updated to identify these changes. As a result, the number of companies mailed a survey form is somewhat smaller than the number of companies initially selected for the survey."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES", "text": "Two questionnaires are used each year to collect data for the survey. For large firms known to perform R&D, a detailed questionnaire, Form RD-1L, is used to collect data for odd-numbered years and an abbreviated version, Form RD-1S, is used to collect data for even-numbered years. The questionnaires are cycled in this manner to reduce reporting burden on survey respondents. The Form RD-1L requests data on sales or receipts, total employment, employment of scientists and engineers, expenditures for R&D performed within the company with Federal funds and with company and other funds, character of work (basic research, applied research, and development), company-sponsored R&D expenditures in foreign countries, R&D performed under contract by others, expenditures for pollution abatement and energy R&D, detail on R&D by product field, Federal R&D support to the firm by contracting agency, domestic R&D expenditures by State, and foreign R&D by country. The Form RD-1S requests the same information except for the last four items. Because companies receiving the Forms RD-1L and RD-1S generally have participated in previous surveys, computer imprinted data reported by the company for the previous year are supplied for reference. Companies are encouraged to revise or update this imprinted data if they have more current information. To further limit reporting burden on small R&D performers and on firms that are included in the sample for the first time, an even more abbreviated form is used each year. Form RD-1A collects data only on R&D, sales, employment, and operational status and includes a screening item that allows respondents to indicate that they do not perform R&D before completing the questionnaires. No prior-year information is available since the majority of the companies have not reported previously. For the 1994 survey, about 2,700 companies that reported $1 million or more in R&D spending in the 1993 survey or had 1,000 employees or more received Form RD-1S and nearly 20,800 received Form RD-1A.

After 60 days, follow-up letters were sent to all nonresponding firms. Three additional follow-up mailings were made to persistent nonrespondents, after 90, 120, and 150 days. In addition to the mailings, telephone follow-up was used to encourage response from those firms ranked among the 300 largest R&D performers, based on total R&D expenditures reported in the previous survey.

During the 1990 survey cycle, NSF conducted a test of the effect of reporting on a completely voluntary basis to determine if combining both mandatory and voluntary items on one questionnaire influences response rates. For this test, the 1990 sample was divided into two panels of approximately equal size. One panel, the mandatory panel, was asked to report as usual (four mandatory items and the remainder voluntary), and the other panel was asked to report all items on a completely voluntary basis.

The general imputation procedure described above became increasingly dependent upon information imputed in prior years, thereby distancing current-year estimates from any reported information. Because of the increasing dependence on imputed data, NSF chose not to publish character-of-work estimates in 1986. Consequently, the imputation procedure used to develop these estimates was revised in 1987 for use with 1986 and later data and differs from the general imputation approach. The new method calculates the character-of-work distribution for a nonresponding firm only if that firm reported a distribution within a fiveyear period, extending from two years before to two years after the year requiring imputation. Imputation for a given year is initially performed in the year the 91 data are collected and is based on a character-of-work distribution reported in either of the two previous years, if any. It is again performed using new data collected in the next two years. Thus, character-of-work estimates are revised as newly reported information becomes available and are not final for two years following their initial publication. If no reported data are available for a firm, character-of-work estimates are not imputed. As a consequence, only a portion of the total estimated R&D expenditures are distributed at the firm level. Those expenditures not meeting the requirements of the new imputation methodology are placed in a \"not distributed\" category. Tables B-6, B-7, and B-8 show the character-of-work estimates along with the \"not distributed\" component for 1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively. NSF's objective in conducting the survey has always been to provide estimates for the entire population of firms performing R&D in the United States. However, the revised imputation procedure would no longer produce such estimates because of the \"not distributed\" component. So, a baseline estimation method was developed to allocate the \"not distributed\" amounts among the character-of-work components. In the baseline estimation method, the \"not distributed\" expenditures are allocated by industry group to basic research, applied research, and development categories, using the percentage splits in the distributed category for that industry. The allocation is done at the lowest level of published industry detail only; higher levels are derived by aggregation (just as national totals are derived by aggregation of individual industry estimates) and result in higher performance shares for basic and applied research and lower estimates for development's share than would have been calculated using the previous method.'

By redefining the frame, the sample reflects current distributions of companies by size and industry. During this process, a company may move from one industry into another because of several factors: changes in a company's payroll composition, which is used to determine the industry classification code (see discussion above under \"Frame Creation\"), changes in the industry classification system itself, or changes in the way the industry classification code is assigned or revised during survey processing. A company's payroll composition changes because of a number of events. Among them are (1) the growth or decline of product or service lines; (2) the merger of two or more companies; (3) the acquisition of one company by another; (4) divestitures; or (5) the formation of conglomerates. Since the introduction of annual sampling in 1992, although unlikely, a company's data can be reclassified yearly.

Beginning with the 1992 survey, NSF decided to (1) draw new samples with broader coverage annually and (2) increase the sample size to approximately 23,000 firms.15 As a result of the sample redesign, for 1992, the reported nonmanufacturing share was estimated to be 25 percent of total R&D."}, {"section_title": "TIME SERIES ANALYSES", "text": "As discussed earlier, the statistics resulting from the survey are better indicators of changes in, rather than absolute levels of, R&D spending and personnel.

The estimates from the new panel are treated as superior primarily because the new panel is based on updated classifications [the industry classifications in the prior panel are frozen] and is more fully representative of the current universe (the prior panel suffers from panel deterioration, especially a lack of birth *dating). The limitations in the prior panel caused by these factors are naturally assumed to increase with time, so that in the revised series, we desire a gradual increase in the level or revision over time which culminates in the real difference observed between the two independent sample estimates of the prior year. At the same time, we desire that See U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Survey Design of the Survey of Industrial Research and Development: A Historical Perspective (Washington, DC, 1995). 19 The process was dubbed wedging because of the wedgelike area produced on a graph that compares originally reported statistics with the revised statistics that result after linking. 20 Bureau of the Census technical memorandum, Wedging Considerations for the 1992 Research and Development (R&D) Survey, June 10, 1994. the annual movement of the original series be preserved to the degree possible in the revised series.

However, summaries of some of the major revisions are included in the technical paper cited below.2' COMPARISONS TO OTHER STATISTICAL"}, {"section_title": "SERIES", "text": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) collects data on federally financed R&D from both Federal funding agencies and performers of the work (industry, 21 U.S. Department of Commerce, Burear of the Census, Survey Design of the Survey of Industrial Research and Development: A Historical Perspective (Washington, DC, 1995). 22 See also NSF, Federal Funds for Research and Development: Fiscal Years 1994-96, NSF 97-302 (Arlington, VA, 1997). Federal labs, universities, and other nonprofit organ izations). As reported by Federal agencies, NSF publishes data on Federal R&D budget authority and outlays, in addition to Federal obligations. These terms are defined below:22 Budget authority is the primary source of legal authorizationto enter into financial obligationsthat will result in outlays. Budget authority most commonly is granted in the form of appropriations laws enacted by Congress with the approval of the President.\" Obligations represent the amounts for orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, regardless of when the funds were appropriated or when future payment of money is required. Outlays represent the amounts for checks issued and cash payments made during a given period, regardless of when the funds were appropriated or obligated. For the reasons cited above, national R&D expenditure totals in NSF's National Patterns of R&D Resources report series are constructed primarily based on data reported by performers and include estimates of Federal R&D funding to these sectors. But until performer-reported survey data on Federal R&D expenditures are available from industry and academia, data collected from the Federal agency funders of R&D are used to project R&D performance. When survey data from the performers subsequently are tabulated (as they are in this report), these statistics replace the projections based on funder expectations. Historically, the two survey systems have tracked fairly closely. For example, in 1980 performers reported using $29.5 billion in Federal R&D funding, and Federal agencies reported total R&D funding between $29.2 billion in outlays and $29.8 billion in obligations.24 In recent years, however, the two series have diverged considerably. For 1994, performers reported $60.2 billion in Federal R&D support, compared with the $66.2 billion to $68.3 billion reported by Federal agencies.\" The difference in the Federal R&D totals appears to be concentrated in funding of industry (primarily 23 See NSF, Federal R&D Funding by Budget Function: Fiscal Years 1994-96 (Budget Function), NSF 95-342 (Arlington, VA, 1995). 24 NSF, National Patterns of R &D Resources: 1996, NSF 96-333 (Arlington, VA, 1996."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "Ibid. 26 Ibid."}, {"section_title": "173", "text": "aircraft and missile firms) by the Department of Defense. Overall, industrial firms have reported significant declines in Federal R&D support since 1990 (see Table A-1), while Federal agencies reported level or slightly increased funding of industrial R&D. For 1994, Federal agencies reported $31.7 billion in total R&D obligations provided to industrial performers, compared with an estimated $22.5 billion in Federal R&D funding reported by industrial performers.26 NSF is examining the causal factors of these divergent trends."}, {"section_title": "'174 SURVEY DEFINITIONS COST PER R&D SCIENTIST OR ENGINEER", "text": "The arithmetic mean of the numbers of full-time equivalent (FTE) scientists and engineers engaged in the performance of R&D reported for January in two consecutive years divided into the total R&D expenditures of the earlier year, with the ratio attributed to the earlier year.

Because R&D expenditures are concentrated in relatively few companies, a completed response is needed from each surveyed firm there is no good substitute for the information that you can provide. Your company can be assured of complete confidentiality. Survey data will be released only in aggregate form so that responses of individual companies cannot be identified. We have enclosed your company's report form and instructions for the 1994 \"Survey of Industrial Research and Development.\" Please review the instructions, complete the form, and return it within 60 days. Federal law requires your responses to four items identified on the form. Your voluntary responses to all other items are needed to assure useful results. This survey can help your business and trade association plan new products and markets, and assist public officials in research funding and tax decisions that affect your industry. We also ask that you keep track of the total time it takes to complete the survey form and the percent used for: (1) reading the instruction manual, (2) collecting the necessary information, and (3) completing the survey form. Please enter this information in the remarks section on the back of the report form. Information you report should cover all your company's domestic operations for calendar year 1994. We recognize that providing this information is a burden and we have worked hard to minimize it. For example, if you do not have book records for any item, you may provide carefully prepared estimates. The law that authorizes this survey (Title 13, United States Code) requires that we keep your report in full confidence. Only sworn Census Bureau employees will see your information and they will use it only for statistical purposes. We conduct this survey with National Science Foundation (NSF) support. We have enclosed a letter from the 'Director of the NSF emphasizing the importance and usefulness of the survey. NOTICE -Your report to the Census Bureau is confidential by law (Title 13, U.S. Code). It may be seen only by sworn Census employees and may be used only for statistical purposes. The law also provides that copies retained in your files are immune from legal process.  If you acquired or disposed of a unit performing an important amount of R&D during the 2-year period, please identify the unit in \"Remarks,\" and give the total amount of R&D accounted for by such unit. Item 5 NUMBER OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS Includes all persons engaged in scientific or engineering work at a level which requires a knowledge of physical or life sciences, engineering, or mathematics equivalent to completion of a 4-year college course of study with a major in these fields, regardless of whether or not they actually hold a degree in this field. Report the full-time equivalent number of R&D scientists and engineers on the rolls in January 1995. For employees whose activities are not solely devoted to research and development, report the proportion of their time that is devoted to research and development. (See instructions for examples) 2. Apply existing knowledge to problems involved in the creation of a new product or process, including work required to evaluate possible uses. 3. Apply existing knowledge to problems involved in the improvement of a present product or process. Research and development includes the activities described above whether assigned to separate R&D organizational units of the company or carried out by company laboratories and technical groups not part of an R&D organization. Reporting the R&D activities of such latter groups may require the use of estimates for some of the questions. Activities to be excluded from R&D: Research in social sciences or psychology Routine product testing Geological and geophysical exploration activities Technical services such as: Quality and quantity control Technical plant sanitation control Trouble-shooting in connection with breakdowns in full-scale production Advertising programs to promote or demonstrate new products or processes Assistance in preparation of speeches and publications for persons not engaged in research and development. Social Science R&D Social Science R&D is defined to encompass those activities devoted to further understanding the behavior of groups of human beings or of individuals as members of groups. Some of the topics include the following: Wages, salaries, and related costs Materials and supplies consumed R&D depreciation Cost of computer software used in R&D activities Total charges for work done on contract, including profit Utilities, such as telephone, telex, electricity, wate and gas Travel costs and professional dues Property taxes and other taxes'(except income taxes) incurred on account of the R&D organization or the facilities they use Insurance expenses Maintenance and repair, including maintenance of buildings and grounds Company overhead including: personnel, accounting, procurement and inventory, and salaries of research executives not on the payroll of the R&D organization Exclude as cost: R&D performed abroad (outside the Continental U.S.), such as in Canada and Puerto Rico (Except in Item 3.C.) R&D performed by non-company R&D organizations of any kind (Except in Item 3.B.) Capital expenditures Patent expense Income taxes and interest The portion of company-held R&D contracts that were subcontracted outside the reporting company Fellowships, grants, and gifts to promote R&D or the study of science and engineering Social Science R&D Item 4 -COMPANY AND OTHER FUNDS, EXCEPT FEDERAL, FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERFORMED WITHIN THE COMPANY BUDGETED FOR THE YEAR 1994 Report the estimated cost of company and other non-federally sponsored R&D that will be performed within the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

Item 5 -NUMBER OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS Scientists and engineers are defined for this survey as all persons engaged in scientific or engineering work at a level which requires a knowledge of physical or life sciences or engineering or mathematics equivalent to completion of a 4-year college course with a major in these fields, regardless of whether or not they actually hold a degree in this field. The figure on R&D scientists and engineers will be obtained primarily from two sources: 1. For company laboratories performing only R&D, report the number of scientists and engineers on the rolls in January. 2. For employees whose activities are not solely devoted to R&D, report the proportion of their time that is devoted to R&D. For example, if a company had the full-time equivalent of 60 scientists and engineers in January 1995 and one-fourth of their time was charged to R&D projects, the figure for the number of R&D scientists and engineers for this,company would Item 6B -New Owner or Operator Report the date the company was acquired and the new owner's name and address information."}, {"section_title": "CHECK ITEM", "text": "Mark \"Yes\" or \"No\" as appropriate for each of the checks in this item.
