While the presence of both is required for a pathological diagnosis of AD, the exact interaction is still debated.\nA\u03b2 has a central role in AD: by definition, plaques are necessary but not sufficient for a diagnosis of AD [2] . NFTs are also required for a diagnosis [1] . However, NFT aggregation increases with age almost universally, but can occasionally be found in healthy individuals under 30 years [3, 4] . Thus, isolated medial temporal tauopathy is not sufficient to cause AD [4] . This suggests that while A\u03b2 plaques and tau tangles are both required to cause AD, neither is sufficient by itself.\nPET imaging allows us to evaluate both these processes. 18 F-flutemetamol and 18 F-florbetapir are amyloid tracers, while 18 F-AV1451 has nanomolar affinity for paired helical filamenttau [5] . PET also enables us to correlate these processes at a voxel level using biological parametric mapping (BPM) analysis in SPM [6] .\nWe hypothesised that tau aggregation would correlate at voxel level with amyloid levels in the isocortex, and that tau aggregation in the medial temporal lobe structures would correlate with amyloid in the isocortex. We further hypothesised that there will be local correlation between tau and amyloid in different cortical regions."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations and Patient Consents", "text": "Ethical approval was obtained from local and national ethics committees (The Riverside\nResearch Ethics Committee -National Health Research Services, Health Research Authority, 6 UK.)

We found highly significant clusters of positive correlations throughout the cortex in both MCI and AD. Z-scores and r correlation coefficients were higher in the MCI group than the AD group, which may be due to the plateauing of amyloid deposition at the MCI stage, while NFT aggregation continues to intensify as the disease progresses [2, 12, 13] . At a regional level, we did not find correlations either locally or in cortical projections in the MCI group. In the AD group, there were correlations in the amygdala only. This was an unexpected finding, and possibly reflects the heterogeneity of the disease process, particularly at the MCI stage. Our groups may have been underpowered to detect the differences in the processes and correlations. Finally, it is possible that the regions that we were analysing were too large to detect voxel level processes.\nOur findings are in line with histopathological findings of AD brains showing that amyloid and tau coexist within neurons in AD [14] consistent with the voxel-level correlations seen in our study. It is possible that the two processes occur independently, but in close proximity to each other, as tau propagation both locally and across the cortex can occur independently of amyloid. [15] There is evidence, however, that the processes act synergistically in driving disease progression. Tau transgenic (rThTauEC) mice (which overexpress tau in the medial temporal lobe) crossed with amyloid transgenic mice (APP/PS1) show a significantly higher tau load with propagation throughout the cortex when cortical A\u03b2 is present [16] . Injecting brain extracts from amyloid transgenic mice into tau transgenic mice results in spreading of tau from the hippocampus to projection at more distant sites. In human neural cell cultures, inhibition of A\u03b2 formation reduces tauopathy [17] further implicating amyloid in inducing tau aggregation. The voxel level correlations, suggesting local aggregation, may also point to local toxicity between the two processes. In vitro studies have shown that A\u03b2 induces tau fibrillisation by cross-seeding, and enhances existing tau aggregation. The possibility of this process occurring across specific networks could explain the spatial discordance between these two pathologies [18] , networks involving the hippocampus providing a transport mechanism for tau while those involving the cingulate transport A\u03b2 aggregates.\nSimilarly, tau can promote amyloid pathology. The presence of tau aggregates can enhance A\u03b2 toxicity [19] , which in turn exerts its toxicity by neuronal projections. Injecting phosphorylated tau from AD brains into transgenic AD mice (3xTg; mutations to APP, Presenilin 1 and MAPT 1) not only induced tau aggregation and propagation, but also increased amyloid plaque load (compared with injection of saline). [20] The same group found that passive immunisation of monoclonal antibodies to tau into AD transgenic mice not only decreased total tau and phosphorylated tau, but also decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels and amyloid plaque. [21] This suggests that passive immunisation to tau could target both pathologies, thus breaking the disease cycle and halting disease progression.\nIn humans, it is suggested that isocortical amyloid may be required to induce slow developing medial temporal lobe NFTs to become rapidly spreading toxic NFT aggregates in the isocortex [22, 23] . Thus, while the processes can appear to be spatially discordant, there may be multiple neuronal projections connecting these 'discordant' areas. For example, corticocortical evoked potential studies in humans have revealed connections between the hippocampus and temporal lobe structures; the parahippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex; and between the amygdala and the temporal, frontal, inferior parietal, cingulate, and insula [24] . Evoked intracranial EEG responses in humans have suggested multiple connections between lobes -with a high frequency of connections within the temporal and frontal lobes [25] .\nIt is likely that while these processes can occur independently, they also act synergistically and have been described as a 'toxic pas de deux'. [26] "}, {"section_title": "Study strengths and limitations", "text": "A strength of this study was that our individuals with MCI and AD were well characterised and showed amyloid positivity on PET. This allowed us to evaluate tau aggregation in homogenous groups of individuals. Additionally, interrogation for both regional and voxellevel correlations revealed the full extent of spatial associations between the two processes.\nA limitation of the study was the inclusion of small numbers of individuals in each disease group, so caution needs to be applied when we generalise our results to the MCI and AD populations. Additionally, the inclusion of both tau positive and tau negative MCI individuals in the correlation analysis introduces the possibility of false positive results arising from null data points. If we had larger numbers we would have performed separate correlation analyses for tau-positive and all patients, respectively. However, we felt that it was important to include all individuals in this case, as tau deposition is a continuous process in the AD trajectory.\nAnother consideration is the reported off-target binding of 18 F-AV1451 described in the choroid plexus, basal ganglia, retinal tissue and melanin containing cells [27] [28] [29] so our results should be interpreted with caution. However, the use of individualised Z-maps reduces this problem. While our findings are in line with previous histopathological studies [14] , ideally our findings should be confirmed with autoradiographic studies. Additionally, detection of correlated tracer binding is influenced by the sensitivity of PET radioligands and is liable to false negatives [30] . Amyloid PET imaging can only confidently detect amyloid plaques at Thal stage 3 or higher when the load is moderate or severe and consistently misses Thal stages 1 and 2. Individuals who are labelled as amyloid negative PART (Primary-age related tauopathy) based on PET imaging may have A\u03b2 that is below the threshold for detection [30] .\nAlternatively, they may enter an amyloidogenic pathway after NFTs aggregate in the medial temporal lobes [31, 32] . Another consideration is our chosen cut-offs for amyloid and tau positivity, based on previous models by Jack et al. [11] Amyloid and tau deposition are continuous processes. In particular, tau deposition increases in the medial temporal lobes in normal ageing, and thresholds for biomarker positivity are still debated. Thus, positivity depends on the threshold used. Additionally, both amyloid and tau can be present in healthy controls. [33, 34] . In view of the limited numbers and the older age of the cohort, we did not differentiate between preclinical AD stages 0, 1 and 2 when creating Z-scores for our disease groups. If we had only used individuals with preclinical AD stage 0, higher levels of tracer uptake in the MCI and AD group would be likely.\nAdditionally, we included a subset of 18 F-AV1451 scans for healthy controls recruited from the ADNI database. These individuals had amyloid scans, but using a different tracer from our centre ( 18 F-florbetapir, compared to 18 F-flutemetamol) so direct comparison of amyloid was not possible. Additionally, the 18 F-AV1451 scans were performed on different scanners, increasing the possibility of introducing variability into the cohort.\nHere we report for the first time that correlations between amyloid and tau are stronger in MCI compared with AD. This is consistent with the fact that both pathologies are increasing in MCI but then amyloid deposition plateaus, while NFT aggregation continues to progress with the clinical course. However, a longitudinal study would allow us to better establish the temporal relationship between these processes, and the sequence of events."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this PET study of MCI and AD subjects, we found that amyloid deposition and tau aggregation were significantly correlated at a voxel level across association cortex, in both MCI and AD. Our findings reinforce the view that the two pathological processes are synergistic when contributing to AD. The strong correlations in the MCI group may suggest that both these pathological processes are still evolving in the MCI stage. Any future therapeutic strategy may need to target both of these pathologies. "}, {"section_title": "Tables", "text": ""}]
