[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 initially spread widely in China, then in Italy, and has since been reported worldwide [1,2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 [3]. Although SARS-CoV-2 has gained attention as a consequence of the global COVID-19 pandemic, other known human coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS, OC43, HKU1) and alphacoronaviruses (229E, NL63), have resulted in severe respiratory syndrome in patients and been of public health concern [4]. To combat COVID-19, an urgent solution is needed for the detection and therapeutic treatment of this disease, which requires a comprehensive experimental investigation of relevant biomedical entities (eg, genes, noncoding ribonucleic acids [ncRNA], viruses, drugs) [5]. However, this is a relatively slow process due to the inherent nature of experimental validation. As an alternative, faster in silico methods can be applied [6,7], which can act as a filter prior to wet lab validation. Virtual screening, molecular docking, and other in silico methods have already been investigated to discover drugs that may work against COVID-19 [8]. Still, this is a daunting task due to the large number of possible combinations of biomedical entities (eg, drug-gene pairs) that need to be examined [9]. To enable comprehensive exploration of potential therapeutic treatments, knowledge base solutions are proposed; these would allow the scientific community to focus on a relatively smaller number of potential biomedical entities that may lead to the discovery of a novel treatment for COVID-19.\nDatabases that focus on virus-related diseases for multiple hosts already exist. For example, in ViRBase [10], the authors highlighted the association between ncRNAs and viruses in 20 hosts. The VISDB database, based on literature mining, integrated the virus interaction site in humans for five DNA oncoviruses and four RNA retroviruses [11]. Virus Pathogen Resources (VIPR) developed a portal that collected a comprehensive set of information related to coronavirus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as other viruses [12,13]. However, none of the abovementioned databases are particularly useful for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, as those databases were not specific to the novel coronavirus, or they provided very limited information about the associated genes, or they did not include other factors involved in coronavirus-related diseases, drugs, and drug side effects. Moreover, there is no one knowledge base that has integrated all biomedical entities specific to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. To address this gap, we explored the potential of machine intelligence to automatically mine the scientific literature, with the goal of developing the first comprehensive knowledge base that integrates several biomedical entities associated with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this, we leveraged state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithms, sentiment analysis, and deep learning\u2013based techniques and applied them to a large corpus of coronavirus-related scientific literature."}, {"section_title": "Data Sets ::: Methods", "text": "For this study, we used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) [14], generated by the Allen Institute for AI.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the disease-drug pairs, we used both a pretrained model (TextBlob) and an unsupervised model (developed by the authors using the Word2Vec model and K-means clustering) to determine the sentiment scores of the sentences extracted for each pair. We further used these sentiment scores along with the minimum distance between the disease and drug term in the corresponding sentences as input features of our neural network model, which we used for the final classification of the disease-drug pairs (as positive or negative). To determine the confidence level of the extracted disease-gene associations, we transformed each disease and gene of a pair into two separate vectors using the Word2Vec model and calculated their cosine similarity. We used the known disease-gene associations from the DisGeNET database as the gold standard to determine the confidence level of the new associations on the basis of cosine similarity measures.

Figure 1 shows the workflow of extracting disease-drug interactions and predicting the effectiveness of drugs against diseases with confidence scores."}, {"section_title": "Disease and Drug Name Extraction ::: Methods", "text": "To extract relevant disease-drug pairs from the CORD-19 literature, we employed a dictionary-based approach to detect mentions of diseases and drugs in the literature. We used Disease Ontology [18] and DrugBank [19] to prepare the disease and drug dictionaries. We leveraged the Aho-Corasick algorithm [21] to search the drug and disease names, considering the large size of the drug and disease dictionaries and the corpus itself. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that efficiently locates multiple patterns in a large amount of text. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n + m + z), where n is the length of the text, m is the total length of all the patterns to be searched, and z is the total number of occurrences of the patterns in the text."}, {"section_title": "Disease-Drug Pairs Extraction ::: Methods", "text": "After extracting the disease and drug names separately, we wanted to mine the literature and identify the sentences that contain the disease and drug pairs to semantically evaluate their interactions. For this purpose, we searched for every disease-drug pair from our disease and drug list in the CORD-19 literature and collected every sentence where a co-occurrence was found. We then created a document for every disease-drug pair, combining all extracted sentences. Thus, we built a disease-drug pair to document mapping. We did not use a pattern-based approach here (as was done previously in [22]) as this could result in missing some sentences containing disease-drug pairs."}, {"section_title": "Anomaly Removal ::: Methods", "text": "As we automatically extracted the sentences containing the disease-drug pairs, there was a possibility of errors in our extracted data; therefore, we decided to check and remove any abnormalities from our collected data before moving on to the next stage of the pipeline. We used unsupervised anomaly detection [23] for this task. Unsupervised anomaly detection detects anomalies in an unlabeled data set by looking for instances that seem to fit the remainder of the data set the least, under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are \u201cnormal.\u201d We used the K-means clustering algorithm [24], as it has been used for anomaly detection in several studies [25-29]. We proceeded as follows. First, we used Doc2Vec [30] to create a numeric representation of each document associated with each disease-drug pair. We then fitted these representations into our K-means model and observed two clear clusters of easily discriminable sizes, where the smaller one consisted of only 189 instances. As we know that anomalies differ from the normal instances significantly and occur very rarely in the data, we could assume that the instances of the smaller cluster were indeed anomalies. We also checked a number of instances manually to verify our assumption. We discarded these 189 instances from any further consideration."}, {"section_title": "Overview ::: Sentiment Analysis ::: Methods", "text": "We applied sentiment analysis to automatically assess the effectiveness of a drug to treat a particular disease in the context of each extracted drug-disease pair. First, we applied the concept of transfer learning. We used TextBlob [31], which is a pretrained sentiment analysis tool provided as a Python library. However, it showed some inconsistency in some cases as expected from a pretrained model and we felt it necessary to perform unsupervised sentiment analysis, which is the second model in our pipeline. We obtained a polarity score from the TextBlob model and a sentiment rate from our unsupervised model for each disease-drug pair, which were subsequently fed to our neural network model to predict the final label."}, {"section_title": "TextBlob Model ::: Sentiment Analysis ::: Methods", "text": "TextBlob is a Python library that is widely used in natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, and translation.

We recorded the polarity scores for each disease-drug pair to use it as a feature for our neural network model."}, {"section_title": "Unsupervised Model ::: Sentiment Analysis ::: Methods", "text": "We used the concept of K-means clustering again for unsupervised sentiment analysis. First, we trained the Word2Vec [32] model with our mined literature and got a vector representation of every word. We then ran K-means clustering on the estimated word vectors and found two clusters (positive and negative). The positive cluster was decided on the basis of the presence of several positive words (in the context of a disease-drug pair), including \u201ccure,\u201d \u201cpreclude,\u201d \u201cinhibit,\u201d \u201cprescribe,\u201d \u201creduce,\u201d and \u201cmodest.\u201d On the other hand, the negative cluster contained words like \u201crisky,\u201d \u201ckill,\u201d and \u201cdanger.\u201d We then assigned each word a sentiment value, either +1 or \u20131, based on the cluster (positive or negative) they belong to. We weighed this value by dividing it by the distance between the word and the centroid of its cluster to describe the extent of its potential positiveness or negativeness. We then calculated the term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (tf\u2013idf) score [33,34] of each word in the sentence collection to consider the significance of the unique words. Next, we built a tf\u2013idf representation, T, for each disease-drug pair by replacing each word of the corresponding sentences with its tf\u2013idf score and a sentiment value representation, S, by replacing each word with its sentiment value. Finally, we took their dot product (T\u25aaS) as the final sentiment rate of our unsupervised model."}, {"section_title": "Overview ::: Neural Network Model for Automatic Labeling and Confidence Score ::: Methods", "text": "We used a deep neural network (DNN) model to automatically predict the label and confidence score for our disease-drug pairs.

The transfer functions of the first and second hidden layers were the rectified linear unit (ReLU) [37] and hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) [38], respectively. The transfer function of the output layer was a sigmoid function [39]. We trained the DNN model using Xavier initialization [40], which tries to make the variance of the outputs of a layer equal to the variance of its inputs. We used Adam optimizer [41] and the maximum training epoch was set to 500. We split our labeled data into training and test sets on an 80:20 ratio.

We extracted gene names along with miRNAs from the CORD-19 literature in a dictionary-based approach using HGNC [15] and miRBase [17]. We then extracted their associations with diseases in a similar process to the one we had used to extract the disease-drug pairs and collected all the abstracts where a co-occurrence was found. Next, we applied the concept of cosine similarity [42] to confidently infer the associations. We transformed each disease into vector V1, each gene (and miRNA) into vector V2, and then calculated the cosine similarity of V1 and V2 for each pair. To create the vector representations, we trained a Word2Vec model with all the collected abstracts. We used the DisGeNET [43] database as the gold standard to evaluate the performance of cosine similarity in predicting the gene-disease linkage. First, we calculated the maximum, average, and minimum cosine similarity of the pairs that were common both in our findings and in the DisGeNET database. We found that 99.7% of the newly discovered pairs lie within this range (determined from DisGeNET) in terms of cosine similarity. We further classified the associations into three classes (high, medium, and low) in terms of confidence as follows: pairs having cosine similarity closest to the maximum (minimum) of the known ones were considered as high (low) confidence associations, and the remaining ones (those closest to the average) as medium confidence associations.

CRP is a known clinical biomarker for SARS [44] and the level of CRP increases significantly in patients with SARS. The level of CRP was also higher for patients with COVID-19 in some clinical cases [45,46]. More than 25 papers (from the CORD-19 data set) related to the association between CRP and COVID-19 were identified through our computational workflow. Furthermore, the genes ELANE, AZU1, MPO, PRTN3, CTSG, and TCN1 were shown to be significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 [47], and our automatically prepared knowledge base highlights all of them as associated with COVID-19 with \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201clow\u201d confidence. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection [48]; in fact, SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into host cells [49,50]. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the ACE2 receptor and the protease TMPRSS2 mediates the infection process [51]. It is important to note that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not directly listed in DisGeNET as genes associated with COVID-19. In spite of that, our data-driven approach based on a gold-standard data set from DisGeNET was able to infer the association of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with COVID-19 with \u201cmedium\u201d confidence, which suggests that our approach is efficacious. Analyzing the complete ACE2 interaction network, Wicik et al [52] listed several element genes (ACE2, ANPEP, DPP4, CCL2, MEPIA, TFRC, ADAM17, NPC1, FABP2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M) and all of these genes were identified as COVID-19\u2013associated in our automatically prepared knowledge base.

Our computational workflow also discovered the effectiveness of this drug against pneumonia, respiratory failure, and diarrhea, which are strongly correlated to COVID-19 [53,54]. Thus, further exploration of this drug to fight COVID-19 is likely to be fruitful.

Notably, remdesivir is an antiviral drug originally developed for Ebola treatment [60,61]. A recent clinical trial conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) showed that remdesivir helped patients with COVID-19 recover faster and improved their survival rates. Adult patients treated with remdesivir were found to recover 4 days faster, an improvement of 31% compared to other patients; in addition, the overall death rate dropped from 11.6% to 8% [62]. Remdesivir is now under consideration for use against COVID-19 in more than ten clinical trials [63]. We found 6LU7 was one of the PDB entries for remdesivir.

Additionally, it also revealed that this drug has 111 side effects including anemia, hemorrhage, liver disorder, hepatitis fulminant, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac failure, which makes it a risky option, especially for patients with heart and liver complications.

Statins are also well known for their anti\u2010inflammatory effects [69] and some studies have supported the use of these drugs as part of a COVID\u201019 treatment protocol [70]. Multiple clinical trials (eg, NCT04343001, NCT04380402) have been launched to determine the efficacy of statins against COVID-19 [71,72]. In our knowledge base, the majority of statin classes were shown to be effective against COVID-19. For example, ulinastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin were labeled as positive (ie, effective) drugs against COVID-19 with 94.04%, 79.38%, 78.88%, and 70.75% confidence scores, respectively. Through our automated computational workflow, we found only one mention of atorvastatin in the literature [73]. In that single article, Deliwala et al [73] mentioned atorvastatin as part of a prevention plan against cortical stroke for a 31-year-old female patient with COVID-19, without referring to the effectiveness of atorvastatin against COVID-19. Consequently, our knowledge base labeled atorvastatin with a negative sentiment and a rather low confidence score (61.22%) for COVID-19. We anticipate that as the number of articles related to atorvastatin use in COVID-19 treatment protocols increases, our model will be able to effectively infer the sentiment (effective versus ineffective) of this drug. Based on our finding, it is safe to state that statins, as low-cost and well-tolerated drugs, should be investigated in more detail in clinical trials; such drugs may help low- and middle-income countries in particular, where expensive drugs might not be affordable."}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings ::: Discussion", "text": "In our knowledge base, through a computational workflow, we not only extracted the drugs and other biomedical terms that are mentioned in the literature, but also identified \u201cterm pairs\u201d based on their co-occurrence, which will allow the scientific community to investigate in depth the associations between term pairs like disease-gene and disease-drug. Many drugs were associated with COVID-19, representing the cumulative effort of the scientific community to repurpose existing drugs rather than pursue novel drug discoveries, which is a rational approach in a pandemic situation [74]. We leveraged an automated approach to highlight the effectiveness of drugs against the disease based on sentiment analysis of the text in the literature. Through this literature mining, we found dexamethasone, ivermectin, remdesivir, and others in the list of potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment. We highlighted hydroxychloroquine as an ineffective drug against COVID-19. We extracted disease-gene associations from the literature and, based on cosine similarity against the gold-standard DisGeNET data set, provided a confidence level for the associations between diseases and genes. We found 194 drug-PDB associations, which highlighted the large amount of work performed by the scientific community to understand the mechanism behind drug-target interactions and virus-host protein interaction mechanisms for coronavirus-related diseases. Surprisingly, we found few miRNAs related to COVID-19, indicating the primary focus of the scientific community is toward protein-based drugs rather than RNA-based drugs, though there have been successful RNA-based antiviral drugs. One such drug is Miravirsen, which binds miR-122 to prevent it from hybridizing with the RNA genome of HCV, depriving HCV of its essential cellular cofactor and blocking HCV replication [75].

From the beginning of this outbreak, the scientific community has invested large amounts of effort to create vaccines and identify therapeutic solutions. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 might come too late to have any effect on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [77]. However, vaccines might be useful in subsequent waves of COVID-19 or in a postpandemic scenario in which COVID-19 becomes a seasonal virus [77]. In this scenario, the identification of drugs with good efficacy and minimal side effects is a rational goal that can be achieved in the near future to combat SARS-CoV-2 [48]. Although promising pharmacological results with repurposed drugs are emerging every day, unfortunately, no drug has been approved thus far for the treatment of COVID-19. Repurposed drugs are under investigation worldwide, many in preclinical and clinical stages [78]. With increasing information about SARS-CoV-2, along with publications about similar respiratory diseases (eg, pneumonia, SARS), it will be essential to investigate existing drugs that are already known to be effective against other respiratory diseases. As a prime example, dexamethasone, an FDA-approved drug, was known to be effective against pneumonia [79], respiratory failure [80], and other diseases. However, there was no evidence of its effectiveness against COVID-19 until its recent breakthrough in a clinical trial [55]. Although final approval of the drug is still pending, had it been investigated earlier, more lives could have been saved.\nThe research in this study is expected to support the scientific community and decision makers in identifying candidate drugs with proper evidence from the scientific literature. This will also help stakeholders explore existing drugs that are already known to be effective against other respiratory diseases. Although careful manual curation of the identified associations of biomedical entities is the ultimate goal, our novel approach estimates the effectiveness of drugs for coronavirus-related diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning to help the scientific community shorten the potential list of drugs, ultimately saving time and resources."}, {"section_title": "Tool and Availability ::: Discussion", "text": "We made our computational workflow and the resulting database an open source tool named COVID-19Base for use by the scientific community [81,82].
