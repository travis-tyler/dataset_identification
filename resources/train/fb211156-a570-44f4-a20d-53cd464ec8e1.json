[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Texas Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) is the product of a wastewater treatment facility planning process developed and updated in accordance with provisions of Sections 205(j), 208, and 303 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended. The WQMP is an important part of the State's program for accomplishing its clean water goals. 1 The Texas Department of Water Resources, a predecessor agency of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), prepared the initial WQMP for waste treatment management during the late 1970s. The Clean Water Act mandates that the WQMP be updated as needed to fill information gaps and revise earlier certified and approved plans. Any updates to the plan need involve only the elements of the plan that require modification. The original plan and its subsequent updates are collectively referred to as the State of Texas Water Quality Management Plan. The WQMP is tied to the State's water quality assessments that identify priority water quality problems. The WQMPs are used to direct planning for implementation measures that control and/or prevent water quality problems. Several elements may be contained in the WQMP, such as effluent limitations of wastewater facilities, total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), nonpoint source management controls, identification of designated management agencies, and ground water and source water protection planning. Some of these elements may be contained in separate documents which are prepared independently of the current WQMP update process, but may be referenced as needed to address planning for water quality control measures. This document, as with previous updates 2 , will become part of the WQMP after completion of its public participation process, certification by the TCEQ and approval by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The materials presented in this document revise only the information specifically addressed in the following sections. Previously certified and approved water quality management plans remain in effect. The October 2018 WQMP update addresses the following topics: 1. Projected Effluent Limits Updates for water quality planning purposes 2. Service Area Population for Municipal Wastewater Facilities 3. Designation of Management Agencies for Municipal Wastewater Facilities 4. Total Maximum Daily Load Update 1 A formal definition for a water quality management plan is found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 130.2(k). 2 Fiscal Years 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984/85, 1986/88, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993/94, 1995, 1996, 1997/98, 02/1999, 05/1999, 07/1999, 10/1999, 01/2000, 04/2000, 07/2000, 10/2000, 01/2001, 04/2001, 07/2001, 10/2001, 01/2002, 04/2002, 07/2002, 10/2002, 01/2003, 04/2003, 07/2003, 10/2003, 01/2004, 04/2004, 07/2004, 10/2004, 01/2005, 04/2005, 07/2005, 10/2005, 01/2006, 04/2006, 07/2006, 10/2006, 01/2007, 04/2007, 07/2007, 10/2007, 01/2008, 04/2008, 07/2008, 10/2008, 01/2009, 04/2009, 07/2009, 10/2009, 01/2010, 04/2010, 07/2010,10/2010, 01/2011, 04/2011, 07/2011, 10/2011, BPUB 2011, 01/2012, 04/2012, 07/2012,10/2012, 01/2013, 04/2013, 07/2013,10/2013, 01/2014, 04/2014, 07/2014, 10/2014, 01/2015, 04/2015, 07/2015, 10/2015, 01/2016, 04/2016, 07/2016, 10/2016, 01/2017, 04/2017, 07/2017, 10/2017, 01/2018, 04/2018, and 07/2018. The public comment period for the October WQMP update is from November 9, 2018, through December 11, 2018. The Projected Effluent Limit Update section provides information compiled from August 1, 2018 through October 31, 2018, and is based on water quality standards, and may be used for water quality planning purposes in Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) permit actions. The Service Area Population and Designation of Management Agency sections for municipal wastewater facilities has been developed and evaluated by the TCEQ in cooperation with the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and regional water quality management planning agencies. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Update section provides information on proposed wasteload allocations for new dischargers and revisions to existing TMDLs and has been developed by the Water Quality Planning Division, TMDL Program. OCTOBER 2018 UPDATE Table 1 reflects proposed effluent limits for new dischargers and preliminary revisions to original proposed effluent limits for preexisting dischargers (MGD-Million Gallons per Day, CBOD5 -5 Day Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand, NH3-N -Ammonia-Nitrogen, BOD5 -5 Day Biochemical Oxygen Demand and DO -Dissolved Oxygen). Table 1 reflect future needs and do not reflect current permits for these facilities. These revisions may be useful for water quality management planning purposes. The effluent flows and constituent limits indicated in the table have been preliminarily determined to be appropriate to satisfy the stream standards for dissolved oxygen in their respective receiving waters. These flow volumes and effluent sets may be modified at the time of permit action. These limits are based on water quality standards (WQS) effective at the time of the TCEQ production of this update. WQS are subject to revision on a triennial basis. \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) adopted Six Total Maximum Daily Loads for Indicator Bacteria in the Armand Bayou Watershed: Segments 1113, 1113A, 1113B, 1113C, 1113D, and 1113E (TCEQ, 2015a on August 5, 2015. The total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) were approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on October 2, 2015. This document represents an addendum to the original TMDL document. This addendum includes information specific to one additional assessment unit (AU) of one segment located within the watershed of the approved TMDL project for bacteria in Armand Bayou. Concentrations of indicator bacteria in this AU exceed the criteria used to evaluate attainment of the water quality standard for contact recreation. This addendum presents the new information associated with the additional AU.

The purpose of this section is to present data reflecting facility planning needs, including previous water quality management plan needs requiring revision. Data are also presented to update other plan information for the TWDB's SRF projects. Table 2 contains the updated Service area population information. The table is organized in alphabetical order and includes the following 10 categories of information: 1. Planning Area -Area for which facility needs are proposed. The facility planning areas are subject to change during the facility planning process and any such changes will be documented in a later water quality management plan update. All planning areas listed are also designated management agencies (DMAs) unless otherwise noted in the \"Comments\" column. 2. Service Area -Area that receives the provided wastewater service. 3. Needs -A \"T\" indicates a need for either initial construction of a wastewater treatment plant, additional treatment capacity, or the upgrading of a wastewater treatment plant to meet existing or more stringent effluent requirements. A \"C\" indicates a need for improvements to, expansion of, rehabilitation of, or the initial construction of a wastewater collection system in the facility planning area. \"T/C\" indicates a need for both treatment and collection system facilities. More detailed facility planning conducted during a construction project may define additional needs and those needs will be reflected in a future update to the WQMP. A \"F\" indicates a need for flood mitigation. 4. Needs Year -The year in which the needs were identified for the planning area. 5. Basin Name -The river basin or designated planning area where the entity is located. 6. Segment -The classified stream segment or tributary into which any recommended facility may discharge existing or projected wastewater. In the case of no-discharge facilities, this is the classified stream segment drainage area in which the facilities are located. 7.

Before an entity can apply for a state revolving fund loan, it must be recommended for designation as the management agency in the approved WQMP. Designation as a management agency does not require the designated entity to provide wastewater services, but enables it to apply for grants and loans to provide the services.

The program is authorized by and created to fulfill the requirements of Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act. The goal of a TMDL is to restore the full use of a water body that has limited quality in relation to one or more of its uses. The TMDL defines an environmental target and based on that target, the State develops an implementation plan with wasteload allocations for point source dischargers to mitigate anthropogenic (human-caused) sources of pollution within the watershed and restore full use of the water body. The development of TMDLs is a process of intensive data collection and analysis. After adoption by the TCEQ, TMDLs are submitted to the EPA for review and approval. The attached appendices may reflect proposed wasteload allocations for new dischargers and revisions to TMDLs. To be consistent, updates will be provided in the same units of measure used in the original TMDL document.

Three Total Maximum Daily Loads for Indicator Bacteria in the Carters Creek Watershed For Segment Numbers 1209C, 1209D, and 1209L", "text": "TMDL Updates to the WQMP: Carters Creek Watershed (Segments 1209C, 1209D, and 1209L) The document Three Total Maximum Daily Loads for Indicator Bacteria in the Carters Creek Watershed For Segment Numbers 1209C, 1209D, and 1209L was adopted by the TCEQ on 08/22/12 and approved by EPA on 09/27/12, and became an update to the state's Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP). It has had one WQMP update prior to this one. The purpose of this update is to make the following change to the TMDL, presented in Table 1: \uf0b7 update the WLA and permittee name for one facility that has increased its permitted discharge. The changes reflected in this update resulted in the shifting of allocations between the sum of the individual WLAs and the allowance for future growth in one assessment unit (AU). This was originally presented in Table 20 in the original TMDL document, and the affected AU is included here as Table 2. In Table 21 of the original TMDL, the WLAs for permitted facilities are the sum of the individual WLAs and the allowance for future growth within each AU. Therefore, these overall numbers did not change, and Table 21 of the TMDL remains the same. The purpose of this WQMP update is to make the following change to the TMDL: \uf0b7 update the name of one facility; \uf0b7 remove two expired permits and include the permit that replaced them; \uf0b7 correct the TMDL equations for two stations to correctly reflect the facilities discharging upstream of them.  The purpose of this update is to make the following change to the TMDL, presented in Table 1: \uf0b7 include and update the WLA for one facility that has increased its permitted discharge. Note that this is a concentration-based TMDL, and therefore there are no final TMDL equations to be affected by this change. The facility presented in Table 1 was incorrectly removed in a previous WQMP update (April 2009). It is being restored in this update, with its new discharge amount. The purpose of this WQMP update is to make the following changes to the TMDL, presented in Table 1: \uf0b7 update the WLA for one facility that has increased its permitted discharge, and \uf0b7 remove a permit that was cancelled. Note that this TMDL was written for E. coli and that it used the single sample criterion of 394 cfu/100 mL. All of the permitted facilities covered by the original TMDL and subsequent WQMP updates have also been given a daily average for E. coli of 126 cfu/100 mL consistent with standard bacteria permitting practices for the state of Texas. In addition, watershed stakeholders are meeting annually to discuss water quality in Upper Oyster Creek related to this TMDL project (both instream data as well as selfreported data from permitted facilities), and may recommend stricter permit limits for E. coli in the future if deemed necessary. The changes reflected in this update resulted in the shifting of allocations between WLA Non-continuous and LA Other terms in Allocation Reach 2. This was originally presented in Table 11 in the original TMDL document, and the new allocations are updated here in Table 2. This shifting of allocations is done in such a way that the WLA Non-continuous and LA Other terms maintain the proportions presented in the April 2016 WQMP update. The purpose of this update is to make the following change to the TMDL, presented in Table 1: update the WLA for one facility that has increased its permitted discharge, and remove a permit that was cancelled."}, {"section_title": "OCTOBER 2018 UPDATE", "text": "The allocations presented in this update were verified as satisfactory using the QUAL2K model used in establishing the original TMDL. The relevant permit limits for the facility that increased its discharge are provided in Table 2.

The region's subtropical climate is caused by the \"predominant onshore flow of tropical maritime air from the Gulf of Mexico,\" while the increasing moisture content (from west to east) reflects variations in \"intermittent seasonal intrusions of continental air\" (Larkin & Bomar, 1983). Occasional anomalous climatic events, including floods and droughts, are a feature of the climate. For the period from 1981 through 2010, average annual precipitation in the project watershed was calculated to be 55.13 inches, which is slightly higher than the average annual total precipitation for the entire Armand Bayou watershed of 55.05 inches (PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University, 2012). The wettest month is June (7.1 inches), while February and March (both at 3.2 inches) are the driest months, with rainfall occurring throughout the year. Average high temperatures typically peak (93 \u00b0F) in August. During winter, the average low temperature (45 \u00b0F) generally occurs in January (Figure 3). \nThe climate of the region is subtropical humid, with very hot and humid summers and mild winters (USACE, 1985). July is the hottest month with an average high of 34.2 degrees Celsius (93.4 degrees Fahrenheit), while January is the coldest month with an average low of 7.3 degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit). Table 3 provides climate (temperature) normals (NOAA, 2010). Summer rainfall is dominated by sub-tropical convection, winter rainfall by frontal storms, and fall and spring months by combinations of these two (Burian, 2005), with an annual precipitation total of approximately 51 inches. Average annual rainfall from 2005 to 2015, based on the Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HCOEM), is summarized in Table 4. Monthly rainfall totals are fairly consistent throughout the year, with slightly more rainfall falling in July and October (approximately six and a half inches), compared to the remainder of the year (generally three to five inches). High-intensity rainfall often causes localized street flooding and occasional out-of-bank conditions. The study watershed is located near the Gulf Coast, and is potentially subject to hurricanes between June 1 and November 30 every year, although the chance of tropical weather declines dramatically in October.

A summary of the reports of SSO events that were determined to have occurred within the full Armand Bayou watershed between January 2016 and December 2017 are shown in Table 5. ; also known as a multi-sector general permits (MSGPs)), concrete production facilities (General Permit number TXG110000), petroleum bulk stations and terminals (General Permit number TXG340000), and construction sites over one acre (General Permit number TXR150000). In addition, Phase I MS4 permits are individual permits for large and medium-sized communities with populations exceeding 100,000, whereas Phase II permits are for smaller communities within a USEPA-defined urbanized area that are regulated by a general permit. Three of these permits (MS4, MSGP, and construction) pertain solely to stormwater discharges. The other two (concrete production facilities and petroleum bulk stations and terminals) also authorize the discharge of process wastewater. The area of the project watershed is covered by both Phase I and II MS4 permits; the associated permits match the jurisdictional boundaries of the regulated entities. For Phase I permits, the jurisdictional area is defined by the city limits and for Phase II permits, the jurisdictional area is defined as the intersection or overlapping areas of the city limits and the 2010 Census urbanized area. For the Armand Bayou project watershed entities with Phase I individual permits and Phase II general permits, the areas included under these MS4 permits were used to estimate the regulated stormwater areas for construction, industrial, and MS4 permits. For the project watershed, there is essentially 100 percent coverage by the urbanized area. For this reason, the urbanized area will be used as a surrogate for the area for all regulated stormwater in the project watershed. However, even in highly urbanized areas such as this one, there remain small areas that are not strictly regulated by stormwater permits and which may receive bacteria loadings from unregulated sources such as wildlife and feral hogs. To account for these small unregulated areas in each OCTOBER 2018 UPDATE impaired watershed, the surface area within the channel of the bayou is excluded from the urbanized area and represents an area of unregulated stormwater contribution. This estimation of an area subject to unregulated direct deposition results in an area regulated by MS4 of 4,561.46 acres or 99.58% of the watershed (Figure 7). A review of Phase I permits and a review of the TCEQ central registry for Phase II MS4 permit coverage in the entire Armand Bayou watershed revealed one Phase I permit and four Phase II permits (Table 6; TCEQ, 2018). For the entire Armand Bayou watershed, the total area under MS4 permits is 35,536.90 acres, or 93.91% of the watershed (Figure 7).  \nSanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) are unauthorized discharges that must be addressed by the responsible party.

Wildlife also deposit fecal bacteria onto land surfaces, where rainfall runoff may wash bacteria into nearby streams. Unfortunately, quantitative estimates of wildlife are rare, inexact, and often limited to discrete taxa groups or geographical areas of interest, so that even county-wide approximations of wildlife numbers are difficult or impossible to acquire. For feral hogs, the Texas A&M Institute of Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR), recently renamed as the Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute, reported a range of feral hog densities within Texas of 1.33 to 2.45 hogs/square mile (IRNR, 2013). The average hog density (1.89 hogs/square mile) was multiplied by the hog habitat area in the project watershed (3.74 square miles). Habitat deemed suitable for hogs followed as closely as possible to the land use selections of the IRNR study and include from the 2015 H-GAC Land Cover dataset: Forest/Shrubs, Pasture/Grasslands, Cultivated Crops, and Wetlands. Using this methodology, there are an estimated 7 feral hogs in the project watershed. For the entire Armand Bayou watershed, the hog habitat was estimated using the same methodology; there is an estimated 15.69 square miles of hog habitat within the entire watershed, resulting in an estimate of 30 feral hogs. For deer, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) publishes data showing deer population-density estimates by Deer Management Unit (DMU) for monitored white-tailed deer range across the state (TPWD, 2017). The entire Armand Bayou watershed, as well as the project watershed, is located within the Urban Houston DMU, one of the few regions for which deerdensity estimates were not published. Similarly, both the entire Armand Bayou watershed and the project watershed are not located within the monitored white-tailed deer range. While a quantitative estimate for deer within the project watershed could not readily be calculated, indications are that undeveloped areas along Armand Bayou would provide habitat suitable for a small population of deer (City of Houston, 2018).\nIndicator bacteria inhabit the intestines of all warm-blooded animals, including wildlife such as mammals and birds.

It outlines an adaptive management approach in which measures are periodically assessed for efficiency and effectiveness. The iterative process of evaluation and adjustment ensures continuing progress toward achieving water quality goals, and expresses stakeholder commitment to the process. Please refer to the original TMDL document for additional information regarding implementation and reasonable assurance. OCTOBER 2018 UPDATE  "}, {"section_title": "TPDES-Regulated Stormwater", "text": "TPDES general permits cover stormwater discharges from Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s; General Permit number TXR040000), industrial facilities (General Permit number TXR050000; also known as a multi-sector general permits (MSGPs)), concrete production facilities (General Permit number TXG110000), petroleum bulk stations and terminals (General Permit number TXG340000), and construction sites over one acre (General Permit number TXR150000). Three of these permits (MS4, MSGP, and construction) pertain solely to stormwater discharges. The other two (concrete production facilities and petroleum bulk stations and terminals) also authorize the discharge of process wastewater. The geographic region of the Mary's Creek Bypass watershed covered by MS4 permits is that portion of the Mary's Creek Bypass watershed defined by the 2010 Census as being an urbanized area ( Figure 5). The watershed is almost completely covered under the 2010 Census urbanized area. Therefore, the urbanized area will be used as a surrogate for the area for all regulated stormwater in the watershed. Table 8 shows a summary of MS4 permit area coverage present in the Mary's Creek Bypass watershed.

The TMDL was calculated based on the median flow in the 0-30 percentile range (15 percent exceedance, Wet Conditions flow regime) for flow exceedance from the LDC developed for the monitoring station 17937. Allocations are based on the current geometric mean criterion for E. coli of 126 MPN/100 mL for each component of the TMDL (with the exception of the WLAWWTF and FG terms, which used one-half the criterion). The final TMDL allocations (Table 11) needed to comply with the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 103.7 include the FG component within the WLAWWTF. In the event that the criterion changes due to a change in the designated recreational use, Appendix A provides guidance for recalculating the allocations in Table 11. "}]
