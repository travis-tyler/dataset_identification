Iterative gradient descent methods used in conventional registration methods are slow in practice while deep learning (DL) methods can be very fast at test time. Most DL based methods rely on large datasets for training. Since it is difficult to obtain ground truth data for registration it restricts the method's efficacy on new image types and in real world scenarios. A network trained to register a pair of chest xray images does not perform equally well on a pair of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, or Xray images from other scanners. Although conventional registration methods are time consuming, their performance is consistent across different image types. Thus DL based methods have to be retrained for novel images. In this paper we address this challenge by proposing a DL based method that, once trained on a particular dataset, can be easily used on other image pairs without extensive retraining.\nA comprehensive review of conventional medical image registration methods can be found in [1] . Previous approaches to DL based image registration involve the use of convolutional stacked autoencoders (CAE) [2] , convolutional neural network (CNN) regressors [3, 4, 5] , and CNNs with reinforcement learning [6] . These approaches use a conventional model to generate the transformed image from the predicted deformation field which increases computation time and does not fully utilize the generative capabilities of DL methods. CNNs trained on simulated deformations were used in [7] while in [8] a parameterized registration function is learned from training data, and does not require ground truth.\nThe above methods are limited by the need of spatially corresponding patches or being too dependent on training data. Generative models can overcome some of these limitations by generating the registered image and the deformation field. In previous work [9] we used generative adversarial networks (GANs) for multimodal retinal image registration, and in [10] show the advantages of including segmentation for registration compared to conventional registration. In this paper we build on our previous works and show how segmentation information can be leveraged to design a DL registration method that does not require extensive retraining when used with different datasets. Our primary contribution is in using principles of transfer learning for achieving dataset independent registration. We show that our method, despite being trained on chest Xray images, achieves high performance levels with test images of brain MRI."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "In our proposed method the generator network, G, takes two "}, {"section_title": "Segmentation Augmented Registration Using GANs", "text": "GANs [11] are generative models where the generator G outputs a desired image type while a discriminator D outputs a probability of the generated image matching the training data.

The aligned images are subjected to local elastic deformation using B-splines with the pixel displacements in the range of \u00b1 [1, 20] .

The segmentation masks are obtained by fusing the weighted normalized output maps of the different convolution layers and applying Otsu's thresholding. The convolution layer outputs highlight the different anatomies of the image and the weights quantify the importance of each map. Figure 2 shows an example image, the obtained fused convolution mask and the segmented mask by Otsu's thresholding (along with a contour of the manual segmentation and the output of UNet segmentation). This shows that our segmentation mask is very similar to UNet's output.\nThe discriminator D (Figure 1 (b) ) has eight convolutional layers with the kernels increasing by a factor of 2 from 64 to 512 .

During training the trained network G generates the segmentation masks of the input images, the registered image and the deformation field. Since we do not have applied deformation field to determine the accuracy of test image, the best way to gauge registration performance is by comparing I T rans and I Ref based on feature maps and segmentation mask output. If the input test image pair consists of lung images (with training images also of the lung) the generated outputs will be close to the desired values and there is no need for any finetuning of the weights.\nThe challenge lies in registering a completely new image pair, e.g., brain MR images which we achieve by transfer learning. In transfer learning for image classification the weights of all except the last few layers are frozen. We use a similar principle to register a new test image pair. The weights of the last convolution layer of generator G are updated iteratively based on the output of the discriminator. In the case of registering a new test image pair, the network is being finetuned. As a result, the discriminator network also comes into play. However, in this case the adversarial loss is based on the cyclic GAN and segmentation mask loss terms, i.e., the first three terms of Eqn. 5, and the deformation field loss term is excluded. The weight updates occur till the difference of cost function values for consecutive iterations is less than 1%. The update happens for 10 \u2212 30 iterations depending on the input image pair. Since the weight updates are only for the last layer and the computation is GPU based, the time taken for registration is very low, around 0.3 \u2212 0.5 seconds."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Our registration method was trained on the NIH ChestXray14 dataset [14] .

The first visit image was I\nRef and subsequent images were I F lt . In total we selected 906 images where each patient had minimum 3 images and maximum 8 images. The left and right lung were manually outlined in each image. All images were resized to 512 \u00d7 512 pixels before the manual annotations.

The results clearly demonstrate that our method can effectively transfer learned information from one dataset to another. All other methods have been trained on the brain images.
