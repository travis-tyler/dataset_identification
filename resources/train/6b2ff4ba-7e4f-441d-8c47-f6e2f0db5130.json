[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Hearing impairment (HI) is prevalent, is modifiable, and has been associated with cognitive decline. We tested the hypothesis that audiometric HI measured in 2013 is associated with poorer cognitive function in 253 men and women from Washington County, Maryland (mean age = 76.9 years) in a pilot study carried out within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study. Three cognitive tests were administered in 1990-1992, 1996-1998, and 2013, and a full neuropsychological battery was administered in 2013. Multivariable-adjusted differences in standardized cognitive scores (cross-sectional analysis) and trajectories of 20-year change (longitudinal analysis) were modeled using linear regression and generalized estimating equations, respectively. Hearing thresholds for pure tone frequencies of 0.5-4 kHz were averaged to obtain a pure tone average in the better-hearing ear. Hearing was categorized as follows: \u226425 dB, no HI; 26-40 dB, mild HI; and >40 dB, moderate/severe HI. Comparing participants with moderate/severe HI to participants with no HI, 20-year rates of decline in memory and global function differed by \u22120.47 standard deviations (P = 0.02) and \u22120.29 standard deviations (P = 0.02), respectively. Estimated declines were greatest in participants who did not wear a hearing aid. These findings add to the limited literature on cognitive impairments associated with HI, and they support future research on whether HI treatment may reduce risk of cognitive decline. aging; cognition; cognitive decline; hearing impairment; memory; perbycussis Abbreviations: ARIC, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; CES-D, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; CI, confidence interval; DSST, Digit Symbol Substitution Test; DWRT, Delayed Word Recall Test; HI, hearing impairment; SD, standard deviation.\nRecent epidemiologic studies have indicated that hearing impairment (HI) may be a risk factor for cognitive decline (1-3).

ARIC participants returned for a fifth ARIC visit in 2011-2013 (the ARIC Neurocognitive Study). A pilot study on hearing was initiated at the Washington County field site in 2013, and audiometric testing was offered to 307 ARIC participants at their regularly scheduled ARIC visit. Six declined participation, and 46 did not complete the examination (45 of them because of compacted cerumen in one or both ears). Since only 2 participants were nonwhite, analysis was restricted to self-reported whites, resulting in an analytical sample of 253.

Scores on the Trail Making Test Parts A and B were transformed to the natural log values to account for nonnormality. All test scores were standardized to z scores, and arithmetic signs were changed for the Trail Making tests so that higher scores indicated better function for all tests. All test-specific z scores were then averaged within each domain to yield a domainspecific score. A global cross-sectional composite score was created by averaging the 3 domain-specific z scores. In order to facilitate comparisons, the global composite score and each domain score were then scaled so that 1 unit equaled 1 SD of that score.\nMost of these cognitive tests included both auditory and written stimuli. Two tests that administer only auditory stimuli, the Logical Memory Test and the Digit Span Backwards Test, were excluded from the domain-specific summary scores in sensitivity analyses.\nLongitudinal measures. Three neuropsychological tests representing the different cognitive domains-memory (DWRT), language (Word Fluency Test), and processing speed/ attention (DSST)-were administered 3 times, in 1990-1992, 1996-1998, and 2013 . For longitudinal analyses, the z scores for these tests at each testing occasion were scaled to their mean and the SD on first testing at baseline (1990) (1991) (1992) .

All thresholds were measured in decibels of hearing level. For each participant, the threshold levels for the pure tone frequencies of 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz in the betterhearing ear were averaged to obtain a pure tone average in accordance with the World Health Organization (18) . We categorized pure tone average according to clinically defined cutpoints for HI (normal: \u226425 dB; mild: 26-40 dB; moderate/severe: >40 dB); because only 5 participants had severe HI (>70 dB), moderate and severe HI were combined to create 1 category.\nHearing aid use was defined as self-reported use of a hearing aid in either ear during the previous month."}, {"section_title": "Other independent variables", "text": "Demographic information was collected in 1987-1989, including age (years), sex, and education (highest grade or year of school completed).

An interaction term for the interaction between HI and time was included in the models in order to test whether rates of cognitive change over time differed by hearing status. Time since baseline was used as the time scale. A 2-piece linear spline with a knot at year 6 was included in the model in order to allow for differential rates of cognitive change before and after year 6. Year 6 was chosen a priori as the knot for the spline on the basis of the ARIC study design: 6 years was the mean follow-up time between baseline and the second round of cognitive testing (1996-1998), after which there was a subsequent 16-year gap until cognitive testing was performed in 2013. Model fit was good, as assessed using residual plots, the Bayesian Information Criterion, and the Akaike Information Criterion.\nModels were adjusted for demographic and disease covariates that were measured in 1987-1989, including education and sex. Time-varying covariates, including age, smoking status, hypertension, and diabetes, were measured at baseline for the longitudinal analysis or in 2013 for the cross-sectional analysis. All analyses also adjusted for scores on the Wide Range Achievement Test, a measure of premorbid intelligence, administered in 2013. Age was modeled using both linear (years) and quadratic (years 2 ) components. Because depression could be a possible mediator of the relationship between HI and cognitive performance, we did not adjust for depression in our primary model. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses with adjustment for depressive symptoms.\nTo evaluate the association of hearing aid use with cognitive performance, we repeated the analyses after restricting the data to persons with moderate or severe HI."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Of 253 participants, 73 (29%) had no HI, 95 (37%) had mild HI, and 85 (34%) had moderate or severe HI. Mean age at the time of the hearing assessment was 76.9 (SD, 5.4) years, and 58.9% of participants had a high school education or less. On average, participants with moderate/severe HI were older (79.4 years) and more likely to be male (54%) and to have hypertension at baseline (33%) than participants with mild or no HI (Table 1) .\nMean test scores across categories of HI differed in 2013 for some (but not all) tests of memory (DWRT, Incidental Learning Test), language (Animal Naming Test, Boston Naming Test), and processing speed/executive function (DSST). DWRT and DSST scores also differed at baseline. A dose-response relationship between HI category and performance on each of these tests was suggested; mean test scores were poorest for participants with moderate/severe HI and best for participants with no HI. We did not observe a difference in mean test scores by HI category in tests that used only auditory stimuli (the Logical Memory Test and the Digit Span Backwards Test), which may reflect administration of all tests in a quiet room by technicians trained to work with older adults (Table 2) .\nCompared with participants with no HI, participants with mild HI showed poorer concurrent memory domain performance (\u22120.35 SDs, 95% confidence interval (CI): \u22120.62, \u22120.07; P = 0.01) in cross-sectional analysis (see model 1 in Web Table 1 , available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). When cognitive tests that include only auditory stimuli (Logical Memory Test and Digit Span Backwards Test) were excluded from the cognitive domain summary scores, we observed significant differences in memory performance for both moderate/severe HI and mild HI: \u22120.39 SDs (95% CI: \u22120.70, \u22120.07) and \u22120.37 SDs (95% CI: \u22120.65, \u22120.08), respectively (Web Table 1 , model 3). Inferences did not change after adjustment for depressive symptoms (Web Table 1 , models 2 and 4).\nObserved mean scores by HI status on each of the 3 cognitive testing occasions are presented in Figure 1 . There is the suggestion of a dose-response relationship between HI category and cognitive decline. After adjustment for demographic and disease covariates, on average, cognitive performance in all domains declined for all 3 HI groups during the approximately 20 years of follow-up (Table 3, Figure 2 ). Compared with participants with no HI, participants with moderate/severe HI declined at a faster rate on the DWRT and the global composite score; comparing the 2 groups, the average difference in the rate of 20-year decline was \u22120.47 SDs (95% CI: \u22120.86, \u22120.08) for the DWRT and \u22120.29 SDs (95% CI: \u22120.54, \u22120.05) for the global composite score. Further adjustment for depressive symptoms did not change the estimates (Web Table 2 ).\nAmong the 85 participants with moderate/severe HI, 51% (n = 43) reported using a hearing aid (Table 1) . Compared with hearing aid users, nonusers were more likely to have hypertension (45% vs. 21% at baseline (P = 0.02) and 83% vs. 70% in 2013 (P = 0.14)) and diabetes (14% vs. 7% at baseline (P = 0.31) and 48% vs. 33% in 2013 (P = 0.16)). Duration of hearing aid use varied across participants and ranged from less than 1 year to 48 years (Table 1) . In multivariable-adjusted analyses among participants with moderate/severe HI, not using a hearing aid was associated with poorer cross-sectional performance in memory (\u22120.74 SDs, 95% CI: \u22121.16, \u22120.32), Table 3 ). Estimated average 20-year changes were greater for hearing aid nonusers than for hearing aid users in memory (\u22120.95 SDs, 95% CI: \u22121.53, \u22120.38) and global function (\u22120.48 SDs, 95% CI: \u22120.83, \u22120.14) ( Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this pilot study, carried out among 253 white ARIC Neurocognitive Study participants from Washington County, Maryland (mean age = 77 years), our results demonstrated that moderate/severe HI measured in late life was associated with poorer concurrent memory performance and with a faster rate of prior 20-year decline in both memory and global cognitive function. Although, on average, all participants with moderate/severe HI declined in all 3 domains, the greatest decline was estimated for participants who reported not using a hearing aid. The estimated 20-year rate of decline in memory for this group was \u22121.84 SDs (95% CI: \u22122.28, \u22121.39), which was \u22120.95 SDs (95% CI: \u22121.53, \u22120.38) faster than the estimated rate for persons with the same degree of HI who reported wearing a hearing aid. Notably, the global decline in persons with moderate/severe HI who used hearing aids (\u22120.97; Table 4 ) was only slightly greater than the corresponding decline in persons with normal hearing (\u22120.90; Table 3 ).\nFor our longitudinal analysis, HI was not measured until the end of follow-up for cognitive function. Therefore, one possible interpretation of our findings is that cognitive decline leads to HI (i.e., reverse causation), either from indirect effects of cognitive impairment on the accuracy of hearing assessment or from direct effects of neuropathology which contributes to cognitive impairment (e.g., microvascular disease, accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 and \u03c4 protein) also affecting the peripheral auditory system. However, pure tone audiometry is considered a measure of the auditory periphery (not dependent on higher-order auditory or cognitive processing (23)), and valid hearing thresholds can be obtained even in participants with dementia (24) . Neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease has also not been found in the peripheral auditory pathways (25, 26) , and we adjusted for multiple midlife and late-life cardiovascular risk factors in our analyses. Regardless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed association between HI and cognitive decline is due to an unmeasured factor that causes both conditions, although this limitation is true for any observational epidemiologic study. A number of mechanisms could account for the observed association between HI and poorer cognitive functioning. Persons with HI may perform more poorly on tests of cognitive function because they are unable to hear test administrators. However, although all cognitive tests require that the participants hear the instructions, cognitive testing was routinely performed in a quiet room by technicians highly experienced in working with older adults, and we also observed strong associations of HI with both auditory and nonauditory cognitive tests.\nHI has also been hypothesized to be a causal risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia through several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive: increased social isolation and loneliness, increased cognitive load, and changes in brain structure. Social isolation is associated with physiological changes, such as increases in systolic blood pressure and increased glucocorticosteroid levels, which could in turn impact brain structure, and several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between social isolation and accelerated cognitive decline and dementia (27) . In a recent cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, HI was associated with increased odds (odds ratio = 3.49, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.39) of social isolation in women aged 60-69 years (28) . Poor or impaired encoding by the cochlea may require extra cognitive processing effort, limiting the effort available for encoding the content of speech into memory. This increase in cognitive load due to HI has been termed effortful listening (29, 30) . Additionally, neuroimaging studies have suggested that structural changes within the brain may occur in response to HI, both cross-sectionally (31) and longitudinally (32) . For example, in 126 participants aged 56-86 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, HI was longitudinally associated with a faster rate of atrophy Although estimates were imprecise because of the small sample size, the estimated rate of 20-year memory decline in persons with moderate/severe HI who did not report wearing a hearing aid was large-about twice the average annual rate of change estimated in nationally representative studies of cognitive change in older adults (33, 34) . However, Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HI, hearing impairment. a Adjusted for age (years), age 2 (years 2 ), sex, education (high school or less vs. more than high school), smoking status (ever smoking vs. never smoking), diabetes (fasting blood glucose concentration \u2265126 mg/dL or participant self-report and medication use for diabetes), hypertension (diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, or use of hypertensive medication), and Wide Range Achievement Test score.\nb HI was measured in 2013 and was defined as none (\u226425 dB)), mild (26-40 dB), or moderate/severe (>40 dB). Numbers of participants with no HI, mild HI, and moderate/severe HI were 73, 95, and 85, respectively.\nc Estimate was scaled to 6 years so that the interpretation is the estimated rate of cognitive change per 6 years. d Estimate combines rates of change before and after year 6 to give an overall estimate of the rate of cognitive change over 20 years.\nresidual confounding may still have affected the longitudinal differences we observed in rates of cognitive decline between hearing aid users and nonusers. Nonusers in our sample had more comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes) at a younger age than did persons with the same amount of HI who reported wearing a hearing aid. Given that hearing aids are not currently covered by Medicare and the average cost of a pair of hearing aids is more than $2,000, hearing aid use could also be a marker of better socioeconomic status and education and therefore increased access to health care and/or a more healthy lifestyle. However, education is not associated with cognitive decline in this cohort (16) , and other stable socioeconomic characteristics seem unlikely to influence measures of change in cognition. Data on other key variables (e.g., duration of hearing aid use, adequacy of hearing aid fitting and rehabilitation) that would affect the success of hearing loss treatment and affect any observed association were also not accounted for in our analyses. Nevertheless, although we cannot determine causality from this study, the slower rate of estimated decline in hearing aid users as compared with nonusers is intriguing and should be the focus of further study. Investigators in 2 previous studies of older adults reported an association between HI and poorer performance on the DSST. Cross-sectionally, HI was associated with a DSST score difference of \u22121.5 points (95% CI: \u22122.9, \u22120.23) among 605 men and women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1) . In a longitudinal analysis of 1,984 older adults (mean age = 77.4 years) from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, HI was associated with faster rates of decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (P = 0.004)-a test of global function-and on the DSST (P = 0.02) over 6 years of follow-up (3). In our study, we observed faster rates of decline on the Delayed Word Recall Test-a word list learning task-and in global function, but not on the DSST. In a recent analysis of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging cohort, Lin et al. (2) reported cross-sectional associations between HI and poorer cognitive function in several domains, including memory (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test), executive function (Stroop Test), and global function (Mini-Mental State Examination). They reported no association with 2 tests of language (Animal and Category Fluency) and with the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, which is similar to our results. Previous studies have also shown an association between HI and incident dementia. In 1,057 men from the Caerphilly Prospective Study, audiometric HI was associated with increased odds of incident dementia over 17 years of follow-up (odds ratio = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.38, 5.18) (35) , and in 639 participants aged 36-90 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, baseline HI was associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia over approximately 12 years of follow-up ( per 10-dB loss, hazard ratio = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50) (36) . Our study adds to the literature on HI and cognition in older adults through the inclusion of multiple tests to measure several cognitive domains, and it adds to the small but growing body of literature on HI and domain-specific cognitive function.\nOur results are limited in their generalizability, given that our study consisted only of whites from Washington County, Maryland. Additionally, we did not have data on duration of HI. Although our exposure was not measured until the end of follow-up for cognitive function, longitudinal analyses of cognitive change avoid the potentially strong cross-sectional confounding effects of variables like education and other factors associated with social disadvantage (16) .\nIn conclusion, this study documented a moderate association between moderate/severe HI and memory performance, both at the time of hearing testing and over the prior 20 years, in 253 white men and women from Washington County, Maryland. This association was strongest among persons with moderate/ severe HI who reported not wearing a hearing aid. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that HI may be a risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults and that hearing aid use could possibly reduce that risk. HI is highly prevalent among older adults, and although it is amenable to rehabilitative devices and interventions, these interventions remain underutilized. Given the current lack of treatments for altering the natural history of cognitive decline and dementia, further research is needed as to whether HI interventions could reduce cognitive decline in older adults."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Author affiliations: Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. a Adjusted for age (years), age 2 (years 2 ), sex, education (high school or less vs. more than high school), smoking status (ever smoking vs. never smoking), diabetes (fasting blood glucose concentration \u2265126 mg/dL or participant self-report and medication use for diabetes), hypertension (diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, or use of hypertensive medication), and Wide Range Achievement Test score.\nb Hearing aid use was measured in 2013 and was defined as self-reported use of a hearing aid in either ear during the previous month.
