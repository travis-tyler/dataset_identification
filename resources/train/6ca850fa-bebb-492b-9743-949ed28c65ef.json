The reported relationship between Ab and cognition measured at a single assessment in cognitively healthy individuals has been inconsistent, with some studies reporting modest associations [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and others demonstrating no significant relationship [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, longitudinal studies examining a variety of cognitive domains and ranging from 6-month to 10-year intervals more consistently reveal negative relationships between Ab and cognition [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Moreover, genetic risk for AD (possession of the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 [APOE \u03b54] allele) may moderate this relationship [22] [23] [24] [25] .\nMost studies have focused on the relationship between Ab, APOE, and cognition in older adults (e.g., .65 years) at risk for AD with fewer investigations in middle age (e.g., 45-65 years). Because Ab is hypothesized to accumulate early and then plateau [1, 26] , it may be possible to detect a subtle, yet clinically meaningful, relationship between Ab and cognitive decline in midlife while Ab is accumulating and cognition begins declining. Higher Ab in middle age may also provide earlier prediction of disease progression. The objective of this study was to examine whether Ab is associated with longitudinal cognitive change in a late middle-aged cohort enriched for parental history of AD (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention [WRAP] ). The first aim investigated whether Ab is associated with classification of psychometric mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at recent follow-up. The second aim was to determine whether Ab is associated with longitudinal cognitive trajectories. The third aim explored whether APOE \u03b54 moderates the relationship between Ab and cognitive trajectories. We hypothesized that higher Ab would be associated with increased MCI and greater cognitive decline, and that the association between Ab and cognitive decline would be strongest in APOE \u03b54 carriers."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were selected from the WRAP, a late middleaged, cognitively healthy longitudinal cohort (mean age 5 53.6 years, standard deviation [SD] 5 6.6, at baseline) enriched for AD risk factors of APOE \u03b54 carrier status (40%) and parental history of AD (72%) [27] .

Although Ab was not associated with cognitive status at the visit closest to the PiB-PET scan, higher Ab was associated with greater likelihood of pMCI classification at approximately 2-year follow-up. Although neuropsychological performance demonstrated stronger relationships with follow-up cognitive status (previously shown in [41] ), Ab remained as a significant contributor to the models, suggesting it may account for variance in follow-up cognitive status not explained by cognitive performance. These results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating greater rates of progression to MCI or dementia in participants with higher Ab. For example, one study observed that 16% of older controls with high Ab developed MCI or dementia within 2 years, and 25% progressed within 3 years [42] . The current sample is younger (mean age 5 60 years) than that described by Villemagne et al [42] (mean age 5 73 years) and suggests that higher Ab predicts progression to neuropsychological impairment that may precede a clinical MCI diagnosis. However, as the construct of pMCI represents a milder form of decline, it will be necessary to document whether these individuals progress to clinical diagnoses with continued follow-up."}, {"section_title": "High Ab is associated with cognitive decline", "text": "Ab was associated with an increased rate of decline in delayed memory and executive functioning. Results indicated a stronger relationship between Ab and delayed memory decline compared with learning and executive functioning, consistent with prior findings [8] . Previous cross-sectional studies of Ab and cognition in the WRAP cohort have been mixed. For example, baseline cognitive performance did not differ between groups divided into Ab positive, Ab negative, and Ab indeterminate [12] . Additionally, no differences in precuneus amyloid load were observed between a \"stable\" and \"decliner\" group defined by RAVLT performance [41] . However, a recent cross-sectional study demonstrated greater age-related decline in processing speed among Ab-positive compared with Ab-negative participants, suggesting that \"normal\" changes in cognition that occur with aging may be accelerated in the presence of amyloid pathology [43] .\nThe present study differed from these prior studies in quantification of Ab (composite measure across eight ROIs examined continuously) and the longitudinal method of measuring cognition (mean slopes across 4 years). By examining mean slopes, while accounting for individual differences through inclusion of random effects, the current analysis attempted to detect meaningful change, even if cognitive performance fell within a cognitively normal range. For example, decline in cognitive performance associated with higher Ab remained within the normal range (declines from wz 5 0.5 to w z 5 20.5), and average performances on cognitive measures remained within normal limits at each visit. These results of subtle cognitive decline associated with Ab may be difficult to detect via traditional clinical methods and cross-sectional designs and are consistent with findings in longitudinal cohorts of older adults such as Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [18] , Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study [20] , and the Harvard Aging Brain Study [17] . Our findings suggest that Ab-associated decline may be detected in younger ages than previously examined."}, {"section_title": "APOE \u03b54 moderates the relationship between Ab and cognitive decline", "text": "Similar to prior studies, APOE \u03b54 carriers exhibited higher Ab than noncarriers [22, 44] . Furthermore, the presence of APOE \u03b54 moderated the association between Ab and cognitive decline. Although some studies reported null effects of APOE genotype on rates of decline [20, 45] , our results of a moderating effect of APOE are consistent with subsequent studies using larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up [22] [23] [24] . The current results were driven by a significant interaction between Ab and time within APOE \u03b54 carriers that was not observed within noncarriers. As displayed in Fig. 3 , the association between higher Ab and time on memory performance in \u03b54 carriers was negative and demonstrated the steepest rate of decline. An unexpected positive association was observed between lower Ab and time on memory performance in \u03b54 carriers. The latter result may be due to sampling bias, as \u03b54 carriers with low Ab were less prevalent and younger than other participants and included fewer participants that had yet to return for their fourth evaluation. However, results from a post hoc analysis suggested that varied number of observations did not fully account for differences between \u03b54 carriers with high or low Ab. It is possible that the sample size was too small to adequately investigate the interaction between Ab and APOE, and followup studies on larger samples are required to replicate these findings. Interestingly, a very recent study of older adults within the AIBL cohort similarly reported unexpected findings of improved memory performance in \u03b54 carriers with low Ab compared with noncarriers with low Ab [46] , which may warrant investigation of potential protective mechanisms in this group.\nThe mechanisms underlying the relationship between APOE \u03b54 and Ab are becoming increasingly understood (see [47] ). APOE \u03b54 carriers exhibit Ab approximately 20 years earlier than noncarriers (e.g., age 55 years compared with age 75 years). APOE \u03b54 may moderate cognitive decline and increase risk for AD by initiating and accelerating Ab accumulation, aggregation, and clearance in the brain. APOE \u03b54 carriers could also be more vulnerable to Ab-related toxicity because of Ab-independent effects on neuronal integrity [48] ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future directions", "text": "The present study used a global composite measure of Ab to summarize diffuse pathology in regions with reported increased PiB binding levels in AD; however, it is possible that regionally specific relationships between Ab and cognition are not captured. Furthermore, the PiB-PET scan was not acquired concurrently with the initial cognitive evaluation, complicating attempts to characterize the specific time course of Ab development and cognitive decline. Additionally, the present study did not examine potential effects of neurofibrillary tangle pathology, neurodegeneration, or cerebrovascular disease on cognitive decline. However, incorporation of both Ab and neuronal injury measures may provide the most accurate prognosis [49] , and this is a future direction. Moreover, the sample is enriched for AD risk and is a highly educated, mostly Caucasian sample from the Midwest region of the United States. These results may not generalize to population-based samples of normally aging middle-aged adults.\nDespite these limitations, results suggest that Ab burden in late middle age is associated with cognitive decline over a 4-year period and predictive of pMCI diagnosis at follow-up in individuals at risk for AD. Furthermore, APOE \u03b54 carriers with greater Ab may decline faster than \u03b54 carriers with low Ab or noncarriers. These results suggest that identification of preclinical AD may be possible in cognitively healthy middle-aged adults with higher Ab who may benefit most from clinical trials attempting to slow the rate of cognitive decline before the onset of clinical symptoms of MCI or dementia."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The project described was supported by the Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) program through the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and grant UL1TR00427.
