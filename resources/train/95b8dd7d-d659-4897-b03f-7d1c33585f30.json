In 2011, CGS was awarded funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF #1138814) to study completion and attrition rates of underrepresented minority (URM) students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral programs at twentyone U.S. doctoral degree-granting institutions with large offerings of STEM programs. The study, which captures student-level enrollment records of all URM students who pursued STEM doctorates at these institutions in a twenty-year period, is the largest dataset of its kind. In addition to enrollment records, the dataset includes surveys of current students, focus groups with students and other stakeholders of STEM doctoral programs, and inventories of initiatives designed to facilitate the success of URM students in STEM doctoral programs. The project, which is still ongoing, has generated national research and best practices that inform national efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive STEM graduate student body and professoriate."}, {"section_title": "Some Signs of Progress", "text": "The 2015 CGS report \"Doctoral Initiative on Minority Attrition and Completion\" (Sowell, Allum, and Okahana, 2015) offers both welcome findings and those that illuminate persisting challenges for our pursuit of more diverse and inclusive STEM graduate programs and professoriate. Specifically, the 2015 report found that the cumulative sevenyear completion rates for URM STEM doctoral students increased from 42% to 47% between the earliest and latest cohorts included in the study. Also, the ten-year completion rate of URM STEM doctoral students in this study, 54%, was not far from the 55% ten-year completion rate for U.S. citizens and permanent resident students reported in an earlier CGS doctoral completion study (Sowell, Zhang, Bell, and Redd, 2008). Another welcoming sign is that URM enrollment in STEM graduate programs has improved in recent years. According to the CGS/GRE Survey of Graduate Enrollment and Degrees (GE&D Survey), on average, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino first-time enrollment in STEM graduate programs increased by 4.5% and 7.4%, respectively, each year between Fall 2005and Fall 2015(Okahana, Feaster, Allum, 2016. Furthermore, the number of earned STEM doctorates by URM CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 2017 3 4 ALLIANCES FOR GR ADUATE EDUCATION AND THE PROFESSORIATE students has more than doubled over the last two decades, increasing from 1,277 in 1995 to 3,057 in 2015, according to NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). These robust increases, both in terms of first-time STEM graduate enrollment and earned doctorates by URM students, are encouraging to many of us in the graduate education community. The data suggest, at least in part, that the many diversity and inclusion efforts implemented by colleges and universities, as well as by funding agencies such as NSF, have steered us in the right direction."}, {"section_title": "Challenges that Remain", "text": "Additional work is needed to achieve more just and equitable access to STEM graduate education and, by extension, the professoriate. Despite the robust increases in first-time enrollments in STEM graduate programs, URM students continue to be underrepresented relative to the U.S. population. For example, in fall 2015 URM students collectively accounted for only 19.8% of all U.S. citizens and permanent residents who began pursuing STEM graduate education (Okahana et al., 2016). By different categories of race and ethnicity, Hispanic/ Latino (10.2%) had the largest share; followed by Black/African American (8.9%), American Indian/ Alaska Native (0.5%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (0.2%). Even though the number of earned doctorates in STEM fields doubled over the last two decades for Hispanics/Latinos, Blacks/African Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives, these groups collectively accounted for only 12.4% of STEM doctorates in 2015 earned by U.S. citizens and permanent residents, according to SED. Minority representation in the professoriate is even bleaker, with URM degree recipients collectively accounting for 8.3% of all doctoral faculty members in STEM fields in 2013, according to NSF's Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR). However, there is one glimpse of hope. Among assistant professors, URMs accounted for 10.4% in 2013. All these data points suggest that while we may be moving in the right direction, the pace at which we are making progress is not nearly fast enough to facilitate more diverse and inclusive STEM graduate education and the professoriate."}, {"section_title": "Opportunities", "text": "One of the project's key findings was that many graduate schools are engaged in long-standing efforts to promote URM student success. However, these initiatives are often designed as early interventions that focus on recruitment, selection, and first-year transitions of URM doctoral students in STEM fields. In fact, only 36% of the STEM doctoral programs that participated in the project indicated that they offer peer mentoring programs and targeted mentoring for students at the \"All But the Dissertation\" (ABD) phase (Sowell et al., 2015). The project also demonstrated that one-half of attrition for URM students occurs during the third year of doctoral study and beyond. Considering these findings, support for STEM doctoral students in latter stages seems to be a logical place to improve degree completion rates for URM students. Indeed, the project results informed us that URM STEM doctoral students seem to grow skeptical about support and interventions offered by graduate programs and faculty members during the latter stages of the doctoral process (Sowell et al., 2015). Prior master's education also appears to be a determinant of STEM doctoral degree completion among URM students. The project found that those URM STEM doctoral students with prior master's degrees had a better seven-year completion rate (47%) than those without (42%) (Sowell et al., 2015). Furthermore, among those URM students without prior master's degrees, there was a statistically significant difference in the probability of earning a STEM doctorate by race/ethnicity. Yet, among those with prior master's degrees, there was no difference by race/ethnicity (Okahana, Klein, Allum, and Sowell, forthcoming). These results suggest that master's education may work as an equalizer in the STEM doctoral education pipeline. The findings support active partnerships between master's and doctoral programs in identifying students with potential for success."}, {"section_title": "Introduction and Self-Location Statement", "text": "In alignment with Indigenous Methodologies in Research, the following self-location statement is "}, {"section_title": "Mentoring Program", "text": "There are three primary research components to the PNW COSMOS: (1) A Social Sciences Research Team (SSRT) studying the transculturation phenomenon of American Indian/Alaska Native students in graduate STEM fields. 2The Indigenous Knowledge Field Camps (IKFC) who take faculty/student pairs on a river trip to learn science from an Indigenous perspective.

To properly prepare them for entry into the academy, postdocs are mentored using a multi-campus group model. Using this model, participating postdocs interact with several mentors, ideally consisting of the advisor, a faculty member on the resident campus, and two faculty members at other Big Ten schools who can provide guidance and entr\u00e9e into faculty positions on their campuses. Originally, the PAI had designated funds to support the mentors for their service in the program. However, we learned that it was more effective to channel this support to the participating postdocs. In fact, many of the faculty members viewed mentoring as part of their job and did not feel comfortable being paid. Consequently, we modified the funding model to allow postdocs to be supported financially from the grant to attend conferences and professional development workshops. Specifically, postdocs can apply for a maximum of two conferences or professional development workshops within the U.S. and can receive funding up to $1500 for each conference/ workshop each funding period. Similarly, they can receive support to visit their Alliance mentors who reside on other campuses. Support for travel and lodging expenses is provide for one visit annually with each external mentor."}, {"section_title": "Coaching Faculty to become Leaders in Diversity Hiring", "text": "Many, if not most, faculty members on search committees seek to find the candidate they judge to be \"best,\" not fully recognizing that their judgments along the way may not be entirely objective.

These include an examination of the influence of mentoring on the self-efficacy and identity of URM postdocs as STEM researchers as well as the influence of having matched-background mentors and the degree of importance URM postdocs place on having a matched mentor. The team is also studying the influence of mentoring on the successful transition into the professoriate and success in that position along with the influence the mentoring experience has had on unconscious bias. Understanding these issues-postdoc-mentor interactions and faculty perceptions-will help us improve the progression of URM postdocs into the academy."}, {"section_title": "Progress", "text": "The Big Ten PAI is making good progress.

The goal proposed in the grant was to effectively double the Alliance URM hiring rate, the specific numerical target being 50 per year.

Are we training our students to be the faculty that our colleagues can write those positive letters about? That is what we need to think about when we are preparing our graduate students and post docs for academic careers, because those letters hold so much weight when it comes to the tenure process. My take-home message is that it's very important to get our students plugged into this \"potential letter-writing\" network. We need to get them in a network early, a network where colleagues will write authentic letters containing the aforementioned phrases and mean it. In order to get tenure, there is more to it than the letters. There are also the teaching, leadership and departmental citizenship achievements.
