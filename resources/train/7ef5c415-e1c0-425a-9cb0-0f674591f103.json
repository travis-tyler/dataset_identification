[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The rise of CRISPR Cas9 based approaches for biosensing nucleic acids has opened up a broad diagnostic portfolio for CRISPR products beyond their standard genome editing abilities 1,2 . In recent times, CRISPR components have been successfully used to detect a wide variety of nucleic acid targets such as those obtained from pathogenic microorganisms or disease-causing mutations from various biological specimens [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . At the heart of such a detection procedure lies the property of CRISPR proteins to accurately bind to target DNA or RNA, undergo conformational changes leading to cleavage of targets generating a reporter-based signal outcome [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . To enable such a detection mechanism to be safe, sensitive and All rights reserved.

Cleavage outcomes are then converted to a reporter-based readout with or without signal amplification 1 . Among the CRISPR proteins that have been used so far, Cas12 and Cas13 have obtained Emergency Usage Authorization (EUA) for diagnostic use during the COVID-19 pandemic [16] [17] . However each of these approaches has its own strengths and limitations that are related to sensitivity to mismatches and ease of design for wide variety of targets. For example, to genotype individuals with high confidence, including careers of a single nucleotide variant (SNV), Cas12 requires individual sgRNA design and optimization for every target 7 which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for design and deployment of a diagnostic test. Importantly, both Cas12/Cas13 unleash a secondary reporter activity upon activation, leading to possible loss of information about starting copy numbers of the target [16] [17] . Taken together, development of a detection pipeline based on a highly specific Cas protein with a direct binding or cleavage based readout can significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and cost of CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for pointof-care (POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction components are not feasible.\nWe have recently reported a Cas9 ortholog from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) showing very high mismatch sensitivity both under in vitro and in vivo conditions [18] [19] [20] . This is based on its negligible binding affinity to substrates that harbor mismatches, a property that is distinct from engineered Cas proteins showing similar high specificity 21 . We reasoned that FnCas9 mediated DNA interrogation and subsequent cleavage can both be adapted for accurately identifying any single nucleotide variants (SNVs) provided that the fundamental mechanism of discrimination is consistent across all sequences. We name this approach FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) and demonstrate its utility in various pathological conditions including genetic disorders. Notably, due to its ease of design and implementation for new targets, we were successful in deploying it for a ready-All rights reserved.

To test this, we selected sickle cell anemia (SCA), a global autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a point mutation (GAG>GTG) [25] [26] . By fixing the position of the SNV and walking along the entire length of the sgRNA, we discovered that two mismatches at the PAM proximal 2 nd and 6 th positions completely abrogated the cleavage of the SNV target while leaving the WT target intact (Supplementary Figure 1B) . We tested FELUDA on DNA cloned from 6 SCA patients and a healthy control and obtained a clearly identifiable signature for SNV in every case (Supplementary Figure 1C) . Importantly, the same design principle for searching and discriminating can be universally applied to other Mendelian SNVs without the need for optimization (Supplementary Figure 1D) . To aid users for quick design and implement FELUDA for a target SNV, we have developed a web tool JATAYU (Junction for Analysis and Target Design for Your FELUDA assay) that incorporates the above features and generates primer sequences for amplicon and sgRNA synthesis (https:// jatayu.igib.res.in, Supplementary Figure 1E )."}, {"section_title": "FELUDA diagnosis is adaptable to direct binding-based outcomes", "text": "We next sought to adapt FELUDA for fluorescent detection. Unlike Cas12/Cas13 based CRISPRDx platforms, FnCas9 is not reported to produce collateral activity on substrates, so FELUDA is not suitable for trans-cleavage signal output. To circumvent this, we envisioned FELUDA as a direct, non-cleavage, affinity-based method of detection which works with single nucleotide mismatch sensitivity. We first investigated if a catalytically inactive dead FnCas9 (dFnCas9) tagged with a fluorophore (GFP) is adept in sensing a point mutation at DNA using Microscale All rights reserved.

We observed that using FELUDA specific sgRNAs (having 2 mismatches with WT), the WT substrate exhibited negligible dFnCas9-GFP binding (K d = 1037.4 nM \u00b1 93.3 nM) while the SCD substrate showed moderately strong binding (K d = 187.2 nM \u00b1 3.4 nM) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary   Figure 2A ). This is consistent with the in vitro cleavage (IVC) outcomes on the two substrates (Supplementary Figure 1C) . Importantly, both Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and its engineered High-Fidelity variant (dSpCas9-HF1-GFP) showed strong binding to WT substrate with sgRNAs containing 2 mismatches (144.9 \u00b1 11.8 nM and 153.6 \u00b1 19.8 nM respectively) establishing that the inherent DNA interrogation properties of FnCas9 are responsible for discriminating single mismatched targets with very high specificity ( Figure 1A) . We then developed a pipeline to adapt FELUDA for an affinity-based fluorescent read-out system, where an amplification step generates biotinylated products that can then be immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads ( Figure 1B ). Upon incubation with dFnCas9-GFP, enzymatic binding to the substrate leads to loss of fluorescence signal in the supernatant allowing FELUDA to discriminate between SCA and WT samples ( Figure 1B )."}, {"section_title": "FELUDA accurately genotypes carriers of Mendelian variants", "text": "Although sickle cell trait (SCT) individuals are generally non-symptomatic, carrier screening is vital to prevent the spread of SCA in successive generations and is widely employed in SCA control programs in various parts of the world 26 .

We also show that FELUDA based detection can work robustly across a wide temperature range and up to 3 days post thawing of reaction components (at room temperature). Thus, field studies using FELUDA can be conducted in diverse climatic conditions and reaction components can be successfully used following cold chain transportation (Supplementary Figure   4A -B)."}, {"section_title": "FELUDA on paper strip can accurately predict COVID-19 outcomes", "text": "The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 virus provided an opportunity to expand the scope of above-mentioned approach of FELUDA and make a difference in the ongoing public health emergency throughout the world.

The on-body RT-RPA FELUDA prototype combined with extraction-free RNA isolation can potentially bring the benefits of testing to home. Although RT-RPA is rapid and sensitive, it is also prone to aerosol-based contamination necessitating an efficient cold-chain transportation of pre-pipetted components to minimize user handling 45 . It is imperative to test this prototype on a larger number of clinical samples to establish its accuracy.\nTaken together, FELUDA is an accurate and low-cost CRISPR based diagnostic assay to detect nucleic acids and variations. A two-gene FELUDA assay for SARS-CoV2 costs ~7 USD (Supplementary Table 2 ). Its single-mismatch sensitivity to nucleic acids expands its application portfolio to a large number of sectors not limited to healthcare.
