[9] [10] [11] [12] As a result of such ischaemic damage, CAA pathology has emerged as an independent contributor to age-related cognitive decline, even in patients who have not had symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. 13, 14 Although CAA-a cortical vascular pathology-has been linked to many subcortical lesions, its association with cortical structural changes has not been studied. The most important impediment for such a study is the frequent coexistence of CAA and parenchymal Alzheimer's disease pathologies, making it diffi cult to tease out the independent eff ects of vascular amyloid on cerebral cortex. To overcome such confounding by parenchymal Alzheimer's disease, we analysed a unique cohort of patients with hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type (HCHWA-D), a condition characterised by severe CAA pathology with minimal or no neurofi brillary pathology. 15 To assess the generalisability of fi ndings from this select cohort, we further compared cortical thickness in patients with the more common sporadic CAA with age-matched healthy controls and individuals with Alzheimer's disease. We also examined the correlation between cortical thickness and markers of structural cerebral injury (lobar microbleeds and leukoaraiosis) to understand whether these widespread lesions might aff ect cortical loss or its measurement. Finally, we analysed the relationship between cortical thickness and a functional MRI (fMRI) marker of vascular reactivity to explore the possibility that CAA-related vascular dysfunction mediates cortical damage."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "This case-control study was done between March 15, 2006 , and Dec 1, 2014, at two tertiary referral centres: Leiden University in the Netherlands, and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, USA.

We then repeated PubMed searches within the same time interval using combinations of the term \"cerebral amyloid angiopathy\" and each one of the following terms: \"leukoaraiosis\", \"white matter\", \"structural networks\", and \"subcortical injury\". We found several articles establishing associations between CAA and subcortical tissue damage, but the association of CAA and cortical atrophy was unknown.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that CAA pathology is an important contributor to subcortical tissue injury through vascular dysfunction and ischaemia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is also a well-established contributor to cognitive impairment in elderly patients, independent of intracerebral haemorrhages and other clinical consequences of vascular amyloid deposition. Our study is the fi rst to suggest that CAA pathology might cause cortical atrophy, an eff ect that might at least partly be mediated by vascular dysfunction. These new fi ndings are important to understand the mechanisms of cerebral damage in patients with CAA, because these mechanisms can potentially have disabling clinical eff ects and even confound therapeutic eff orts. For example, some of the immunotherapies studied for Alzheimer's disease (eg, bapineuzumab and gantenerumab) resulted in superfi cial cerebral microbleeds typical of CAA pathology, and accelerated atrophy has been reported in several antibody trials. On the basis of all available evidence, CAA pathology will need to be taken into consideration in future clinical trials for patients with Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment.\nHCHWA-D; all control individuals underwent genetic testing to rule out HCHWA-D. The diagnosis of HCHWA-D was based on DNA analysis for confi rmation of the codon 693 mutation in the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein gene APP. 17 A total of 26 DNA-proven HCHWA-D mutation carriers and 28 age-matched (to within 5 years) controls were enrolled and demographics, vascular risk factors, and clinical features recorded. 16 The healthy controls from the same communities in Leiden all had genetic testing to rule out HCHWA-D. Individuals with sporadic CAA were enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of CAA at Massachusetts General Hospital. Detailed information including demographics, vascular risk factors, and clinical characteristics were recorded at the time of enrolment by AA and SvRf. 9, 11 None of the individuals with CAA had dementia and all were free of symptoms suggestive of new stroke for 6 months before MRI acquisition. All individuals with sporadic CAA had a diagnosis of probable CAA according to the pathologically validated Boston criteria. 18 Patients with sporadic CAA were compared with two groups of age-matched healthy controls with complementary strengths: controls in the Harvard Aging Brain (HAB) study, 19 drawn from the same population as the CAA group but imaged on a diff erent scanner type; and a second control group from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, 20 imaged using the same scanner type and strength as the CAA group. As a positive control group to demonstrate cortical atrophy, we also selected age-matched individuals with Alzheimer's disease from the ADNI database. Age matching was done based on the closest age to the fi rst decimal for age, from the available HAB cohort as well as ADNI healthy control and Alzheimer's disease cohorts. Matching was performed without knowledge of radiological or other individual characteristics. Patient enrolment and data collection for these large studies have been extensively described. 19, 20 Specifi cally, part of the data used in the preparation of this Article were obtained from the ADNI database. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuro psychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease.\nOverall, 63 patients without dementia but with probable sporadic CAA were age-matched to 63 healthy controls from the ADNI database, 126 healthy controls from the HAB study, and 63 patients with Alzheimer's disease from ADNI. The institutional review boards of the participating sites have approved this study. All participants completed written informed consent. 11 The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI protocol, using a block design with a visual stimulus, has been previously described. 9 The individuals from the ADNI database underwent similar structural MRI sequences using Siemens 1\u00b75 T scanners at several sites, whereas the healthy controls from the HAB study underwent MRI using a Siemens TrioTim 3 T scanner (12-channel head coil) within the same research facility as the sporadic CAA cohort. 19, 20 Extensive details of MRI acquisition parameters for these studies have been presented in previous publications.

We repeated these comparisons after excluding 31 patients with CAA who had intracerebral haemorrhage (and their matched healthy controls), to overcome any potential confounding eff ect of these lesions. The remaining 32 patients with CAA without intracerebral haemorrhage again had signifi cantly lower cortical thickness (2\u00b716 mm [SD 0\u00b712]) versus both healthy control groups (both p<0\u00b70001; table 3). The diagnosis of CAA was independently associated with cortical thinning compared with both healthy control groups after adjustment for the covariates above (p=0\u00b7007). Similar results were obtained when the multivariate models were limited to CAA patients without intracerebral haemorrhage and corresponding healthy controls (p=0\u00b7010). There was again no association between cortical thickness and total number of lobar microbleeds or white matter hyperintensity volume after controlling for age within the sporadic CAA cohort (data not shown).\nThe patients with Alzheimer's disease were in the early stages of this disease: 36 (57%) had a clinical dementia rating of 0\u00b75 (normal rating 0, abnormal range 0\u00b75-3) and 27 (43%) had a clinical dementia rating of 1. Patients with Alzheimer's disease showed signifi cantly thinner cortices when compared with both the CAA (table 3) and healthy control groups (ADNI healthy vs Alzheimer's disease, mean diff erence -0\u00b720 [95% CI -0\u00b724 to -0\u00b716], p<0\u00b70001; HAB healthy vs Alzheimer's disease -0\u00b716\n[-0\u00b720 to -0\u00b713], p<0\u00b70001).

Prolonged BOLD time-topeak correlated with decreased cortical thickness within the HCHWA-D cohort (\u03c1=-0\u00b758, p=0\u00b7003), but not in the age-matched healthy control group (\u03c1=0\u00b705, p=0\u00b7810).

In patients with sporadic CAA, cortical thickness was also negatively correlated with BOLD time-to-peak (r=-0\u00b74, p=0\u00b7015) and remained signifi cant after adjusting for the above covariates (p=0\u00b7007).

The Sobel test also found BOLD time-to-peak (t=2\u00b74, p=0\u00b7018) to be a signifi cant mediator of the infl uence of HCHWA-D on cortical thickness, explaining 63% of the total eff ect."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To identify the contribution of cerebrovascular amyloid pathology to cortical atrophy, we evaluated cortical thickness in patients with a monogenic form of CAA largely devoid of parenchymal Alzheimer's disease pathology, as well as in patients with sporadic CAA without dementia. Both hereditary and sporadic CAA groups showed signifi cant decreases in cortical thickness (5-6%) when compared with age-matched healthy controls, whereas patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibited even greater cortical thinning (3%) than agematched patients with sporadic CAA.\nCortical atrophy in CAA could be related to several factors: confounding from concomitant parenchymal Alzheimer's disease pathology; cortical eff ects of CAArelated structural lesions; or CAA-related vascular dysfunction. We addressed the fi rst possibility by minimising the confounding of Alzheimer's disease pathology through the unique opportunity aff orded in patients with HCHWA-D, and noted essentially the same extent and pattern of cortical thinning as in the cohort of sporadic CAA. Our results further showed no major eff ects on cortical thickness of structural lesions, such as Figure 2: Diff erences in cortical thickness between patients with sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy and their age-matched controls A general linear model was computed to schematically explore the regional diff erences in cortical thickness between patients with sporadic CAA and healthy controls, after adjusting for age and sex.

A strength of our study was inclusion of patients with HCHWA-D and age-matched controls identifi ed and scanned at a single site. The codon 693 mutation of the amyloid precursor protein gene APP 15 causes extensive amyloid deposition in the walls of meningocortical arterioles, minimal parenchymal A\u03b2 deposition in the form of so-called diff use plaques, and essentially no dense core plaque or tau deposition. 31 We found decreased cortical thickness in this essentially pure phenotype of CAA in relatively young patients (mean age 46 years) and no association between cortical thickness and structural lesions. We have replicated these results in patients with the more prevalent condition of sporadic CAA. Adding hippocampal volume (a commonly used diagnostic biomarker in Alzheimer's disease) as a covariate in multivariate regression models did not change the independent association between CAA and global cortical thinning, further supporting our hypothesis that vascular amyloid directly contributes to cortical atrophy.\nCortical atrophy could be related to any of the various CAA pathology-related lesions: intracerebral haemorrhage, microbleeds, cortical microinfarcts, and even white matter lesions through local or dying-back mechanisms. As in previous studies, 9, 11 we collected data from the hemisphere that was not aff ected by intracerebral haemorrhage, and repetition of all pertinent analyses in the subgroup of patients without intracerebral haemorrhage did not change the results. Lobar microbleed counts and white matter hyperintensity volumes did not correlate with cortical thickness in either CAA cohort in multivariate models, similar to fi ndings reported previously for another small vessel disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy. 32 Future studies designed to detect cortical microinfarcts and measure the remote eff ects of small deep lesions, such as lacunes, will increase our understanding of the mechanisms of cortical atrophy in patients with CAA.\nCortical thinning in CAA was noted in the occipital, temporal, posterior parietal, and medial frontal regions, areas previously reported to be particularly susceptible to vascular amyloid load by pathology and in-vivo amyloid imaging. 6, 33, 34 Amyloid burden in the medial frontal region has also been identifi ed as an independent predictor of future haemorrhages in patients with CAA. 35 Although the distribution of cortical thinning in patients with CAA resembles the distribution of vascular amyloid, it also overlaps with the pattern of cortical thinning observed in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that these patterns may not be entirely disease specifi c. 36 We did not observe substantial qualitative diff erences in the patterns of cortical thinning between the individuals with hereditary and those with sporadic CAA. Because of substantial age diff erences between the two CAA cohorts (approximately 25 years, with no age overlap) and the large eff ect of age on cortical thickness, we could not quantitatively compare the pattern of cortical thinning between sporadic and hereditary CAA.\nBOLD time-to-peak appears to be a marker of vascular dysfunction in patients with sporadic CAA and, on the basis of our data, also in the younger patients with HCHWA-D. 9, 12 There was a strong and independent negative correlation between BOLD time-to-peak and cortical thickness. Consequently, vascular dysfunctionexpressed as delay in haemodynamic response-might contribute to cortical thinning in patients with CAA. Cortical thinning did not correlate with BOLD time-topeak in the respective controls, supporting the conclusion that vascular amyloid, but not the cortical thickness itself, drives this association. Furthermore, both mediation analyses found that vascular dysfunction mediates a signifi cant part of HCHWA-D's eff ect on cortical thinning.\nSome recent evidence also suggests reduced blood fl ow and possibly cortical atrophy in patients with CAA: two studies showed grey matter loss and hypometabolism in the temporal lobe of patients with Alzheimer's disease with microbleeds, when compared with Alzheimer's disease without microbleeds, and widespread reductions in cortical perfusion in healthy octogenarians with cortical microbleeds (mean age 87\u00b76 years [SD 2\u00b78]), when compared with age-similar healthy controls without microbleeds (mean age 86\u00b72 years [SD 2\u00b75]). 37, 38 The lack of a dedicated control group for sporadic CAA is a weakness of the study. We note, however, essentially similar diff erences in cortical measures in the two agematched control groups compared with the patients with sporadic CAA, supporting the robustness of the fi ndings. Other notable weaknesses were the lack of fMRI in the fi rst 26 patients with sporadic CAA enrolled early in the study and in the corresponding controls. We cannot exclude the possibility that the parenchymal A\u03b2 that has been observed as diff use plaques in patients with HCHWA-D might have some contribution to cortical thinning even in hereditary CAA. 39 We also again note that, in the absence of a validated molecular tracer specifi c to CAA or Alzheimer's disease pathology, it is impossible to exclude some degree of confounding by concurrent parenchymal Alzheimer's disease pathology on cortical thickness. Eff orts to produce a specifi c marker for CAA are underway. Short of such a specifi c marker, we have analysed a series of neuroimaging markers that capture aspects of CAA severity-lobar microbleeds, white matter hyperintensity volume, vascular reactivity-and fi nd correlation only with vascular reactivity, raising the possibility that this aspect of CAA severity contributes to the CAA-related reduction in cortical thickness. In all other respects, the fi ndings from the sporadic CAA analyses replicated those from the less confounded HCHWA-D analyses, suggesting that the observed cortical thinning and association with vascular dysfunction are indeed driven by advanced CAA pathology.\nIn conclusion, our fi ndings show that cerebrovascular amyloid pathology is an independent contributor to cortical atrophy and suggest that this eff ect is at least partly mediated by CAA-related vascular dysfunction. These results indicate that a relatively common cerebral small vessel disease results in cortical changes independent of its profound subcortical eff ects. Our results also add support to the view that the contributory role of CAA pathology and small vessel diseases should be considered in eff orts to reduce age-associated cognitive impairment.
