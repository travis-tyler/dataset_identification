[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Although the importance of social norms in affecting health behaviors is widely recognized, the current understanding of the social norm effects on obesity is limited due to data and methodology limitations. This study aims to use nontraditional innovative systems methods to examine: a) the effects of social norms on school children's BMI growth and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption, and b) the effects of misperceptions of social norms on US children's BMI growth. Methods: We built an agent-based model (ABM) in a utility maximization framework and parameterized the model based on empirical longitudinal data collected in a US nationally representative study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), to test potential mechanisms of social norm affecting children's BMI growth and FV consumption.\nResults: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for BMI were 0.064-0.065, suggesting that children's BMI were similar within each school. The correlation between observed and ABM-predicted BMI was 0.87, indicating the validity of our ABM. Our simulations suggested the follow-the-average social norm acts as an endogenous stabilizer, which automatically adjusts positive and negative deviance of an individual's BMI from the group mean of a social network. One unit of BMI below the social average may lead to 0.025 unit increase in BMI per year for each child; asymmetrically, one unit of BMI above the social average, may only cause 0.015 unit of BMI reduction. Gender difference was apparent. Social norms have less impact on weight reduction among girls, and a greater impact promoting weight increase among boys. Our simulation also showed misperception of the social norm would push up the mean BMI and cause the distribution to be more skewed to the left. Our simulation results did not provide strong support for the role of social norms on FV consumption.\nConclusions: Social norm influences US children's BMI growth. High obesity prevalence will lead to a continuous increase in children's BMI due to increased socially acceptable mean BMI. Interventions promoting healthy body image and desirable socially acceptable BMI should be implemented to control childhood obesity epidemic."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Although the importance of social norms in affecting health behaviors is widely recognized, the current understanding of the social norm effects on obesity is limited. The dynamic interplay between individuals, groups, and environment poses challenges to traditional methods to realize a holistic view of \"contagious\" obesity [1, 2] .\nThere have been efforts to identify pathways and mechanisms in peer influences. Eisenberg et al. measured social norm effects by asking respondents whether they had friends who dieted to lose or keep from gaining weight [3] ; Thompson et al. [4] used multifaceted scales to measure peer influence, such as the degree of teasing that respondents received from friends about weight and appearance, and their friends' influence on their ideas of body image and weight-control strategies; Shomaker and Furman [5] measured the social reinforcement of thinness from close social group members (e.g., mother, close friends and romantic partners); Christakis and Fowler [1] examined obesity spreading through social networks using the Offspring Cohort from the Framingham Heart Study [1] . However, traditional analytical approaches have led to mixed empirical findings in the literature. The influence of a social network might disappear once other social and contextual factors were considered in the analytical models [2] . Different results came from the alternate foci and hypotheses based on a reductionist point of view.\nSystems methods attempt to examine the research question as a whole. Agent-based models (ABM), as a major application of systems methods, simulate agent behaviors at the micro level and can generate macro level emergent patterns from the bottom up. With the aid of ABM, this study aimed to examine the dynamics between social norms and individual children's body mass indices (BMI) and their consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV). We also tested how misperception of the social norm may affect children's BMI growth. Based on rationality and assumption of utility maximization, a group of school children's BMI and FV intake within social networks (schools) are simulated. Since social influence on individuals' BMI is usually masked and mixed with food and built environment effects, there has been considerable debate about whether obesity is contagious. The results from our ABM simulations intend to answer this question from a generative standpoint."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview of study design", "text": "We developed an ABM based on longitudinal data collected from a US nationally representative study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K).

There is no common definition for social norms. In a general sense, social norms are rules that guide individual behavior in interactions with others. Group pressure ensures the avoidance of the deviant acts in group members' behavioral decision-making process. The norms and how individuals communicate the norms play a central role in the process. In our model, social norm effect was modeled through the behavior rule that governed children's interactions, i.e. the follow-theaverage (FTA) rule [6] . The rule defines how individuals communicate with the social environment. Individuals evaluate their status and adjust to engage in socially acceptable behaviors. The reference group where the normative information is derived from is a determinant of the communication and interaction patterns as well.

To our knowledge, there is no established algorithm available in literature to guide numerical parameter calibration for ABMs. We used the ECLS-K data to calibrate and validate our model. First, we initialized the model by assigning baseline attributes to each agent. These attributes included the gender, age, race/ethnicity, baseline BMI and FV consumption, and the social network the agent resided. The social networks had no spatial relationship, as we did not examine the spillover effect. The parameters to be estimated were \u03b1 and \u03b2 defined in the behavioral rules as described in the previous section. Then the model searches for the numeric values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 until the model generated data matched the empirical data to the greatest extent possible. That is, the information of the children at the 5 th grade was used for initial model setup, and the model then generated simulations for three years consequently, i.e. BMI and FV consumption in the 6 th , 7 th , and 8 th grade.\nThe criteria we used in our calibration and validation was the deviance of the descriptive statistics between the observed and the model-generated data distributions, i.e. deciles, the means, and the standard deviations. We compared the agreement between the observed and the ABM-generated data using moments, correlation coefficients, and distributional characteristics.\nOur ABMs were designed using NetLogo 5.0 [7] . Other statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 and STATA 11.\nEmpirical data (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort, ECLS-K) As stated above, we used the ECLS-K data to obtain empirical parameters for our ABM. The ECLS-K is a study following a national representative sample of children recruited from 1280 schools across the US in 1998-1999 up to their 8 th grade (in 2007). Schools were the clusters for sampling and recruitment. Since food consumption frequencies were collected only at the follow-ups at the 5 th and 8 th grades, we utilized data from these two waves of followup for the current model: the 5 th grade as baseline and the 8 th grade as follow-up.\nIn this study, we selected children who stayed at the same school from 5 th to 8 th grade. We excluded those who transferred to another school to prevent the contamination of different schools in the model. Schools with 10 or more student participants in the 5 th grade were included in the analysis. Table 1 presents the summary characteristics of the eligible children in the data.\nAt each follow-up, the children's body weight and height were directly measured twice. We used the averaged measurements to calculate BMI for each child. The 2000 CDC Growth Chart was used to convert children's BMI into sex-age specific Z score and percentiles. The age-sex-specific percentiles of \u226585th and \u226595th were used to define overweight/obesity and obesity status, respectively [8] . To generate mutually exclusive weight status groups when examining the agreement between observed data and the ABM-simulated data, we defined non-overweight group as sex-specific percentiles <85 th or \u2265 95 th , and non-obese group as sex-specific percentiles < 95 th .\nECLS-K assessed children's food consumption at the 5th and 8th grades. The FV index is a compound index constructed from children's self-report consumption frequencies in the past week (7 days) of salad, potatoes, carrots, other vegetables and fruits. Children reported their consumption of these food items as zero, 1-3 times in last week, 4 to 6 times in last week, 1 time per day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day, and 4 or more times per day. We constructed a VF index score, a continuous variable, by adding up the separate consumption frequencies. We also categorized FV consumption as <3 vs. \u22653 times per day.\nPlease see the Appendix for detailed model documentation."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Contribution of shared social and built environmental factors on concordance of US school children's BMI and VF intake based on ECLS-K data Table 2 shows the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for BMI at 5 th grade was 0.064 and at 8 th grade it was 0.065, suggesting that there was similarity between children's BMI within the same school. In contrast, ICC for VF dropped from 0.041 at 5 th grade to 0.034 at the 8 th grade, indicating diverging dietary patterns among older children. However, it is challenging to attribute the intraschool correlation to social vs. shared built environmental factors. The ABM simulation tends to add direct evidence about the social norm effect on children's weight status and food behavior."}, {"section_title": "ABM simulation findings on the effect of social norm on children's BMI", "text": "After a thorough calibration and validation process as described in the previous section, we found that \u03b1 for those whose BMI was below social average was 0.025 (kg/m 2 /year), while \u03b1 for those whose BMI was above social average was 0.015. The general BMI growth trend E was found to be 0.65 kg/m 2 /year. Table 3 reports the descriptive statistic comparisons. It is evident that the ABM-simulated BMI distribution \"mimics\" well the observed BMI distribution. The correlation between simulated BMI and observed BMI was as high as 0.87. The mean squared error (MSE) between the simulation and the observation for BMI was 4.86 2 . After we silenced the social norm effect with growth trend unchanged, the MSE increased to 4.92 2 , indicating the existence of the social norm effects and the validity of the model, though the magnitude is small. As Table 4 shows, we further categorized the children as normal, overweight, and obese based on the CDC 2000 growth chart. Kappa statistics suggested a high agreement between the observed and ABM-predicted weight status. Figure 2 (a) shows a good agreement between the observed and ABM-predicted BMI distributions. These results suggest the validity of our hypothesized mechanism of the social norm effect on children's BMI changes.\nFurthermore, the ICC based on observed and ABMsimulated data were also close: ICC for the observed 8 th grade BMI was 0.065, while the ICC for the ABMsimulated BMI was 0.067. The results suggest that the social norm added a motivational drive among the children, which generated an upward and converging trend of their BMI.\nGender difference was also apparent.

Figure 2 (b) shows good agreement between the observed and ABM-predicted FV intake distributions.\nNevertheless, a comparison of the correlation coefficients between the observed and ABM-predicted VF intakes indicates that social norms might explain less FV consumption variance in our ABM.

This finding indicates that social norm may play a less influential role in children's FV consumption."}, {"section_title": "Simulation evidence on personal misperception and social consequences", "text": "According to the general model mentioned above, we compare the children's BMI changes from 5 th grade to 8 th grade with and without the presence of misperceptions.

Our analysis showed a good agreement between observed and ABM-predicted BMI, e.g., the Pearson's correlation coefficient was as high as 0.9, indicating the validity of our ABM, and the existence of the follow-theaverage social norm effect. Furthermore, gender difference was apparent. The social norm was shown to have less impact stimulating weight reduction among girls and greater impact promoting weight increase among boys. Simulation experiments also showed that misperception of the social norm would further push up the mean BMI and make the distribution more skewed to the left. However, our simulation results did not provide strong support for the role of the social norm on students' FV consumption."}, {"section_title": "Social norms and children's BMI changes", "text": "As the simulation results suggest, the influence of the social norm on children's BMI adjustment is asymmetric, though the deviation from social average BMI could trigger the adjustment process in either case. It is more difficult for children to lower BMI growth than to gain BMI in order to meet the social norm. Moreover, the results suggest that for children whose BMIs were at the upper tail of the BMI distribution, their BMI adjustment behaviors become more heterogeneous and the social norm contributes little in explaining their BMI changes. This is evidenced by the relatively large difference between simulated and observed BMI for children above 70% in the BMI distribution. This phenomenon could be due to various endogenous and exogenous factors, which cause higher heterogeneous behavior among these children, for example, differences in energy metabolism and appetite control, and the influence of environment. Under-average children had a clear aim to attain growth above the average rate, while the over-average children faced the conflicting aims of fulfilling linear growth potential and preventing overweight/obesity. This dilemma adds to the complexity and heterogeneity of weight/ BMI-change among the heavier children.\nOur models also suggested gender differences in the social norm effect. The magnitude of weight increase influence was about 2 times higher than weight reduction influence among boys, while the ratio was about 7 times for girls. Possibly, girls may face more challenges than boys to lose weight due to factors related to dietary habits, physical activity level, and lifestyle. Furthermore, the results suggest that the social norm had greater impact on boys than girls with regard to weight increase. This result is in line with the finding of Bernier et al. that children in the lowest BMI percentile have a greater desire for change in body shape [9] . Difference in the perception and preference of body image across genders may partially contribute to the distinct patterns, for example, desire for a thinner or stronger body [10, 11] ."}, {"section_title": "The social norm and FV consumption", "text": "The asymmetric social norm influence was evident in the FV consumption as well. The ABM simulation suggests that on one hand, children with low FV consumption may be influenced by the perceived social norm to increase their FV consumption; while those with high FV consumption may be less influenced by others in the same social network. Our findings indicate that the attributes of the FV, such as visual cues and palatability, could be more important than social norm when children are making food decisions, especially when their consumption reaches a threshold level [12] . Nutrition education about the health benefits of FV thus should intervene to facilitate desirable behavior changes. These results suggest the importance of nutrition education and the power of good role-models in initiating and maintaining high FV consumption.\nThe impact of the social norm on FV consumption was less evident than that on BMI adjustment. This is likely to be because low/high FV consumption may not cause immediate consequences in social binding and thus leads to less behavior changes. In contrast, body image can be directly observed and may incur negative psychological effects, such as suicidal attempt, lower self-esteem, and depression [13, 14] . Therefore, we may expect to observe much stronger social norm effects on children's BMI than on their FV consumption behavior because of the difference in the seriousness of the consequences.\nThe weaker predicted or observed social norm impact on FV intake could also be affected by intra-individual variation in weekly food consumption. Moreover, FV consumption in the ECLS-K was measured in frequency, rather than amount. Although children consume a greater quantity of foods when growing up, the FV consumption pattern (frequency) may be established at earlier life stages. Hence, between 5 th and 8 th grades, children's real FV consumption frequency might not change much with the FTA rule. Food environment and household dietary habits may have greater influence on children's food choice than peer influence."}, {"section_title": "Misperception and the social consequences", "text": "In general, the FTA rule governing social interactions and behavior changes crucially hinges on the assumption that every single member within a network perfectly observes the status and behavior of other members and thus is able to make correct assessment and behave accordingly. However, in reality, partially due to limited knowledge/ information, the assessment is usually not based on comprehensive observation but rather on bounded information and subjective \"guessing\". Our simulations suggest that the misperception would further push up the mean BMI and make the distribution more skewed to the left. From the intervention point of view, our findings imply Baseline scenario-Individual children correctly perceive the social mean BMI and adjust accordingly. Scenario1. Qualitative deviance misperception, i.e. children with a BMI above real social average perceived their BMI as under the average and make opposite BMI adjustments; Scenario 2. Consensus misperception, i.e. children with a BMI above real social average perceived others are having similar BMI and make no attempt to make changes; and Scenario 3.

We tested the social norm impacts on BMI adjustment behavior and FV intake among children. We examined how misconception of the social norm can influence individual and social BMI outcome. Our model focused on the \"individual-level effect\", rather than solely examining the weight distribution transitions. Furthermore, we added the time dimension in the analysis of the adjustment process. As an improvement to existing models, our model explicitly accounted for the heterogeneity of individuals and gender differences, and showed asymmetric social influence on children's BMI. Burke and Heiland [14] used NHANES data to calibrate their model, but the data was too limited to identify social networks and analyze agent behavior within these networks [15] . The ECLS-K data we used provided natural well-defined social networks -the children's schools -which largely enhanced the ability of our model to simulate real-world social norm effects.\nCompared to the existing studies on the contagious nature of obesity among family members and friends, the ABM of this study overcomes the intrinsic limitations and gaps embedded in the traditional methods, such as the confounding effects of homophily and shared environment, mis-specified regression models and sensitive estimation approaches. Hypothetical mechanisms are explicitly simulated and tested through ABM, generating concrete evidence for us to make causal inference of the effect of social norms on the BMI distribution among children.\nThe study has a few limitations: First, the BMI model did not incorporate child's behavioral approaches to adjust BMI under social norm influence. Changing energy intake and physical activity both can lead to BMI changes. We did not model specific behavioral changes during the BMI adjustment process. Second, due to the scope of this study, the model did not test the effectiveness of potential intervention options to promote desirable social norm effect and to inhibit negative impact simultaneously. Third, the model cannot distinguish pure social norm effects from the influence of other factors, such as the influence of the media and food environment at national and local levels, which could reinforce the social norm effect. We cannot develop a model that isolates the social norm effect due to data and methodological challenges, which deserves future research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, our agent-based simulation analysis calibrated with empirical data demonstrated the effects of social norms on US children's BMI growth, but was not clear on fruit and vegetable consumption. The followthe-average social interaction rule could be one of the mechanisms that influence children's BMI growth although it was not helpful in explaining fruit and vegetable consumption. These results indicate that health education and promotion of obesity awareness are important to prevent excessive weight gain in school children due to weight misperceptions. Moreover, the influence of social norms may differ by gender (boys are more likely to gain weight) and by baseline BMI.
