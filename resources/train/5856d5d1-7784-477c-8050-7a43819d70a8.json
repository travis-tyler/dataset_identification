[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Brain development in the early stages of life has been suggested to be one of the factors that may influence an individual's risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) later in life. Four microcephaly genes, which regulate brain development in utero and have been suggested to play a role in the evolution of the human brain, were selected as candidate genes that may modulate the risk of AD. We examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging common sequence variations in these genes and risk of AD in two case-control samples. We found that the G allele of rs2442607 in microcephalin 1 was associated with an increased risk of AD (under an additive genetic model, P=0.01; odds ratio=3.41; confidence interval, 1.77-6.57). However, this association was not replicated using another case-control sample research participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We conclude that the common variations we measured in the 4 microcephaly genes do not affect the risk of AD or that their effect size is small."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "such phenotypes and some or all of the microcephaly genes.

Only 2 studies have found associations between common SNPs in MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, or ASPM and brain volumes in a sex-specific manner. 13, 16 One of these studies also sought for an association between 2 SNPs in CDK5RAP2 and schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum disorder, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and found no association. 16 In this study, we examined the association between the microcephaly genes and risk of AD using tag SNPs covering all 4 genes. To test our hypothesis, we completed a 2-step study. In the discovery step, 2 related but separate case-control studies were carried out: first the association between SNPs in ASPM and AD risk was examined. Later, the association between MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, and CENPJ SNPs and AD risk was examined in a slightly larger case-control sample.

We determined that the frequencies of the ASPM SNPs in our population were comparable with the HapMap CEU population. Therefore, tag SNPs spanning the entire ASPM gene were selected using Haploview 3.2 based on data obtained from the HapMap CEU population. Haploview uses a method that is identical to the program Tagger. 26 A pair-wise tagging method using single markers with thresholds of 0.8 for r 2 and 3.0 for logarithm of the odds score was used, and SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of >5% were included. A coding SNP (rs41310927) was also included in the final tag SNP panel based on our initial pilot study results. In the end, 2 coding SNPs previously suggested to have undergone positive selection were included (rs41310927 and rs3762271). 27, 28 The final SNP panel consisted of 11 SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure was examined using Haploview, and the haplotypes were defined using the confidence interval (CI) method. 28 Purified samples of genomic DNA, obtained from the blood or brain, were used for genomic analysis. SNPs were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA sequencing method.

This finding is consistent with many earlier studies that have failed to show a relationship between brain-related phenotypes and microcephaly genes. Two studies investigated the association between brain volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging and rs41310927 in ASPM and rs930557 in MCPH1. 11, 14 Both these studies found no significant effect of either polymorphism, alone or in combination, on the 3 measures of brain size. This may have been due to the lack of power, given the small sample sizes (n=120 and n=118, consecutively). Two larger studies, with sample sizes of n=2393 and n=644, examining the association between intelligence and these same gene variations were also negative. 10, 12 Several recent studies have reported inconsistent sexspecific relationships between the microcephaly genes and brain volume measures. For example, 1 study of 867 Han Chinese individuals found no association in their entire sample. However in a sex-stratified analysis, they found that male individuals homozygous for the C allele of rs1057090 in MCPH1 have larger cranial volumes. 13 Another study examined the relationship between brain volumes and SNPs in the microcephaly genes in 287 participants. The researchers found an association with 10 SNPs in CDK5RAP2 and brain volume or cortical area in male patients only. 16 Four SNPs in MCPH1 showed an association with brain volume or cortical area in female patients only. One SNP in ASPM showed an association with intracranial volume in female patients only. The researchers replicated their finding for 2 SNPs from CDK5RAP2 in a validation sample of 657 participants from ADNI. The researchers also examined the association between 2 SNPs from CDK5RAP2 and AD or MCI and did not find an association. Although our a priori hypothesis and analyses were not to investigate a sex-specific effect, we conducted a post hoc analysis and sought a sex-specific effect for rs2442607 by stratifying participants in the discovery step based on their sex and repeating the association analysis. We found no sex-specific effect. The G allele of rs2442607 remained associated with AD risk in both the sexes (P=0.03 in male participants-55 cases and 75 controls; and P=0.003 in female participants-105 cases and 93 controls). Although sex-specific effects are plausible, the underlying mechanism is not clear. To our knowledge, mutations in these genes have not been reported to cause sex-specific phenotypes. In addition, 1 SNP in MCPH1 was associated with cranial volume in Han Chinese men only, whereas 4 other SNPs in MCPH1 were associated with brain volumes in women only in the Rimol study. It is difficult to interpret these findings or to propose a plausible biological mechanism leading to these different observations.\nThis study has some limitations. First, it is possible that phenotypic differences between the discovery and validation samples may be the reason that we could not replicate our initial findings. We set forth 4 selection criteria to be included in this study for the discovery samples: presence of banked DNA, age, White ethnicity, and no first-degree relative with AD. These selection criteria may have introduced some bias, mainly impacting our ability to generalize our findings. When selecting the validation sample, we purposely did not limit participant inclusion to family history. This way we wanted to see whether we could validate our findings in a more heterogeneous sample of cases and controls. In the end, some participants in the validation sample had a family history of AD in a first-degree relative. In addition, the validation sample ended up being younger. As agevarying associations have been suggested as a reason for failure to replicate findings from genetic association studies, 31 we repeated the validation analysis this time with participants matched for age with the discovery sample participants. The result of no association did not change. Although phenotypic differences may have been a reason for lack of replication, the more likely possibility, given the uncommonly high OR, is that the initial finding was spurious.\nThe second limitation is that rs2442607 in MCPH1 was not genotyped in the ADNI population. Although we did not have direct information on this marker, 2 SNPs in strong LD with this marker were genotyped in ADNI and did not show an association with risk of AD. Using LD data from the HapMap CEU population for selection of SNPs in the ADNI participants has been recently shown to be a valid approach. 32 Another important limitation of this study was the dichotomous outcome used. Our initial hypothesis was that variations in the microcephaly genes affect cognitive reserve. Ideally, to be able to study cognitive reserve, one needs to have information on the amount of brain injury (such as amount of AD neuropathology and vascular changes) in relation to reserve (such as brain size, brain function, and synapse number) and the cognitive status of the participants. Practically, it is difficult to have neuropathologic and brain volume data on large numbers of participants. Thus, a less direct way of studying cognitive reserve has been to look at the risk of AD in cases and controls. 33, 34 We conclude that the common variations we measured in the 4 microcephaly genes do not affect risk of late-onset AD or that their effect size is small. As risk of AD is at best only a crude measure of cognitive reserve, future studies that will include additional information on the amount of neuropathology and brain size or function in relation to cognitive status and polymorphisms in these genes will likely be needed to definitively answer the question of whether these genes may influence cognitive reserve.
