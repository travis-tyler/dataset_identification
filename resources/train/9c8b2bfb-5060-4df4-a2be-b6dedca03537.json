Reports on quality of care (QOC) and factors that influence quality in CAHs are mixed.

Compared to rural hospitals with more than 25 beds, rural hospitals with 25 beds or less (including CAHs) were less likely to be accredited by the JC (Newhouse & Morlock, 2011) . Of CAHs who reported to Hospital Compare, JC accreditation was linked to better performance on 20 out of 23 measures for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure measures, pneumonia, and surgical care (Casey et al., 2012) .\nHowever, all CAHs scored below the 90% benchmark suggesting there is a need for improvement regardless of the JC accreditation. CAHs and other small rural hospitals have less number of Registered Nurses (RNs) employed and less RNs with a BSN degree compared to larger rural hospitals (Newhouse & Morlock, 2011) , both are features which have been linked to lower QOC (Aiken et al., 2011) . CAH nurses have previously identified the nurse work environment as important for QOC (Baernholdt, Jennings, & Lewis, 2013) . Compared to larger rural hospitals, nurses in CAHs and other small rural hospitals reported work environments with greater shared visions such as working together for common patient-centered goals, but less engagement in quality and safety activities (Newhouse & Morlock, 2011) . Given the inconclusive findings on QOC in small rural hospitals, this study compared QOC and factors that influence QOC in CAHs and other rural hospitals.\nOnline Journal of Rural Nursing and Health Care, 14 (2) http://dx.doi.org/10.14574/ojrnhc.v14i2.328 9"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "This cross-sectional descriptive study used nurse surveys and large public databases to collect data on community (three variables), hospital and nursing unit characteristics (eight variables each), the nurse work environment (ten variables), quality of care (six variables), and community perception of hospital quality (8 variables).

The ARF's rural-urban continuum codes from USDA ERS (2012) were used to produce designations for rural location.\nRural counties were defined as counties with no adjacent metro areas (continuum codes 5, 7, and 9) and those adjacent to metro counties (continuum codes 4, 6, and 8)."}, {"section_title": "Procedure", "text": "The Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) for all 65 hospitals received an invitation to participate by mail and email. Next, attempts were made to reach each CNO by phone and all were left a voice mail or message with their administrative assistant. A total of 44 CNOs or designated persons communicated with the primary investigator. Four hospitals declined, 20 considered but did not return subsequent emails and phone calls. Twenty hospitals provided a contact person and number of employed staff nurses within their institution. Staff nurses were all part-time or 10 study packages to be distributed to all staff nurses. Each staff nurse received a packet containing a cover letter explaining the study and a username and password for a Web survey option, a consent form for their records, a 12 page paper survey, return envelope with postage, and payment information for a $5 coupon to Food Lion. Two additional bulk mailings were sent three weeks apart with participation reminders to be distributed to all staff nurses.

Type of unit referred to what type of unit nurses worked on most of the time (medical/surgical unit, emergency department, intensive care unit, or other). Work complexity was a seven item 6-point Likert-type scale. The items asked nurses if they needed more information about their patients, if physicians' orders were changed frequently and if the unit had a high number of transfers and admissions. Higher scores represent higher work complexity. Previous studies have reported Cronbach alphas of .82 -.85 (Baernholdt & Mark, 2009; Salyer, 1996) . In our study the alpha coefficient was .88. Availability of support services was measured by a checklist of 21 possible support services where staff nurses indicated whether a specific service was consistently available (2), inconsistently available (1) 1-4 from strongly disagree to strongly agree, organizational learning-continuous improvement was three items rated 1-4 from strongly disagree to strongly agree, communication openness was three items rated 1-5 from never to always, feedback and communication about errors was three items rated 1-5 from never to always, and non-punitive response to error was three items rated 1-4 from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Higher scores represent a more positive unit safety culture. All five scales had Cronbach alphas of .57-.82 in previous studies (Blegen et al., 2009; Sorra & Nieva, 2005) . In our study alpha coefficients ranged from .68-.82."}, {"section_title": "Nurse work environment", "text": "The nurse work environment had ten variables. Education was measured as the highest level of education obtained by the individual nurse from LPN to above a BSN. Experience was number of years working as a nurse. Expertise was an eight-item 6 point Likert-type scale that measured nurses' ability for early recognition of patient problems, for example, nurses' ability to recognize subtle changes in patients and initiate appropriate actions (Minick & Harvey, 2003) .\nPrevious alpha coefficient was .92 (Baernholdt & Mark, 2009 ). In our study the alpha coefficient was .94. Commitment to care was an eight item, 6-point Likert-type scale that measured the extent to which nurses felt responsible for the care on their unit, for example, if they continue to seek clarification or question the physician when an order did not quite make sense, and if they approached and counseled a staff member who provided sub-standard care. In previous studies a Cronbach 's alpha of .81 has been reported (Baernholdt & Mark, 2009 ). In our study the alpha coefficient was .79. Professional nursing practice was measured using the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES). This 31 items 4-point Likert-type scale depicts the work environment through a composite score and five subscale scores: nurse participation in hospital affairs (nine items), nursing foundations for quality of care (ten items), (Lake, 2002) . In our study alpha coefficients ranged from .75 -.86.\nHigher scores indicate more expertise, higher commitment to care, and better professional practice environments."}, {"section_title": "Quality of care", "text": "The six variables measuring quality of care were all from the nurse surveys. Overall quality of care was assessed in one item asking nurses to rate the overall quality of care in their hospital (Aiken et al., 2001) . Things left undone was measured using a checklist of 12 tasks indicating good nursing care such as oral hygiene, skin care, and teaching (Aiken et al., 2001 ).\nThe nurses indicated how many of these tasks they did not do on their most recent shift/day of work. Safety outcomes were rated using four measures from the HSOPSC (Sorra & Nieva, 2005) . Number of events reported in the past 12 month was a single item measure with categories from none to 21 or more and a category of prefer not to answer. An event was defined as any type of error, mistake, incident, accident or deviation regardless of whether or not it resulted in patient harm. Higher scoring indicates more events have been reported; frequency of events reporting was a three items 5-point Likert-type scale about how often events are reported from always to never; overall perceptions of safety was a four items 4-point Likert-type scale about whether patient safety beliefs and procedures are in place and rated from strongly agree to disagree; patient safety grade was a single item rating on a 5-point scale from excellent to failing. For all three measures higher scores are better. Cronbach alphas in previous studies were (Blegen et al., 2009; Sorra & Nieva, 2005) .

The items included whether the community felt patients get good care, it is a good hospital for minor health issues, they would rather go here than a larger hospital, it is a desirable hospital, if services are available at a larger hospital they want ours, there is good care coordination across settings, and they would recommend hospital to a friend or family member. These items were developed from previous studies on how QOC is measured in rural hospitals and what factors are important for QOC in rural areas Baernholdt, Jennings, Merwin, & Thornlow, 2010; Baernholdt, Jennings, & Lewis, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "We aggregated all variables to the hospitals level.

The hospitals reported employing a range of 40-241 staff nurses (N= 2299) leaving response rates from 10-41%. Of the 17 hospitals, 15 had at least five nurses respond and were therefore included in this analysis of 6 CAHs and 9 other rural In communities with CAHs, there were less people below the poverty level (p< .041) (Table 1 ). Other rural hospitals had significantly more beds and RNs than CAHs. Hospital safety culture and all nursing unit characteristics did not differ between CAHs and other rural hospitals. Both the hospital and unit safety culture dimensions were all rated high. For the nurse work environment only experience differed between CAHs and other rural hospitals. CAHs had nurses with an average of 19.7 years of nursing experience while other rural hospital had nurses with 15.2 years of nursing experience. All of the professional nursing practice areas were above the 2.5 benchmark level indicating all hospitals had good practice environments. QOC was also rated high and similar by nurses in both types of hospitals. The events report average was 3.93 across all hospitals indicating nurses had filled out events report for an error, mistake, incident, accident or deviation regardless of whether or not it resulted in harm to a patient close to 10 times in the last 12 months. However, about17% of the nurses chose the option \"prefer not to answer\" and 3% had missing data. For the community perception of hospital quality, two items were significantly higher in CAHs. Compared to nurses in other rural hospitals, CAH nurses rated their community felt their hospitals were a good hospital for minor health issues (3.34 vs.\n3.14, p < .027) and that the community would recommend their hospital to family or a friend (3.23 vs. 2.96, p < .027). Bolded values denote statistically significant difference, p <. 05; SD = standard deviations"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One of the main findings from our study is the differences in community characteristics and nurse-rated community perception of hospital quality between CAHs and other rural hospitals. CAHs had a lower proportion of people below the poverty level compared to other rural hospitals. In general, rural communities tend to have higher proportions of people who are poor compared to urban areas (Hartley, 20014) . For example, in rural areas, 33% of the population earns less than $7/hour and 24% are uninsured, compared to $19/hour and 15% respectively in urban settings (Merchant, Coussens, & Gilbert, 2006) . Between rural hospitals there were no socioeconomic differences, including percent below poverty level, between counties with CAHs and those counties with other small rural hospitals in the beginning of the Flex program (Dalton, Slifkin, Poley, & Fruhbeis, 2003) . Later studies have found that (Ona & Davis, 2011) . Further, having a CAH in a community increases total retail sale by 28% compared to communities with no CAH. This is a similar influence as having a Walmart in a community (Brooks & Whitacre, 2011) . Perhaps the CAHs in our study are in communities that were more affluent before their hospital became a CAH. Another possibility is that the CAHs in our sample have created financial advantages for their communities. These advantages include both the indirect \"Walmart effect\" and the direct effect on the health sector through possible development of collaborative delivery systems to meet community health and health system's needs as expected and encouraged by the Flex program (Gale, Coburn, Gregg, Slifkin, & Freeman, 2007) . However, overall CAHs lag behind both other rural and urban hospitals in community benefit engagement activities including having a long-term plan for improving the health of the community, a specific budget for community benefit activities, and working with other local providers, public agencies, or community representatives to conduct a community health assessment and develop an assessment of appropriate health service capacity in the community (Croll, Gale, & Coburn, 2012) . Whether the CAHs in our sample did engage extensively with their communities is not known but the nurses did feel the community viewed their hospital favorably.\nThe CAH nurses in our study described the community recognized their hospitals as a good hospital for minor health issues and the community members would recommend their hospital to family and friends. These findings are in contrast to other studies of patients' recommendation of their hospital in rural areas and hospital bypass rates of patients who live close to a CAH (Casey, & Davidson, 2010; Liu, Bellamy,& McCormick, 2007) . Casey and Davidson (2010) provider perceptions and ratings."}, {"section_title": "The nursing unit and the work environment", "text": "We did not find differences between CAHs and other rural hospitals in the nursing unit characteristics and the nurse work environment, except for years in nursing. In fact, all nurses rated their nursing units and the nurse work environment highly. The five unit safety culture dimensions were all rated well above neutral means of 2.0 (for the four item scales) and 2.5 (for the five-item scales). There are no comparisons available of ratings from studies of other rural hospitals, but our high ratings might be explained by previous findings of greater shared visions to improve quality and safety in small rural hospitals (including CAHs) (Newhouse & Morlock, 2011) . The greater shared vision is explained by the nature of smaller organizations where there is the ability of more direct interaction between all who are working there. This more direct interaction might also explain the higher ratings on the unit safety culture dimensions of Our study's incidence reporting rates of almost 10/12 months is difficult to compare with other studies which report error rates as percentages of staff that have filled out at least one report in the last 12 months. In our study, 79 % had submitted at least one report in the past 12 months which is higher than previous reports of 52% among all health care workers (Sorra, Khanna, Dyer, Mardon, & Famolaro, 2012) . However previous reports have also found that nurses are involved in more preventable adverse events than they submit reports for (Blais et al., 2013) . Perhaps our high incidence reporting rates are because the nurses feel comfortable reporting. Even though we had 17% who preferred to not answer the question and 3% with missing data, the high scores on all hospital and unit safety dimensions suggest these nurses were comfortable reporting errors in order to improve quality and safety in their hospitals.\nCompared to previous studies of rural and urban nurses, the nurses in our study had higher ratings of unit expertise which is the nurse's ratings of their colleagues' ability to collectively recognize patient problems early and initiate appropriate actions (Baernholdt & Mark, 2009 ).\nOur nurses also had higher ratings on commitment to care which is the extent nurses perceive that the nurses on their unit feel responsible for care (Baernholdt & Mark, 2009 ). The high expertise and commitment to care may have offset the nurses' lower ratings on availability of support services in these small rural hospitals.\nProfessional nursing practice ratings were all above 2.5 with nurses in CAHs scoring higher or the same (but not significantly different) suggesting all nurses in our sample felt their practice environments were good. The nurses had comparable scores as reported in other studies in rural hospitals or all hospitals except for the subscale collegial nurse-physician relationship. (Havens, Warshawsky, & Vasey, 2012) . In six studies that took place in all hospitals (with no rural-urban distinction), our nurses scored lower than nurses in five of the studies (Calarco, 2011; Eaton-Spiva et al., 2010; Lake & Friese, 2006; Manojlovich, & Laschinger, 2007; Moorer, Meterko, Alt-White, & Sullivan, 2010; Patrician, Shang, & Lake, 2010) . The exception was a rating of 2.54 in a study in a hospital in the Southeastern US which is the same area as our study. Perhaps there are regional differences in the work environment related to local education and culture. However, for the other four subscales and the composite score the nurses in our sample scored as high or higher as reported in other studies. For nursing foundation for quality care and staffing adequacy the CAH nurses scored as high or higher as nurses in Magnet hospitals (Lake & Friese, 2006) , and for nurse manager ability, leadership, and support our means in both CAHs and other rural hospitals were higher than means in Magnet hospitals (Lake & Friese, 2006) . Staffing and resource adequacy was rated well above the 2.5 level in both types of hospitals (2.83 in CAHs and 2.71 in other rural hospitals) which is in contrast to Cramer and colleagues findings where CAH nurses reported that the fluctuation in staffing patterns because of frequent floating between inpatient and outpatient units, left them feeling overextended (Cramer, Jones, & Hertzog, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Quality of Care", "text": "The nurses rated the QOC as high on all measurements. Our ratings were higher than previously reported (Aiken et al., 2012 (Aiken et al., 2012) , so it is plausible that the hospitals in our sample have high QOC despite the lack of reporting on QOC measures. To further strengthen QOC reporting from small rural hospitals, indicators relevant for these hospitals should be included in public databases. One example is transfer time because transfers happen more frequently in small rural hospitals (Baernholdt et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, our study procedure to reach staff nurses through their CNO proved difficult. Other studies, with higher response rates, have used national directories to reach the nurses directly (Aiken, et al., 2011) . The low response rate may also be partly explained by survey fatigue due to both the length of our survey and other surveys the hospital have their nurses participate in. For example, in a hospital that participates in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators or does patient safety culture surveys. Finally, the low response rate may be attributed to how that information about the study was delivered through a third party. Having local champions in each hospital might have increased our response rates.\nFurther, our sample may not be representative of nurses who chose not to respond to the survey. Our high scores in both factors that impact QOC and QOC ratings may be attributed to a positive bias in the nurses who did respond. However, as discussed, our results do compare to other studies with higher response rates and in rural and urban areas. Moreover compared to the 2004 national RN rural workforce statistics (Skillman et al., 2006) , our study sample was similar 23 in regards to gender (6% male versus 5.1% in national rural areas), had less white nurses (90% white compared to 95%) and were older with an average age of 44.6 years old compared to the rural national average of 43.1 years old. Additionally our sample had a lower percent of BSN or higher degree (27%) compared to national rural areas (32%) and urban areas (47%). It is noteworthy that our sample of nurses with less education did produce high ratings of quality.\nThis is in contrast to national findings where higher proportions of nurses with at least a BSN are associated with better rates of quality of care indicators (Blegen, Goode, Park, Vaughn, & Spetz, 2013 ) and nurses' ratings of quality (Aiken et al., 2012) . This suggests that our finding of less education yet high nurse quality ratings in small rural hospitals needs further exploration.\nFinally, the questions about community perception of hospital quality have not been examined for reliability and validity."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The CAHs in this study provided as good as or higher QOC compared to other rural hospitals. However, we could only compare nurses' ratings of QOC. There were no differences in the vast majority of factors influencing QOC. Our finding that poverty levels were lower in communities with a CAH suggests that CAHs may have a positive financial impact on the communities they live in. "}]
