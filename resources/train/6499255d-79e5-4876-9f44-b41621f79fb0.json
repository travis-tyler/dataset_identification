This report describes the age-related hearing trajectories of screened men \u0351n = 953\u0352 aged 23 to 81 years at enrollment, estimates the typical rate of change per decade in hearing sensitivity, and compares longitudinal and cross-sectional estimates of change in hearing sensitivity. The men were followed 14 years on average. The hearing trajectories, based on a mixed-effects model analytical approach to the data, provide converging evidence that hearing loss in aging is pervasive and progressive even among men initially selected for good physical health. Typically the men accrued early losses \u0351\u03fe25 dB HL\u0352 in hearing sensitivity at the higher frequencies beginning in the early 40s, but maintained hearing thresholds better than 25 dB HL for lower frequencies into old age. The average rate of change per year across frequencies and age was 0.69 dB.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Greater prevalence of hearing loss with aging is a wellestablished fact in industrialized societies \u0351e.g., Corso, 1958; Mo\u015bcicki et al., 1985; Cooper, 1994; Cruickshanks et al., 1998 Cruickshanks et al., , 2003 Helzner et al., 2005\u0352. In the United States, hearing loss is the third most common chronic condition affecting older adults \u0351Lethbridge-Cejku et al., 2004\u0352. Approximately half of the 31.5 million Americans with hearing loss are age 55 years and older \u0351Kochkin, 2005\u0352. As many as 83% of persons over the age of 70 years experience some degree of hearing loss \u0351Cruickshanks et al., 1998; Helzner et al., 2005\u0352 . Patterns of hearing sensitivity change with aging have been studied extensively using cross-sectional approaches \u0351see Divenyi and Simon, 1999 and Nelson and Hinojosa, 2006 for reviews\u0352 and short-term longitudinal studies \u0351e.g., Moller, 1981; Mo\u015bcicki et al., 1985; Pedersen et al., 1989; Cruickshanks et al., 2003; Davis et al., 1991; Gates and Cooper, 1991; Ostri and Parving, 1991; Hietanen et al., 2004\u0352. Large scale studies provide converging evidence that \u03511\u0352 hearing loss increases with age; \u03512\u0352 the prevalence of hearing loss for men older than 60 years ranges from 31. 0% \u0351Mo\u015bcicki et al., 1985\u0352 to 45.9% \u0351Cruickshanks et al., 1998\u0352 depending on the definition of hearing loss applied; \u03513\u0352 higher prevalence rates \u035176.9%\u0352 of hearing loss are found at the mid to higher frequencies \u03512.0, 4.0, 8.0 kHz; Helzner et al., 2005\u0352;  and \u03514\u0352 men have poorer hearing sensitivity for higher frequencies than women. Nevertheless, current knowledge of changes in hearing sensitivity with aging is limited given the paucity of longitudinal evidence and the known problems of inferring change from cross-sectional differences. Brant and Fozard \u03511990\u0352, reporting Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging \u0351BLSA\u0352 data, found that the cross-sectional rate of change in hearing thresholds \u03510.59 dB per year\u0352 underestimated the actual average longitudinal rate of change of 0.69-1.68 dB per year. Lee and colleagues \u03512005\u0352 examined pure-tone thresholds for 188 older adults, using a relatively large number of repeated measures \u03519.8\u0352 over a shorter duration \u03513-11.5 years\u0352 and found an average threshold increase of 1.0 dB per year at ages 60 and older. These findings, overall, suggest that hearing loss increases in older age groups.\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging \u0351BLSA; Brant and Fozard, 1990; Pearson et al., 1995\u0352 and the Veter-ans Affairs \u0351VA\u0352 Normative Aging Study \u0351NAS; Bell et al., 1972\u0352 are both longitudinal studies of the aging process \u0351Fozard et al., 1990\u0352 that have measured hearing sensitivity with approximately 10 or more years of follow-up and with large samples of men of a broad age range. In particular, Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 published audiometric data from the BLSA that described ageassociated hearing loss in normal aging for both men and women. The BLSA men were followed over nine years on average, and up to 23 years. The BLSA investigators confirmed longitudinally the cross-sectional findings that older adults have greater hearing loss for higher frequencies than for lower frequencies and that hearing loss accelerates with age. These investigators further reported that changes in hearing thresholds in men occur as early as age 30 and that hearing levels and longitudinal changes became increasingly variable with age even in a select and relatively homogenous longitudinal study sample. With the exception of a study by Lawrence et al. \u03512001\u0352 relating hearing loss to dental status, longitudinal data on hearing sensitivity from the NAS men have not been reported previously.\nThe purpose of this report is to build on, and extend, the BLSA findings for men by describing longitudinal changes in hearing sensitivity in NAS participants. In contrast to the BLSA, the NAS data are based on a larger sample of men who were followed approximately 5 years longer \u0351average 14 years; maximum 33 years\u0352. The NAS differed from the BLSA in that participants were screened for good health at the time of enrollment and a broader socioeconomic and education range was included.\nThe primary aims of this article were as follows: \u03511\u0352 to describe the hearing trajectories of men over time, \u03512\u0352 to estimate the typical rate of change per decade in hearing sensitivity, and \u03513\u0352 to compare longitudinal and crosssectional estimates of change in hearing sensitivity."}, {"section_title": "II. METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Study population", "text": "The VA NAS is a longitudinal study of aging in initially healthy men established at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic in 1963 \u0351Bell et al., 1972\u0352. Over 6 000 potential participants were recruited from the community and screened for good general health \u0351Boss\u00e9 et al., 1984; Damon, 1969\u0352 . Men \u0351N = 2,280\u0352 aged 21 to 81 years \u0351M = 42.8; SD = 9.5\u0352 were enrolled. Most men \u035176%\u0352 were 35 to 64 years old at the time of enrollment and nearly all were Caucasian. Fewer than 2% of the participants were African-American, which is less than the corresponding 3.7% African-American population for metropolitan Boston in 1970 . Most of the participants \u035186%\u0352 had a high school diploma and 26% were college graduates. Compared to the general Boston population, the participants were from higher socioeconomic strata. At the time of enrollment in the NAS, 23% percent of the participants were employed in professional or technical occupations \u0351e.g., engineers, medical technicians\u0352, 21% were managers or proprietors, 16% were skilled craftsmen \u0351e.g., electricians, plumbers\u0352, 8% clerical or sales workers, and 28% were service workers \u0351mostly policemen and firemen, but also postal couriers, janitors, etc.\u0352. Only 4% of the participants were operatives \u0351e.g., factory workers, delivery drivers\u0352 or laborers \u0351e.g., manual laborers, farmers\u0352. As is characteristic of many men born during the first third of the 20th century, the majority of the participants \u0351\u03fe90%\u0352 served in the military, and 44% of the participants saw combat \u0351most in WW II, some in Korea, and a few in Vietnam\u0352. Boss\u00e9 et al. \u03511984\u0352 provide a detailed description of the NAS sample.\nOnce enrolled, the participants reported to the NAS testing location based at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic for thorough examination, including audiometric assessment. Until 1984, men were assessed every 3 \u0351age\u0546 52\u0352 or 5 \u0351age\u03fd 52\u0352 years; thereafter until 1996 \u0351when audiometric testing ceased\u0352, all men were assessed every 3 years. Between 1962 and 1996, a total of 2 169 men received one or more such assessments, generating a total of 17 094 audiograms on the 4 338 ears. At each NAS exam, the men provided written informed consent.\nParticipants were excluded from the present study if an audiometric assessment at any time of measurement suggested evidence of hearing loss due to other than age-related causes, including at the first visit. The following exclusion criteria, akin to those of Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 , were adopted to facilitate comparisons between BLSA and NAS data and included: \u03511\u0352 unilateral loss \u0351criterion: mean threshold at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz that differed between ears by more than 10 dB HL at any visit\u0352, \u03512\u0352 conductive or mixed hearing loss \u0351criterion: air-bone gap that was greater than 15 dB HL at two consecutive frequencies at any visit\u0352, or \u03513\u0352 evidence of noise-induced hearing loss \u0351criterion: notch in the audiogram of either ear where the threshold at 3.0, 4.0 or 6.0 kHz, if 3.0 or 6.0 kHz were available, was more than 15 dB worse than at both 2.0 and 8.0 kHz at any visit \u0351Ward, 1980; Kryter, 1985; Pearson et al., 1995\u0352 . Individuals who were missing data \u0351n =27\u0352 at either 2.0 or 8.0 kHz at any visit were excluded due to inability to determine evidence of noiseinduced hearing loss in the audiogram. Similar to Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 , who excluded 45% of the BLSA sample with these criteria, of the 2 169 NAS men who took an audiometric test, 1 216 \u035156.1%\u0352 were excluded due to evidence of one or more of these types of hearing loss at any visit, leaving 953 men in the final screened sample. Among those excluded, 485 men \u035122%\u0352 had evidence of unilateral loss, 144 \u03517%\u0352 had evidence of a conductive component, and 899 \u035141%\u0352 were excluded due to evidence of noise-induced hearing loss. Many \u0351n = 310\u0352 of these individuals had evidence of multiple types of hearing loss \u0351e.g., noise induced and unilateral loss\u0352. Six-hundred-fifty-six individuals had evidence of noise-induced hearing loss singly, with no co-occurrence of unilateral loss or of conductive component."}, {"section_title": "B. Screened sample", "text": "Descriptions and data will henceforth be limited to the final screened sample \u0351n = 953\u0352 which represents initially healthy men who at each study visit were free of otologic abnormalities and audiometric noise notches based on the above criteria. Detail regarding the longitudinal follow-up for the sample is given in Table I , which lists the mean, minimum, and maximum number of years the men were followed, the number of visits, and the mean number of years between each visit \u0351visit interval\u0352 for each decade of age at the first visit.\nThe majority of the men \u035187.5%\u0352 entered the study between the ages of 30 and 59 years and these individuals had the greatest number of assessments. Men who entered the study at ages less than 30 or age 60 or older had the fewest number of assessments. The majority of the men \u035169.9%\u0352 were followed for at least 9 years. Overall, the men had an average of 14.4 years of follow-up \u0351range: 0-33\u0352, 3.6 visits \u0351range: 1-8\u0352, and 4.1 years between the study visits \u0351range: 1-14.5\u0352, which resulted in a total of 6 956 audiograms on 1 906 ears. Owing to small sample size \u0351and consequent high standard errors\u0352 for the relatively few men who entered the study in their 3 rd and 9 th decades, further findings specific to these age groups are not reported. Table II displays the distribution of the number of years the men were followed once enrolled in the study, by their age decade at entry. The bottom row depicts the total number of men in the initial age group and the far-right column depicts the total number of men who were followed for a given range of years. There were two men who were followed for 30 years or more, one of whom enrolled in the study in his 40s and the other who entered the study in his 50s. Fivehundred-fifty-one of the 953 men in the final sample were followed for 15 years or more and 454 were followed for 18 years or longer.\nThe mean age at first visit was 44.1 years \u0351SD = 10.2\u0352\nand 97.4% were Caucasian. The majority of the men had at least some college education \u035137.7% had some college experience, 15.9% were college graduates, and 16.6% had graduate-level education\u0352 and 19.4% were high school graduates with no further education. The occupation distribution of the men in the screened sample is listed in Table  III . At NAS enrollment, the majority of men were employed in civilian occupations consistent with low noise exposure. Approximately 23.1% of the men were categorized as having occupations with potential exposure to intense noise \u0351e.g., policemen, firemen, operatives, laborers\u0352; however, the proportion of these men who were actually exposed to intense noise is unknown. Occupations such as postal couriers and janitors, for instance, as part of NAS protocols were grouped with potentially noisy occupation categories, but most likely these were not high-level noise occupations. The majority \u035187%\u0352 of the men in the screened sample served in the military during wartime."}, {"section_title": "C. Apparatus and procedures", "text": "Audiologists on the VA Outpatient Clinic staff completed audiometric evaluations of participants at each visit, and participants underwent an otologic evaluation by an otologist. Pure-tone testing was conducted using three audiometers from 1962 through 1996 \u0351Beltone 15C, and GrasonStadler models 1701 and 10\u0352. The audiometers were calibrated to the standard used at the time by a certified technician on an annual basis at the minimum and the staff audiologists performed daily inspections and listening TABLE I.

During the period reported here, the audiometers were calibrated to audiometric zero in accordance to four standards. Before July 1966, the American Standards Association \u03511951\u0352 was used, followed by the International Standards Organization \u0351ISO, 1964\u0352 between 1966 and 1969, followed by the standards established by the American National Standards Institute \u0351ANSI, 1969; 1989\u0352. Corrections were made to the data to account for minor differences in calibration. Air-conduction thresholds were obtained for frequencies of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 kHz and for octave frequencies from 0.25 through 4.0 kHz for bone conduction, for each ear. Air-conduction thresholds were obtained for 3.0 and 6.0 kHz in cases where the difference between the adjacent octave frequencies was 20 dB or greater. Thresholds were determined using pulsed tones and standard psychophysical testing procedures \u0351Hirsh, 1952; Carhart and Jerger, 1959\u0352. All threshold levels are reported in dB Hearing Level \u0351dB HL, ANSI, 1989\u0352. All audiologic testing was accomplished while the participant was seated in a double-walled sound suite \u0351Industrial Acoustics Co., Bronx, NY\u0352."}, {"section_title": "D. Analytical approach", "text": "A variety of analytical approaches have been used to model longitudinal data on changes in hearing thresholds. In one of the more basic approaches, Lee et al. \u03512005\u0352 used linear regression to model the hearing data for each participant at each frequency for each ear individually, and then calculated the correlations among the regression parameters. A benefit of this approach is that the interpretation is simple; however, the use of independently estimated regression models does not adequately accommodate the unique aspects of longitudinal data, including how multiple observations on a given person are related, nor the potential bias produced by missing data, which often are characteristic of longitudinal data sets \u0351Brant and Pearson, 1994\u0352. A second approach, used by Wiley et al. \u03512008\u0352 , combined a curve-fitting procedure with Generalized Estimating Equation \u0351GEE\u0352 methods to relate hearing thresholds over a 10-year period. The GEE approach provides robust estimates of population average effects, which is useful for making inferences about group differences, but does not allow for estimation of individual variation in initial hearing thresholds and the rates of decline.\nA third approach, which has been used extensively in modeling the BLSA data \u0351Brant and Pearson et al., 1995\u0352 , is the mixed-effects model. Mixed-effects models can be used to fit longitudinal data in which the number and spacing of observations vary among the participants, and in contrast to other approaches, mixed-effects models can include participants with only a single observation \u0351Gold-stein, 1995; Singer and Willett, 2003\u0352. Mixed-effects models allow estimation of the average intercept and rates of change via the fixed effects, and for individual deviation via estimation of random effects using all data from all participants at all times of measurement, provided that there is a large sample size and large number of observations. The random effects account for individual variation in initial threshold, ear, differences in thresholds among the frequencies, and the patterns of longitudinal change. These random effects, in addition, account for the autocorrelation owing to repeated measurements on individuals and allow for unbalanced data in which individuals have different numbers of observations \u0351i.e., missing thresholds at certain frequencies at a given visit\u0352 measured at different intervals.\nWhen fitting a mixed-effects longitudinal model for change, the observed data for each participant are assumed to represent a random sample from their true hearing trajectory. All observations for every participant are retained in the analysis, contributing information to the estimation of the regression parameters at the times for which they contribute data. In the BLSA analyses, mixed-effects modeling was used to estimate hearing thresholds as a complex function of frequency, ear, age, and time.\nIn the mixed-effects model presented in Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 and replicated here, longitudinal change is represented by fixed linear and quadratic effects of time; crosssectional age differences are represented by linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of age at first visit; and the audiometric configuration is represented by linear, quadratic, and cubic terms of the natural log of the frequency. To reduce multicollinearity, study time and age at first visit were centered \u0351that is, time/age for a given individual were transformed by subtracting the respective means\u0352 at 10 and 44 years, respectively. Terms representing ear and visit \u0351to contrast first versus subsequent visits\u0352 also were included. Two-and threeway interactions among age, time, and frequency were included to allow the longitudinal patterns of change to vary with age of entry and to allow the rates of change in thresholds to vary at different ages and frequencies. To account for individual variation in rates of change, in addition to a random intercept, seven random effect terms involving ear, time and frequency were included: a main effect for ear, log frequency terms up to the cubic, and time up to the quadratic.\nIn summary, the mixed-effects model assesses longitudinal change for the sample as a whole in both ears and across all frequencies \u0351based on the fixed effects portion of the model\u0352, while accounting for individual differences around the overall hearing trajectory by including subject-specific random effects. An advantage of using the mixed-effects model approach is that each threshold estimated from the The numbers in parentheses represent the number of and proportion of policemen and firefighters who were part of the service occupation sector.\nmodel is based on observed data included in the entire screened data set \u0351i.e., all thresholds from all frequencies at both ears obtained from all participants at all visits\u0352. A second advantage is that the model accounts for missing threshold data in instances where inter-octaves frequencies were not tested at a time of measurement. This model has a disadvantage in that the presence of higher-order interaction terms makes interpretation more challenging. Because one goal of this paper was to predict changes in hearing thresholds over time, similar to Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352, the additional terms were included. The threshold levels predicted from the model were then used to estimate the age-related hearing trajectories over time and to describe the rates of change in hearing thresholds for the sample over the course of the study. To obtain cross-sectional estimates of \"change\" in hearing sensitivity, the mixed-effects model was modified to omit the terms involving time and only the data from the first visit of the participants were analyzed."}, {"section_title": "III. RESULTS", "text": "After initially fitting the full model described above, non-significant terms were eliminated. The final model contained 38 fixed effects \u0351the coefficients appear in Table IV\u0352 and also contained seven random effects: intercept, ear, log frequency terms up to the cubic, and time up to the quadratic. These random effects indicate that there was a significant degree of between-subject variability in hearing thresholds and in longitudinal change in thresholds over time \u0351likelihood-ratio tests for the inclusion of these random effects gave p values \u03fd0.0001\u0352.\nAcross the frequencies measured, hearing sensitivity was symmetrical between the ears; however, the right ear Effect Terms: Time= time since first visit, Log\u0351fr\u0352 = natural logarithm of the frequency in kHz, Age= age at first visit to represent cross-sectional age differences.\nestimated thresholds were slightly better on average \u03510.42 dB\u0352 than the thresholds for the left ear. Because there was no meaningful difference between the estimated thresholds for the two ears, the data from the right ear only are presented throughout to avoid redundancy. The estimated thresholds for the left ear can be obtained by adding 0.42 dB to the estimated thresholds for the right ear. Unlike other statistical approaches used to model longitudinal changes, there are no easily-interpretable measures for goodness of fit for mixed-effects models \u0351e.g., analog of R 2 estimate in regression models\u0352. The thresholds estimated from the model \u0351open squares\u0352 and the observed median thresholds \u0351filled triangles\u0352 obtained from the men for each age group are shown in Fig. 1 , to illustrate that the model fitted the data adequately. The observed audiograms were based on median thresholds obtained from men aged \u03ee1 year of the initial age for each decade \u03514 th -8 th \u0352. For example, for the 40 year olds, the observed audiograms were taken as the median thresholds obtained from all men with measurements at ages 39-41 years. As seen in Fig. 1 , the estimated and observed audiograms are similar for each age group. See Table V for the distribution of the observed thresholds. For comparison, Fig. 1 also displays, in each panel \u0351open circles\u0352, the median thresholds from men based on the ISO-7029 standard \u0351ISO, 2000\u0352, which are identical to Annex A in ANSI S3.44 \u0351ANSI, 1996\u0352, and will be discussed later. Because the model fitted the observed data well, thresholds estimated from the model will be presented in the sections that follow. Figure 2 presents the estimated audiometric trajectories for each age group \u0351i.e., 30s, 40s,\u2026, 70s\u0352 at initial testing and over 15 years of follow up. The 30s-70s panel at the bottom right illustrates the estimated audiograms based on the data for the first visit. In each age group panel, the top line represents the initial estimated audiogram for men in that age group, and the successive lower lines are the estimated audiograms at 3-year intervals, with the bottom line representing the estimated audiogram of the same men 15 years later. The data indicate a marked increase in hearing thresholds evident at frequencies of 1.0 kHz and above, particularly for the older ages \u0351e.g., 70 years\u0352, suggesting that hearing loss accelerates with increasing age, particularly for higher frequencies. This is particularly apparent in the comparison of the 30s-70s estimated audiograms within the bottom right panel of the figure."}, {"section_title": "A.

Hearing loss was evident at 6.0 and 8.0 kHz in the 40s, at 4.0 kHz in the mid-50s, at 3.0 kHz in the 60s, and at 2.0 kHz in the late 60s. The ages at which the modeled hearing thresholds were first \u03fe25 dB HL were 40, 43, 51, 59, and 70 years of age for frequencies of 8.0, 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, and 2.0, respectively. For 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 kHz, estimated mean thresholds approached, but did not exceed, 25 dB HL. Standard errors ranged from 0.7 to 4.9 dB. The standard errors were lowest for estimated thresholds for lower frequencies and younger ages and highest for estimated thresholds for higher frequencies and ages, as expected. The percentage of participants in each age decade who had estimated right ear hearing thresholds greater than 25 dB HL, as modeled using data for the first visit, is presented in Fig. 3 as a function of frequency. As expected, the onset of hearing loss \u0351i.e., thresholds greater than 25 dB HL\u0352 affected fewer of the participants at the younger age decades and the greatest proportion of participants at the older decades. For each frequency, the percentage of participants who had estimated thresholds above 25 dB HL increased with each decade, particularly for the higher frequencies. In fact, approximately 20% of men in the 4 th decade had hearing loss at 4.0 kHz while approximately 80% of those in the 8 th decade had hearing loss at this frequency. None of the men aged 30-39 had hearing loss at 0.25 kHz in contrast to nearly 30% of the men aged 70-79.\nThe hearing thresholds of men who had no evidence of otologic pathologies or audiometric noise notches at any point during the study are reported. As with previous studies, the current results demonstrate that hearing thresholds are greatest for higher frequencies in older individuals and that hearing sensitivity for low frequencies was relatively preserved. The data from this study provide further evidence that changes in hearing thresholds were gradual and progressive and not limited to higher frequencies or to older age. The data, in fact, suggest that hearing loss, as indicated by thresholds greater than 25 dB HL, occurs at higher frequencies as soon as in the early 40s and at 3.0 and 4.0 kHz in the 50s.\nCompared to the men in the BLSA sample, as reported by Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 , the hearing sensitivity among the NAS sample was worse \u0351by approximately 2 dB at lower frequencies and approximately 5 dB at higher frequencies\u0352. Given that both study samples were screened for otological disorders and evidence of noise-induced hearing loss in a similar fashion prior to the analysis, the somewhat poorer hearing thresholds of the NAS participants may result from differences between samples in exposure to noise and changing health conditions over the course of the study.\nIn relation to noise exposure, relative to the BLSA \u03518.1%\u0352, this NAS sample included greater numbers of men \u035123.1%\u0352 in occupations that may have involved exposure to excessive noise. It is plausible, however, that some men categorized as having traditionally noisy occupations \u0351e.g., skill/craft, service, operatives\u0352 were assigned to positions with minimal or limited noise exposure \u0351e.g., desk/ administrative position\u0352. In contrast to the BLSA sample, where extent of military service is unknown, 88% of the NAS screened sample reported wartime military service. A significant proportion of men in the BLSA cohort also may have had military service histories, as was common for men in the early 20 th century. A report evaluating threshold differences in veterans and non-veterans in the Beaver Dam Study sample, however, revealed no significant differences in thresholds at any frequency \u0351Noe et al., 2002\u0352. The history of recreational noise exposure for the current screened sample and for the BLSA sample is unknown. Because men in the NAS study enrolled at differing ages, some men with noiseinduced hearing loss may have been included in the screened sample because they did not exhibit an audiometric noise notch while enrolled in the study.\nEligible participants in the NAS were screened for general physical health at their initial visit only, including selfreported hearing loss in both ears; however, the BLSA participants had no formal health criteria for inclusion until 1990 Over the course of their participation, the NAS participants in the screened sample may have experienced health declines or developed other risk factors for hearing loss including cardiovascular disease, smoking, and ototoxic medication use \u0351Wiley et al., 2001\u0352, particularly at older ages and/or with greater number of study visits. Differences in the health screening and development of health conditions over time, therefore, may account for observed differences between the BLSA and NAS samples, particularly because the current NAS sample is based on the screened data of more participants \u0351953 vs 681\u0352 with more times of measurement \u03513 478 vs 3 200 audiograms\u0352 and over a longer duration \u0351periods up to 33 vs 23 years\u0352 than the BLSA report. While individuals were excluded from entry into the NAS if they were not in generally good physical health at that time, some participants in the screened sample had hearing loss \u0351i.e., thresholds greater than 25 dB HL; see Fig. 2\u0352 , because initial threshold level was not an exclusion criterion. Lastly, there were differences in the psychophysical procedures used for obtaining thresholds between the two studies. The NAS employed a bracketing procedure with 5-dB step sizes \u0351Carhart and Jerger, 1959\u0352 whereas the BLSA employed the Bekesy psychophysical procedure, which provides greater measurement precision.\nLee \u03511995\u0352, however, found that the thresholds for the BLSA men generally were comparable to those in the ISO standard. The NAS hearing thresholds \u0351observed and estimated\u0352 are mostly consistent with the ISO standard at the ages illustrated in Fig.  1 ; however, at the higher frequencies the estimated thresholds for participants in the 30s, 40s, and 50s are poorer than those in the ISO standard. These findings are in accord with other studies that have found the ISO standards to underestimate thresholds at the higher frequencies in middle age. The factors considered above, that may account for the differences between the BLSA and NAS thresholds reported here, also may account for the differences in thresholds between the NAS men and the ISO standards. In all, the observed thresholds are similar to the ISO-7029 Annex C median thresholds which, according to ANSI S3.44 \u0351ANSI, 1996\u0352, are \"identical\" with the values in its Appendix A for men screened for otologic disease."}, {"section_title": "B. Rate of change", "text": "Based on the mixed-effects model, the annual rate of change of hearing thresholds over a ten-year interval was calculated. Figure 4 shows the average estimated annual rate for each age group for each frequency. The average rate of change per year across frequency and age was 0.69 dB \u0351median= 0.60, range= 0.08-1.57\u0352. For 0.25 kHz, the rate varied little over the lifespan. For 0.5 and 1.0 kHz, the rate accelerated primarily over the 6 th through 8 th decades. For the frequency range 2.0-4.0 kHz, the rates increased roughly in a linear fashion through the 8 th decade. For the frequencies of 6.0 and 8.0 kHz, the highest rate occurred in the 7 th decade with subtle deceleration in estimated rates of change in the oldest men. The mean rate of change across decades was 0.29, 0.27, 0.37, 0.59, 0.75, 0.89, 1.11, and 1.27 dB per year for frequencies of 0.25-8.0 kHz, respectively. The mean rate of change collapsed across frequencies was 0.37, 0.50, 0.71, 0.90, and 0.98 for the 4 th through 8 th age decades, respectively. Overall, these findings suggest that the rates of change increase as frequency increases and that hearing loss accelerates with increasing age; however, rates of change vary as a function of frequency and age. Figure 5 gives a comparison of the average annual change in hearing thresholds based on the longitudinal trajectories described above and the trajectories based on a single cross-sectional view of the first visit data from each participant. The cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories are consistent, with only minor differences between the trajectories, \u05450.26 dB \u0351mean absolute difference= 0.13, median= 0.13, range= 0.01-0.26 dB\u0352, for all frequencies for ages 30 through 60 years. However, the rates of change for frequencies of 2.0 kHz and above for the 70 year olds show that the cross-sectional data lead to a slight misestimate of the average yearly change in hearing thresholds by as much as 1.07 dB at 8 kHz. For the 70 year olds, the differences between the cross-sectional and longitudinal annual rates of change were 0.42, 0.71, 0.88, 1.04, and 1.07 dB for frequencies of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 kHz, respectively, which are indicated in Fig. 5 with the gray symbols. The larger misestimations for the 8 th decade may be a result of the crosssectional data being based on fewer participants \u0351n =15\u0352 with first visits in this age group relative to the other age groups. In summary, the average annual rates of change estimated from the cross-sectional and longitudinal threshold data overall are consistent across all frequencies for the 4 th decade through the 7 th decade, but the former misestimate the annual rates of change by \u03f31.0 dB for the 8 th decade in the higher frequencies."}, {"section_title": "C. Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "This report describes the longitudinal progression of hearing loss for a large screened sample of men enrolled in the VA Normative Aging Study and joins a relatively sparse literature on longitudinal effects \u0351Brant and Gates et al., 1990; Pearson et al., 1995; 2003; Wiley et al., 2008\u0352. In this section, these findings are discussed, and related to the previous literature, including the BLSA. Some limitations of the current sample and analytic approach are considered and avenues for further research are suggested."}, {"section_title": "B. Annual rate of change", "text": "In the current study, the annual rate of threshold change was greatest for higher frequencies and was lowest for low frequencies. The rate of change at 0.25 kHz remained relatively stable with increasing age. The rate of change of thresholds between 0.50-4.0 kHz accelerated with increasing age. For the highest frequencies \u03516.0 and 8.0 kHz\u0352, the rates of change accelerated through the 7 th decade then deceler-ated at the oldest ages. These data are consistent with the rate of change data for men in the BLSA, reported by Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 , and for men in the Framingham Heart Study, reported by Gates and Cooper \u03511991\u0352. On the other hand, the current data are contrary to findings from Wiley and colleagues \u03512008\u0352 and from Lee and colleagues \u03512005\u0352, who found that, for the older age groups, the rate of change among men was greater for low frequencies than for higher frequencies. The similarities in the rate of change data between the NAS men and the BLSA men may be due to the similarities between the screening of the two samples and the statistical methodologies. The rates of change from the NAS sample may differ from those for the Beaver Dam sample \u0351Wiley et al., 2008\u0352 because of the differences in statistical methods, and from those for the Lee et al. \u03512005\u0352 study owing to the shorter length of follow up and smaller sample size for the latter and differences in statistical methodologies. Overall the patterns of annual rates of change increase with increasing frequency and age, suggesting that aging differentially affects the portions of the auditory system responsible for low versus high frequency hearing \u0351i.e., basal versus the apical portions of the cochlea\u0352; these effects remain to be understood fully. Generally, the impact that auditory risk factors have on age-related changes in hearing sensitivity likewise remains to be understood fully."}, {"section_title": "C. Longitudinal and cross-sectional estimate comparisons", "text": "Longitudinal studies enable the direct measurement of change with aging. Consequently, investigations of how hearing sensitivity changes across the lifespan are best accomplished using longitudinal approaches \u0351Brant and Pearson, 1994\u0352. Cross-sectional estimates of hearing sensitivity, however, are easier to obtain than longitudinal measurements. A goal of the current study was to compare these two types of estimates over a 10-year period. The findings \u0351see Fig. 5\u0352 suggest that cross-sectional measures of average threshold change in dB per year slightly misestimate the longitudinal trajectories as a function of age and frequency, at least in a screened sample of men. The mean absolute value of the difference in annual rates of change between crosssectional and longitudinal estimates of hearing levels averaged across frequency and age after 10 years in this study is 0.21 dB \u0351median= 0.14, range= 0.01-1.07 dB\u0352, which is smaller than that reported by Pearson et al. \u03511995\u0352 at 3.5 dB. The extent to which cross-sectional trajectories approximate longitudinal trajectories may depend on the degree to which longitudinal study participants, if not screened on a continual basis, subsequently develop diseases or risk factors that could affect hearing and would be most prevalent at older ages. Overall, based on the findings of the BLSA and the current report with NAS data, hearing levels predicted from cross-sectional data may generally well approximate hearing levels estimated from longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This report documents longitudinal changes in hearing sensitivity in a large screened sample of men and joins a relatively sparse literature on hearing loss progression with aging \u0351Brant and Gates et al., 1990; Pearson et al., 1995; Cruickshanks et al., 2003; Wiley et al., 2008\u0352. These results indicate that initially healthy men accrue marked losses in hearing sensitivity for higher frequencies as early as in their late 40s; demonstrate declines in hearing sensitivity for the mid-range frequencies \u03512.0, 3.0, 4.0 kHz\u0352 in their mid 50s to the late 60s; and maintain hearing sensitivities that are better than 25 dB HL at the lower frequencies \u03510.25, 0.5, and 1.0 kHz\u0352 into old age. The rates of change accelerate across frequency and age with modest deceleration at the oldest ages and highest frequencies \u03516.0 and 8.0 kHz\u0352. Cross-sectional estimates of change in hearing sensitivity approximate the longitudinal trajectories for all frequencies and at most ages reliably, but may yield slight misestimates at ages 70 and higher, particularly at higher frequencies.\nThe thresholds from the current sample, although highly screened for evidence of otologic pathology and noiseinduced hearing loss, are slightly poorer than thresholds reported from BLSA men modeled using the same approach, and than those in the ISO standard. Because pure presbycusis is rare in industrialized societies and noise exposure in daily life is increasingly commonplace, even among demographically advantaged individuals, future research to disentangle the mechanisms and impact of risk factors on age-related hearing changes may employ different exclusion criteria to facilitate greater generalizability to modern aging populations."}]
