Unless otherwise specified, the published data represent estimates of total enrollment in science and engineering (S&E) programs in approximately 11,598 graduate departments at 602 institutions in the United States and outlying areas. All eligible institutions were included in the survey population in the years 1988 through 1995. From 1984 through 1987 the surveys were conducted on a stratified random sample basis, with all doctorate-granting institutions, all master's-granting historically black colleges and universities, and all land-grant institutions included in the certainty stratum. The remaining master's-granting institutions were divided into two sample strata on the basis of enrollment size. Data for sampled institutions for the years 1984-87 were reestimated in 1988 on the basis of 1983 and 1988 data. During the 1989 survey cycle, S&E field definitions were reviewed and some departments were deleted. Data for 1975 through 1988 were adjusted to conform to the revised definitions. In 1992, the citizenship categories requested were modified to conform to those used in other surveys conducted by NSF, the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and others. Prior to that time, permanent residents (those who held green cards but had not yet been granted U.S. citizenship) were to be included in \"Foreign\"; in subsequent years these individuals were included in the \"U.S. citizens\" total and reported according to racial/ethnic background. For these reasons, and because institutions may revise their data for earlier years, only the latest trend data should be used in historical analyses. To meet the needs of those interested in more detailed data of a specific type, NSF has developed a series of Supplementary Data Releases focusing on specific data topics. The supplementary tables as well as the full report are available through the Division of Science Resources Studies World Wide Web site (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm).

Included are data for all branch campuses, affiliated research centers, and separately organized components such as medical or dental schools, schools of nursing, public health, etc. The survey universe consisted of 722 reporting units at 602 graduate institutions. Included were 257 master'sgranting institutions and 465 reporting units associated with 345 doctorate-granting institutions. The National Science Foundation has collected data on graduate science and engineering (S&E) enrollment and postdoctoral appointees since 1966. From fall 1966 through fall 1971, data from a limited number of doctorate-granting institutions were collected through the NSF Graduate Traineeship Program, which requested data only on those S&E fields supported by NSF. Beginning with the fall 1972 survey, this data collection effort was assigned to the Universities and Nonprofit Institutions Studies Group and was gradually expanded during the period 1972-75 to include additional S&E fields as well as all institutions known to have programs leading to the master's or doctorate degree. Because of this expansion, data for 1974 and earlier years are not strictly comparable with 1975 and later data. Technical Table 1 shows the number of institutions, reporting units, and departments at each level included in the data, as well as the total enrollment reported for each year between 1966 and 1995. No attempt has been made to inflate the data for 1966-74 to reflect universe totals. Beginning with the 1984-85 academic year, master's-granting institutions were surveyed on a sample basis. The fall 1988 survey included the entire survey population for the first time since 1983-84. For each year since 1988, any institutions that begin S&E master's or doctoral programs are added to the survey universe and any that close all their S&E graduate -programs are deleted. (See Survey Methodology, below.) Technical Tables 2 and 3 present data on departmental coverage by S&E field for doctorate-granting and master's-granting institutions for the last 8 years surveyed."}, {"section_title": "THE SURVEY INSTRUMENTS", "text": "The Survey Questionnaire on which data were reported in fall 1995 was identical to the fall 1994 version, except for changes in the instructions to clarify some data items. Each survey package also included the following items: 1. an enclosure detailing mailing package contents; 2. a flyer explaining NSF's academic S&E surveys; 3. cover letter to survey coordinators at graduate schools or at medical schools; 4. cover letter to departmental respondents; 5. a computer-generated List of Departments or Programs (NSF Form 811) specific to each institution surveyed and based on the departments known to exist in the previous survey cycle; 6. a \"crosswalk\" showing National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) instructional program codes corresponding to each S&E field as defined by NSF; 7. a \"How To Avoid Common Survey Errors\" sheet with guidelines for avoiding the most common mistakes made in the graduate student survey; and 8. a postcard acknowledging receipt of the survey and requesting the respondent to indicate changes in coordinator name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY METHODOLOGY", "text": "The survey packages were mailed out by November 30,1995. The final survey universe consisted of 722 responding units at 602 institutions. The acknowledgment postcard requested that institutional coordinators indicate how the data were collected, whether the data were maintained centrally or collected from individual departments, and whether Missing data for partially nonrespondent departments were imputed using the departments' previous year's data, where available, or data from peer institutions in cases where data had not been reported the previous year. Data for nonrespondent departments (departments that did not provide any data) were imputed using data from the previous year, where available. The number of departments in doctorategranting and master's-granting institutions that required total or partial imputation and the numbers and proportions of full-time and part-time graduate students and postdoctorates imputed are shown in Technical  Tables 5 and 6. Imputation rates by survey data item are provided in Technical Table 7."}, {"section_title": "CHANGES IN DATA ITEMS", "text": "Although NSF has attempted to maintain consistent trend data, some modifications in the survey questionnaire have been made to respond to changing issues over the past 15 years. As a result some data items are not available for all institutions in all years. Major changes in the data collected are as follows: From 1975From through 1977, data for master's-granting institutions were collected on a short form (i.e., an abbreviated form of the survey) that did not collect data on sex or citizenship of graduate students, nor any data on postdoctoral appointees. In 1978 a similar questionnaire was sent to doctorate-granting institutions, but master's-granting institutions were not surveyed. In addition, the 1978 questionnaire did not collect data on mechanisms of support for full-time students. All mechanisms of support data for that year were combined on one line and appeared as \"other types of support\" in any data tables. The 1978 figures shown in the tables for master's-granting institutions represent estimates based on 1977 and 1979 data. Beginning in 1979 the long form (i.e., the full-scale survey form) was sent to both doctorate-granting and master'sgranting institutions. Distribution by sex was originally requested only for full-time graduate students at doctorate-granting institutions. Beginning in 1976 master'sgranting institutions were requested to provide data on all graduate students by sex, and in 1977 similar data were requested for all graduate students in all institutions. The short form used in the 1978 survey did not request any information on sex; figures in the tables represent estimates based on 1977 and 1979 data. Citizenship data were collected only for graduate students enrolled full-time in doctorate-granting institutions through 1977. No citizenship data were requested on the short form used for master'sgranting institutions in 1975 through 1977 and for doctorate-granting institutions in 1978. Data on citizenship of all full-time graduate students are available beginning in 1979 and on those enrolled part-time since 1983. Racial/ethnic data were first requested in 1979 and became a standard item on the questionnaire in 1980. \"Fellowships and traineeships\" were combined on one line until 1979, when separate data on the two mechanisms were first collected. \"Other nonfaculty research staff with doctorates\" were combined with postdoctoral appointees until 1979. Separate data on students receiving their primary support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture were first requested in 1985. Racial/ethnic data by sex were first requested in 1993 and became a standard item on the questionnaire in 1994."}, {"section_title": "DATA REVISIONS", "text": "During the fall 1988 survey cycle, the criteria for including departments in the survey universe were tightened, and all departments surveyed were reviewed. Those departments not primarily oriented toward granting research degrees were no longer considered to meet the definition of science and engineering. As a result of this review, it was determined that a number of departments, primarily in the field of \"social sci-ences, n.e.c.\" (not elsewhere classified), were engaged in training primarily teachers, practitioners, administrators, or managers rather than researchers; these departments were deleted from the database. This process was continued during the fall 1989-95 survey cycles and expanded to ensure trend consistency for the entire 1975-95 period. As a result, total enrollments and social science enrollments for all years were reduced. The net effect of adjustments over the years is shown in Technical Table 8. During the same period, the survey methodology changed so that an institution's highest science and engineering degree in the current year would apply to all previous years that the institution was surveyed. Since a number of master's-granting institutions have become doctorate-granting institutions, the combined effect has been a smaller decrease in enrollment at doctorate-granting institutions than at master's-granting institutions, and for the years 1975-76 and 1991-92, an increase in enrollment at doctorate-granting institutions after subsequent-year modifications. The definition of \"medical schools\" was revised during the fall 1992 survey cycle to include only those institutional components that are members of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Tables generated after the fall 1992 survey differ from their counterparts in earlier years in that they exclude schools of nursing, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and other health-related disciplines, and should not be compared with tables from earlier years.
