[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Homework is generally one factor that has been discussed and claimed to have a relationship with achievement; it has a central role in providing students with opportunities to continue learning out of the school. This study forms one of crosscultural investigations that analyze the links between homework variables and achievement in mathematics. Data was drawn from TIMSS database 2015, including 477 schools and 73,987 eighth grade students from 10 Arab countries. Analysis showed that the majority of Arab students spend less time doing homework (less than 60 minutes) and do not need to take homework every day to strengthen their knowledge and get better scores in mathematics. Two-level analyses revealed that different associations were seen in most of Arab countries between homework time, homework frequency, computer use, and internet use in doing homework with achievement in mathematics. The result was interpreted in terms of the consistency between instruction and homework evaluation."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Students' progress in mathematics has consequences on country's growth around the globe (Baker & LeTendre, 2005; Phan et al., 2010) through preparing students with quantitative skills and raising stronger foundations to skills for lifelong learning. Mathematics provides useful tools that enable students to understand science, technology, and engineering. As a result, mathematics achievement becomes a central source of information (Schleicher, 2002) and has commonly shared interest among educators, parents and others involved in making decisions about students' academic achievement.\nClearly, obvious efforts were taken to understand mathematics achievement and identifying the contextual factors across educational systems that contribute to high\nInternational Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 occasion that improves the student's feeling of responsibility, study independently, and self-regulation (Ekici, 2014) . As a consequence, students develop their study habits effectively and can show that learning can take place at home as well as school. Students may get the high efficiency from homework when he or she is capable to accomplish the homework successfully (Ekici, 2014) , receives feedback, and perceive it in a way appropriate for the subject introduced in the classroom. Lamb and Fullarton (2000) using TIMSS database concluded that, in Australia, although student characteristics influence differences in achievement in mathematics, classroom and school factors also contribute considerably. Constantly, In 2001 Lamb and Fullarton compared US and Australia using TIMSS database, the results revealed about one-third of achievement variation in the US was accounted by classroom factors and about onequarter in Australia, suggesting the impact of compositional and organizational variables of the classroom. The results have important implications on the improvement of achievement in mathematics.\nTeachers' factors do matter, In the US; teachers of more experience enhance higher levels of achievement. Also, their method on homework, measured by the time amount they locate for homework, has effect on achievement after controlling for other factors (Lamb & Fullarton, 2001 ). Dettmers, Trautwein, and Ludtke (2009) conducted a cross-cultural comparison analyzing 2003 cycle data which obtained from 231,759 students in 40 countries participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Findings of the two-level analyses showed a significant positive relationship between the students' scores in mathematics and the amount of time spent doing the homework at the group level, but no clear relationship at the student level across the countries. The association was decreased significantly after controlling other school and students' background. In most countries at the student level, Dettmers, Trautwein, and Ludtke found an opposite negative relationship between homework time and achievement in mathematics, which indicates that when students spend less time on mathematics homework than their colleagues in the class they tend to get higher scores on mathematics test. Mikk (2006) revealed that there was a relationship between mathematics scores obtained from TIMSS 2003 and teachers' styles of assigning homework, also more exercises were effective in elevating achievement. Murillo and Martinez-Garrid (2014) claimed that homework must be integrated in lesson routines by using the knowledge and skills accumulated through homework during the next lessons. If teachers want to increase the amount of homework, they are advised to do so when homework is used to teach new concepts. Authors recommend the duration must not exceed half an hour a day in Latin America primary schools.\nAnother direction of researching homework focusing on parent's involvement while their kids are solving the homework (Cooper, Lindsay, & Nye, 2000; Falch & R\u00f8nning, 2011 , Rudman, 2014 Margolis, 2015) , Rudman (2014) brings out the need to understand the student's motivation and parent's involvement to consider proper approaches that meet kids expectations. Also, studies have examined another aspects regarding homework, e.g. getting help for doing homework through phone calls (Reach & Cooper, 2004) or online homework (Rochelle, Feng, & Murphy, & Mason, 2016) . Evidences showed an increase in students' performance when they use paper type for homework. This supports the teachers' practices and explains why they still use this method (Sp\u0103t\u0103relu, 2017) . Valle, et al. (2016) found a positive relationship between school achievement and the homework quantity, time management being related to homework quantity, type of approaching homework being related to time management. Other researchers connected homework quantity to characteristics such as family's socio-economic level; motivation to learn (R\u00f8nning, 2010; Dettmers, Trautwein, & Ludke, 2009 ) and parent's involvement while doing homework (Farrell & Danby, 2013; Margolis, 2015) . Rudman (2014) claimed over the fact that homework is not investigated sufficiently. He brings attention to the need for more research to understand the roles of different variables to homework. Dissimilar opinions at the international level and the variables effect homework emerged according to the country where the study is conducted in.\nAlthough homework has been a focus of research for many years, the strength of its relationship with achievement is not yet fully clear. A number of studies have generated contradicting findings; significant, insignificant, positive, and negative effects of homework on achievement, studies showed that homework increases students' scores (Cooper, Robinson, & Patall, 2006; Rowell & Hong, 2002; Cheema & Sheridan, 2015) . Mau and Lynn (2000) used data of 20,612 tenth grade students obtained from the American National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) to study the link between weekly hours doing out of school homework and achievement. Mau and Lynn noted higher mean scores for males on mathematics and science tests. Female students reported doing more homework out of school than male students and higher positive correlations were consistently found for females than for males when the amount of time for doing homework is associated with test scores. The results could suggest that homework is an essential contributor to achievement for female students compared with their counterpart of males. Kitsantas, Cheema, and Ware (2011) used the US sample involved in a national survey, 5,200 high schools students, and the findings showed a negative significant correlation but weak coefficient that exists between time spent on doing homework and achievement in mathematics. Males and females did not differ significantly in terms of the relationship between time spent on homework and achievement.\nStudents believe that technology facilities and internet can enhance learning from homework and let them experience a great pleasure. Researchers (Dodson, 2014; Hopkins, 2005; Bafile, 2005) perceived technology use as one of the factors that increases students' motivation and raises their achievement while doing homework. Salend et al. (2004) pointed out that teachers use websites to support the understanding of homeworks, e.g. list of assignments, assessment rubrics, facilitate creating group work, provide access to extra information, and provide opportunity to raise any problem International Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 they face online. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based instruction varies across educational Arab systems, especially in terms of the level of access in schools and usage outside the schools. Computers are dedicated to assist instruction in classrooms and in some cases for administrative purposes. However, studies show that some Arab countries are still lag behind in utilizing ICT in their education systems (Wiseman, Abdelfattah, & Almassaad, 2016) .\nAccording to Ekici (2014) , students must be provided with opportunities to locate resources such as library, internet, references and further sources that belong to the subject. Cooper et al. in 2006 categorized types of studies that were conducted to explore the effects of homework on achievement into three types. One type which used experimental designs found positive effects of homework; the second type which used data from cross-sectional studies or high-school database found positive significant associations when controlling confounding variables; the third type which used bivariate correlation coefficient between homework and performance found that most correlations were positive. Cooper et al. noted design flaws in some of those studies investigated the relationship between homework and achievement.\nExamining the previous literature shows the importance of ongoing research in mathematics achievement to explore ways geared to improve performance across countries. Also, Dettmers, Trautwein, and Ludtke (2009) argued that some evidences concerning the homework-achievement relationship may differ across countries. The advancement in educational research field enables researchers to illuminate new ideas to improve educational systems from theoretical and methodological perspective as well. Also, sharing ideas and learning from others build a rich opportunity for educators to advance education in their countries.\nThe educational settings in Arab countries are single-sex classrooms where male and female students are separated in schools and their teachers are from the same sex. Furthermore, differences of socialization process in school and family led Arab boys to be less critical about them and have led to higher self-concept more than expected in terms of achieving their objectives, encouraging competition, and over emphasizing marks than mastery in testing and exams (Abu-Hilal, 2008) . In this study, limitations on homework findings attained by several researchers will be considered by taking into account the hierarchical nature of the data."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of the present study is to investigate how homework (HW) variables relate to achievement in mathematics within the specific classroom in Arab countries.

To answer RQ1, table 1 divides students' responses in each country according to HW time and HW frequency. The analysis reported in table 1 shows that the highest scores in mathematics were obtained by Bahraini students. Approximately 60% of them work on assignment homeworks at least 3 to 4 times a week. From preliminary analysis, it is concluded that a small number of students in all Arab countries reported a lack of taking homework in mathematics (less than once a week or Never) except for Kuwait, where the number of students who reported a lack taking homeworks (26.9%) equals the number of students who took homework every day.\nLebanese and Moroccan students have the highest average in mathematics when teacher assigns homework 3 or 4 times a week matching the international average. Students from GCC countries except Kuwait have the highest average in mathematics when teachers assign less frequent homework approximately 1 or 2 times a week. Jordanian and Egyptian students have similar situation, they were assigned less frequent homeworks, less than once a week, when achieved their highest average in mathematics. At the opposite side, Kuwaiti students achieved the highest average in mathematics when assigned homework every day.\nThe conclusion from table 1 would be that, in all Arab countries except Egypt, students would not need to have homework every day to strengthen and deepen knowledge and skills in mathematics. Generally, from 1 to 4 times would be enough to reach the highest average in mathematics. On the same direction, students with no homework are more likely to achieve the least average in mathematics. Findings from table 2 show that the majority of Arab students spend less time doing homework (less than 60 minutes). Countries of Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and Oman showed the great benefits on achievement when spending less time doing homework. Countries of Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia got the great benefit when spending 16-30 minutes doing homework. Surprisingly, students in two countries differ from that, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, achieved the highest benefit when doing longer homeworks (31-60 minutes).\nGenerally, it can be noted that students in countries of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia prefer short and frequent homeworks; meanwhile, students from Bahrain, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates prefer short homeworks every day or at least 3 to 4 times a week. Kuwaiti students prefer short and less frequent homeworks. Two-level model analysis.\nFour models of two-level analysis that associate homework with achievement in mathematics were performed. One common way of starting the multi-level analysis is to examine a so-called null model that contains no predictors. Model 1 is the baseline\nInternational Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 model for comparisons with more advanced models. The intraclass correlation (ICC) indicates that 77.7% to 92% of the variance in mathematics scores are found in level 1 (within students), and 8.0% to 22.3% of the variance are found in level 2 (between teachers). Where Y ij is the mathematics achievement of student i within teacher j ; \u03c0 0j is the mean achievement of class j , and e ij is student effect or residual (deviation of student i from the respective teacher mean). \u03b2 00 is the mean achievement in class, and u j is class effect or residual. Model 1 results shown in table 3 explain that only 23% of the variance of mathematics achievement was between classes relative to 92% was within classes. Table 4 Multiple group analysis of a two-level modelling conducted to associate HW frequency and HW time with achievement in mathematics. International Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 To answer RQ2, model 2 was created and specified in the subsequent step. This step controls the differences in achievement levels after HW time and HW frequency were included as predictors at student and class levels. As reported in Table 4 , HW frequency had a significant negative effect at the student level in eight Arab countries and a significant positive effect at the classroom level in four Arab countries. Meanwhile, HW time had a significant negative effect at the student level in six Arab countries and a significant positive effect at the classroom level in four Arab countries. In other words, individual students who spent more time on homework and took more frequent homeworks than their colleagues scored lower on mathematics, whereas a high average of HW time and HW frequency at the class level was positively related to achievement. HW time explained 0.35% to 20.76% of the variance at level 2 and 0.18% to 6.17% at level 1. However, because other predictor variables, such as gender, were not controlled in Model 2, the homework achievement relationship identified might still be questionable. Note: B: is unstandardized regression coefficient; R = Recoded; All within-level variables are group-mean centered. *p<.05, **p<.01, ***p<.001\nTo answer the third research question, model 3 was created to examine HW time, HW frequency, Computer use, and Internet use at the level 1; and both HW time and HW frequency variables at the level 2. As shown in table 5 , not all of these variables were statistically significantly related to mathematics achievement. With the United Arab students, all variables were significantly correlated with achievement in mathematics in the two levels, followed by Qatari students who reported non-significance of HW time and computer use at the student level and HW frequency at the class level. Different associations between predictors and achievement in mathematics were seen in most of Arab countries. Similarly, at the student level, HW time and HW frequency were closely associated with achievement in different directions (positive or negative). The effect of gender was statistically significant (controlling for the other variables in the model), which means that females achieved better than males.\nThe effects of HW time and HW frequency were the particular interest in the present study. At the class level, when the additional predictors were included in Model 3, the size of the HW time and HW frequency effects decreased dramatically in almost all countries."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The current study was carried out to find the relationship between homework and achievement in mathematics using TIMSS database. Generally, it was found that longer homeworks (spending more than 60 minutes) could be seen as a source of annoyance for students. On the other side, shorter and less frequent homeworks (1 to 4 times a week) reflects an important source of improving achievement in most Arab countries. Correlations differed significantly between males and females, girls exceeding those for boys. These differences suggest that homework plays a more important role in the achievement scores of females than those of males. Although TIMSS dataset provides a unique opportunity to study the relationship between homework and achievement; it has some limitations in the current study. First, it is unfeasible to conclude the causal directions of the observed effects due to the cross-sectional design executed in TIMSS 2015. Second, variable set does not allow deep examination of the relationship between time and effort while doing homework, such variables together are important to our understanding of the homework styles.\nFrom the study findings we cannot claim that low achieving students take more time doing their homework because their prior knowledge and skill are low; or might claim that longer homeworks could indicate difficulty in concentration that result in low achievement. R\u00f8nning (2010) considered longer time spent on doing homework can be an expression of high motivation rather than problems of understanding.\nIt is widely accepted among educators and students that homework is associated with improved performance, when the two-level modeling was used to separate student level and class level effects. The analyses somewhat confirmed that the relationship between homework variables and achievement is only moderate at the class level and is in fact negative at the student level. Teachers are recommended to increase homework frequency when they rely on homework to teach new concepts. In Latin America, Martinez-Garrid (2014) recommended that homework duration must not exceed half an hour a day in primary schools. In addition, his encourage is that teachers must incorporate homework in lessons and must use the accumulated knowledge and abilities during homework into teaching.\nInternational Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 Literature in homework (Kandemir & G\u00fcr , 2009; Stefan, 2015) mentioned that the biggest need at this moment is enriching traditional methods of doing homework by introducing new modern methods that are capable to arouse students' interest, involve creativity and to develop critical thinking. Although homework can encourage students to be independent learners, it can have a negative effect on student's progress. Longer homework leads to boredom especially when it contains repetitive tasks. Also, homework can deny students to access leisure activities (Costley, 2013) . Providing feedback is one of the important factors that increase the homework efficiency.\nFrom the teacher's perspective, homework helps to condense the time secured for teaching the subject in the classroom. It helps the student to be independent and connects learning at home with learning at school.\nStudents reported that less time spent on doing homework and less frequent homeworks assigned by teachers are better and enhance achievement. One of the interpretations states that homeworks should be valued firstly by students and more weight should be given from teachers to the development of homework (Ekici, 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION", "text": "The analysis of homework relationships with achievement in Arab countries is important for education systems. The homework efficiency differs in some countries, e.g. Kuwait and Egypt. Everyday homework contributed to lower average achievement in mathematics. In other Arab countries, students achieved higher scores when assigned less frequent homeworks in mathematics. The result could be interpreted in terms of the consistency between instruction and homework evaluation.\nMost of the teachers still use the traditional methods in teaching compared with modern teaching methods (Balliu & Belshi, 2017) . They have the central and the biggest place during the class time isolating homework from learning process. In this case, students would need more time doing homework. If teachers try to make learning easier during class time and encourage students to be active in learning, this would help students do their homeworks in lesser time and more efficiently. More importantly, homework would concentrate on applying knowledge and skills acquired during class time rather than learning.\nOne of the factors that may force teachers to use traditional methods in teaching is the crowded classrooms. Teacher will not have enough time and space for each student to have an active role during the class time. Therefore, majority of the activities that should take place during class are switched to be done at home. The time given to homework should not be spent on learning, a process that should be take place during class time. Instead, homework must involve challenges that develop creativity, critical thinking, and motivate student to be an efficient learner who seeks the increment in his performance."}]
