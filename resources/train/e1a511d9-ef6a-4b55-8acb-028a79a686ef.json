[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which assists doctors in determining clinical staging and expected surgical range, has high medical value. A large number of MRI images require a large amount of storage space and the transmission bandwidth of the PACS system in offline storage and remote diagnosis. Therefore, high-quality compression of MRI images is very research-oriented. Current compression methods for MRI images with high compression ratio cause loss of information on lesions, leading to misdiagnosis; compression methods for MRI images with low compression ratio does not achieve the desired effect. Therefore, a fast fractal-based compression algorithm for MRI images is proposed in this paper. First, three-dimensional (3D) MRI images are converted into a two-dimensional (2D) image sequence, which facilitates the image sequence based on the fractal compression method. Then, range and domain blocks are classified according to the inherent spatiotemporal similarity of 3D objects. By using self-similarity, the number of blocks in the matching pool is reduced to improve the matching speed of the proposed method. Finally, a residual compensation mechanism is introduced to achieve compression of MRI images with high decompression quality. The experimental results show that compression speed is improved by 2-3 times, and the PSNR is improved by nearly 10. It indicates the proposed algorithm is effective and solves the contradiction between high compression ratio and high quality of MRI medical images.\nINDEX TERMS MRI, image compression, fractal compression, spatiotemporal similarity, lossy compression."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Medical imaging has become one of the most active and rapidly evolving fields in medical research and clinical diagnosis. Medical images display the internal structure of the human body in an intuitive form, providing clinicians with intuitive and accurate basic information on anatomy, pathology and function. Typical imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer-assisted tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), computer-assisted X-ray (CR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), et al. With continuous advancement of medical imaging technology, especially the resolution of imaging devices, the amount of medical image data will continue to grow. Existing bandwidth\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Yudong Zhang. conditions are difficult to meet the real-time transmission requirements of large data volumes. To meet effective storage and transmission of medical images, it is not only necessary to expand storage space and transmission bandwidth, but also to study how to efficiently compress medical data. Therefore, it is necessary to implement effective compression of various medical images using an image compression algorithm.\nMedical image compression methods are generally classified into lossless compression and lossy compression. Lossless compression provides medical diagnostics with image information of the same quality as the original image. However, the compression ratio of lossless compression is usually low, which is difficult to meet the actual transmission requirements of medical images. Lossy compression provides a higher compression ratio by losing some information. Increase in compression inevitably brings a certain degree of degradation to medical images. In the future of telemedicine applications, lossless compression will be difficult to provide a low bit rate required for image transmission, while relying on lossy compression to achieve real-time transmission of images. At present, lossy compression technology for medical images has become a research hotspot at domestic and international, and its research goal is to improve the reconstruction quality of images as much as possible under a given code rate.\nMRI medical images contain rich temporal and spatial correlations. As shown in Fig. 1 , three similar image blocks 1, 2, and 3 are respectively derived from three adjacent MRI medical image slices. The spatiotemporal correlation means that in a MRI image slice, its adjacent fields of a certain pixel (region) in a layer of image (several layers before and after) have a strong similar relationship with the pixel (region). This spatiotemporal correlation makes a large amount of (local) self-similar information contained in MRI images. Therefore, it is considered to compress this type of medical image using the fractal compression idea. Fractal image compression is based on Iterated Function System (IFS), omitting the image content, and only retaining self-similarity parameters of the local image content to complete data compression. It has advantages of high compression ratio, reconstruction at any scale, and fast decoding. However, traditional fractal compression algorithm fails to fully consider the spatiotemporal relationship of MRI images, resulting in inefficient and poor results. Therefore, a fast fractal-based compression algorithm for MRI images is proposed in this paper.\nIn this study, our contribution is to apply sequence image-based fractal compression method to compress three-dimensional MRI images. Besides, to get better performance of compression, we proposed two improvements. First, range blocks and domain blocks are classified according to the spatiotemporal similarity feature. A range block only needs to search for the optimal matching block in a certain type of domain block. Compression process is accelerated by reducing the capacity of matching pool. Second, the residual compensation mechanism is introduced to achieve approximate lossless compression of MRI images. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves compression efficiency under the premise of ensuring image quality of MRI.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the progress of medical image compression research from both ROI coding and non-ROI coding. Section 3 elaborates on a fast fractal-based compression method for MRI image. In Section 4, we verify feasibility of the proposed method through experiments. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our work and describes future research directions."}, {"section_title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "text": "Under application conditions such as telemedicine, the compression ratio of lossless compression is difficult to meet transmission requirements for real-time images. It is necessary to resort to a lossy compression method. At the expense of image portion information, a target bit rate required for real-time transmission is exchanged. Selective image compression technology is gaining an increasingly important role in telemedicine or medical imaging applications with large storage needs. Its production effectively alleviates the contradiction between high compression ratio and lossless compression of medical images. The compression method based on region of interest (ROI) has become an important selective image compression technology, which accounts for a large proportion in published literatures. This paper will review the research progress of medical image compression from both ROI coding and non-ROI coding."}, {"section_title": "A. ROI CODING", "text": "Medical image compression algorithm based on ROI coding first divides an image into ROI and background (BG), wherein the ROI region usually adopts lossless or near lossless compression, and the BG region usually performs a large degree of lossy compression. Bruckmann and Uhl [1] compared the performance of lossy compression based on wavelet transform and JPEG in selective image compression techniques. Experimental results show that the selective compression performance of wavelet transform was better than JPEG. Based on the ROI coding provided by JPEG2000, Tahoces et al. [2] proposed a selective coefficient mask displacement coding algorithm. The wavelet coefficients belonging to different sub-bands were shifted to implement ROI coding. Zhang et al. [3] proposed a classification method based on neural network. Hosseini and NaghshNilchi [4] proposed context-based vector quantization (CVQ) algorithm to achieve high-fidelity compression of medical ultrasound images. The algorithm used the region growing method to separate ROI and BG in an image, and then used the proposed CVQ scheme to compress the two parts separately. In the algorithm proposed by Sophia and Anitha [5] , the ROI part of an image is losslessly compressed by run-length coding, Huffman coding or arithmetic coding, and the BG part is subjected to lossy compression based on vector quantization. VOLUME 7, 2019 The algorithm proposed by Kaura and Wasson [6] used the fractal algorithm to perform lossy compression on BG, and performs lossless compression based on context tree weighting (CTW) on ROI.\nLesions in medical images and other infected sites have a more important diagnostic significance than the overall image. Schelkens et al. [7] combined the embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) coding algorithm with the multi-ROI general protocol to improve scalability of the embedded code stream. Sridhar [8] proposed a dual ROI coding algorithm for medical images in which the lesion area was considered to be the ROI, and the surrounding lesion (usually susceptible area) was the secondary ROI, giving the two ROIs different levels of priority. Hu et al. [9] proposed a multi-ROI medical image compression algorithm based on edge feature protection. The algorithm used the Canny operator to extract useful image edge information, combined JPEG2000 to reduce the ROI losslessly, and used a multi-level tree set split in hierarchical tree (SPIHT) to compress the BG. For vascular images, Firoozbakht et al. [10] proposed a compression algorithm based on context and multi-ROI coding. The algorithm divided a vascular image into a primary ROI (vascular stenosis region), a secondary ROI (other important areas of blood vessels), and BG. The main ROI usually needed to be manually selected, while the secondary ROI was automatically detected by the regional growth method. The component priority-based ROI coding method proposed by Bartrina-Rapesta et al. [11] utilized the optimal rate distortion technique and combined a simple and effective ROI code rate allocation strategy to achieve coding of multiple ROIs at different priorities.\nFor stereoscopic medical images, multidimensional wavelet transforms are typically used to remove correlations in various directions in the image. Agrafiotis et al. [12] extended 3D SPIHT algorithm to enable three-dimensional ROI coding. Wang and Cuhadar [13] proposed the use of unbalanced three-dimensional tree structure to achieve three-dimensional ROI coding of medical images, and achieved multi-ROI and multi-quality control. Victor et al. [14] proposed an improved threedimensional scalable compression algorithm for medical images based on the optimal volume of interest (VOI) coding. Nguyen et al. [15] proposed an efficient compression algorithm using hierarchical vector quantization and motion compensation. The algorithm used three-dimensional motion estimation to create uniform pre-processed data, and used a three-dimensional compression algorithm based on hierarchical vector quantization to compress the pre-processed data. Sanchez [16] proposed a lossy compression algorithm for medical images based on multiple 3D ROI. The use of joint source channel coding enabled multiple three-dimensional ROIs to achieve higher transmission priorities in the context of wireless transmission. Sid Ahmed et al. [17] proposed an embedded image encoder based on efficient reversible discrete cosine transform (RDCT). The proposed rearrangement structure was well coupled to a lossless embedded zerotree wavelet encoder (LEZW). The background was compressed using a set partitioning algorithm in hierarchical tree (SPIHT) technology. Yee et al.

NON-ROI CODING", "text": "Sridhar and Prasad [19] combined the integer DCT-based SPIHT algorithm with context adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) to encode important coefficients of medical images. Then, only these important coefficients were transmitted instead of transmitting the entire image data, thereby achieving compression effect. Based on the curled DCT (Warped DCT, WDCT), Prabhu et al. [20] proposed a 3D warped DCT (3D WDCT), by means of which a complete medical image compression scheme was presented. Bhavani and Thanushkodi [21] compared the performance of several fractal coding algorithms on MRI compression, including fractal coding standards, quasi-lossless fractal coding, and improved quasi-lossless fractal coding. Based on this, a novel quasi-lossless fractal compression algorithm was proposed, which effectively retained important features in the image. A machine learning method was used to reduce encoding time of the algorithm and improve compression performance. Juliet et al. [22] proposed a medical image compression algorithm based on Ripplet transform, which introduced an anisotropic Ripplet transform to represent singular points on an arbitrary shape curve, and encoded its important coefficients by SPIHT algorithm. Automatic and accurate classification of MRI images is important for the analysis and interpretation of these images. Zhang et al. [23] combined two successful techniques: pseudo Zernike moment and kernel support vector machine to pathological brain detection. This approach performed better than eleven state-of-the-art smart pathological brain detection methods in three open datasets.\nIn addition, Juliet et al. [24] proposed using sparse representation to explore the geometrical rules of image structure, and based on this, proposed a medical image compression algorithm. Geometric flow indicated the direction in which the gray level of the image changed regularly. The image was further refined along the direction of geometric flow by Bandelet transform. Bandelet coefficients were encoded by SPIHT algorithm, and then the global thresholding process combined with fixed coding was performed. Selvi and Nadarajan [25] proposed a fast compression method for four-dimensional fMRI images. The method utilized data recombination, Contourlet transform, and improved binary array technology. The test results for fMRI showed that performance of the algorithm was better than SPIHT or SPECK, and had lower complexity. Zhang et al. [26] proposed an MRI image classifier based on Particle Swarm Optimization and kernel support vector machine. Juliet et al. [27] proposed a projection-based medical image compression algorithm. Discrete radon transform (DRT) was used to effectively represent direction information of the image, and RANHT was used to encode Randon transform coefficients. The test results for MRI and CT showed that compression performance of this algorithm was better than other types of SPIHT algorithms.\nPatbhaje et al. [28] proposed a medical image compression technique based on adaptive scanning wavelet differential reduction (ASWDR). ASWDR technology utilized different wavelet filters and achieved different compression efficiencies based on unique sparse characteristics. Selvi and Nadarajan [29] proposed a fast two-dimensional lossy compression technique using wavelet-based contourlet transform (WBCT) and binary array technique (BAT) for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Pathak et al. [30] analyzed various prediction methods using spatial correlation properties of neighborhood pixels to minimize prediction errors. Experimental results showed that the support prediction method improved compression ratio and maintained marginal PSNR and minimum absolute error. The new method proposed by Amri et al. [31] combined image reduction and extension techniques, digital watermarking and lossless compression standards such as JPEG-LS (JLS) and TIFF formats. Zhang et al. [32] developed a novel machine learning system that automatically diagnoses Alzheimer's disease from MRI images. Parikh et al. [33] established an acceptable HEVC compression range for medical imaging applications based on established medically acceptable JPEG 2000 compression ranges. The complexity of diagnostically acceptable lossy compression and high depth medical image compression was investigated.\nFrom the above review to research progress of medical image compression, it can be seen that the ROI-based compression method has received extensive attention and has a large proportion in published literatures. Purpose of introducing ROI coding is to protect some of the information useful for subsequent medical diagnosis under limited transmission bandwidth conditions. Transform-based method has been widely used in medical image compression. The currently used transformation method is still DWT. The adoption or design of more advanced transformation methods is expected to further improve compression performance. The proposed method improves compression speed of MRI images while ensuring image quality. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this method."}, {"section_title": "III.

Moreover, continuous m-layer MRI images are combine them into one large image matrix for overall compression. The 'codebook' is expanded from a single frame image to a number of consecutive frames. When matching a range block, it is no longer limited to a single frame. Make full use of the inter-frame correlation to expand the matching pool.

In this way, each class of range blocks only needs to perform matching search in the same class of domain blocks, for example, the m-th range block class C Rm and the m-th domain block class C Dm is matched. The matching process between different classes of range blocks is performed independently. Reduction of matching range effectively reduces encoding time.

Compression ratios of Complete 1Yr is higher than that of BWT-MTF algorithm. PSNRs of the three MRI images are higher than the BWT-MTF algorithm. Unfortunately, compression time of proposed method is greater than the BWT-MTF algorithm. This is a flaw of fractal compression algorithm.

Proper compression of medical images reduces the amount of data transferred. Compressed data is then stored and transmitted. It not only saves storage space, but also improves transmission efficiency and shortens transmission time during remote diagnosis. Thereby promoting the development of medical care. In addition to retaining important information in medical images, increasing the compression ratio and decoding ability of compressed images is a major problem in medical image compression.\nIn response to the above problems, we propose a fast MRI image compression method based on fractal. First, threedimensional MRI image is converted into two-dimensional sequence image. The sequence image-based fractal compression method is used to compress it.
