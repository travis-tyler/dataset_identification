[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the average global mean (or ''eustatic'') sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 mm per year from 1961 to 2003 and at an average rate of 3.1 mm per year from 1993 to 2003, and the global mean sea level rise (SLR) by 2100 could be as much as 60 cm (IPCC, 2007). A continued global mean SLR has been referred by various studies (Walton Jr., 2007;Williams et al., 2008;Feldman, 2008;Gill et al., 2008;Batten et al., 2008). It has been reported that the sea level is not only rising, but also accelerating (Douglas, 1997). Recently, Sallenger et al. (2012) identified the evidence of acceleration in SLR at tide stations along the northeast Atlantic coastal region. Boon (2012) also found a similar trend of SLR acceleration in the 20th century and the first 11 years of the 21st century in the U.S. East Coasts and the Canadian Atlantic Coasts. Williams et al. (2008) have mentioned that there are at least two primary factors contributing to the present rate of global mean sea level rise: thermal expansion of ocean surface waters, and the melting of glaciers as well as their runoff to the oceans. They also pointed out that vertical movements of coastal land surface, due to tectonics, isostatic adjustment of the crust, compaction of sediments, etc., can contribute significantly to the local (or relative) sea level change. Measuring SLR is a complicated process due to varying land subsidence rates (Gibeaut, 2007), as well as the regional climatic and oceanographic variability. In addition to traditional tide gauge observations, more accurate elevation data can be measured from altimetric satellites, such as TOPEX/Poseidon, by eliminating uncertainty of subsidence in some tide gauges (e.g. Douglas and Peltier, 2002;Lee et al., 2009). Global mean SLR does not translate into a uniform rise in local sea level in coasts and estuaries around the world. Considerable variation often exists between global and local changes over a range of temporal and spatial scales. For example, based on available tide gauge data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the mid-Atlantic coast, Cooper et al. (2005) obtained an approximate relative sea-level rise trend of 3.53 mm/yr during the 20th century, which is almost double the global-mean value of sea-level rise. In general, the local sea-level change can be determined by the sum of global mean sea-level rise, regional sea-level change due to meteo- oceanographic factors (i.e. atmospheric pressure, storm surge, wave set-up, and ocean circulations), and vertical land movement (Nicholls, 2003). The continued rise of the local sea level poses many problems along the developed coastal regions. Local SLR can cause permanent inundation and displacement of coastal lowlands, increased flood and storm damage, increased erosion, and saltwater intrusion (Nicholls, 2003). After the sea level rises, extreme events at coasts such as high tides, tropical storms, typhoons, and hurricanes may increase the occurrence and magnitude of flooding and inundation, shoreline erosions, local scouring, and barrier island breaching (e.g. Cooper et al., 2005). SLR may also increase the susceptibility of coastal populations and ecosystems due to drastic changes of coastal zones. Nicholls and Lowe (2004) estimated that this continuous trend of SLR may lead to retreat of millions of people, severe damage to coastal infrastructure and property, and a considerable loss of coastal ecosystems by the end of the 21st Century. SLR will modify current hydrodynamic and morphodynamic features at coasts and estuaries, due to increasing of wave setup, tidal prisms and currents, and shoreline changes (e.g. Douglas, 1997). The variation of this effect depends on bathymetry, tide ranges, as well as properties of wave and wind. Due to nature of multi-scale and unsteadiness in coastal hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, this effect can be predicted by using integrated coastal/ocean processes-based models. The modeling processes and parameters have to be properly based on flow conditions since the modeled conditions represent projected future scenarios beyond the calibrated conditions (ASCE Task Committee on Sea Level Rise and Its Effects on Bays and Estuaries, 1992). Validated computational processes-integrated models can be applied to assess the SLR impacts on a local/regional scale coast. For the purpose of coastal flood management and infrastructure planning, it is essential to take into account SLR under dynamic storm/hurricane conditions for assessing temporal and spatial variation of SLR impact on coasts and estuaries (Ding, 2011). The study of SLR-related impacts has been performed in previous studies. Based on the selected long-term tide gauges on the East Coast of the United States, it has been found that along the Atlantic coast of the U.S., over the last century, relative sea-level rise rates have ranged between 1.8 mm/yr to as much as 4.4 mm/yr (US-CCSP, 2008). The highest rates (4.4270.16 mm/yr) have been observed in the mid-Atlantic region between northern New Jersey and southern Virginia. Based on the regional SLR, US-CCSP (2008) proposed three projected SLR scenarios (0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m of SLR by 2100) to evaluate several aspects of SLR impacts for the mid-Atlantic US coast using a range of elevation data sets which have large variations in vertical resolution and horizontal accuracy. Cooper et al. (2005) also applied digital elevation models (DEM) to study the impact of projected sea level rise to the New Jersey coast. They used two relative sea level rise projections, 0.61 m (2 ft) and 1.22 m (4 ft) to study what areas could be chronically inundated. By comparing with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) tidal surge frequency for 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100-year flood water levels for Atlantic City, New Jersey, they found that sea-level rise will allow current flood levels to be exceeded and low-lying lands to be flooded with increasing frequency. In the case of 0.61 m of SLR, the current 30-year storm will produce a flood water elevation of 2.96 m, which exceeds the current 100-year FEMA flood level (2.90 m at Atlantic City). After a 1.22 m of SLR, the current 5-year storm will cause water levels above the current 100-year flood level. In other words, provided that other factors being equal, New Jersey's current 100-year flood levels could become the 30-year flood level after a 0.61 m sea-level rise and the 5-year flood level after a 1.22 m rise. Bromirski et al. (2012) concluded that if relative mean sea level along the California coast reaches global mean sea level rise projections, extreme flooding events expected to occur once in about 100 years under stationary relative mean sea levels will occur annually. Local SLR has been detected by analyzing long-term tide records. For example, the so-called permanent service for mean sea level database (PSMSL, 2012) provides a global data bank for long-term sea level change information from tide gauges and bottom pressure recorders. NOAA also provides long-term tide records and sea level trends at tide gauges in the coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (NOAA, 2012). In the northern Gulf coasts, for instance, at Grand Isle, Louisiana and Dauphin Island, Alabama, which are located in the study area, the sea level trend observed by NOAA are 9.24 mm/yr and 2.98 mm/yr respectively (NOAA, 2012). The projection shows that local SLR at the two stations could be 92 cm and 30 cm, respectively, in 100 years. The impacts of sea-level rise can be assessed in different purposes and ranges of spatial scales. In a global or regional scale, some case studies are driven by policy making (e.g. Nicholls et al., 1999;Nicholls, 2004;Schleupner, 2007); some are more scienceorientated to examine the methodologies that can transfer scientific knowledge into decision making tools (e.g. Cooper et al., 2005;Capobianco et al., 1999). Local/regional assessment of impacts of sea-level rise usually is required for coastal hazard management in coastal zones (e.g. USACE, 2011), for which the variation of waves, tides, and geomorphology has to be included. For example, to assess the changes and variability of coastal flooding potential in California over 2000-2099, Bromirski et al. (2012 employed the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) wave model (Tolman, 1999) and ocean wave projections derived from global climate model (GCM) output fields. They found that wave activity provides the primary driving force for coastal flooding. Their assessment results also indicated that the incidence extreme wave heights in deep waters would not increase also with SLR. However, the primary SLR impacts on coastal hydrodynamics such as waves and currents, as well as morphological changes due to sediment transport and increased storm waves have not been fully studied. It should be noted that the reliability of the sea-level rise assessment results strongly depend on the accuracy of the coupled physical process models. Reliable and high accuracy of integrated models relies on rigorous model validations for all the submodels for waves, currents, sediment transport, and morphological changes. As for assessment methodologies, the contour-line projection approaches and downscaling techniques (e.g. Wilby et al., 2002) to assess sea-level rise can only give an average estimation (most likely underestimation) of the impacts. Further accurate numerical simulations are needed to include the nonlinear variations of other physical factors of coastal/ocean processes such as storm surge, wave, tide, etc. along with sea-level rise. Therefore, the paper presents applications of an integrated coastal/ocean process model, CCHE2D-Coast (e.g. Ding et al., 2006;Ding and Wang, 2008a), to assess the SLR impact on flooding/inundation and morphological changes under the hydrological conditions of storms at two different scales of coasts. The first one is a small-scale estuary in Taiwan, for which a set of sea-level rise scenarios and local extreme hydrological forcing including waves, tides, river floods, and sediment transport are taken into account. The second one is to predict hydrodynamic responses (i.e. waves and storm surges) to SLR and hurricane in a region-scale domain covering the Mississippi and Louisiana coast. This study does not estimate SLR; instead, it uses different hypothetical local SLR scenarios, which are broadly based on recent SLR forecasting studies, to predict variations of coastal dynamics such as water elevations, waves, and morphological changes. Before applying to simulate SLR impact, CCHE2D-Coast has been validated by simulating waves, storm surges and morphological changes by using local hydrological conditions in the two coasts. Then, by assuming five hypothetical SLR scenarios (i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 m, and a case without mean sea level change), this model is used for predicting the variations of water levels, waves, and morphological changes due to a typhoon or a hurricane event. Prediction results are used to investigate the trend of water elevations, waves, and morphological changes in the two different scales of coasts and estuaries with respect to the assumed static SLR. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: a brief description of an integrated coastal/ocean processes model, which is used in the study, is presented in Section 2. Then validations of the integrated model by simulating hydrodynamic and morphodynamic variations in the two coasts are given in Section 3. In terms of this validated model, in Section 4, prediction results of water levels, waves, and morphological changes in response to the five hypothetical SLR scenarios are presented and discussed. Finally conclusions are given in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "A brief description of an integrated coastal/ocean processes model", "text": "CCHE2D-Coast, an integrated coastal/ocean processes model is used for simulations of coastal/ocean processes under the conditions of static SLR in this study. As shown in Fig. 1, this integrated model consists of three major process-based submodels, i.e. wave, current, and sediment transport and morphological change models. The wave model of CCHE2D-Coast simulates irregular wave deformations including refraction, diffraction, wave breaking, windinduced energy input, whitecapping, etc. The current model is capable of computing storm winds, surges, tide, wave-induced currents, river flows, and wave-current interaction. The sediment transport and morphological change model is to compute sediment transport capacities and morphological changes due to combined waves and currents driven by river flows, tidal flows, and nearshore currents. This integrated modeling system has been developed in the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering (NCCHE) at the University of Mississippi. CCHE2D-Coast has been extensively verified and validated (e.g. Ding et al., 2006;Ding and Wang 2008a, b). It has been utilized to simulate the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes induced by combined hydrological forcing such as storm waves, tides, river flood, as well as sediment transport from river reaches to coasts, estuaries, and the offshore (Ding et al. 2007). The integrated model has been built in a software package called CCHE2D (Jia et al., 2002), with a user-friendly interface, CCHE2D-GUI (Zhang and Jia, 2009). It is important to note that all the modules share one grid system for simulating coastal/ocean processes in sequence. Thus, unlike the model steering operation used in some storm-surge models, CCHE2D-Coast does not need to switch executable codes of the modules. As a result, this model avoids possible errors and loss of information due to interpolation and extrapolation of the results between different grid systems for different process models. The mesh of CCHE2D-Coast is non-orthogonal, which allows general structural quadrilateral grids. This structural mesh can model irregular coastlines in a more flexible way, in comparison with a rectangular mesh. In addition to the unified mesh, implicit numerical schemes for solving all the governing equations of wave, current, and morphological change models make this integrated model efficient and capable of running simulations in a standard laptop computer with a relatively short computational time. The three submodels for computing waves, currents, and morphological changes are briefly described as follows:"}, {"section_title": "Wave model", "text": "A wave-action model is used for computing multidirectional spectral wave transformation. This wave model includes wave transformation and deformation processes such as refraction, shoaling, diffraction, wave breaking, wind-induced energy input, whitecapping, etc. It produces statistical variables of irregular waves such as significant heights, periods, and mean directions. The governing equation of the wave model is a wave energy balance equation, i.e. where N \u00bcN(x,y,s,y,t), wave action density, t is the time; x, y are the horizontal coordinates; y is the wave angle relative to the x-direction; e b is the local rate of wave breaking energy dissipation, Q is the source term which represents generation due to wind, wave-wave interaction, and energy dissipation due to bottom friction; C is the wave celerity and C g is the wave group celerity; v x , v y , v y \u00bc energy transport velocity, of which three components in space and frequency are: Details on the wave model for simulating storm hurricane waves can be found in Ding and Wang (2011).

Holland's hurricane wind-pressure model (Holland, 1980) is used for generating hurricane wind and pressure fields by giving hurricane track information. The surface wind stress is computed using a conventional bulk formula in which the drag coefficient is calculated by using an empirical formula (Large and Pond, 1981). Ding et al. (2012a) have reported a comprehensive study on the model validation by simulating winds, waves, and storm surges of Hurricane Gustav in 2005."}, {"section_title": "Sediment transport and morphological change models", "text": "The variation of seabed elevation Z b is calculated by considering the local sediment balance and the downslope gravitational transport: where q \u00bc(q x ,q y ) is the local sediment transport rate; and e is the empirical coefficient of downslope gravitational effect. The bed evolution is described by a divergence term at the right hand side and the other two terms for the anisotropic downstream gravitational effect. According to Watanabe et al. (1986), the local sediment transport rate has two contributions from wave and current: where q w and q c are the local sediment transport rates due to wave and current, respectively, which includes bed load and suspended sediment load; t m is the maximum bottom shear stress which has been modified to consider the difference of the stress in river flows and nearshore currents (see Van Rijn 2007for more details); t c is the critical shear stress; A w is an empirical coefficient related to grain size and fall velocity; u b is the wave orbital velocity at the bottom; A c is an empirical coefficient for sediment transport rate due to current. F D represents the direction function ( \u00bc \u00fe1 for onshore, \u00bc \u00c01 for offshore). The governing equations of these three mathematical models, i.e. Eqs. (1), (3), (4), and (5) are solved by implicit numerical schemes. The shallow water Eqs. (3) and (4) are solved by using a timemarching fractional step method (Jia et al., 2002). The time-step size of simulations of hurricane-induced storm surges can reach up to several minutes. By coupling with wave simulations, a week-long wave-current simulation for a real hurricane event only takes less than 2 days in a personal computer with a 2.90 GHz CPU. Detailed descriptions of numerical solution schemes and boundary conditions of tides and waves can be found in Ding et al. (2006) and Ding and Wang (2008a). 3. Case study 1: hydrodynamic and morphodynamic response to SLR at the Touchien Estuary, Taiwan The first case is to predict flooding/inundation and erosion at a small-scale estuary located the east coast of Taiwan Strait, called the Touchien Estuary, induced by a set of sea-level rise scenarios and local extreme hydrological forcing including waves, tides, river floods, and sediment transport. As shown in Fig. 2(a), this estuary has a 1.0-km wide river mouth, a river mouth bar, two islands inside the bay, and two rivers (Touchien and Fengshan Rivers). Due to hazardous weather conditions by typhoons and river floods, the local coastal community around the estuary with a dense population is constantly threatened by coastal flooding and inundations, as well as channel refilling in harbors and property damage by shoreline erosions. During storms or typhoons, this small-size estuary has equally important hydrodynamic and morphological processes driven by tides, storm waves, surges, and river floods. The morphodynamic processes are therefore driven by multi-scale physical forcing such as river flows, tidal currents, nearshore currents, and wave breaking across the surf zone. Tseng et al. (2010) investigated the sealevel variation in the regional seas around Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait. Using long-term tide-gauge and satellite altimetry data, they found a SLR rate ( \u00fe5.3 mm/yr) around Taiwan during the period from 1993 to 2003, which is significantly larger than the global mean SLR ( \u00fe3.1 mm/yr) during the same period. Assessment of the local SLR impact on the hydrology and morphology around the estuary needs to consider the dynamic conditions of storms or typhoons through this region. Before applying CCHE2D-Coast for assessment of the local SLR and storm . Comparison of water elevations during the typhoon events at the tide gauge of the Hsinchu Harbor (the location is shown in Fig. 1(a)). conditions, this model was validated by simulating hydrodynamics and morphodynamics around the estuary driven by real storm/typhoon events from 2004 to 2006, for which the validation results are given as follows."}, {"section_title": "Model validation in the Touchien Estuary", "text": "To validate CCHE2D-Coast and further investigate floods and morphological changes due to the local SLR, a computational domain covered by a non-orthogonal grid with a size 167 \u00c2 133 was used, as shown in Fig. 2(b). A non-orthogonal structural grid with quadrilateral cells was generated by the CCHE2D mesh generator to cover the entire estuarine and coastal area. Fig. 2(b) shows a close-up view of the non-orthogonal mesh in the estuarine area in which several stations are marked for model result outputs. The grid size at the river mouth varies from 10 m to 30 m. Through simulating the long-term morphological changes from 2004 to 2006 in which 9 typhoon events (i.e. Mindulle, Aere, Haima, Haitang, Matsa, Talim, LongWang, Bilis, and Kaemi) were included, the CCHE2D coastal model was validated in this study area. To do so, the bathymetrical of the estuary obtained from the field observations in 2004 were used to generate initial bed elevations in the computational mesh. The boundary conditions for modeling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes include the hydrographs of inflows at the upstream of the two rivers, tidal elevations at the offshore, offshore incident wave properties, wind forcings, sediment properties in the river and sea beds, and the sediment transport rates from the two rivers. Two hydrographs at the two inlet cross-sections of the Fengshan and Touchien rivers (i.e. St. 3 and St. 5) have been obtained by performing a one-dimensional (1D) watershed flow simulation from far upstream of the two rivers to the estuary under the same hydrological condition of the flood waters during the computational duration from 2004 to 2006 (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3(b), the peak discharge of 5343 m 3 /s occurred at 14:00, 8/5/2005 in the Touchien river in Typhoon Matsa (2005). As a result, the river flood generated by storms/typhoons in the region is a major factor to induce the inundation and morphological changes in the estuary. The boundary conditions of tidal elevations and wave properties at the offshore in the 3-year simulation from 2004 to 2006 were prepared beforehand by using a regional-scale storm-surge model (a Princeton Ocean Model (POM)) (Blumberg and Mellor (1987)) and the SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) wave model (SWAN, 2008). The offshore incident wave properties, i.e., the significant wave heights, the periods, and the mean directions,  were provided by the measurements and the extracted results from the simulations by the SWAN model. The significant wave heights were usually lower than 2.0 m in most typhoons and flood events in the coast. However, the maximum wave height of 4.21 m at the offshore happened in Typhoon Bilis in the July of 2006. In the wave transformation simulations, the Bretschneider-Mitsuyasu (B-M) wave spectra were used to specify the wave energy spectra at the offshore in all the wave transformation simulations by the CCHE2D-Coast wave model. According to the grain size measurements, a uniform grain size, d 50 \u00bc0.2 mm, was used for representing the coastal sediments in the domain. A modified Watanabe's total load sediment transport formulation was used to calculate sediment fluxes from rivers to the coast. One may refer to Ding et al. (2007) for the details of the sediment transport model. The initial conditions of the currents and water elevations were obtained from the steady flow with the constant discharges and the first wave action under a non-tide mean sea level (MSL) situation. In the wave-current-morphology iterative simulations, by updating the water elevations, bed elevations, and the water depths obtained by the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic simulations, the wave field was updated after every one-hour hydrodynamic and morphological computations. The effects of wave breaking and wave diffraction (Ding et al. 2006) were considered in the irregular wave simulations, in which the coefficient for including the wave diffraction was set to 2.5. The time interval for the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic modeling was 2 s. A critical shallow water depth of 5 cm was used to determine if dry cells should be wetted. Due to lack of observation facility at this estuary during the 3-year period of model validation, one tide gauge is located at the breakwater tip of the Hsinchu Harbor as shown in Fig. 2a. Comparison of water elevations at this tide gauge station is presented in Fig. 4, in which the datum is the local mean sea level. It shows that the computed water elevations during the typhoon events match with the observations. Two snapshots in Fig. 5 show respectively (a) the computed significant wave heights and mean directions and (b) the computed currents and water elevations at the peak flood in Typhoon Aere. The computed flow field includes tidal currents, nearshore currents, and river floods from upstream. Therefore, the flow results represent the highly complicated multi-scale hydrodynamic processes in the estuary, which can quantify coastal flooding, river mouth bar breaching, and interactions of tidal and nearshore currents. The long-term simulation results about the water elevations reproduced the coastal flooding during the nine typhoon events happened in the 3 years. The highest water stage, 12.27 m, occurred at the Touchien river inlet cross-section in the peak discharge of Typhoon Matsa. At the same time, the water stage at the Beiliao Island was 5.78-m high. The coastal morphodynamic process model was validated by comparing the computed morphological changes with the measured data. The observation area in 2006 covered most the estuarine and coastal areas and the tidal reaches of the two rivers. The measured bed elevation changes over the 3-year longterm period (2004)(2005)(2006) were obtained by comparing their measurements in 2006 with those initial values in 2004. In validation of the coastal morphodynamic process model, the calibration of empirical parameters related to the morphodynamic model has been conducted. To do so, the computed bed elevation changes at ten selected stations as shown in Fig. 6(a) were compared with the measured bed changes at the these locations. These stations are located at the most interesting areas for morphological changes in the estuary: for example, St. 1 and St. 5 at the sand bar of the river mouth, St. 2 and St. 3 at the head of an island in the Touchien River, Sts. 7, 8, and 9 at the Touchien River, St. 10 at the Fengshan River, and St. 4 at the south bank of the river mouth. Meanwhile, only two empirical   parameters were calibrated: an empirical parameter (B w ) to calculate sediment transport rate (see the definition in Ding et al., 2006), and the coefficient of downslope gravitational effect (e) in Eq. (5). As a result, the site-specific calibrated parameters were obtained: B w \u00bc3.0, and e\u00bc10.0. Fig. 6(b) shows the comparisons of the 3-year bed changes at ten selected observation stations (in which the labels are the station numbers). It indicates that an excellent agreement between the simulations and observations were obtained at these major locations of the estuary. To compare the spatial distribution of the bed changes in the entire estuary, the measured and simulated morphological changes over the 3 years are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. On the basis of a visual comparison of the two figures, it is found that the long-term morphodynamic simulations adequately reproduced the erosion and breaching occurred in the river mouth bar, as well as the offshore bar development; only the simulated offshore bar in the on-off shore direction is wider than the measurements. The simulated morphological changes in the Touchien River give almost the same size and range of deposition and erosion as the measurements in Fig. 7(a), but the morphodynamic simulations in the Fengshan River reach show some overestimated deposition. Furthermore, Fig. 8 compares the computed bed changes with the measurements at the mesh nodes in which the bed changes are greater than 5 cm. It was found that the average absolute error of bed changes is 737.0 cm. It implies that the predication accuracy of this integrated model is acceptable for the engineering practical applications. As a result, although long-term coastal/estuarine morphodynamic simulation under complex hydrological and morphological conditions is still a great challenge to engineering applications of most existing numerical models, the CCHE2D-Coast model does reproduce most important morphological change features in the estuary with an acceptable accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses to SLR at the Touchien Estuary", "text": "In order to examine the impacts of SLR during storms on the estuarine area, a real storm (Typhoon Talim), which attacked the area during a period from 8/31/2005 to 9/2/2005, was used as the storm event for the study. The storm flood inflows from the two rivers were applied to the two river inlets as the river inflow boundary conditions. As shown in Fig. 9, the two hydrographs at the inlets of the two rivers were produced by simulating the watershed flow from far upstream down to the estuary using a 1-D river flow model. The peak discharge was 2013.67 m 3 /s in the Touchien River and 992.66 m 3 /s in the Fengshan River, respectively. In this study, the validated CCHE2D-Coast was applied to simulate flood flows and morphological changes in the estuary due to this selected storm event (i.e. Typhoon Talim in 2005) and five hypothetical SLR scenarios (i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 m, and a case without mean sea level change) to reflect the increases of mean sea level. The mean SLR cases can be considered as the different scenarios of tidal elevations at the open sea. Therefore, the SLR was added to the measured tidal elevations during the storm period to simulate the tides under the conditions of the SLR. Fig. 9 also presents time series of tidal elevations at the present mean sea level. As the boundary conditions of wave model at the offshore, the wave properties (i.e. significant heights, averaged periods, and mean directions) were provided by wave simulations using the SWAN wave model. As shown in Fig. 10, the offshore incident significant wave heights varied in the range from 0.5 m to 1.6 m during the storm event. Fig. 11 shows the time series of prevailing wind speed and direction during the storm event which has been used in this study as surface wind forcing over the estuary. The wind speed varied from 0.3 m/s to 16.4 m/s. The initial conditions for simulating the SLR scenarios were generated by running the model with tidal and river inflow boundary conditions and no morphodynamic process for a sufficient-long period to create spun-up sea status for different SLR scenarios. Fig. 12 shows the spatial distributions of computed wave parameters (i.e. significant wave heights and mean directions) at the flood peak (t \u00bc12 h) under the different SLR conditions. Along with the increase of the flooding area in the estuary from the current sea level (no SLR) to 2-m SLR, the offshore waves could invade the estuarine area from the river mouth toward the upstream river reaches. In comparison with the case for the current sea level as shown in Fig. 12(a), sea level rises from 0.5 m to 2.0 m promote the invasion of offshore waves inside the estuary for longer periods. This invasion of wave to the estuary can further alter the morphological features inside the estuary area which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. Fig. 13 shows the comparison of the computed currents and water elevations at the flood peak due to the different SLR cases. The results show that there are significant increases in water elevations, offshore surge water invasion inside the estuary, and widening inundation areas along with the increase of SLR. Furthermore, the river mouth bar is increasingly inundated by overflowing waters for a longer period. The intercomparisons of water elevation time history at seven different monitoring stations (the locations are labeled in Fig. 2(b)) in the five SLR scenarios are shown in Fig. 14. As mentioned above, the datum of water elevations is the local mean sea level. These stations represent the offshore (St. 7), river mouth (St. 6), three upstream cross sections (Sts. 1, 2, and 4) and two inlet locations (Sts. 3 and 5). Furthermore, the differences of water elevations generated by the five SLR scenarios at four stations (i.e. Sts. 1, 2, 3, and 6) are shown in Fig. 15. The following remarks can be summarized from these results: (1) there are obvious wet/dry cycle change at all upstream monitoring stations (Sts. 1-5) due to the increases in SLR. For example, by comparing Fig. 14(a) with Fig. 14(b), the high tide water started to reach St. 1 and St. 2 when the SLR reaches to 0.5 m. This tidal effect is propagated toward upstream by SLR as plotted in Fig. 13(c) (SLR \u00bc1.0 m) and Fig. 13(d) (SLR \u00bc2.0 m). Finally, both the river reaches could become tidal under a SLR of 2.0 m. (2) As it can be seen from Fig. 15(a), there is an increasing inundation at the river mouth bar due to SLR; and the river mouth begins to behave like an offshore area after the SLR is equal to and higher than 1.5 m. 3The upstream river area is more susceptible to the tidal effect as it is shown in Fig. 14(c), (d) and Fig. 15(d). For example, as shown in Fig. 15(d) for the Touchien River inlet, the increase of sea level promotes the invasion of tidal waves inside the rivers, elevates the water levels in river reaches, and the tidal effect may even influence farther upstream. The morphodynamic processes are complicated in the estuary due to the existence of the two interior islands, which affect the river course and the spatial distribution of the erosion/deposition. As depicted in Fig. 16, simulated morphological changes over a 2-day hypothetical storm event ( Fig. 9) indicate erosion/deposition areas in the estuary, river mouth, and the adjacent coasts due to different SLR. It shows the gradually reducing areas of deposition in the offshore of the river mouth when SLR increasing from current sea level to 2.0 m mean sea level. This is because the increased water depth can slow down the sediment transport at the offshore. Fig. 16 also shows that with the increasing of sea levels, the river mouth bar is increasingly eroded, which consequently will cause a significant landward displacement of the shoreline. Furthermore, the new river mouth bar may migrate to the junction area of the two rivers in the estuary. Fig. 17(a) presents the profiles of bed changes at the river mouth along with the transect A-A 0 shown in Fig. 16(d) after the storm flood under the different SLR scenarios. Fig. 17(b) plots the changes of width of the river mouth bar along with the SLR scenarios. The width of the river mouth bar was measured at the level of 0.0-m bed elevations. It indicates that the river mouth could be narrowed at 1.0-m SLR, and the river mouth widening process could be accelerated after the sea level rises up to 2.0 m. The numerical simulations show that the widening process of the river mouth is not linearly varying with the SLR scenarios; the river mouth could be quickly eroded at a certain high-level of SLR. This is because sea level change will alter wave breaking zone and longshore littoral zone. If mean sea level rise is not enough to significantly change the wave breaking location at the river mouth, the morphological changes would not show a mean direction (i.e. significant erosion or deposition). But if SLR (e.g. SLR \u00bc2.0 m) causes sufficient deep water over the sand bar, most waves would break behind the sand bar. Therefore, sediments from nearshore and river upstream would not be able to deposit at the top of the original river mouth; the original river mouth bar will be constantly eroded by flood and tide currents; possibly, a new sand bar may be growing at a close upstream. This means that SLR will certainly cause variation of morphology at estuaries and coasts, but the trend of the variation also depends on the local geometry and hydrological forcing applied to the area. As a result, due to the nonlinear features of sediment transport, morphological change in coastal and estuarine waters is, in general, not proportional to the increase of mean sea level at the offshore. Hurricane Gustav is selected due to the availability of quality observed data, compared to Hurricane Katrina. The details of the study are explained in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "Study site", "text": "Gustav generated widespread storm surge along the northern Gulf coast, Florida Panhandle to the upper Texas coast, including Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana. Surges of 3.6-4 m occurred in the Mississippi river delta with surges of 2.7-3 m in other portions of southeastern Louisiana (Beven and Kimberlain, 2009). The model domain extends from 91137 0 27 00 W to 87140 0 18 00 W in longitudinal direction and from 28134 0 35 00 N to 30146 0 27 00 N in transverse direction which is approximately (440 km \u00c2 320 km) as shown in Fig. 18. The important geographical features in the domain are also shown in Fig. 18. Three major rivers that flow in the study site are the Mississippi River, the Atchafalaya River, and the Pearl River in the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The study site also includes the city of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain in LA, and the entire MS coast along with portions of Alabama (AL). The numerical numbers on the figure are the monitoring stations for retrieving computational results and observation oceanographic data. Most the stations are located at either a NOAA tide gauge or a NOAA's buoy. For the selected stations, the information such as owner (NOAA or the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)), station numbers, station official name, is given in Table 1. The bathymetric data of the Gulf of Mexico and the MS-LA coasts are provided by an existing grid in storm-surge simulations by the ADvanced CIRCulation model (ADCIRC), called the SL15 mesh. It has been used to study storm surges in the Gulf of Mexico for Hurricane Katrina (e.g. Bunya et al., 2010), Rita (Dietrich et al., 2010), and Gustav (Dietrich et al., 2011). By using ADCIRC, they have obtained excellent handcasting results about wind fields, storm surges, and waves driven by those hurricanes. Additional two elevation data sources are used to generate a high-resolution mesh representing the rivers and coastal communities in Mississippi and Louisiana. The first is the USGS 10 m DEM (USGS, 2012) and the second is surveyed channel cross sections for the navigable portion of the East Peal River extending from the John C. Stennis Space Center to the coast. The river cross section data were described in McKay and Blain (2010). The topography data for the entire computational domain including the inland DEM data and the river cross section data are used to generate the present computational mesh. The datum for the vertical elevation data is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The present computational mesh, which is a non-orthogonal quadrilateral grid, consists of 2,288,064 nodes (2103 nodes in the horizontal direction and 1088 nodes in the vertical direction) and was created using the CCHE-Mesh generator (Zhang and Jia, 2009). The multi-block methodology was employed to decompose the computational domain into 17 sub-domains. Each domain was meshed separately with different resolution. The characteristic mesh size for the levees, roads and as-built hydraulic structures is 10-100 m, 100-1000 m for the Mississippi River, and 1000-2000 m for the ocean. One may refer to Ding et al. (2012b) for the details of the mesh generation. The inflows from upstream of the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya Rivers were also included in the computation. Only the daily average discharges for these two rivers are available from the USGS Water Data for the Nation website: http://waterdata. usgs.gov/nwis. The stream gage USGS 07374000 at Baton Rouge, LA, provided the daily average discharges for the Mississippi River. For the Atchafalaya River, the daily discharges were obtained from USGS 07381490 at Simmesport, LA. The discharges measured at these two stations during Hurricane Gustav were used as river inflow boundary condition. The observed tidal variation was imposed at the sea boundary. The bottom roughness coefficients, i.e. Manning's n values, are obtained by interpolating the values from the SL15 mesh data. The values in the SL15 have considered the sea bottom roughness, coastal structures (i.e. dikes, roads, sea walls etc.), and vegetation at wetland. The values of Manning's n on the inland area are set to 0.03. Though the computed results of water elevations and waves at all the stations as shown in Fig. 18 have been compared with NOAA's observations, results only for some of the stations have been reported herein for space limitation and their details are listed in Table 1."}, {"section_title": "Validation of storm-surge model by simulating Hurricane Gustav (2008)", "text": "In order to assess the impact of SLR along the MS-LA coast, Hurricane Gustav was first validated using the CCHE2D-Coast storm surge model with present day conditions. Gustav began as a tropical wave in the Lesser Antilles and rapidly intensified to form a hurricane. It was the most intense storm to hit Cuba in five decades. Hurricane Gustav decreased its strength in the Gulf of Mexico due to increased wind shear and intrusions of dry air. When Gustav made landfall at 1500 UTC on September 1, 2008 near Cocodrie, LA, USA, it was a category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale and subsequently weakened to a tropical storm. Its forward motion slowed down as it crossed southern and western Louisiana on September 1. By September 2, its status was downgraded to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana. To assure the reliability of the following SLR impact assessment, the wave and current models in CCHE2D-Coast for simulating waves and storm surges were validated by simulating Hurricane Gustav. The hurricane pressure field was computed using the parametric wind model proposed by Holland (1980) by supplying the observed (or best) track of the storm observed by NOAA, which contains the information for central air pressure, radius of maximum wind and its forward speed. The model was first spun up with the constant river discharges at the inlets of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers and keeping the water surface level in the southern sea boundary fixed at the still water level (i.e. NAVD88\u00bc 0) which is the datum level for the topography of the region. The model was run for several days in order to achieve a steady state condition. Once the steady state was achieved the daily discharge hydrographs were introduced at the river inlets and observed tidal variations were imposed at the sea boundary. In order to establish equilibrium tide condition in the computational domain, the model was run from 0:00UTC, August 15, 2008 to 0:00UTC, August 25, 2008. Once the model spin-up was completed, the best hurricane track was fed into the model and the hurricane wind model was activated. The simulation was then continued till September 3, 2008. Instead of running another deep water wave climate model such as WAM (the global ocean WAve prediction Model) (e.g. WAMDI, 1988), Young's hurricane wave spectral model (Young, 1988;Young and Burchell, 1996) is employed to calculate wave properties such as significant wave heights, mean directions, and peak periods on the offshore boundary of the computational domain. The calculated wave properties are used as the input boundary conditions of the CCHE2D-Coast wave model. Young's wave model assumes that the JONSWAP relationship (Hasselmann et al., 1973(Hasselmann et al., , 1976, originally developed for fetch limited conditions, could also be applied in hurricane wind fields with the specification of a suitable 'equivalent fetch'. Therefore, the deep water wave properties at the offshore boundary (including the significant wave height (H s ) and the peak period (T p )) are computed by the modified JONSWAP spectrum. As long as the wave parameters are calculated from Young's hurricane wave model on the offshore boundary, the multidirectional wave spectral density at every offshore boundary node is calculated based on the given hurricane wind directions and the Bretschneider-Mitsuyasu (B-M) spectrum (Mitsuyasu, 1970). For inclusion of wave setup in the simulations of storm surges, the hurricane wave field was computed at every one-hour interval. In other words, the radiation stresses were updated every one hour by using the latest information of water surface elevations and flow velocities. In the simulation of coastal and ocean currents, a large time step, 120 s was used. All simulations were performed on a PC with Intel quad core TM i7 CPUs at 3.20 GHZ. Only a single CPU was used for the simulations. CCHE2D-Coast provides two options for modeling wave actions driven by the cyclonical storm winds: a half-plane wave model and a full-plane wave model. The former is only to compute the wave fields from the upwinding direction to the downwind direction. Namely, the wave computations in the direction-frequency plane are preceded from the south to the north, following the hurricane track direction. The later one is to compute the wave fields by sweeping back and forth at the north and south directions. In terms of the half-plane operation, this 10-day hurricane simulation (August 25 to September 3, 2008), with wave computations, took approximately 40 CPU hours. The same period simulation with the full-plane took about 88 CPU hours.  compared the wave results computed by the half-plane with those by full-plane operation. They found the full-plane wave simulation only improved the waves during a short period after hurricane landfall when the hurricane wind directions turned to south. Therefore, the full-plane simulation would not change the maximum water elevations of the storm surges. The half-plane wave simulation was used for the following SLR assessment simulations. While validating the performance of the model by comparing observed and computed time series of water surface elevation, several empirical parameters were calibrated to achieve better accuracy. These parameters are the surface friction coefficient (C D ) in the surface wind shear stresses and the wind energy input parameters in the source term of the wave-action equation. By comparing with a few surface wind friction coefficient models, we have found that Large and Pond (1981) model is a good model to calculate C D in the wind stresses. The energy input by wind forcing is modeled as separated sink and source terms proposed by Lin and Lin (2004a,b). The calibrated values of the two empirical coefficients in the wind energy input term are 2.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 for the energy transfer rate from surface wind to surface water, and 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 5 for whitecapping effect. Fig. 19 compares the water surface elevations above the NAVD88 datum at different stations where observed data are available from the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). In comparison with the observations at NOAA's tide gauges, this storm-surge model reproduced the tides at all the stations. Only at St. 4, Dauphin Island, AL, the tidal range was underestimated. The water elevations are slightly under predicted during the storm period at stations 3 (Dauphin Island, AL) and 23 (Pilots Station East, LA) but the trends are similar to that of observed data. The peak at the Mobile State Docks, AL (St. 4) is slightly over predicted. The predicted water surface elevations at Sts. 6 (Pascagoula, MS) and 27 (Waveland, MS) are very close to the observed profiles. St. 28 at Port Fourchon, LA failed to measure the data during the peak hours of the storm. However, the rising and falling limbs of the computed profile follow the observed data. The model was further validated by comparing the wave parameters (i.e. significant wave height and mean wave period) observed from the NOAA National Data Buoy Center's (NDBC's) Buoy 42040 (i.e. St. 1, Luke Offshore Test Platform, AL). Fig. 20(a) and (b) respectively compares significant wave height and mean wave period during the storm. The wave height at this station is predicted with high level of accuracy. However, the wave period is over predicted and the computed peak wave period has shifted to the left but the comparison is still reasonable given the complexity and the scale of the study area. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed storm surge model is capable of predicting propagation of hurricanes in a real coast."}, {"section_title": "SLR Scenarios due to climate change", "text": "Global warming is an established fact and its effect is an increase in the global volume of the ocean and accelerated global mean sea level rise. The Fourth Assessment Report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that global SLR by 2100 could be as much as 60 cm (IPCC, 2007). Based on the long term tide gages, the relative SLR along the Atlantic coast of United States have ranged between 1.8 mm/yr to as much as 4.4 mm/yr (US-CCSP, 2008). The highest rates (4.4270.16 mm/yr) have been observed in the mid-Atlantic region between northern New Jersey and southern Virginia. The global mean SLR does not translate into a uniform rise in sea level around the world (Sallenger et al., 2012). Considerable variation often exists between global and local changes over a range of time/spatial scales. Recently, Sallenger et al. (2012) and Boon (2012) identified convincing evidence of acceleration in the relative SLR at the tide gauge stations at the northeast Atlantic coastal region of the U.S. and Canada. The sea level trend observed by NOAA at Grand Isle, LA and Dauphin Island, AL which are located in the study area are 9.24 mm/yr and 2.98 mm/yr respectively. Therefore, the predictions show that SLR at these stations could be 92 cm and 30 cm in 100 years. Such a high rate of SLR during storm periods can be disastrous for low lying area of an estuary. In order to assess the impacts of SLR during storms on the MS-LA coasts, Hurricane Gustav which attacked the area during a period from 8/30/2008 to 9/3/2008 was used as the storm event for the study. The selected storm and four hypothetical SLR scenarios (i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 m) were considered for the assessment. The hypothetical SLR scenarios were added to the measured tidal elevations during the storm period and applied as boundary condition at the sea boundary (Fig. 21). Each tidal variation with each SLR scenario was ramped Fig. 18. The study domain in the Mississippi and Louisiana Gulf Coasts with topography (unit: meter above NAVD88) and station details (maximum and minimum limits have been clipped for better view). The information of the stations is given in Table 1. up so that the transition will be smooth from the no SLR condition to the selected SLR condition and then a few cycles were added to attain equilibrium flow condition before the storm was introduced. All other boundary conditions remained the same as considered for the model validation and same model spin-up procedure was followed for all the simulations. The considered hypothetical SLR scenarios are expected to provide worst condition as far as flood inundation is concerned."}, {"section_title": "Simulation results of storm surges and waves due to SLR", "text": "SLR, which was applied as a boundary condition, together with Hurricane Gustav, caused water elevation increase in the MS-LA coasts. The increase in water elevation can be quantitatively observed through the time series plots at different stations and the maximum flood inundation plot of the study area. The time series of water elevations at different stations are shown in Fig. 22. All the stations at the MS-LA Gulf coasts show that there is increase in water elevation due to SLR and consequently more inundation takes place. However, the time series plots of Stations 16 (West Bank, Bayou Gauche, LA), 26 (Shell Beach at the Lake Borgne, LA) and 34 (the East Pearl River mouth, MS) indicate that the area surrounding these stations is projected to be severely inundated for the considered SLR scenarios. Fig. 23 depicts the increase in the maximum water elevations relative to the one at the present sea level. Except Station 16, all other stations follow a linear increase in the water elevation with respect to linear SLR boundary condition. NOAA (2012) has predicted the sea level trend based on the past observed data shows that the SLR at different locations is linear. The present predictions support the predicted trend by NOAA by which SLR at different stations will most likely be linear, with almost similar increase rate, if the SLR at the boundary is also linear. As an exception, St. 16 is located at very shallow water at Bayou Gauche, LA. Offshore tide waves are deformed significantly due to resistance of marsh near Lake Salvador. After the sea level rises up to 1.0 m, this station will be permanently wetted as the same as the other stations. This is why this station does not show a linear trend compared to the others. The variations in significant wave heights at four selected stations, i.e. Sts. 2 (the offshore of Biloxi, MS), 5 (Pascagoula Point, MS), 25 (Grande Isle, LA), and 34 (the East Pearl River mouth, MS), for different SLR scenarios are shown in Fig. 24. The peaks of the wave heights at the stations correspond to the maximum wind speed and the hurricane landfall. The wave height is maximum at St. 2 with negligible change due to different SLR scenarios because it is located in deep water of far offshore. However, the other three stations near the coasts show increase in computed wave height due to SLR. The increase in water depths along with SLR at the coastal zone will obviously convey higher waves to the shores. And the increase in wave heights for different SLR scenarios at these stations is less than the increase in water elevation. Fig. 25 further presents the changes in wave heights relative to those at the present sea level. It confirms that the deep water (St. 2) wave heights would not be affected by SLR due to global warming. But at all other stations (Sts. 5,25,and 34) in the MS-LA coasts, wave heights will be increased with respect to SLR. The increase rates at Sts. 5 and 25 (i.e. Pascagoula Point, MS and Grande Isle, LA) are slightly greater than that at the Mississippi East Pearl river mouth. In terms of the maximum water elevations, Fig. 26 plots the maximum inundation contours for different SLR scenarios. They present overall impacts in the entire MS-LA Gulf coasts and the Mobile Bay, AL in terms of maximum coastal flooding and inundation driven by the SLR and the hazardous storm. The plots indicate that the Biloxi Bay (area near Station 4) will receive more water as soon as SLR crosses 1.0 m and downstream of the Pascagoula river (area near Station 5) will be inundated more when SLR is 1.5 m. The Lake Pontchartrain starts overflowing heavily through the west side when SLR is 1.5 m. The left and right sides of Mississippi river at the downstream will be affected more even if SLR is 0.5 m because of the relatively flat topography. Almost all the southern Louisiana and the east New Orleans city will be under water when SLR is 1.5 m due to flow overtopping the structures and water intrusion through the canals around the city. Under the same hurricane condition, the SLR up to 1.0 m will pose a serious threat to the coastal infrastructures and communities in the entire MS-LS Gulf coasts. Under the 1.5-m SLR, the coastal flooding and inundation induced by Hurricane Gustav (made landfall as a category 2 storm in Terrebonne Bay in southern Louisiana) could be comparable to the damage by Hurricane Katrina (2005) (a category 5 storm when it approached the Mississippi shelf) (Dietrich et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper focuses on impact assessment of regional and local sea-level rise and emphasizes complexities in predictions of coastal hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions under the combined SLR and storm events. By employing an integrated coastal/ocean processes model, CCHE2D-Coast, two case studies are presented: The first one is to predict flooding/inundation and erosion in a small-scale estuary on the west coast of Taiwan induced by a set of sea-level rise scenarios and a local typhoon event (i.e. Typhoon Talim in 2005); The second case is to simulate large-scale hydrodynamic responses (i.e. waves and storm surges) to SLR and a hurricane in the Mississippi/Louisiana Gulf Coast.  Prior to simulation of the sea level rise scenarios for the first case, this model was validated by computing morphological changes due to storms and typhoons occurring in a 3-year period from 2004 to 2006 at the Taiwan estuary. As a result, the model reproduced the most major morphological change patterns in the complex estuary system such as river bar breaching, offshore bar development, erosion/deposition in the tidal river reaches, etc. The computed bed changes are in good agreement with the field observations. Then, this validated model was applied to compute hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses to four hypothetical sea level rise scenarios combining with Typhoon Talim which had passed through this estuary. The hydrodynamic results show that there are obvious wet/dry cycle changes at all river upstreams. There is also an increasing inundation at the river mouth bar in case of SLR higher than 1.5 m. In addition, the river area is more susceptible to the tidal effect as long as the sea level rises to 0.5 m. The morphodynamic results show that there is apparent change in erosion/deposition areas due to SLR. The river mouth bar is more exposed to be eroded, which consequently could cause landward shoreline retreat due to inundation and waves approaching to inland. The river mouth widening process due to erosion on the river mouth bar could be accelerated after the sea level rises up to 2.0 m. The assessment results at this small-scale estuary shows that the morphological changes in the estuary, especially, in the river mouth, are most likely nonlinear with respect to the SLR. Before the assessment of the SLR impact in the northern Gulf coast, this integrated model was also validated by simulating Hurricane Gustav (2008) in MS-LA Gulf coast. The computed water elevations and wave properties are in good agreement with the observed data obtained from the NOAA wave and water level stations in the area. It is confirmed that the integrated processes model is capable of predicting water elevations driven by various hydrological forcing in that area. The validated model with the well-calibrated model parameters is then applied to simulate a tropical storm event (i.e. Hurricane Gustav) under different SLR scenarios in order to assess the SLR impact together with hazardous storm conditions in the coasts. Numerical results for the four SLR scenarios present overall impacts in the northern Gulf coast due to coastal flooding and inundation. It is found that the changes of maximum water levels in the MS-LA coasts induced by the storm are linearly proportional to the SLR for most coasts, but the increase rate of sea levels at the southern Louisiana marshland may not follow the linear relation with SLR. Meanwhile, no significant changes in significant wave heights with the static SLR are found at the deep waters. But the wave heights at the coastal areas could increase with the increase of the SLR. Under the condition of Hurricane Gustav, the SLR up to 1.0 m will pose serious threat to the coastal infrastructures and communities in the entire MS-LS Gulf coasts. Up to 1.5-m SLR, this hurricane could put almost all the southern Louisiana and the east New Orleans city under water due to overtopping and inundation of storm surges. At the 1.5-m SLR, the coastal flooding and inundation induced by Gustav (a category 2 hurricane when landfall in 2008) could be comparable to the damage by Hurricane Katrina (a category 5 storm when it made landfall in the MS Gulf coast in 2005). It means that a less-strength hurricane under certain sealevel rise (highly possible happening in the future) could cause the same disaster in the coasts as a large violent hurricane did. This preliminary assessment of SLR in the two different coastal regions indicates that this systematic approach based on the integrated-process modeling is essential to deal with nonlinear features in unsteady and multiscale hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes in coasts and oceans. This paper shows that with the help of integrated coastal/ocean processes models, the dynamic assessment of the local/regional SLR impact can facilitate better assessment of coastal vulnerability, coastal hazard management, and building a resilient coastal community against disastrous storms under the future sea-level rise."}]
