The Census Bureau projects that by 2040, we will see over 80 million older adultswith the fastest growing portion of this population being those persons 85 years and older (Administration on Aging, 2015). There has never been a more relevant time to engage in research on health of middle-age to older adults. Commensurately, with the significant trend toward population aging, an increasing number of older adults live with a pet, which underscores the importance of a better understanding of HAI and its potential influence on ensuring that these individuals live those additional years of life healthy and disability free."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology of Older Adults and Animal Interactions", "text": "A growing body of evidence suggests that pets may improve the psychological, social, and physical health of persons of all ages, especially older adults (Boldt & Dellmann-Jenkins, 1992;Esposito et al., 2011;Melson, 2003;O'Haire, 2010). These health domains include chronic conditions, where we have seen lower prevalence among pet owners ages 65 and older, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, and disability (Beck & Katcher, 2003;National Institutes of Health, 1988;Thorpe, 2004). The linkage between pet ownership among older adults and better health outcomes have led several scholars to recommend that companion animals be used to intervene or help maintain wellbeing in older adults (Beck & Katcher, 2003;Boldt & Dellmann-Jenkins, 1992;Thorpe, 2004;Thorpe, Serpell, & Suomi, 2011). To be clear, the intersection of HAI and older adults is not a new issue. In 1987, the NIH invited a group of scholars to discuss the growing field of HAI. The key product from this meeting was a report, \"The Health Benefits of Pets,\" stating that pet exposure should be considered as a possible protective factor in scientific studies of human health (Beck & Katcher, 2003;National Institutes of Health, 1988). In addition, these scholars agreed that research was needed to test explanatory models for understanding health benefits of HAI in older persons. Such models should seek to understand what aspects of pet exposure/ownership affects the health of older adults. For example, it has been shown that pet ownership is related to increased physical activity and decreased mobility limitation (Curl, Bibbo, & Johnson, 2017;Gretebeck et al., 2013;Thorpe, Kreisle, et al., 2006;. However, the mechanisms, to date, are still largely unknown. More recently, in 2008, a public-private partnership between the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the NIH and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition of Mars was formed to advance HAI research. Later that year, a group of investigators from a variety of disciplines convened at the NlH to discuss the state of HAI research, with the sole purpose of developing a research agenda focusing on HAI. A second meeting was held in 2009 in the UK. The objective of these meetings was to encourage a rigorous scientific research agenda focusing on the interaction of people and pets and to consider how to heighten awareness of this burgeoning scientific field (McCardle et al., 2011). Two key products were developed from these meetings-a book that discusses the state of understanding of HAI in different settings such as the community, hospitals, and therapy sessions (McCardle et al., 2011), and a research framework that focuses on the need to better understand HAI as it relates to child development, health, and the therapeutic involvement of animals (Esposito et al., 2011). McCardle and colleagues (2011) state in their edited volume that pets are an important part of society and that an understanding of HAI should be a public health priority. More importantly to our purpose here, there was a strong consensus among the investigators that a paradigm shift is needed to move beyond studies that merely examine correlates of pet ownership to longitudinal cohort studies and intervention studies, which could help elaborate the sequencing and mechanisms operating between pet ownership and positive health benefits (Beck & Katcher, 2003;Thorpe, 2004;Thorpe, Christian, & Bauman, 2011). While several funding announcements resulted from these two strategic initiatives on HAI, the announcements largely focused on the relationship between HAI and children. Given the expanding aging population and the number of pets in homes of older adults, there seems to be a missed opportunity for a key first step in HAI research in understanding the mechanism(s) that underlie the association between pet/dog ownership and improved human health and wellbeing, particularly for older adults (Garrity, Stallones, Marx, & Johnson, 1989;Stallones, Marx, Garrity, & Johnson, 1990;Thorpe, Serpell, et al., 2011). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the positive pet ownership-human health connection, although few have been definitively tested due to a lack of available longitudinal data. These include psychosocial benefits such as companionship and the feeling of instrumental need of the human owners to care for the animals. Other mechanisms relate to the psychological benefit of care of animals (Dembicki & Anderson, 1996;Garrity et al., 1989;Stallones et al., 1990;Thorpe, Serpell, et al., 2011) and the direct physical health benefits from exercise through dog walking (Curl et al., 2017;Gretebeck et al., 2013;Johnson, Beck, & McCune, 2011;Thorpe, Kreisle, et al., 2006;. Reviews of these literatures exist elsewhere, so we will not repeat that information (Knight & Edwards, 2008). We will, however, discuss some special concerns related to older adults and how pet ownership and animal interaction may improve or maintain good health. In the United States, 28% of older adults (age 65+) live alone, and 46% of women age 75 or older live alone (Administration on Aging, 2015). The risk of social exclusion for lone adults is quite high, given the Western social norm of \"independence.\" One important role of animal companions for sololiving older adults is both the opportunity and obligation to interact with the larger social world. Dog walking, for instance, has clear linkages to better health for the human owners through regular exercise (for review, see Johnson et al., 2011). However, the intangible benefits of interacting with neighbors and other dog owners, and feeling like part of a tribe of animal lovers, have separate mental and emotional benefits (Knight & Edwards, 2008). A specialized role of pets in the health and wellbeing of older adults is the alleviation of loneliness. Cole et al. (2007), in their landmark study, showed how lonely older adults (versus non-lonely older adults) expressed more than 208 genes differently. Many of those genes were connected to physiologic mechanisms related to inflammation, lowered immune response, slower cell repair, and disrupted metabolism. Pet ownership among older adults is associated with higher rates of serotonin release through positive interactions with their pets, as well as lower blood pressure (Allen, 2003;Knight & Edwards, 2008). The fact that pet owners who live alone report substantially less loneliness than their non-pet owning counterparts (c.f., Parslow, Jorm, Christensen, Rodgers, & Jacomb, 2005;Stanley, Conwell, Bowen, & Van Orden, 2014), suggests that pet ownership is a significant positive factor in physiologic regulation in older adults. To date, much of our epidemiological understanding of pet ownership among older adults has been based on relatively small proprietary samples or part of interventions. Moreover, Torske, Krokstad, Stamatakis, and Bauman (2017) recently conducted a rapid review focusing on the association of dog ownership and health and identified that of the 90 papers only 3% were epidemiological studies. Studies of HAI utilizing large-scale panel studies on health and aging have been noticeably lacking, largely due to a lack of inclusion of pet information in the studies. This gap has limited our knowledge of the long-term potential health benefits of human-animal interaction. Our purpose here is to identify epidemiological studies of older adults that do include pet ownership and pet-related questions, explore the new frontiers for research using such measures, and then provide recommendations for moving the field of HAI forward."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We sought to determine what information about pet ownership was available in publicly available population studies. We conducted a review of public-use data archives (e.g., ICPSR) with the following inclusion criteria: (1) sample has respondents age 50 or older for analysis; (2) panel study conducted in the United States; (3) contains measures of health and functioning; and (4) asks about pets at one or more study waves. Our search yielded five studies (each referenced and described in the following sections): Health and Retirement Study (HRS); Americans' Changing Lives (ACL); Women's Health and Aging Study I (WHAS I) and II (WHAS II); and the Health, Aging, and Composition (Health ABC) Study. We limit our discussion to those studies that fit the inclusion criteria described above. However, we acknowledge there are other studies in the United States (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II and III, Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Study, and National Quality of Life Study) and other countries (e.g., German Socio-Economic Panel Survey and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) that contain pet ownership and pet-related survey questions. When extracting the survey questions on pet ownership from each of the selected studies, we opted not to include open-ended questions asking respondents to name a source of worry, or most recent upsetting life event. Americans' Changing Lives, for example, included these questions at each wave. Our reasoning is that the questions were not just focused on pet ownership and likely would not yield sufficient statistical power for rigorous analysis."}, {"section_title": "Study Descriptions", "text": "Health Retirement Study (HRS): HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal study of health and wellbeing of adults over the age of 50 years. Questions in this study range from health indicators, neighborhood characteristics, financial situation including retirement, biomarkers, and psychological measures. Participants in HRS are interviewed every two years, beginning in 1992. It is a birth cohort-based study design, integrating new cohorts as they reach ages 51 to 56 (Sonnega et al., 2014). The HRS utilizes a multistage area probability sampling design and has oversampled Black and Hispanic adults, and Florida residents. The HRS is especially ideal because the prospective panel design allows us to observe respondents in midlife (ages 51-61) who then transition into older adulthood (age 62 years and older). Further, the wide range of ancillary information that is collected in HRS such as psychosocial, environmental, and biological data provides a great opportunity to pose HAI-related questions that may not be otherwise addressed."}, {"section_title": "Americans' Changing Lives (ACL):", "text": "The ACL study is the oldest ongoing nationally representative longitudinal study of the role of a broad range of psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors in health and the way health changes with age over the adult life course. The study began in 1986 with a national face-to-face survey of 3,617 adults ages 25 and up in the contiguous U.S. African Americans and people aged 60 and over were over-sampled. In 1989, another face-to-face interview was conducted on 2,867 participants. The next three waves (1994,2001, and 2011) were conducted by phone or face-to face interview.

Table 1 describes the pet questions available in each study and at which study wave, as appropriate. Table 1 is arrayed chronologically, from the earliest to the most recent measures of pet ownership. A first observation from this table is that later studies have more questions-and a wider variety of questions-about pets and respondents' activities, affect, and perceptions of pet ownership. We take this as an indicator of the increasing awareness of HAI research and its importance to health and aging. To illustrate, WHAS I and II [1992][1993][1994][1995] merely asked questions about whether the respondent lost a pet within the past year, and these questions appeared in a section of questions about other recent family losses or changes. This question was asked at baseline only. Likewise, ACL [1986] included at baseline an interviewer-reported item on whether she/he had observed evidence of a pet in the respondent's home. At Wave 2 [1989], ACL directly asked the respondent about pet ownership and types of pets.  (Garrity et al., 1989). Parallel with an increasing literature about the benefits of dog walking among older adults, Health ABC [1999][2000] included standard measures on pet ownership and pet type(s) but expanded the questions, among dog owners, to include frequency of dog walking. Using these data, Thorpe, Kreisle, and colleagues (2006) showed that dog walking was associated with increased physical activity for owners. Most recently, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) included an experimental module on human-animal interaction in Wave 12 [2012]. To our knowledge this is the most extensive body of pet ownership questions in a large-scale panel study of older adults. Questions include the standard ones on pet ownership (number, type, duration) and reasons for owning pets. HRS also asks an extensive body of questions on dog walking behavior (frequency, duration, pace), which would allow one to distinguish the casual one-day-a-week walker from the daily rigorous walker. In this module, HRS also includes a validated questionnaire on pet attachment (Garrity et al., 1989), which again allows researchers to tease out the psychosocial benefits of pet ownership, rather than assuming that all aspects of pet ownership are rewarding. In an exemplary study, Curl et al. (2017) use these measures to examine how the associations between dog ownership and attachment to the dog can lead to more walking of the animal and better subsequent health of the older adult."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Recommendations for Future HAI Research", "text": "Over the past three decades we have observed an increasing interest in understanding HAI as it relates to human health. Only recently has there been a concerted effort to shift from merely documenting associations of HAI and human health to understanding the mechanisms involved in such processes. However, more rigorous research is needed using data that tracks respondents over a sustained period of time. Below are study design recommendations that would benefit the field of HAI as it relates to older adults."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Studies", "text": "Longitudinal studies are needed to advance the understanding of the relationship between HAI and middle-to older-age adults. The cross-sectional design of most HAI studies does not permit assessment of temporality, sequencing, or ordering of events. At its most basic, cross-sectional data cannot tease out the reciprocal relationship between pet ownership and good health. Nor can such data explore long-term health benefits of pet ownership. Even if pet ownership is associated with better health in older adults, it is not clear if this relationship is causal or merely reflects a selection bias. For example, a person's health status may influence his or her pet ownership choices, and/or both health and pet ownership may be related independently to some other variable, such as socioeconomic status. Regarding sequencing and timing, life events may trigger changes in pet ownership, such as adopting a friend's pet who can no longer care for the animal or giving up one's pet(s) due to a change in living arrangement or functional status (Cain, 1985). Indeed, some older adults may put off decisions about moving to assisted living because it may mean having to lose their pet (Sharkin & Knox, 2003). Longitudinal data would help to array the order of events and track health and wellbeing prospectively. A longitudinal research design examining several aspects of pet ownership at each wave of data collection can provide an opportunity to understand pet ownership from a life course perspective. However, to our knowledge, no available data exist to examine pet ownership histories or life course events associated with pet ownership. Furthermore, pet ownership should be investigated across the life course because pets may not play the same role in individuals' lives over time (e.g., Boldt & Dellmann-Jenkins, 1992;Stallones et al., 1990). Also, since most chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis develop over time, studying HAI throughout the lifespan would provide a better understanding as to how pets contribute to the modification of these chronic conditions. Rather than developing a new, prospective study, we suggest that existing epidemiological panel studies could benefit from the inclusion of repeated HAI modules. Specifically, a greater understanding of the health benefits could be gained if questions regarding pets were added to studies such as Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults; Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA); Health and Neighborhoods in Diversity Across the Life Span Study (HANDLS); and the Jackson Heart Study. Including questions about pet ownership, histories of pet ownership (prospectively or retrospectively), and life course events associated with pet ownership (housing status, institutionalization, etc.) would therefore be beneficial. Considering these factors in a longitudinal study would enhance our understanding of the relationship between pet ownership and health benefits over the life course."}, {"section_title": "Dynamics and Aspects of Pet Ownership", "text": "The dynamics and aspects of pet ownership should be measured more broadly in studies of HAI and older adults. To date, HAI literature has used two basic approaches to measurement-functional and structural. The functional approach involves the attachment to the pet, whereas the structural approach merely involves the presence or absence of the pet. The mere fact that one owns a pet does not assure that the pet will directly affect health. Rather, the level of the owner's attachment to the pet may be more important in determining health benefits (Boldt & Dellmann-Jenkins, 1992;Garrity et al., 1989;Ory & Goldberg, 1983;Siegel, 1993). In addition, pet attachment is known to be affected by the behavior and temperament of the individual animal (Budge et al., 1998;Serpell, 1996), so this too should be measured and explored in future epidemiological work on HAI. It would be scientifically useful to include questions about the level of attachment to the pet, who in the household is the primary caregiver of the pet, length of ownership of the pet, time spent with the pet, attitudes toward companion animals, and pet ownership history, as would repetition of questions in each wave of a panel study. Although limitations regarding the use of secondary data are inherent, these measures would enhance the knowledge base of pet ownership and human health."}, {"section_title": "Sample Size within Categories", "text": "It is important to ensure that there is an adequate sample size in each pet ownership category to detect significant differences in the outcome variable(s). Studies have produced mixed results related to the association between HAI and human health (McCardle et al., 2011;Thorpe, Christian, et al., 2011). One reason for this is the use of small samples, or limited subsets of pet owners in larger studies (e.g., pet module not administered to the total sample). Thus, studies should ensure a sufficiently large sample size within each pet category in order to eliminate statistical power as a reason for the unobserved association between pet ownership and human health. For example, to make appropriate contrasts and comparisons on the benefits of dog walking, one would need sufficient number of respondents in three categories: (1) non-dog owners; (2) dog owners who walk little or none; (3) dog owners who walk frequently. Further, studies need a sufficient number of observations across social categories such as race/ethnicity, gender, marital status, and living arrangement to make meaningful comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Theory-based Research", "text": "Research focusing on HAI and middle-to older-aged adults should be theoretically based to address the underlying research objectives and hypotheses. A major concern about much of earlier work about pet ownership and companion animal influences has been the failure to specify a theoretical framework underlying the research hypotheses (for discussion, see Garrity et al., 1989). The NIA Framework for Health Disparities as it relates to aging is an example of a guiding framework that can be useful for investigators to consider when seeking to understand the complex relationship between pet ownership and health benefits across the life course (for details, see Hill, P\u00e9rez-Stable, Anderson, & Bernard, 2015). In most existing work, the literature explores two prevailing theories/hypotheses with regard to the health benefits of animal interaction. First, pet ownership substitutes for human social support and buffers stress, which in turn produces health benefits (Dembicki & Anderson, 1996;Garrity et al., 1989;Siegel, 1990;Stallones et al., 1990). Second, pets encourage behaviors, such as increased physical activity, that modify the development of age-related diseases and decreases in physical function (Anderson, Reid, & Jennings, 1992;Dembicki & Anderson, 1996;Headey, 1999;. However, few studies have been able to demonstrate specific mechanisms that explain the association between pet ownership and health benefits (for exceptions, see Siegel, 1990;Dembicki, 1995;Thorpe, Kreisle, et al., 2006). Future research on pet ownership and human health should include an evaluation of alternative explanatory mechanisms for the relationship between pet ownership and human health across the life course."}, {"section_title": "Confounding Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Studies should consider additional variables that may confound the relationship between HAI and the health of older adults.", "text": "A number of unmeasured factors may influence the strength of association between animal interaction and human health. These could include degree of attachment to animals, number of children and other household composition factors, and type and temperament of the animal (Brown & Katcher, 2001;Budge et al., 1998;Friedmann & Thomas, 1985;Friedmann & Thomas, 1998;Serpell, 2002;Staats & Horner, 1999). These potential confounders should be accounted for in future analyses of pet ownership and human health. Some research has even suggested that the health of pets and their human owners is very similar: overweight owners tend to have overweight animals (Hurley, Elliott, & Lund, 2011;Nijland, Stam, & Seidell 2010). Future studies could examine how health status may covary between humans and animals. In addition, the inclusion of biomarker measures will prove to be valuable as they relate to HAI (Beck & Hatcher, 2003). If it is the case that pet ownership, or particular types of pets, help to reduce cortisol production or boost serotonin, biomarkers would help to document definitive associations. Furthermore, it is important for investigators to consider moving beyond simply controlling for these confounders and consider the extent to which these variables modify the association between pet ownership and human health (Thorpe, 2004;Thorpe, Serpell, et al., 2011). For instance, racial disparities exist among chronic diseases that may be impacted by pet ownership or type of pet (Thorpe, 2004); it is reasonable to determine whether pets contribute to health benefits differently by race/ethnicity and why that may be (Thorpe, 2004). It is possible that pets are truly more beneficial among certain populations or cultures, such as people with little or no social support, institutionalized elderly persons, or widowed persons (Beck & Katcher, 2003;. Thus, it is important to determine if the same r elationships between pet ownership and health exist across the life course."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, although the field of HAI as it relates to older adults is still developing, it is important for investigators to ensure that the studies that are being conducted are of the highest standard and quality. Future work should include robust study designs, based upon and guided by sound theories, with adequate numbers of pet owners. In addition, we encourage a broader range of research questions that may help provide insight into the relationship of the pet to the human. With the increased proportion of aging race/ethnic minorities and the magnitude of the race-and SES-related differences in health outcomes, understanding the contribution of pets to quality of life within and between racial/ethnic and/or SES groups should be a high priority. These efforts will provide key information necessary for health-promoting strategies and interventions for older adults who are pet owners."}]
