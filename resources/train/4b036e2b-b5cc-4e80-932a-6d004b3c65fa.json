[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Dementia has reached epidemic proportions, with an estimated 4.6 million new cases worldwide each year. With an aging world population, the prevalence of dementia will increase dramatically in the next few decades. Of the predicted 114 million who will have dementia in 2050, about three-quarters will live in less developed regions. Although strongly age-related, dementia is not an inevitable part of aging but is a true disease, caused by exposure to several genetic and nongenetic risk factors. Prevention will be possible when the nongenetic risk factors have been identified. Apart from age, more than 20 nongenetic risk factors have been postulated, but very few have been established by randomized intervention studies. Elevated blood concentrations of total homocysteine and low-normal concentrations of B vitamins (folate, vitamin B 12 , and vitamin B 6 ) are candidate risk factors for both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Seventy-seven cross-sectional studies on more than 34,000 subjects and 33 prospective studies on more than 12,000 subjects have shown associations between cognitive deficit or dementia and homocysteine and/or B vitamins. Biologically plausible mechanisms have been proposed to account for these associations, including atrophy of the cerebral cortex, but a definite causal pathway has yet to be shown. Raised plasma total homocysteine is a strong prognostic marker of future cognitive decline, and is common in world populations. Low-normal concentrations of the B vitamins, the main determinant of homocysteine concentrations, are also common and occur in particularly vulnerable sections of the population, such as infants and elderly. Large-scale randomized trials of homocysteine-lowering vitamins are needed to see if a proportion of dementia in the world can be prevented."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Psychiatric diseases are the most rapidly increasing component of the global burden of disease in the world, rising from an estimated 10.5% of all disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) in 1990 to 14.7% by 2020 [1] . A significant part of this expected increase is due to the aging of the world's population, notably in the less-developed regions where more than 75% of the world's population over 60 years of age will reside by the year 2025 [2] , and to the corresponding increase in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The worldwide prevalence of dementia is strongly related to age: 0.5% in those between 60 and 65 years, 1.5% between 65 and 69 years, 3% between 70 and 74 years, 6% between 75 and 79 years, 12% between 80 and 84 years, and 25% in those aged 85 to 89 years [3] . The prevalence rises dramatically in older people, reaching almost 50% in those over 95 years [3] .\nThe prevalence data, although subject to methodological uncertainties [4] , especially in the lessdeveloped regions [5, 6] , can be used to give estimates of the current numbers of people with dementia across the world. WHO estimated that the number of people with dementia in 2002 was 22.5 million [7] , close to the estimate of 25.5 million for 2000 made by Wimo et al. [8] . The latter authors estimated that in 2000 the numbers with dementia were 11.9 million in Asia, 7.4 million in Europe, 3.1 million in North America, 1.7 million in Latin America, 1.25 million in Africa, and 0.2 million in Oceania. All such estimates are subject to many assumptions, but it appears that the numbers A. David Smith S144 A. D. Smith for North America may have been rather low, since it has been calculated that in the United States in 2000 there were 4.5 million with Alzheimer's disease [9] , the commonest form of dementia, which comprises about 70% of all cases [10] . A recent Delphi consensus study broadly agrees with the estimates of Wimo et al. [8] and estimates that in 2005 there are 4.6 million new cases each year [11] . A striking feature of the worldwide prevalence estimates is that, in 2000-2001, 52% to 60% of those with dementia lived in the less-developed regions [8, 11] . Of great concern are the predictions of the future prevalence of dementia ( fig. 1) , which suggest that by 2050 there will be as many as 114 million with dementia, of which 84 million (74%) will be in the less-developed regions [8] . The social and economic challenges these numbers present to governments, especially those in the less-developed regions, are huge, because dementia is one of the most disabling and costly of human diseases."}, {"section_title": "Costs of dementia", "text": "The costs of dementia to society are higher than those of the other noncommunicable diseases because of the high prevalence and because patients need a high level of care for many years. As a rough guide, we can say that in more-developed regions the annual cost of dementia is the equivalent of about 15% to 20% of the cost of a nation's health services, or around 1.5% of the GDP [12, 13] . If the costs of informal care, which are difficult to estimate to any degree of accuracy, are excluded, then the direct costs have been estimated at $156 billion for the world in 2003 [14] . The costs do not mainly fall on the health services, but rather on social services and the families of patients [15] . There are also considerable costs to businesses, which in the United States have been estimated as $61 billion per year [16] .\nSome of the most detailed costing studies have been done in the United States, where it is estimated that Medicaid spending for nursing home care for people with Alzheimer's disease in 2005 was $21 billion and Medicare spending was $91 billion [17] . Although it is difficult to avoid some double counting, the total annual cost of dementia in the United States is likely to be between $150 and $200 billion [16, 18] . On purely economic grounds, it has been calculated that enormous savings could be made if the onset of dementia could be delayed and its progression slowed [19] by preventive measures or by new treatments: annual savings in US Medicaid and Medicare costs alone could reach $149 billion by 2025 [17] . The critical question is: Can dementia be prevented [20, 21] ?\nThe nature of dementia Many people believe that cognitive decline is an inevitable part of normal aging. This idea is not new. Virgil wrote: Time wastes all things, the mind too: often I remember how in boyhood I outwore long sunlit days in singing; now I have forgotten so many a song. (Eclogue IX, translated by J. W. Mackail, 1934) . But was Virgil right? Is it inevitable that, as we age, our memory begins to fail? Is memory loss, leading eventually to dementia, an inevitable part of aging? There is no doubt that in a population it is \"usual\" for memory to decline with age, but is that just because in most people there is an underlying disease process that affects the functioning of the brain? If we, as individuals, can achieve what has been called \"successful aging\", then perhaps we can prevent the worst effects of aging on the brain. As expressed by Rowe and Kahn: \"Within the category of normal aging, a distinction can be made between usual aging, in which extrinsic factors heighten the effects of aging alone, and successful aging, in which extrinsic factors play a neutral or positive role\" [22] . The two commonest types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (now often called vascular cognitive impairment [23] ), and in the early 1990s it was recognized that both these types were in fact true diseases. This is more readily appreciated for vascular dementia, which is the result of cerebrovascular disease, and so ought to be preventable, as is stroke [24, 25] . The discovery in 1991 that a rare mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein can cause Alzheimer's disease, the commonest type of dementia, led to the realization that Alzheimer's disease may be a true disease after all. But this discovery also led to a new dogma: \"It is all in the genes, isn't it, doctor?\" This dogma is almost as dangerous as the dogma that dementia is an inevitable part of aging, since it also makes people fatalistic. The true situation is both more complicated and more hopeful: Alzheimer's disease is a complex disease with multifactorial causation. Very FIG. 1 . Predicted prevalence of dementia in the world. The graph is based upon two independent studies [8, 11] that arrived at very similar estimates. The figures for the proportion of dementia cases in the less-developed regions come from Wino et al. [8] Year Millions of cases of dementia 52% 65% % in less-developed regions 74% S145 Dementia and B vitamins rarely, perhaps in as few as 1% of cases worldwide, the cause is a mutation in one of three genes that leads inevitably to the onset of symptoms when a certain age has been reached. By far the commonest cause of dementia is the occurrence in an individual of several risk factors which, in combination, can trigger the disease process. Some of these risk factors are genetic, of which the best established are the \u03b54 allele of APOE [26] and the indel polymorphism of ACE [27] . A large number of nongenetic risk factors have also been postulated, mainly on the basis of epidemiological studies, and it is not possible to review these studies here. Listed in table 1 are those that should be considered seriously. It is notable that a great many of the postulated risk fac-tors are also risk factors for vascular disease [28] [29] [30] , which raises the hope that modifying such risk factors might help to prevent not only vascular dementia but also Alzheimer's disease [21, 31] . Can the same success be obtained for dementia as for stroke, where recognition of risk factors has contributed to falls of up to 70% in mortality from vascular disease and in the incidence of stroke in the more-developed regions in the last 30 years [32] [33] [34] ?\nThe purpose of this survey is to summarize the observational evidence that one of the established risk factors for vascular disease, moderately raised concentrations of plasma total homocysteine [35] , is also a strong candidate risk factor for dementia. Since S146 A. D. Smith the major determinants of total homocysteine concentrations are the intake and blood concentrations of B vitamins (folate, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 12 ) [35, 36] , these vitamins will also be considered in relation to dementia. Finally, the implications for preventive measures will be discussed. It should be stressed that this is not intended to be an in-depth and systematic review of the evidence but rather a report to draw attention to the new findings."}, {"section_title": "Homocysteine and dementia", "text": "It has long been known that frank deficiencies in either folate or vitamin B 12 are associated with cognitive deficit or dementia [37] [38] [39] [40] . However, in 1992 it was pointed out by Rosenberg and Miller in a seminal article that \"For most people, including elderly people, overt vitamin deficiencies are unlikely\u2026it is more likely that mild or 'subclinical' vitamin deficiencies play a role in the pathogenesis of declining neurocognitive function in aging\" [41] . In the same year, two \"Hypothesis\" articles were published in which the authors suggested that abnormal one-carbon metabolism might play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and that raised concentrations of total homocysteine might be a marker [42, 43] . In the early 1990s there were several reports of raised total homocysteine concentrations in patients with cognitive deficit/dementia [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , but none of these studies compared patients with dementia with well-matched, cognitively screened control subjects.\nIn 1998, two case-control studies from the United Kingdom were reported [49, 50] . McCaddon were that the DAT patients and patients with confirmed Alzheimer's disease had higher concentrations of total homocysteine and lower blood folate and vitamin B 12 values than controls. In addition, it was shown that total homocysteine was also elevated in patients with \"pure\" pathologically confirmed vascular dementia and in those who had a mixture of vascular changes and Alzheimer's disease pathology as well as in in those with \"pure\" Alzheimer's disease pathology. Thus, the association of elevated total homocysteine with dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease cannot solely be explained by the presence of overt cerebrovascular disease, as suggested by later authors [51, 52] . Case-control studies of this type have many limitations, not least the possibility that the cases might have had a poorer diet as a consequence of their dementia. This latter possibility was rendered less likely by the findings that McCaddon's study [49] there were no significant case-control differences in the blood concentrations of folate and vitamin B 12 , nor in a marker for nutritional status (retinol-binding protein). In the OPTIMA study [50] , where the blood vitamin concentrations were lower in the dementia cases, the duration of memory impairment prior to the biochemical measurements did not influence the total homocysteine level, and the total homocysteine concentrations did not rise in blood samples taken later as the dementia became more severe. Part of the OPTIMA study was prospective: a subset of the patients with DAT were followed for 3 years after the blood sample had been taken. Disease progression, monitored by the size of the medial temporal lobe as measured from CT scans, was strongly related to the baseline total homocysteine level ( fig. 2) . Patients with total homocysteine values in the middle and upper tertiles (> 11.1 \u00b5mol/L) had a 24.5% thinner medial temporal lobe after 3 years, while those with total homocysteine concentrations in the bottom tertile did not show any significant shrinkage over the same period. Associations between baseline concentrations of serum folate or vitamin B 12 and disease progression showed a similar, although inverse, trend but did not reach significance.\nSince 1998, many cross-sectional studies have been reported on cognitive deficit or dementia in relation to total homocysteine (table 3). Reviews since 1998 cover some, but not all, of these studies [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . The cross-sectional studies vary considerably in quality, such as in the precision of case-definition and in the degree to which possible confounders of the association were taken into account, but there is not space here to discuss them in detail. In relation to case-definition, it must be pointed out that while the clinical diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) is reasonably accurate, so long as the appropriate operational criteria are strictly applied [61, 62] , the diagnosis of vascular dementia in life is very inaccurate [63] [64] [65] .\nIf we simply count the cross-sectional studies in table 3, without weighting for quality, then 77 studies involving 34,238 subjects reported evidence of associations between dementia or cognitive deficit and blood concentrations of total homocysteine and/or B vitamins. The seven remaining studies, involving 3,645 subjects, reported finding no associations. Too few studies were reported on cerebrospinal fluid to draw any conclusions.\nStatistically confirmed evidence of associations does not tell us how meaningful such associations might be. It is therefore notable that three independent studies have estimated that total homocysteine accounts for as much as about 10% of the variance in global cognitive test scores in elderly populations [66] [67] [68] . The association is not limited to global cognitive tests. A detailed study of different cognitive domains in a large, community-based population [69] showed that raised total homocysteine concentrations are associated with poorer performance in 20 tests that assess the following 8 cognitive domains: language skills, conceptual reasoning, simple motor and psychomotor speed, eyehand coordination and manual dexterity, executive function, verbal memory and learning, visual memory Prospective study of the association of baseline plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations with the progression of Alzheimer's disease, assessed by the size of the medial temporal lobe measured by CT scan. Forty-three patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type in the OPTIMA cohort were scanned four times at yearly intervals. The figure shows the linear regression lines of the age-adjusted thickness of the medial temporal lobe as a percentage of the baseline value. The slope for those with total homocysteine < 11 \u00b5mol/L was not significant, while that for those with total homocysteine > 11.1 \u00b5mol/L was significant (p = .03). Drawn from and learning, and visuoconstruction/perception. It is noteworthy that these results from a population of mixed race (aged from 50 to 70 years) were obtained several years after the introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification of food in the United States. A very similar result on a wide range of cognitive domains was reported in a large, prospective, community-based study in which blood samples had been collected prior to folic acid fortification [70] . In the latter study, cognitive tests were carried out more than 7 years after collection of the blood sample, but the results were only significant in subjects over the age of 60 (range, 60 to 82 years). Both of these studies are characterized by a careful consideration of possible confounders, and they reveal quite strong associations: an increase in total homocysteine concentrations within the normal range (from the 25th to the 75th percentiles) was equivalent to a decline in cognitive test scores that would occur in 4.2 years of normal aging [69] . Overall, these crosssectional studies are consistent with the hypothesis that moderately raised concentrations of total homocysteine, due in part to low-normal B vitamin status, might be one of the causes of cognitive deficit and dementia. How well does this hypothesis stand up to the results of prospective observational epidemiological studies?\nThe first prospective study was on patients in OPTIMA [50] with a clinical diagnosis of DAT, where it was found that the baseline level of total homocysteine was related to the rate of disease progression, "}, {"section_title": "S155", "text": "Dementia and B vitamins as described above ( fig. 2) . Several community-based prospective studies have since been done in populations initially free from dementia (table 4) . Altogether, 13 prospective studies, involving 7,196 subjects, reported evidence of associations between baseline total homocysteine concentrations and subsequent cognitive deficit. The remaining three studies, involving 1,722 subjects, did not find an association, although in one of these [71] the association was present before adjustment for age, gender, education, and ApoE4. Most of the other positive studies have included these factors as covariates, and in one [72] the association was present when age and gender were covariates but was no longer significant when education and B vitamins were included. As in all epidemiological studies, it is important to consider which factors should be included as covariates. All studies should include gender and age and, in relation to the risk of dementia, additional risk factors such as the presence of ApoE4, years of education, race, and possibly smoking, depression, and socioeconomic status should be considered. While some of these, notably age and gender, are also related to total homocysteine concentrations [35] , there will be a risk of overadjusting if very strong determinants of total homocysteine, such as intake or blood concentrations of folate and vitamin B 12 , are included. For example, in one study the relation between cognitive test scores and total homocysteine concentrations was lost when folate or vitamin B12 was included as a covariate [73] . Nevertheless, in several studies where one or more B vitamins was included in the analysis, the prospective association between total homocysteine and cognitive deficit remained significant [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . It can be concluded that much of the observational epidemiological evidence points to a strong association between moderately raised total homocysteine concentrations and the subsequent development of dementia. Is homocysteine itself the culprit, or is it only a marker for a poor status of one or more of the B vitamins?"}, {"section_title": "B vitamins and dementia", "text": "In their classical paper in 1983, Goodwin et al. [80] showed that in healthy community-dwelling elderly people there was an association between poor performance on cognitive tests (memory and abstract thinking) and low-normal intake and serum concentrations of riboflavin, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 , vitamins that are all involved in homocysteine metabolism. The associations were not changed when allowances for age, education, and income were made. Since 1983, there have been many studies on the association between low-normal concentrations of B vitamins and cognitive deficit or dementia. These studies have been ably reviewed [41, 53, 54, 59, 81] and so only more recent, mainly prospective studies will be covered here, i.e., studies in which the blood sample was taken prior to the onset of detectable cognitive impairment. No prospective studies appear to have been published on riboflavin [82] in relation to dementia, and the follow-up study of the Goodwin cohort only found significant associations between riboflavin status in cross-sectional measures of cognition [83] . We can summarize the results from the prospective studies on vitamin B 6 , vitamin B 12 , and folate, listed in table 5, as follows.\nVitamin B 6 . Four prospective studies, involving 1,342 subjects, that assessed vitamin B 6 intake or concentrations found an inverse relationship with cognitive decline or incident Alzheimer's disease, although the association with incident Alzheimer's disease was lost when folate intake was included as a covariate [84] . Consistent with these prospective studies, some crosssectional studies have found an association between poor vitamin B 6 status and dementia [51, 85] and cerebral atrophy [86] . Three studies involving 2,001 subjects did not find associations with vitamin B 6 status. This rather neglected area clearly needs more research.\nVitamin B 12 . Six prospective studies, involving 4,607 subjects, that assessed vitamin B 12 intake or status found an inverse relationship with cognitive decline or incident dementia. A striking finding by Wang et al. [87] was that in subjects with a high baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (\u2265 26) and serum folate concentrations < 12 nmol/L or serum vitamin B 12 concentrations < 250 pmol/L, the relative risk of incident Alzheimer's disease was 7.0 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.7) versus those with normal concentrations of both vitamins. A similar relationship was not found for those with lower MMSE scores. On the other hand, 10 studies, involving 7,537 subjects, found no association with vitamin B 12 status.\nThere are many possible reasons for the lack of consistent findings with vitamin B 12 status, apart from the different populations studied, such as the different endpoints used, the poor correlation between different assay methods, the use of different cutoff values, and the occurrence of confounders [39, 88, 89] . Another problem is that the level of total serum vitamin B 12 does not necessarily reflect the vitamin B 12 available for cellular function, which is that carried in plasma by the protein transcobalamin-II. Alternative markers of the functional status of vitamin B 12 are concentrations of total homocysteine (which is not specific to vitamin B 12 status), methylmalonic acid, or holotranscobalamin-II [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] . The greater sensitivity of these other markers in relation to cognition is illustrated by a case-control study from OPTIMA showing that a subset of histopathologically confirmed patients with Alzheimer's disease had low plasma holotranscobalamin-II, and elevated methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine, but plasma vitamin B 12 concentrations that were not different from the controls [93] . In a larger cohort of S156 A. D. Smith OPTIMA patients, those with confirmed Alzheimer's disease did in fact have significantly lower total vitamin B 12 concentrations than controls [50] . A community study in 2,278 elderly subjects also reveals the sensitivity of the functional markers of vitamin B 12 status: cognitive impairment was associated with elevated plasma total homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, and with low concentrations of plasma holotranscobalamin-II, but not with low vitamin B 12 concentrations [94] . Further studies on the possible relationship between vitamin B 12 status and cognition should clearly make use of these markers.\nFolate. Ten prospective studies, involving 5,435 subjects, that assessed folate intake or folate blood concentration found an inverse relationship with cognitive decline or incident dementia. In contrast, nine studies, involving 7,657 subjects, reported no association of cognitive decline with folate status. In five of the negative studies, change in the MMSE score was used as an endpoint [77, [95] [96] [97] [98] . This is a screening test for dementia and so is not very sensitive to changes in cognition in the normal elderly. It is thus of interest that in one study where both MMSE and other more sensitive tests were used, there was no association of folate with MMSE score, but there was with tests of praxis [98] . Technical factors might also contribute to some of the discrepancies: notably, folate in frozen blood is not stable and the different folate assays show large differences, especially at low folate concentrations [99] . However, two studies that did not include assays of blood folate stand out as totally contradictory. Both studies used information about diet in large community populations: one (Chicago Health and Aging Project) reported that high folate intake is associated with a subsequent decline in overall cognition [100] , while the other (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) reported that higher folate intake protects against the subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease [84] . Both studies began before fortification of food with folic acid, but they were complicated by the fact that fortification was introduced during the course of the study so that some of the endpoint assessments took place after fortification had occurred. The Chicago study reported that 91% of final assessments took place after fortification, while the Baltimore study did not give this information. The Chicago study adjusted estimates of folate intake to take account of fortification. The range of estimated folate intakes was similar for the two studies (Chicago, 63 to 1,719 \u00b5g/day, and Baltimore, 79 to 1,457 \u00b5g/day), and yet the Chicago study reported that intake in the top quintile was associated with cognitive decline in relation to the bottom quintile, while the Baltimore study reported that those in the top tertile had a 56% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The Chicago study also reported that there was an increased risk of cognitive decline in those who took folic acid supplements > 400 \u00b5g/day. A possible explanation for the different results is that the rate of cognitive decline in the high-folate group in Chicago was slower in those who took supplements containing extra vitamin B 12 than in those consuming the RDA for vitamin B 12 . An interaction between vitamin B 12 status and folate status in a population exposed to mandatory folic acid fortification has recently been reported [101] from the United States: whereas elderly people with low vitamin B 12 status and normal folate status had a 70% increased risk of cognitive impairment, those with high folate (> 59 nmol/L) and low vitamin B 12 status had a much higher incidence of cognitive impairment (OR = 5.1; 95% CI, 2.7 to 9.5) and anemia (OR = 5.2; 95% CI, 2.5 to 11.0) than elderly who had normal vitamin B 12 and normal folate levels. Another study reported that higher blood concentrations of folate were associated with a greater rate of global cognitive decline, even though in the same cohort a strong positive cross-sectional relationship was found between folate and cognition [97] . These contradictory findings cannot be explained at present, but the possible harmful effects of high folic acid intake [102] should not be dismissed, especially in the context of low vitamin B 12 status [101] .\nSome of the other findings with folate are quite striking. The Normative Vitamin B Study [98] found that the cognitive test that best related to B vitamin status and total homocysteine involved constructional praxis (a spatial copying task). The changes in scores on this test over 3 years were strongly related to folate status even when total homocysteine and the other plasma B vitamin concentrations were included in the regression. There was a linear relationship between the changes in test score and both plasma folate concentration and dietary folate intake: scores declined the most rapidly at plasma concentrations < 20 nmol/L and intakes < 339 \u00b5g/day, whereas at concentrations > 30 nmol/L and intakes > 523 \u00b5g/day the scores tended to go up over time. It is notable that the plasma folate values over which the scores varied are within the normal range. A longitudinal, but not strictly prospective, study by OPTIMA showed that low serum folate was a strong risk factor for histopathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease [50] ; once again, the association occurred at serum folate concentrations usually considered to be within the normal range ( fig. 3) . A well-controlled cross-sectional study (Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging), carried out after fortification of food with folic acid has shown robust relationships between red blood cell folate and global cognition and memory (delayed recall) in a population where < 1% had red blood cell folate values classified as deficient [103] . In this population, there was also a highly significant protective effect against the diagnosis of dementia of higher red blood cell folate concentrations within the normal range. In the prospective Conselice study of an elderly community in Italy [78] , a strong inverse relationship was found between incident dementia S159 Dementia and B vitamins and serum folate, across the normal range ( fig. 4) . We can conclude that in four very different populations, low-normal blood folate status is associated with a strong risk of either having dementia or of developing dementia in the future. In all four of these studies, elevated total homocysteine concentrations were also associated with increased risk of dementia."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of the observational epidemiological studies and the need for more research", "text": "Interpretation of the studies described above is subject to the usual caveats. However statistically sound, all observational studies of this type are subject to the possibility of reverse causality and to the influence of confounding factors that either have not been sufficiently taken into account [104] or have been unknowingly ignored [105] . None of the studies can thus be used to demonstrate a causal link between B vitamins, or total homocysteine, and dementia. To show causality it would be necessary to carry out randomized clinical trials with doses of B vitamins that lower homocysteine in the elderly [106, 107] . Since cognitive decline and the development of dementia occur over many years [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] , such trials would have to be initiated early in the disease process and last for several years (see section below on Implications for Prevention). For the time being, we can consider the findings of a study [79] on 1,670 elderly Norwegians, where blood samples were taken twice, 6 years apart: changes in total homocysteine and plasma folate between baseline and follow-up were analyzed in relation to memory test scores at follow-up. It was found that subjects in whom plasma folate increased over the 6-year period had higher memory scores, while those in whom plasma folate decreased had lower scores. The opposite result was found for total homocysteine, i.e., a fall in plasma total homocysteine was associated with better performance in the memory test. These complementary findings with folate and total homocysteine could be interpreted as a naturally occurring \"clinical trial\" in which improving folate status and lowering total homocysteine concentrations in a population leads to better performance on memory tests.\nAn alternative approach would be to use \"Mendelian randomization\" based on the different genotypes of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene [113] , as so successfully used for demonstrating a causal link between maternal total homocysteine and NTD [114] and between total homocysteine and coronary heart disease [114] and stroke [115] . But such an approach requires genetic and phenotypic information on many thousands of subjects, depending upon the strength of the association between raised total homocysteine and the disease in question [116] . The studies so far on MTHFR genotypes and dementia have involved far too few subjects, which may explain the largely negative findings [50, 117, 118] . It would be extremely valuable to collect this information with respect to cognitive status in large populations. The prior hypothesis would be that the TT genotype is associated either with an increased risk of dementia, if raised total homocysteine is the causal factor, or with a reduced risk of dementia, if uracil incorporation into DNA is the causal factor (see section below on Biological Plausibility).\nThe study of the role of homocysteine and B vitamins in relation to dementia is many years behind similar studies in vascular disease, and much can be learned from the vascular disease field. Another important underexplored area concerns the interactions between risk factors. To study interactions, large numbers of subjects are required, and there is a need for such large collaborative studies in the dementia field. The importance of such studies is that they can highlight factors of particular public health concern. For example, the large European Concerted Action Project on atherosclerosis studied 750 cases of atherosclerosis and 800 controls, and showed that elevated plasma total homocysteine interacted strongly with conventional risk factors [119] . For example, the risks of smoking and of hypertension were each greatly magnified (more than multiplicatively) in subjects with elevated plasma total homocysteine. The interpretation is that, even if raised total homocysteine is not itself causally related to vascular disease, it is a strong prognostic marker and subjects with high total homocysteine should be intensively treated for conventional risk factors. Since raised blood pressure is one of the best established risk factors for dementia [120] , it is particularly important to determine if hypertension and total homocysteine interact in the risk of dementia."}, {"section_title": "Biological plausibility of the association between B vitamins, homocysteine and dementia", "text": "There are several biologically plausible mechanisms through which low B vitamin status or raised plasma total homocysteine could influence the brain, and so affect cognition. These will not be reviewed here. It must be pointed out that several of the experimental studies on mechanisms use concentrations of free homocysteine that are in excess of the concentrations of total homocysteine occurring in the plasma and in particular in the cerebrospinal fluid, where the level is typically about one-fiftieth of that in plasma [121] [122] [123] . In the brain, the concentrations are also low, but in the rat cerebrum about 70% occurs as free homocysteine [124] . Although homocysteine has been demonstrated in hippocampal pyramidal neurons by immunohistochemistry [125] , we do not know the intracellular level in brain cells. The cerebrospinal fluid level is presumably low because most of the total homocysteine is bound to albumin, the level of which is much lower in cerebrospinal fluid than in plasma, but it is also possible that homocysteine is rapidly cleared from the brain. It is noteworthy that the brain seems to be protected from folate deficiency, since cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of folate are higher than in plasma [126] . Some mechanisms that have been proposed [68, [127] [128] [129] are listed below: \u00bb Raised total homocysteine compromises the cerebrovascular circulation, leading to ischemia and reperfusion that initiates Alzheimer-type pathology in the medial temporal lobe, a process exacerbated by low folate [50, 130] . \u00bb Raised total homocysteine compromises the cerebrovascular circulation, causing ischemia that leads to damage to the white matter and silent infarctions, known correlates of vascular dementia [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] . \u00bb Homocysteine is directly neurotoxic, leading to cell death and shrinkage of the brain [127, [138] [139] [140] . \u00bb Homocysteine accentuates the neurotoxicity of betaamyloid [141, 142] . \u00bb Homocysteine is converted to homocysteic acid, a highly potent neurotoxin [143, 144] that may also increase the synthesis of beta-amyloid [144] . \u00bb Homocysteine is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is a powerful inhibitor of transmethylation reactions that use S-adenosylmethionine as a donor. Thus, many cellular methylation reactions are inhibited [145, 146] , some of which might lead to hyperphosphorylation of tau [147] . \u00bb Inhibition of methylation of cytosine residues in DNA changes gene expression, notably of genes critically involved in Alzheimer's disease pathways [148, 149] . \u00bb Due to its conversion to S-adenosylhomocysteine, a rise in total homocysteine may be associated with a fall in adenosine concentrations that may be harmful to the vasculature or to neurons [150] [151] [152] . \u00bb Raised total homocysteine may induce oxidative stress that, among many other effects, compromises the recycling of vitamin B 12 as cofactor of methionine synthase, so leading to further rise in total homocysteine [153, 154] . \u00bb Raised total homocysteine may trigger the cell cycle in neurons, thus initiating the cellular reactions that lead to apoptosis and to the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau and beta-amyloid [155, 156] . \u00bb Raised total homocysteine may be a marker for poor B vitamin status-poor folate status in particularleading to misincorporation of uracil into DNA and compromising DNA repair. Homocysteine may itself cause DNA damage [157] [158] [159] . \u00bb Raised total homocysteine may stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in endothelial cells [160] and in neurons and glia, activating presenilininduced generation of beta-amyloid [161] . Perhaps the most biologically plausible finding is that certain parts of the brain, notably structures in the medial temporal lobe that are known to be crucial for memory, are smaller in subjects with elevated total homocysteine concentrations [68] . This was first reported by OPTIMA in 1998, which also showed ( fig.  2) that the rate of shrinkage of the medial temporal lobe S161 Dementia and B vitamins was more rapid in patients with total homocysteine concentrations in the middle and upper tertiles [50] . A subsequent report from the Nun study [162] described a strong inverse correlation between the extent of neocortical atrophy, assessed at autopsy, and concentrations of serum folate in blood collected several years before death in patients dying of Alzheimer's disease. A correlation between serum folate concentrations and the volumes of the mygdale and hippocampus in the elderly, assessed by MRI, has since been reported [163] . In the normal elderly, the sizes of parts of the medial temporal lobe [164, 165] and other regions of the brain [166, 167] are also inversely related to the blood level of total homocysteine. A striking finding from the Framingham cohort is that elevated total homocysteine concentrations measured 6 to 8 years before MRI imaging were related to a smaller total brain volume [168] . A precursor to atrophy is the death of neurons and glia: it has been shown by magnetic resonance spectroscopy that the concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, a neuronal marker, in the human brain are inversely related to plasma total homocysteine [139] . In relation to these modern findings, it is of interest that in one of the early descriptions of patients with homocystinuria, patients showed loss of neurons and astrogliosis in the hippocampus, in the absence of nearby infarcts [169] . Is this, perhaps, a sign of the vulnerability of the hippocampus to the toxic effects of homocysteine? It would be particularly interesting to see if the brains from homocystinuria cases display any of the characteristic histopathology of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Implications for prevention", "text": "The cross-sectional and prospective observational studies are, with a few exceptions, reasonably consistent, and lead to the following hypothesis: Moderately elevated concentrations of total homocysteine and/or low-normal concentrations (or intake) of certain B vitamins (folate, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 12 ) are associated with an increased risk of brain atrophy and of developing cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly. The crucial test of this hypothesis requires either a Mendelian randomization study of the genotypes of MTHFR in a large population, or a series of randomized, controlled trials of B vitamin treatments in the elderly at risk. Such trials should take into account the long-time course of the development of cognitive impairment, the slow spread of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease [56, 108] , and the possibility that the disease process is initiated early in life [109, 111, 112, 170, 171] . The very few controlled trials published so far have been of much too short duration and were not in the appropriate populations at risk: these have been reviewed by the Cochrane team [172] [173] [174] and by Rosenberg in his report to WHO [175] . One report describes the results of a trial of B vitamins (folic acid, riboflavin, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 12 ) in 185 patients \u2265 65 years of age with ischemic vascular disease [176] . The median baseline MMSE score was 28, so these patients were not significantly cognitively impaired. In fact, the placebo group appeared to show no significant cognitive decline over the 1-year treatment period, so it is hardly surprising that there was no effect of the treatment. Three trials in progress are targeted at more appropriate populations. Two involve patients with dementia, where the aim is to see if the B vitamins can slow disease progression: one in the United States (VITAL) [177, 178] and the other in China [179] . One trial in Oxford (VITACOG) involves subjects with mild cognitive impairment, where the aim is to see if the B vitamins can slow the rate of shrinkage of the brain and slow cognitive decline [180] .\nPending the outcome of clinical trials, what should be done? On the basis of the evidence reviewed above, it is clearly premature to recommend that the elderly start taking high-dose B vitamin supplements, or that governments introduce mandatory fortification of food with B vitamins. However, we can take encouragement from the successes that campaigns of prevention have achieved in the field of vascular disease, which have in large part been responsible for the decline in deaths from vascular disease in developed countries by up to 70% since 1970 [34] . Vascular disease risk factors, including homocysteine, are also often risk factors for dementia (table 1), but in the case of vascular disease many have already been demonstrated to play a causal role. Thus, we know that lowering blood pressure will protect against stroke. Stroke itself is a strong risk factor for subsequent dementia: both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease [181, 182] . So prevention of stroke should eventually lead to fewer cases of dementia. Perhaps this is one explanation for the important finding that the age-specific prevalence of dementia in the United States has been declining since 1982, particularly in those with more education [183] . Since there is now compelling evidence from Mendelian randomization that raised total homocysteine, or modified folate metabolism, is a cause of stroke [115] , we can ask whether the significant lowering of total homocysteine concentrations in the United States and Canada since mandatory fortification of food with folic acid in 1998 [184] has had any impact on the incidence of stroke. National records of stroke mortality are consistent with this idea [185] . Thus, the rate of decrease in mortality from stroke has increased since 1998 in both Canada and the United States, such that in the United States there are about 12,900 fewer deaths each year than predicted if the previous rate of decline had continued. If the decrease in stroke-related deaths reflects fewer incident strokes, then we can predict that there should in due course be fewer incident cases of dementia. If, on the other hand, there has only been a decrease in S162 A. D. Smith stroke mortality but not incidence, then the incidence of stroke-related dementia may actually go up.\nThe worldwide prevalence of folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency, conventionally defined, is not well documented, as described in the contributions by McLean [186] and Allen [187] , and, for vitamin B 12 , also by Stabler [188] . Some striking examples can be given: thus, in part of India about 75% of adults had metabolic evidence of vitamin B 12 deficiency [189] ; in Iran 98% of adults in Tehran were folate-deficient [190] ; and in Sri Lanka 54% of adolescents were folate-deficient [191] . It is of great concern that such deficiencies may affect many millions of people in vulnerable sections of the population, ranging from breastfed babies to the elderly. With current knowledge, it is clear that folate and vitamin B 12 concentrations close to or below the usual cutoffs for deficiency must be corrected by intervention. The question is, should more be done? This survey of B vitamins in relation to dementia has shown that folate and vitamin B 12 concentrations that typically fall within the bottom quartile or tertile of the normal distribution in a population are associated with increased risk of harm to the brain. Pending the results from trials, the very least we can do is to review the blood values chosen as cutoffs for deficiency and consider whether there should be a range of values above the conventional cutoffs where action might be taken, or at least further monitoring carried out.\nWe can also make suggestions concerning homocysteine before the results of trials are known. Elevated total homocysteine concentrations are associated with many common diseases [35] , and one possibility is that total homocysteine reflects some fundamental biological property common to these diseases [192] , and that for many diseases it is a prognostic marker if not a cause [193] . One of the striking features of total homocysteine is that it reflects many less ideal aspects of lifestyle [193] . A simple recommendation for now is that, if we want to improve our chances of reaching old age with minds intact, we should adopt a healthy lifestyle as early as possible (table 1); this will not only be good for our cardiovascular systems and our brains, it will incidentally lower our homocysteine concentrations and so improve our prognoses [193] .\nFinally, the question can be asked: Should WHO play a role in alerting the world to the fact that dementia is now largely a preventable disease? Since many risk factors for dementia are also risk factors for vascular disease (table 1) and since vascular pathology is commonly found in all forms of dementia [194] , WHO programs such as the Mental Health Global Action Program [195] , the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health [196] , and the recent call for global action to prevent chronic diseases [34, 197] should, if implemented, also reduce the burden of dementia worldwide. But these programs are conspicuous for their lack of mention of dementia. It is time that dementia was given a priority similar to that of the other chronic diseases: mortality from dementia may not be so large, but morbidity is on an altogether different scale both in quantity and in terms of the depth of human suffering. One way to meet the challenge of the dementias would be to establish a Global Dementia Initiative, modeled on the Global Stroke Initiative [198] ."}]
