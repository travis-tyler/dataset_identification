[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The variations of the mean sea level of the world ocean play a significant role in the development of coastal areas. Thus, it is extremely important to monitor changes in the sea level both on local and global scales. These measurements are traditionally performed using networks of coastal tide gauges 1 . However, the measurements of even most accurate tide gauges provide sea level estimates which are to some extent biased by the moution of the of the earth's surface. To overcome this problem, it was proposed to use a GNSS-receivers in coastal areas, which can simultaneously estimate both ground moution, solving common positioning problem, and local sea level, using reflected navigational signals 2 . Currently, there are two basic approaches to the problem of GNSS -reflectometry. The first one requires the installation of two GNSS-antennas vertically spaced at the predetermined distance. The first Right-Handed Circularly Polarized (RHCP) zenith-directed antenna is aimed to receive direct GNSS signals, which are RHCP. The second Left-Handed Circularly Polarized (LHCP) nadir-directed antenna is aimed to receive reflected from sea surface GNSS signals, which are mostly LHCP for high elevation angles of the satellites. Sea level in that case is determined from the difference between predetermined distance between two antennas phase centers and the distance between two antennas, estimated according to GNSS data 3 . The second approach is based on the multipath effect for the low elevation angles of GNSS satellites and does not require the installation of a second, nadir-directed LHCP antenna 4 . All the results presented in the current paper are obtained using that second approach."}, {"section_title": "FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM", "text": "Though the main purpose of the conventional RHCP GNSS-antenna is the reception and amplification of a direct signal, not all the multipath effects, for example signals reflected from the sea surface, are effectively suppressed. This is due to the fact that for satellite elevation angles less than 10 degrees both LHCP (dominant) and RHCP components are present in the GNSS signals, reflected from the sea surface. The RHCP component then decreases rapidly with increasing satellite elevation angle 5 . That, in particular, explains the choice of the cut-off elevation angle of ~ 15 degrees for many practical GNSS applications to mitigate multipath effects. Thus, at low elevation angles and azimuths of GNSS satellites which provide signals reflected from the sea surface, direct and reflected GNSS signals could interfere with each other. It could be observed as a periodical interference patterns in amplitudes or SNRs of GNSS signals. The experimental scheme is shown in Figure 1. Given that the atmospheric refractive index for gigahertz band radio waves (GNSS signals) differs little from unity, the geometrical path difference can be used to calculate the phase difference of the direct and reflected signals. Assuming flat surface reflection the geometrical path difference between the direct and reflected rays is 2 sin , where \u03b8 is the elevation angle of the satellite, h is the height of the antenna's phase center above the reflecting surface. Thus detrended amplitude variations or SNRs of received GNSS signals at low elevation angles due to multipath effects can be written as: where A is the amplitude of SNR variations changing slowly as a function of satellite elevation angle; \u03bb is the wavelength of the GNSS signal (for GPS corresponds to one of the working frequencies L1 -1575,42MHz, L2 -1227.60MHz, L5 -1176,45MHz; for GLONASS L1 -1602MHz and L2 -1246MHz, correspondingly); 0 \u03d5 is some phase shift. Trend removal in amplitude or SNR data is carried out using a second order polynomial fitting. So, in the experimental curves var (sin ) SNR \u03b8 there should be oscillations with a constant frequency 2h \u03bb , which can be determined by analyzing the spectrum of the amplitude or SNR variations, allowing for a known wavelength of the GNSS signal to determine the height of the antenna phase center above the reflecting water surface. Note that to obtain such interference pattern in amplitude or SNR data, approximately 25-35 min. long data record is needed. This time is typical for GNSS satellite to rise from the horizon up to 12-15 degrees elevation or to set from those elevation angles, depending on the satellite path. Of course, any variations of sea level within this time interval will be averaged. Moreover such variations lead to the broadening of the main spectral line of the var (sin ) SNR \u03b8 oscillations, as well as to the appearance of additional harmonics, which act like noise while resolving main harmonic. In some cases, for large sea level variations, the assumption of a single reflection frequency over the satellite pass could even break down. To automate sea level estimations we used the criterion that magnitude of main harmonic in the interference pattern spectrum should be three times that of average noise in spectrum."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS", "text": "As in Larson et al. studies 4 , we used data from GNSS station sc02 (48.55N, 123.01W) of UNAVCO network and data from NOAA Friday Harbor tide gauge (9449880), located a few hundred meters from the sc02 station. Station sc02 operates Trimble Net-R9 receiver with Choke -Ring Antenna. The data, which is publicly available in RINEX 2.11 format, contains SNR S1 and S2 for the two working frequencies of GPS and GLONASS systems at 1 sample every 15 sec. rate. Azimuth directions 110-150 degrees provide observations of multipath interference patterns in received GNSS signals due to reflections from the sea surface for satellite elevation angles 0.5 -12 degrees. In this study, in contrast to Larson et al. 4 , we use both GPS and GLONASS systems and both working frequencies L1 and L2 to estimate sea level variations, which practically doubles the number of daily measurements (average of 12 sea level estimates from GPS data, 8 -from GLONASS data). Moreover, the use of both operating frequencies allows to choose the optimum sea level estimation in terms of better meeting the criteria of determination of main harmonic of the interference pattern, i.e. choose the sea level estimation at the operating frequency for which the main harmonic is higher above the average noise level. The results for the period June 1-15, 2016 are considered below. Figure 2 (top panels) shows SNR S1 (red curves) and S2 (blue curves) dependence on the sine of elevation angle for GLONASS R20 (left) and R14 (right) satellite passes for June 1, 2016. The lower panels present the variations of S1 and S2 for each of the satellites. Note that periodical variations of S1 and S2 caused by multipath effects (reflection from the sea surface) are easily traced for both satellites. Also note the comparable SNR values for both GLONASS working frequencies, for GPS satellites SNR for the first frequency (L1) is typically almost twice as SNR for the second frequency (L2).  Figure 3 shows the spectra of SNR S1 (red lines) and S2 (blue lines) variations for the same satellites (R14 -solid lines, R20 -dashed lines). The frequencies in the spectra are translated into the antenna's phase center height above the reflecting sea surface. It can be seen that the height estimates obtained at different times (9:20 UT for R14 and 17:15 UT for R20) differ by more than 1.5 m due to tidal effects, as will be shown later. Note also that the magnitudes of main harmonics are well above the noise for both working frequencies, the magnitude of the main harmonic at the second (L2) working frequency is significantly greater than at the first working frequency (L1) for both GLONASS satellites. The latter effect is often observed in GPS data, despite the greater power of the signal at the first working frequency (L1).  Figure 4 presents the comparison of the sea level variations according to sc02 GNSS-reflectometry estimates (red dots) and the collocated Friday Harbor NOAA tide gauge (mareograph) (black dots) for the studied period June 1-15, 2016. Good agreement of the data with the correlation coefficient greater than 0.95 is observed. The GNSS-reflectometry data successfully represents semidiurnal tides and the transfer of energy from the morning tide to the evening one and back. If consider the longer data series, it is also possible to study variations corresponding to lunar month and its harmonics and even much slower changes in sea level, i.e. the rise of the sea level due to global warming effects.  Note that the possibility and the quality of the estimates of the antenna phase center height above the reflecting sea surface strongly depends on the sample rate of the input GNSS data. It can be shown that standard for IGS network 1 sample per 30 sec. rate is insufficient for the discussed GNSS-reflectometry approach, because with such sampling it is difficult or almost impossible to separate main harmonic of the interference pattern from the background noise. Thus, for GNSS -reflectometry routines it is worth using higher sampling rates (at least 1 sample per 15 sec. as in this study), for example highrate IGS network data with 1Hz sampling. In addition, the accuracy of sea level estimations also depends on the amplitude of S1 and S2 variations, in other words on the number of maxima and minima of the interference pattern, which can be distinguished from noise. Given the fact that the intensity of the received reflected signal decreases with increasing elevation angle of the satellite (effect of the antenna directivity pattern), it appears reasonable for GNSSreflectometry tasks to use horizontally oriented towards the sea surface antenna instead of zenith-directed one 6 , which allows to significantly increase the number of observed extrema of the interference pattern. Note also that rapid development of GNSS systems, such as Compass/BeiDou and Galileo, together with the increasing number of multisystem GNSS receivers (for example in IGS/MGEX network) in coastal areas provide the possibility to further increase the amount of data available for studies of sea level variations with GNSS-reflectometry technique 7 ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The paper presents the method for estimation of sea level variations from the GNSS -reflectometry data simultaneously using both GPS and GLONASS systems and their two working frequencies, which showed good agreement with the data of traditional tide gauge measurements. Although GNSS -reflectometry can not fully replace the measurements of the sea level using tide gauges, it provides additional useful information in the coastal areas with sufficient number of multisystem GNSS receivers."}]
