These programs include Pell Grants, federal student loans, work-study, and other federal aid. 3 The target population of students was limited to those enrolled in an academic program, at least one course for credit that could be applied toward an academic degree, or an occupational or vocational program requiring at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award. The target population excluded students who were also enrolled in high school or a high school completion (e.g., GED preparation) program. 4 The NPSAS and BPS samples are not simple random samples; therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. Power-Stats takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by PowerStats involves approximating the estimator by replication of the sampled population. The procedure used is a bootstrap technique.    2 Unmarried includes separated students."}, {"section_title": "National Center for Education Statistics", "text": "3 Estimates for parent education exclude the 3.7 percent of students who did not know the highest education attained by either parent. includes American Indian, Alaska Native, and respondents having origins in more than one race or in a race not listed.
