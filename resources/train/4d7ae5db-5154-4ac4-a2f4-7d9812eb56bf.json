[{"section_title": "", "text": "At the end of 2019, patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) were identified in Wuhan, China 1 , infected by a novel coronavirus, now named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2. The WHO then declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern 2 . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 bears 96% 3 and 79.5% identity to that of a bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively 4 . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the Corornaviridae family 5 . Clinically, several papers showed that most COVID-19 patients developed lymphopenia as well as pneumonia with higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe cases [6] [7] [8] , suggesting that the host immune system is involved in the pathogenesis 9, 10 . Patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV were previously reported to have antibody responses [11] [12] [13] [14] , but exhibited defective expression of type I and II interferon (IFN), indicative of poor protective immune responses [15] [16] [17] . However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one COVID-19 patient was shown with nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibody response, in which IgM peaked at day 9 after disease onset and then switched to IgG by week 2 3 , suggesting involvement of humoral immunity. SARS-CoV-2specific T lymphocyte response was unclear. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses.\nClinical and pathological characteristics of the 12 COVID-19 patients in this study were shown in Table 1 . All the patients initially showed mild symptoms via CT scan and were positive during SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Of them, 6 (patients #1-6) were newly discharged, while the remaining 6 were 2 weeks post discharge (follow-up patients, patients #7-12). In line with the previous reports, 2 patients (#5, 8) showed lymphopenia (normal range is 1.1-3.2X10e9 cells per L). However, only two travelled to Wuhan city within the past 3 months. One serum was obtained before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (healthy donor #1). 3 All rights reserved.

Human AB serum (GemCell, CA) was used as a negative control.\nIn order to detect anti-viral immune responses, we first constructed recombinant pET28-N-6XHis by linking 6 copies of His tag to the C-terminus of NP in the pET28-N vector (Biomed, Cat. number: BM2640). Escherichia coli transformed with pET28-N-6xHis was lysed and tested by Coomassie blue staining to confirm NP expression at 45.51 kDa. NP was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purity of NP was approximately 90% ( Figure S1A ). The presence of NP was subsequently confirmed by anti-Flag antibody ( Figure S1B ). The RBD region of S protein (S-RBD) and main protease (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 19 .956235) were produced by a baculovirus insect expression system and purified to reach the purity of 90% ( Figure S1A ).\nUsing sera from patients and healthy donors, IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 NP, main protease and S-RBD antigens were analyzed. There was no significant antibody response to main protease in sera from several patients (data not shown), suggesting that it may not serve as an antigen for humoral immunity. We thus focused on NP and S-RBD. The serum from a patient and human AB serum were titrated in order to determine optimal dilutions (data not shown). Dilution of 1:50 was used for IgM and 1:150 for IgG. NP-and S-RBD-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were both detected in the sera of newly discharged patients, compared with healthy donor groups ( Figure 1A ). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were also more obviously observed than IgM in the follow-up patients (#7-12), when compared with healthy donors ( Figure 1A ). Taken together, these findings indicate that COVID-19 patients mounted IgG and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially NP and S-RBD, and also suggest that infected patients could maintain their IgG levels, at least for two weeks.\nSince RBD domain of the S protein has been shown to bind to human receptor ACE2 3 , the existence of antibodies against it may suggest neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess this, we performed pseudovirus particle-based neutralization assay. As shown in Figure 1B , patients #1, 2, 4 and 5, all within the discharged group, had high levels of neutralizing antibody titers. These results demonstrate that most recently discharged patients All rights reserved.

All except patient #11, the follow-up patients had lower levels of neutralizing antibody titers than recently discharged patients, though all positive with the exception of patient #7 being negative. Whether protective humoral immunity can be maintained needs further investigation.\nTo explore cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, we isolated PBMCs from the whole blood and phenotypically analyzed them by flow cytometry (Figure 2A ). We found that compared to discharged patients, there was a trend towards an increased frequency of NK cells in the follow-up patients ( Figure S2 ). However, there was no significant difference in terms of the percentages of T cells among those two groups and the healthy donors.\nTo assess virus-specific cellular immunity, we then treated PBMCs with recombinant NP, main protease and S-RBD, followed by IFN-g ELISpot analysis. The results were considered positive if there were at least 1-fold increase in the numbers of IFN-g-secreting T cells in the subject than in the healthy donors. As shown in Figure 2B , compared with healthy donors, the numbers of IFN-g-secreting NP-specific T cells in patients #1, 2, 4 and 5 were much higher than other patients, suggesting that they had developed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Of note, patients #1, 2, 4 and 5 developed both strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Main protease-specific T cells were detected in patient #1, 2 and 5, while patients # 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 showed S-RBD-specific T cells. Although the numbers of IFN-gsecreting S-RBD specific T cells were much lower than those of NP-specific T cells, they could be detected in more patients than those for other viral proteins. S-RBD thus not only elicited humoral immunity that may result in blockade of receptor binding during viral entry in host cells, but also induced T cell immune responses, suggesting S-RBD is a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In the follow-up patients, only patient #8 who showed lymphopenia before treatment still had a high number of IFN-g-secreting T cells in response to NP, main protease and S-RBD ( Figure 2B ), which suggests that anti-viral T cells may not be maintained at high numbers in the PBMCs in the recovered patients. More interestingly, when combining all 12 patients in our analysis, there was a significant correlation between the neutralizing All rights reserved.

Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state.\nOur work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAll rights reserved.
