Approximately 95 percent of the annual cohort of doctorate recipients in 1994 responded to the questionnaire. Over the decade, though, the response rate ranged from 95 percent in 1985 to 91 percent in 1989 and 95 percent in 1994. Note that most of the numbers presented are actual self-reports, as there are no adjustments for nonresponse. For the nonrespondents, partial data from public sources are added to the file for nonrespondents; therefore complete counts are presented for conferred doctorates by field of study and sex of recipient. Although some tables present data subject to nonresponse, the estimates represent the conservative known estimate for any data item. Therefore, small changes in numbers should be interpreted w:th caution, as numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Thus, declines and inc.-eases may appear greater than they actually are. Tables   Page   I.
