In Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive decline with progression to dementia is the defining clinical feature, accompanied by development of the neuropathological hallmarks of beta-amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. 1 In Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive decline is a secondary feature that nevertheless affects the vast majority of PD patients. 2 Multiple lines of evidence suggest that common mechanisms may contribute to cognitive decline in both PD and AD. Neuropathologically, although PD is defined by alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy body pathology, 3 many PD patients are found at autopsy to have coexisting AD pathology. 4 Some PD patients have been reported to demonstrate beta-amyloid deposition in life by radiotracer imaging as well. 5 Biochemically, in vitro evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein and tau can synergize in the formation of the amyloid fibrils 6 that may initiate pathophysiology. Genetically, mechanisms involving tau -which has been extensively studied in AD 7 -are also implicated by genome-wide association with risk of developing PD. 8 Finally, from the biomarker literature, lower Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid, in addition to providing diagnostic support in AD, 9 may predict cognitive decline over time in PD. 10 We previously screened 102 plasma proteins in an effort to discover blood-based biomarkers predicting cognitive performance in PD. From this screen, we nominated epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a candidate biomarker: low plasma EGF levels associated cross-sectionally with poorer cognition in PD and predicted, in a small cohort of 49 non-demented PD patients followed longitudinally, a substantially increased risk of progression to dementia. 11 Both our cross-sectional and predictive associations were subsequently independently replicated in early, drug-na\u20ac \u0131ve PD subjects. 12 As a trophic factor, EGF as a candidate biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases such as PD is biologically attractive. Delivery of trophic factors to the brain to ameliorate neurodegeneration has shown efficacy in animal models of PD and AD. 13, 14 Indeed, such an approach is currently being tested in human trials. 15 Thus, one may hypothesize that individuals with lower levels of trophic factor support may be at risk of accelerated neurodegenerative disease progression. In the case of EGF, in particular, dopamine-triggered adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone has been reported to depend on EGF and its cognate receptor, EGFR, 16, 17 and local administration of EGF in an animal model of PD has been reported to rescue neurodegeneration. 18 Because many of these potential mechanisms may extend beyond PD-related neurodegeneration, we sought to understand whether plasma EGF levels predict disease course in PD as well as AD. Furthermore, because increasing evidence suggests that pathophysiology is well underway years or decades before clinical manifestation, we investigated EGF levels in both manifest and prodromal stages of PD and AD. Finally, given the well-known failures of many candidate biomarkers to replicate, we sought to replicate our previous finding in a large cohort of PD patients followed longitudinally over many years."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical cohorts", "text": "Three clinical cohorts were used in this study (Table 1) .

In the ADNI cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk of conversion from AD-MCI to dementia for different baseline levels of EGF, adjusting for age and sex. In the PARS cohort, a multivariate linear model adjusting for age and sex was used to evaluate the cross-sectional association between EGF and performance in the five aforementioned cognitive domains. In the case of the UPenn PD cohort, covariates were chosen for the primary model to replicate our prior analyses. 11 In the case of the ADNI and PARS cohorts, covariates were chosen to match the PD analysis.\nSecondary analyses: In the UPenn PD cohort, we additionally evaluated the effect of adjusting for baseline cognitive performance (MoCA) or motor impairment (UPDRS-III) in order to further understand the basis of the associations observed. In the ADNI cohort, we additionally investigated (1) baseline cross-sectional differences in EGF among NC, AD-MCI, and AD individuals, (2) the effect of omitting or adding further covariates such as baseline MMSE score on model results, and (3) the effect of baseline plasma EGF on change in MMSE over time, using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age and sex, with or without additional adjustment for baseline MMSE score. In the PARS cohort, we additionally investigated the relationship between EGF and cognitive domain performance (in linear models adjusting for age and sex) within the subgroup at increased risk for development of PD (hyposmic individuals with putaminal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding <80% expected for age), as the PARS cohort is an asymptomatic, rather than prodromal, cohort. We also evaluated the effect of adjusting for DAT binding levels in PARS individuals as an early indicator of whether associations between plasma EGF and cognitive domain performance in PARS individuals are more or less likely to be mediated by dopaminergic systems.\nFor exact details of each analysis (covariates included, statistical methods used in each situation), please see the Data S1 for R-scripts.\nTwo-tailed P-values are reported for all statistical analyses.

Using linear mixed-effect models, we asked if lower plasma EGF levels predicted future cognitive decline. In models adjusted for age and sex, we found a significant association between lower baseline EGF levels and faster rate of cognitive decline (P = 0.048). Further adjusting for baseline, MoCA score did not affect our result (P = 0.014).\nAs various risk factors for cognitive decline have been described in PD, including severity and type of motor impairment, 28 we further asked whether EGF correlated with motor symptoms. We found no correlation between plasma EGF levels and scores on the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) at baseline (P = 0.682). Accordingly, adjusting our model predicting longitudinal cognitive decline from baseline EGF levels to include baseline UPDRS as well as age and sex as covariates did not affect the significant association between baseline EGF levels and rate of cognitive decline (P = 0.019)."}, {"section_title": "Low baseline plasma EGF levels predict conversion from amnestic MCI to AD", "text": "We next sought to understand whether lower plasma EGF levels predict faster cognitive decline in PD subjects only, or whether these findings could extend to AD as well. To answer this question, we obtained and analyzed data from the ADNI cohort. In cross-sectional analyses comparing ADNI NC participants (n = 58), subjects with amnestic MCI (AD-MCI, n = 396), and subjects with AD (n = 112), we found that the AD-MCI and AD individuals had significantly lower levels of EGF at baseline (P = 0.029, Fig. 1A ). Adjusting for age and sex minimally changed the result (P = 0.056 for cross-sectional association between EGF and cognitive class), and age and sex did not differ significantly in NC participants versus AD-MCI and AD participants (Table 2 ) from the ADNI cohort.\nWithin the AD-MCI individuals of the ADNI cohort, we observed a wide range of plasma EGF levels, suggesting that baseline EGF levels might predict conversion to AD dementia. Of the 396 individuals with baseline EGF measures in the AD-MCI cohort, 387 had available follow-up data, and 203/387 (52%) converted to AD dementia during follow-up. The average time to dementia among individuals who converted to AD was 25.7 months (SD = 18.3 months).\nIn a Cox proportional hazards survival analysis in these 387 AD-MCI patients, adjusting for age and sex, individuals with the lowest tertile of EGF levels at baseline demonstrated an increased rate of conversion to dementia in follow-up (log-rank test P < 0.001, HR: 1.76, 95% CI = 1.33-2.33, Fig. 1B) . We next considered the possibility that this apparent effect of EGF might simply be reflecting a difference in cognition between low-versus high-EGF individuals at baseline. However, EGF levels did not correlate with baseline MMSE, and additionally adjusting for baseline MMSE score in our Cox proportional hazards analysis only strengthened the effect (logrank test P < 0.001, HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.41-2.48 for association between plasma EGF at baseline and risk of conversion from AD-MCI to AD). Omitting adjustment for covariates also did not affect results (log-rank test P < 0.001, HR: 1.741, 95% CI = 1.31-2.30).\nTo further confirm the value of baseline plasma EGF measures in predicting longitudinal change in cognition in these 387 AD-MCI individuals, we employed linear mixed-effects models incorporating MMSE scores from 2444 total visits; each individual was followed at 6-month intervals for up to 96 months. In these longitudinal analyses adjusted for age and sex, we found a significant association between lower baseline EGF levels and faster decline in MMSE (P = 0.033). Further adjusting for baseline MMSE score did not alter our results (P = 0.031). Figure 1 . Plasma EGF as a predictive biomarker in amnestic MCI-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion. At baseline, plasma EGF levels are lower in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AD-MCI, n = 396), and subjects with (AD, n = 112), compared to cognitively normal subjects (CN, n = 58). Means +/\u00c0 SEMs are shown. *P < 0.05. Lower baseline levels of EGF correlate with higher risk of conversion to AD among ADNI individuals with AD-MCI (n = 396, log-rank test P < 0.001, HR: 1.741, 95% CI = 1.31-2.30). Survival curves for months without conversion to AD are shown for AD-MCI individuals with the lowest tertile of baseline plasma EGF levels (red) versus those with higher tertiles of plasma EGF levels (blue). Adjusting for age at plasma sampling and sex in Cox proportional hazards models did not change the result (log-rank P < 0.001, HR: 1.76, 95% CI = 1.33-2.33).\nLow plasma EGF levels correlate crosssectionally with visuospatial domain impairment in an asymptomatic cohort at high risk of developing PD Having shown that lower plasma EGF levels associate with cognitive decline in PD, and that lower EGF levels also characterize AD-MCI individuals at higher risk of cognitive decline and conversion to AD, we next asked whether lower EGF levels correlated with poorer cognition in prodromal PD as well.\nTo answer this question, we turned to the PARS cohort, in which investigators have intensely characterized a cohort of asymptomatic individuals, some at increased risk for developing PD. 23, 29 From an initial pool of more than 5000 individuals, PARS investigators used a sequential biomarker strategy consisting of olfactory testing followed by DAT imaging to characterize lower risk versus higher risk groups. In these at-risk individuals, putaminal DAT uptake determined by [\n123 I] b-CIT SPECT has been used as a measure of DAT density, a proxy for striatal dopaminergic neuron terminal integrity. 30 We measured plasma EGF levels by ELISA in 165 individuals from the PARS cohort, to assess whether EGF levels associated with performance on any of the five cognitive domains -executive function, language, memory, attention, visuospatial -tested by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.\nWhen all PARS subjects, regardless of DAT uptake and olfactory testing results, were considered as a group, no significant correlations between EGF and cognitive domain scores were observed ( Fig. 2A) . However, in the subset of prodromal individuals at highest risk for development of PD (hyposmic individuals with putaminal DAT uptake <80% of age-expected value, n = 35), we found that lower plasma EGF levels correlated with poorer performance on visuospatial domain tasks (Fig. 2B) , in a linear regression model adjusting for age and sex (nominal P = 0.045). Further adjusting our model for DAT binding levels strengthened the association (nominal P = 0.010).\nIn contrast to these visuospatial domain findings, cognitive performance in the other four domains did not correlate with EGF levels in either the full PARS cohort or the high-risk subgroup (Fig. 2C) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we evaluated the association of plasma EGF levels with cognitive outcome in 236 PD individuals from UPenn, 566 individuals from ADNI, and 165 asymptomatic individuals at risk for PD from PARS. In longitudinal follow-up, we replicated our previous finding that low baseline plasma EGF levels predict cognitive decline in PD. Moreover, in ADNI subjects, plasma EGF levels were decreased in AD-MCI and AD individuals compared to neurologically normal controls, and lower baseline plasma EGF levels also predicted a higher risk of conversion to AD. Finally, in PARS subjects at highest risk for development of PD, low EGF correlated with poorer visuospatial task performance. Taken together, our data suggest that low plasma EGF levels predict accelerated rates of neurodegeneration in both AD and PD, possibly through alterations in shared neurotrophic signaling pathways.\nWe previously nominated plasma EGF as a biomarker predicting cognitive decline in PD, emerging from an unbiased screen of~100 proteins. 11 In our initial study, however, the longitudinally followed patient sample was small, consisting of only 49 subjects, and a subsequent replication by an independent group also suffered from a limited sample size of 65. 12 Here, we replicate our finding in 236 new PD patients followed for up to 5 years, a key result because demonstration of the robustness of initial findings is an important, but often unsuccessful, aspect of biomarker research.\nBroadening the scope of plasma EGF as a predictive biomarker is our demonstration here that low EGF levels are also predictive of the transition from AD-MCI to AD. Indeed, we found that AD-MCI individuals with the lowest baseline levels of plasma EGF expression had~80% increase in their risk of conversion to AD, compared to AD-MCI individuals with higher levels of EGF expression. Prior to this study, plasma EGF levels have been reported in small cohorts of AD patients, with conflicting results in different studies with respect to the direction by which AD patients differ from controls. 31, 32 In order to reach a more definitive answer, we evaluated 387 AD-MCI subjects from the 55-site international ADNI cohort, in longitudinal analyses with follow-up for an average of 3 years. We note further that our result was robust to changes in modeling paradigms. That is, we continued to find significant associations between lower baseline plasma EGF levels and faster cognitive decline whether we (1) adjusted or did not adjust for various covariates, (2) used Cox proportional hazards analyses to evaluate risk for conversion to AD dementia, or (3) used linear mixedeffects models to evaluate baseline EGF as a predictor of longitudinal rate of change in MMSE. We thus add plasma EGF to a very small number of biochemical biomarkers -CSF tau and beta-amyloid chief among them -that have demonstrated significant predictive value in an international cohort of AD patients. 33, 34 We find that low plasma EGF levels may correlate cross-sectionally with visuospatial impairment in the highest-risk individuals from the asymptomatic PARS cohort. This finding is certainly less definitive than our longitudinal results for cognitive decline in overt PD and for the MCI-to-AD conversion, as it emerges from subgroup analyses and may not survive Bonferroni correction, depending on which covariates are used in the model. However, two aspects of our result merit discussion. First, EGF levels correlate with visuospatial domain performance, but not with performance in other cognitive domains. Second, we find this association between EGF levels and visuospatial domain performance in only the highest-risk individuals within the asymptomatic PARS cohort, and the association is more significant when DAT binding levels are included as a covariate. Intriguingly, multiple studies have demonstrated that visuospatial domain impairment is a frequent feature of the mild cognitive impairment associated with PD (PD-MCI), even in its earliest stages. [35] [36] [37] The fact that the relationship between plasma EGF and visuospatial domain impairment is only seen in the highest-risk asymptomatic PARS cohort individuals could be due to chance. However, our results may also represent the biomarker signature of one of the earliest phases of PD-MCI, emerging even prior to a formal diagnosis of PD. Longitudinal findings from the PARS cohort (which is actively being followed) will be important in providing further support or refuting this possibility.\nWhile biomarkers that can be measured in the blood are attractive for many practical reasons, the finding of a correlation between a peripheral protein and a central nervous system (CNS) disease state begs the question of Figure 2 . Plasma EGF correlates with visuospatial domain performance in asymptomatic individuals at high-risk for PD. A, B. In the full PARS cohort, comprising asymptomatic individuals at high-and low-risk for development of PD (n = 165), plasma EGF levels did not correlate with visuospatial domain performance (Panel A). In high-risk asymptomatic individuals (defined by hyposmia and putaminal dopamine transporter uptake <80% expected for age, n = 35) from the Parkinson's Associated Risk Study (PARS) cohort, plasma EGF levels correlated with performance in the visuospatial domain, with higher EGF associating with better performance (Panel B). Each dot represents one subject. EGF levels are represented on the X-axis in pg/ml, and visuospatial domain performance is represented on the Y-axis as standard deviations from the mean. (C) Association of plasma EGF levels with performance in five cognitive domains was tested in linear models adjusted for age, sex and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding levels, using the high-risk asymptomatic individuals from the PARS cohort. Visuospatial domain performance correlated with plasma EGF levels, with higher EGF associated with better performance. No correlations were observed between plasma EGF levels and performance in the other four domains. The coefficient b represents the difference in performance in each of the cognitive domains, for each 1 standard deviation change in baseline EGF. whether evidence exists for the peripheral protein in question playing a significant role in relevant CNS processes. In the existing literature, EGF signaling pathways have been reported to play a role supporting the survival of dopaminergic neurons in multiple animal models of PD 38, 39 as well as in cell culture. 40, 41 More generally, EGF pathways have been reported to mediate the proliferation of neural precursor cells in the Subventricular zone (SVZ). 16, 17 Intriguingly, both dopaminergic signaling and signaling via the soluble secreted form of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) have been reported to influence this EGF-mediated SVZ neuronal proliferation. 16, 17, 42 Taken together, these data suggest that both PD-and AD-relevant processes might influence EGF signaling pathways; these changes in EGF signaling might, in turn, affect the survival of existing neurons or the process of adult neurogenesis.\nSeveral limitations to this study should be considered in interpreting our results. First, while intriguing, the relationship observed between low EGF plasma levels and visuospatial domain impairment in the PARS cohort is based on a limited number (n = 35) of high-risk individuals, and the significance of the association barely survives correction for multiple cognitive domain testing (nominal P = 0.010 for one out of five domains tested). As a consequence, this result should be considered preliminary, and replication in a larger set of extensively characterized prodromal PD individuals, cohorts of which are being assembled now, may be needed to fully understand the role of plasma EGF as a prodromal PD biomarker. More generally, the data presented here are correlative; additional mechanistic studies in progressive animal models of AD and PD would be needed to understand the role of EGFbased trophic support as a potential therapeutic avenue in these diseases.\nWith these caveats in mind, however, we have evaluated EGF plasma levels here in nearly 1000 unique individuals at prodromal and manifest stages of PD and AD, demonstrating that low EGF levels robustly predict poorer cognition in both of these diseases. Moreover, EGF as a candidate biomarker emerged as the top hit from an unbiased screen of~100 plasma proteins. 11 Our findings support the general approach of unbiased screening for lead discovery, 43 which may in turn lead to both practical biomarker development and indications of potential routes for therapeutic exploration. From an immediate practical perspective, our study suggests that a relatively simple blood test may be able to predict which individuals are at highest risk to cognitively decline in both PD and AD-MCI. From a therapeutic perspective, our study suggests that further investigations into whether enhanced EGF-based trophic support may slow neurodegeneration may be warranted. With over 6 million people suffering from AD and PD in the US alone, 44 and no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for either disease, both immediate practical biomarkers and delineation of novel therapeutic approaches are greatly needed.\nAuthor's contributions EGF plasma measurements were performed by TLU, and statistical analyses were performed by NSL, CRS, HRC, and ACP.
