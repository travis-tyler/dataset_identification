[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the last decade, incidents of increased seismicity throughout the central United States have been correlated with wastewater disposal to support oil and gas operations, commonly associated with unconventional hydrocarbon plays (e.g., Frohlich et al., 2011 Frohlich et al., , 2014 Horton, 2012; Keranen et al., 2014; Rubinstein et al., 2014) . One such hydrocarbon play is the Haynesville shale play, which includes areas of east Texas and northwest Louisiana.\nIn many recent studies, whether seismicity is natural or associated with hydrocarbon activities is difficult to disentangle due to issues of seismic network coverage. This is coupled with the fact that the recent increase in earthquakes in the central United States has been occurring in a region that has been relatively sparsely instrumented. The monitoring coverage was considerably improved with the temporary (\u223c2 yr) deployment of seismometers during the USArray Transportable Array (TA) experiment (see Data and Resources) , which crossed the central United States in 2010-2012. This deployment presents a unique opportunity to understand intraplate seismicity and seismicity associated with unconventional hydrocarbon plays. We analyze the seismicity from April 2010 to July 2012 using this denser instrumentation (\u24ba Table S1 , available in the electronic supplement to this article).\nBecause the broad instrument spacing (\u223c70 km) is not ideal for studying specific seismicity sequences, we utilize recently developed techniques to improve our seismicity catalogs. In addition to proximity issues, seismicity catalogs can be woefully incomplete for many reasons, including high station noise, earthquakes occurring closely spaced in time, or sparse network coverage. An effective way to identify possible \"missing\" events is the waveform matched-filter technique (e.g., Shelly et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2015) . Waveforms from earthquakes that are undetected but close spatially and that have similar focal mechanisms to cataloged events may transmit waveforms that appear similar upon inspection or are identified as similar by cross correlation. In this study, we use the matched-filter technique to identify earthquakes not detected by our initial automatic methods, allowing us to build a more comprehensive seismicity catalog with geographic emphasis near the Haynesville shale play (Fig. 1) . Other studies have successfully used a waveform cross-correlation technique in the central United States withTA data (Kim, 2013; Skoumal et al., 2014) , and we use a comparable network-based cross correlation."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Automatic Earthquake Detection As in our previous study in the Williston Basin , we first build a catalog utilizing standard passive seismological techniques for identifying earthquakes among continuous seismograms. We identify candidate phase arrivals utilizing an automatic short-term average/long-term average (STA/LTA) ratio filter with a threshold set based on our previous experience working with TA data. We catalog picks and determine trial locations and origin times using Antelope Seismic Database software. The phase arrivals and event associations are all analyst-reviewed and in all cases repicked manually. These phases are used to locate the events with the GENLOC earthquake location library (Pavlis et al., 2004) as it is currently implemented in the dbloc2 module of the Antelope seismic software using a 1D seismic velocity model for east Texas (\u24ba Table S2 ), slightly modified from Frohlich et al. (2014) . We utilize these events as templates for the next step in the analysis.\nWaveform Matched-Filter Detection of \"Missing\" Earthquakes We next identify additional events by applying the matchedfilter technique. This technique utilizes waveforms of known events as a template to search for similar patterns in continuous recordings. It has been successfully applied to detect a myriad of unreported events that occurred at midocean ridges and transform faults (Shearer, 1994) , as low-frequency earthquakes within the deep tectonic tremor signals (Shelly et al., 2007) , early aftershocks (Peng and Zhao, 2009) , triggered earthquakes , and foreshocks (Kato et al., 2012; Walter et al., 2015) .\nTo run the matched-filter technique, we use the manually picked waveforms as initial templates. In order to focus on regional waveforms, we band-pass filter these data between 1 and 5 Hz, cut the waveforms 1 s before and 5 s after the phase arrival (P or S), and resample the data at 20 Hz. The filter and time cut are chosen to best represent the waveforms with high fidelity for the short distances (interstation TA distance \u223c70 km) and relatively short duration of the low-magnitude events for the resampled data. We utilize template events that have phase arrivals from at least four stations within the network. For each component and at each sample point through time, the matched-filter technique computes the normalized cross-correlation coefficient between the template and the continuous data to determine a normalized cross-correlation coefficient time series. Here \"normalized\" means the crosscorrelation coefficient is between \u22121 and 1. The normalized coefficients for each component are then time-shifted back to the origin time and stacked. Detection occurs when the stack initially exceeds nine times the median absolute deviation (MAD), a threshold similar to that employed by other studies utilizing a network-based matched-filter technique (e.g., Meng et al., 2013) . We examined these initial detections and, after careful analyst scrutiny, chose a higher threshold of 12 times the MAD (Fig. 2) , which was sufficient to ensure that visible body waves were present on seismograms for at least a few stations for the newly detected events. Note that this is a more conservative approach, reducing the possibility of false detections.\nOnce matches are identified, we further improve the relative locations of the newly identified events rather than assuming they have the same spatial origin as the template event. We cross-correlate individual phases of each newly detected event relative to the master template event to obtain differential timing of arrival phases at each component and to include phase shifts when this cross-correlation coefficient exceeds 0.4. These relative phase shifts, if they are present, are used in hypoDD (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) to obtain a relative location for the newly detected event with respect to the template event. Sometimes no phase shift is detectable; and, in these cases, the assigned location is plotted at the same epicenter as the template event."}, {"section_title": "Magnitude Determination", "text": "The default magnitude determination routine within Antelope (dbevproc) computes the Richter magnitude, otherwise known as the local magnitude M L . M L is calculated at each station with the equation E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; d f 1 ; 3 2 3 ; 7 2 1 M L log 10 A \u2212 log 10 A 0 \u0394 c; 1 in which log 10 A is the base-10 logarithm of peak amplitude A (in millimeters) on a Wood-Anderson seismometer, station \u0394 (in kilometers) is the source-station distance, and C is a station correction term. The log 10 A 0 (\u0394) term is the amplitude-distance correction, which is a function of \u0394 and was originally empirically determined for southern California (Richter, 1935) . This correction was originally fixed such that, on the Wood-Anderson seismometers that were once commonly used throughout southern California, the peak amplitude was 1 mm for an M w 3.0 earthquake recorded at a source-station distance of 100 km. Richter (1958) Upon comparison of the event magnitudes initially calculated for earthquakes that were also reported by the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) Comprehensive Catalog (see Data and Resources), we found that our initial magnitudes were, on average, \u223c0:8 magnitude units higher (\u24ba Fig. S1 ). As in other previous regional studies (e.g., Hutton and Boore, 1987; Kim, 1998; Kang et al., 2000) , we utilize equation (1) to determine a more reasonable value for the distance-correction term log 10 A 0 for our study region by setting M L equal to the ANSS magnitude and plotting log 10 A 0 as a function of distance to each station. Then, using least-squares to fit our data for east Texas, we find the following distance-correction term for east Texas when computing M L : \u2212 log 10 A 0 1:91log 10 \u0394 \u2212 1:55 (\u24ba Fig. S2 ). When we compare our correction with those determined for southern California (Richter, 1935; Hutton and Boore, 1987) over epicentral distances of 50-400 km, our correction is \u223c0:8 magnitude units higher, which is the cause of the discrepancy between our initial magnitude calculations and those provided by the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog. Thus, to obtain a magnitude for our study region, we utilize the following equation:\nE Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; d f 2 ; 3 2 3 ; 2 5 5 M L log 10 A \u2212 1:91 log 10 \u0394 1:55:"}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "We use equation (2) to calculate magnitudes for the template events. Equation (2) allows us to calculate magnitudes that are, on average, equal to the ANSS-published magnitude 0:1 magnitude units. For each component and each event detected by the matched-filter technique, instead of equation (2), we estimate the magnitude of the new event by calculating the ratio between the peak amplitude of the newly detected event and the original template event amplitude. The median value of all the ratios is used to calculate the new event magnitude, assuming a logarithmic scaling between event amplitude and magnitude (Peng and Zhao, 2009; , 2015) . Relative magnitude associations for crosscorrelated data may be prone to errors for low cross-correlation coefficient results (e.g., Schaff and Richards, 2014) . However, our data should be a reasonable approximation of the event magnitude because we have used a relatively conservative dataprocessing strategy: we select events using a relatively high MAD, we require that an analyst also visually identifies the detected event, and that the newly detected events have a relatively high cross-correlation value (median value of 0.59 for all newly detected events in Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seismicity", "text": "We identify 19 earthquakes using the STA/LTA method described in the Automatic Earthquake Detection section. When we used these as template events and applied the matched-filter technique, we identify a total of 58 earthquakes ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Most of the newly identified earthquakes have smaller magnitudes than the 19 template events (Fig. 2) . The template events are easily identified because they have a cross-correlation coefficient equal to 1.0 in Figure 2a . Most of the earthquakes occur in clusters originating from five distinct foci."}, {"section_title": "Timpson Cluster", "text": "The most numerous cluster, with 25 earthquakes (Fig. 3a) , occurred adjacent to the town of Timpson in east Texas and includes 13 events reported by Frohlich et al. (2014) . Our study attempts to analyze seismicity in mid-2012 during the time period when the TA stations were being removed from east Texas; many of the stations detecting seismicity were located in Louisiana at this time. Thus, Frohlich et al. (2014) should be consulted for their analysis of the Timpson aftershock seismicity using a temporary network installation beginning 26 May 2012, nine days after the M w 4.8 Timpson mainshock occurred. We identified four earthquakes (labeled \"Ti\" in Table 1 ) between the M w 4.8 earthquake and the temporary network install, highlighting the usefulness of the matched-filter technique for early aftershock detection and before network densification, when station coverage is otherwise too sparse to detect small aftershocks. In addition, among the Timpson events we identified are four earthquakes occurring in 2010, one in 2011, and seven in 2012 that were not identified by Frohlich et al. (2014) , including two earthquakes occurring after the 10 May 2012 M L 3.9 earthquake and prior to the 17 May 2012 M w 4.8 earthquake. This confirms that sustained seismic activity occurred 1.5-2 yr prior to the 17 May 2012 M w 4.8 earthquake, a finding consistent with Frohlich et al. (2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Bienville Cluster", "text": "The second-largest cluster identified in this study had 18 earthquakes and occurred in the northwestern portion of Louisiana, within the Bienville Parish and between the towns of Jamestown and Ringgold (Fig. 3b) . These earthquakes (labeled \"BP\" in Table 1 ) all occurred in August, September, and October of 2011 and were not reported by other agencies. Of particular note is the number of smaller magnitude earthquakes without a preceding larger event. Clearly these events are not part of some aftershock sequence and are instead most consistent with classification as a seismic swarm. However, many of the stations adjacent to the Bienville Parish area were removed in January 2012, as the network was repositioned eastward. Thus, our ability to detect earthquakes after the end of 2011 was greatly diminished.\nCenter Cluster A third cluster had six earthquakes, five occurring in June and one in December of 2010, about 25 km southeast of the Timpson cluster (Fig. 3) . This is \u223c6 km south of Center, Texas and several kilometers east of a location determined for an earthquake felt in Center in 1981 and recorded by a temporary local network (Pennington and Carlson, 1984; Frohlich and Davis, 2002) . The six earthquakes in this Center cluster (labeled \"Ce\" in Table 1 ) appear to be separate from the Timpson cluster; because they were recorded mostly by the same stations, it is implausible the epicenters are grossly mislocated.\nFor Bienville Parish, we compiled injection well volumes for Bienville Parish within the archives of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, utilizing a paid research service (\u24ba Table S5 ). Between 2005 to present there were 51 injection wells within the Parish. We included only the 14 wells closest to the epicenters identified within the western portion of Bienville Parish, shown in Figure 4 (\u24ba Table S3 ). There was no reported wastewater injection in the Bienville Parish area from 2005 to late 2010 (Fig. 4) . The seismicity we detect there occurred during peak monthly injection volumes around mid-to late-2011. Using a 1D seismic velocity model (\u24ba Table S1 ) tuned to local geology in the Timpson area (Frohlich et al., 2014) , we find that injection at a few wells at 40; 000 bbl=month occurs within 10 km of the cluster of epicenters shown in Figure 4 . We note that the horizontal error for epicenters is on the order of \u223c 2 km. Due to the 70 km station spacing, the earthquake focal depths are not reliable.\nCloser to the cluster of seismicity (within a few kilometers) were a number of production wells that were being completed around the time of the seismicity ( Fig. 4 ; \u24ba Table S4). Based on our review of regulatory filings, they were being hydraulically fractured from May through August 2011. However, high-resolution reflection seismic data, which in some cases delineates buried faults or other geomechanical features (e.g., Hornbach et al., 2015) , are not publicly available in the area of interest.\nThe presence of seismicity during the months experiencing high wastewater injection rates (Fig. 4b) , including the largest magnitude event during the highest monthly injection rate during calendar year 2011 suggests that earthquake activity could be coincident with relatively high injection rates. In mid-2012, injection rates were higher, though the TA stations were no longer present and thus our ability to detect seismicity in the area during 2012 was greatly diminished. The potential correlation between injection rate and the presence of seismicity would be an observation consistent with a recent study of the spatial correlation (\u223c10 km) between earthquakes and high-rate injection wells across the central United States (Weingarten et al., 2015) . Although, as that study and other recent studies highlight (e.g., Hornbach et al., 2015) , the lack of pore pressure monitoring at depth makes it difficult to determine the factors that trigger the seismicity. The epicenters in Bienville Parish are actually closer to production wells than to the injection wells. Moreover, because of the absence of nearby seismic stations near Bienville Parish prior to 2010, it is possible that small swarms of natural origin had occurred here or in other parts of northern Louisiana previously but went undetected. Though hydraulic fracturing typically produces very small earthquakes (\u223cM w 0 and below; Rubinstein and Mahani, 2015) , there are recent studies that show hydraulic fracturing has caused earthquakes of moderate size (\u223cM L 2-3) but generally not felt by humans except in a few cases (e.g., Friberg et al., 2014; Skoumal et al., 2015) and has even induced earthquakes up to M L 4.4 (BC Oil and Gas Commission, 2014). In the case of the Bienville Parish, the hydraulically fractured wells also appear to be relatively deep compared with production wells in other shale plays (true vertical depths are \u223c11; 500-12; 000 ft). Because background lithospheric stresses are greater at depth, injection into critically stressed zones may preferentially induce earthquakes large enough to be detected by regional seismic networks. Regardless of the specific contributing factors, hydraulic fracturing appears to be the most likely cause of seismicity in the Bienville Parish, though natural fault slip could have also caused the seismicity."}, {"section_title": "Border Cluster and Other Events", "text": "We also located earthquakes in other areas of Louisiana. A fourth cluster of six earthquakes (labeled \"Bo\" in Table 1 , and production wells (light gray circles). The mapped horizontal production wells are those completed May-August 2011 using hydraulic fracturing techniques (each bold black \u00d7 indicates a bottom hole location, each bold black circle, is a surface hole location; and labeled dates indicate the completion dates of hydraulic fracturing, which occurs over 3-8 days at each well. True vertical depths are \u223c11; 500-12; 000 ft at the bottom hole locations. See \u24ba Table S4 ). Note that earthquakes are 10-12 km from injection wells and within a few kilometers of production wells that were hydraulically fractured near the origin times of the events. 2014; McGarr, 2014) . Fluid injection in one well occurs within 1 km of the tip of a mapped blind fault that was identified to have slipped during the May 2012 aftershock sequence. Our findings confirm that seismicity was occurring in the years prior to the 17 May 2012 earthquake (Frohlich et al., 2014) , because we are able to identify different events than those identified in that study for the years preceding the Timpson mainshock."}, {"section_title": "Center and Border Clusters", "text": "Two other clusters of note include the Center cluster, located near the town of Center, Texas, and the border cluster, near the east side of Toledo Bend Reservoir in Louisiana (Fig. 5) . These clusters are about 30 and 80 km, respectively, from the Timpson earthquakes. Both clusters are within 5 km of an active injection well (Fig. 5) . The Center seismicity and injection occur adjacent to a mapped fault (Geomap Company, 2012) . The seismicity is clearly present prior to injection at the adjacent well (Fig. 5b) , but the largest magnitude event occurred on 1 December 2010 during a period of time when monthly wastewater injection exceeded 200; 000 bbl=month. If the larger event was induced by wastewater injection, then the observations suggest that injection in an area already experiencing seismicity may cause further events to occur. Alternatively, all events could be natural. The border cluster is adjacent to injection wells (within 5 km), though those wells inject at significantly reduced rates (\u223c40; 000 bbl=month) compared with the injection well adjacent to Center.\nThere is also recent historical seismicity near the east Texas border with Louisiana. In 1964, there were a number of earthquakes over a three-month period along the Texas-Louisiana border during the time period when the Sam Rayburn Reservoir and the Toledo Bend Dam were under construction but before water impoundment (Henley, 1965; Stevenson and McCulloh, 2001; Frohlich and Davis, 2002) . The area near Center also has experienced a number of earthquakes, including one M w 3.0 in 1981 (Pennington and Carlson, 1984) and two earthquakes in the period since the TA was removed from the area, including an M w 2.1 in 2013 and an M w 3.1 in 2014 (Fig. 5) . Although there are no injection wells within 5 km of the 2014 earthquake, there is an injection well within 4 km of the 3 February 2013 earthquake, and that injection well exceeded 400,000 bbl in the month of January 2013 (Texas Railroad Commission Public GIS Viewer, see Data and Resources), possibly triggering that event. Clearly there is a questionable relationship between seismicity and oil and gas activities in this region, because it is possible these earthquakes are associated with ongoing natural seismicity in the area or are related to wastewater injection or a combination of both."}, {"section_title": "Other Earthquakes", "text": "We identified three earthquakes in southern Louisiana and Mississippi, of which one was identified by other agencies (see the Seismicity section). There are numerous wastewater injection wells across southern Louisiana (Weingarten et al., 2015) in a zone with many growth faults extending out to the Gulf of Mexico. Reactivation of faults has likely occurred during hydrocarbon extraction and can result in surface subsidence (e.g., Chan and Zoback, 2007) . There was one earthquake reported by the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog between 1980 and 2010 (black open circle in southern Louisiana in Fig. 1 ; see Data and Resources), in addition to historical earthquakes near Lake Charles in 1952 (Davis et al., 1995) and in 1983 (Stevenson and Agnew, 1988) . Also, earthquakes have occurred in southern Alabama and Mississippi (Gomberg and Wolf, 1999) , with some relationship to hydrocarbon recovery efforts rather than wastewater injection. Nonetheless, the possibility of natural earthquakes cannot be ruled out. As we discuss in the Seismicity section, these earthquakes occurred when the TA was not yet installed in southeast Louisiana, and thus horizontal errors could be on the order of 10 s of kilometers. Because these individual events are not well located, we did not investigate them further and do not conclude whether they are induced or natural."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "From an analysis of TA data, including application of a matched-filter technique, we identified about 40 previously unreported earthquakes in eastern Texas and Louisiana. We detected earthquakes in five distinct clusters; however, the majority of events were confined to zones near Timpson, Texas, and Bienville Parish, Louisiana. The Timpson sequence has been studied and discussed extensively by Frohlich et al. (2014) . We identified a new cluster of seismicity in the Bienville Parish, Louisiana, which seems to exhibit swarm-like behavior. Because of the distance (\u223c10 km) from active injectors and without further geomechanical information, we cannot directly link this activity to wastewater injection, though it is possible. The more likely scenario is that hydraulic fracturing induced the small-magnitude (M L < 2:0) Bienville Parish seismic swarm; however, it is possible the events are natural. Near Center, Texas, we identify a cluster of seismicity that is within 5 km of an active injection well where maximum injection rates exceed 200; 000 bbl=month, though that seismicity appears to have begun prior to reported injection activities. This may be a case of a larger earthquake being triggered by injection in an area already experiencing seismicity. Previous to our study time period (Pennington and Carlson, 1984) and since our study (the Relation to Wastewater Injection and Hydraulic Fracturing section), there have been other events with a possible link to wastewater injection in the Center, Texas area (Fig. 5) . This work highlights the complicated nature of investigating seismicity sequences and underlines the continued need for more comprehensive seismic networks monitoring.\nStudies that suggest a potential link between human activity and seismicity should also consider whether natural tectonic events are possible. Because of the historical paucity of permanent seismic stations in the south-central United States, there is only limited information available about Louisiana's past seismicity over the last century (e.g., Stevenson and Agnew, 1988; Brasseaux and Lock, 1992; Ellsworth et al., 2012) . Without this historical context, it is difficult to determine whether earthquakes are natural or induced in regions of increasing energy production, especially those near sites of wastewater disposal or production operations. Prior to the TA, it is likely that humans would not have felt the seismicity in the Bienville Parish and Center/Border clusters; and, thus, it is possible that seismicity there is ongoing and natural. Nonetheless, the hydraulic fracturing in the area near Bienville Parish and the increase in wastewater disposal near Center, Texas, followed by the occurrence of seismicity seems an unlikely coincidence. It therefore is possible that hydraulic fracturing induced previously undetected seismicity within the northwest portion of Louisiana and that wastewater injection may have induced seismicity in eastern Texas.
