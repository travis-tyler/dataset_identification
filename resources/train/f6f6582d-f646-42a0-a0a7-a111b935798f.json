[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract The clinical relevance of gray/white matter contrast ratio (GWR) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unknown. This study examined baseline GWR and 3-year follow-up diagnostic status in MCI. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative MCI participants with baseline 1.5 T MRI and 3-year follow-up clinical data were included. Participants were categorized into two groups based on 3-year follow-up diagnoses: 1) non-converters (n=69, 75\u00b17, 26 % female), and 2) converters (i.e., dementia at follow-up; n=69, 75\u00b17, 30 % female) who were matched on baseline age and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Groups were compared on FreeSurfer generated baseline GWR from structural images in which higher values represent greater tissue contrast. A general linear model, adjusting for APOE-status, scanner type, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness, revealed that converters evidenced lower GWR values than non-converters (i.e., more degradation in tissue contrast; p=0.03). Individuals with MCI who convert to dementia have lower baseline GWR values than individuals who remain diagnostically stable over a 3-year period, statistically independent of cortical thickness or hippocampal volume."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a higher propensity to develop dementia (Ganguli et al. 2011) , so early identification is critical for primary and secondary intervention purposes. Recent diagnostic work-group recommendations request additional research identifying biomarkers, including structural imaging variables, for enhanced diagnostic accuracy (Albert et al. 2011 ). Tissue contrast is one potentially novel method to quantify early neuronal injury or microstructural changes in tissue properties. Gray to white matter signal intensity ratio (GWR) declines across the lifespan (Salat et al. 2009b) . Furthermore, AD patients have more compromised GWR than cognitively normal elders (Westlye et al. 2009) , and the spatial distribution of tissue contrast changes reflects regions associated with AD Stephen Damon and Dandan Liu completed statistical analysis.\nData used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/wpcontent/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf pathology, including the parahippocampal cortex (Salat et al. 2011) . Thus, GWR may have potential as a unique neuroimaging marker of tissue loss and early neuropathological changes associated with unhealthy brain aging. That is, changes in tissue contrast may reflect a ratio of cell water and lipid content of gray and white tissue, taking into account the absolute signal variability across the brain as well as field inhomogeneities. However, the clinical significance of GWR in MCI is not yet known.\nThis study leverages a publically available dataset to examine the clinical implications of GWR by examining baseline gray matter/white matter tissue contrast in a cohort of MCI individuals who either convert or do not convert to dementia over a 3-year follow-up. In light of prior crosssectional work showing that patients with AD have poor GWR relative to controls (Salat et al. 2011; Westlye et al. 2009 ), we hypothesized that tissue contrast would be poorer among participants with MCI at risk for conversion independent of neuroimaging markers of normal brain aging (i.e., cortical thickness, which cross-sectionally decreases across the cognitive aging spectrum (Lemaitre et al. 2012 ) and longitudinally decreases in community-based elders (Thambisetty et al. 2010) ) and neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal volume (Killiany et al. 1993) , one of the earliest neuroanatomical sites for AD-related neurodegeneration, especially in the CA1 stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosummoleculare (Braak et al. 2006 )."}, {"section_title": "Material & methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/) launched in 2004. The original ADNI study enrolled approximately 800 participants, aged 55-90 years. ADNI exclusion criteria included serious neurological disease other than AD, history of brain lesion or head trauma, and history of psychoactive medication use (for full inclusion/exclusion criteria please refer to http://www.adni-info.org). Analysis of ADNI's publically available database was approved by our local Institutional Review Boards prior to data access or analysis.\nThe current study included individuals with a baseline diagnosis of MCI who had a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, maintained enrollment in ADNI for at least 36 months, and had a 36-month follow-up diagnosis of MCI or dementia. These criteria resulted in a pool of 211 participants, which was divided into two groups: 1) converters or participants with dementia (McKhann et al. 1984) at their 36-month follow-up visit and 2) nonconverters or participants who remained MCI. These groups were then matched for age and MMSE score (Hulley et al. 2001; Thomas and Greenland 1983) by filtering the subset of non-converters for age and then making a one-to-one match (i.e., converter to non-converter) on age and MMSE score. This process resulted in a sample of 138 MCI participants (n=69 converters, n=69 non-converters). APOE genotyping was performed by the ADNI Biomarker Core (see http://www. adni-info.org/)."}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging scan acquisition & analysis", "text": "The ADNI neuroimaging protocol has been reported in detail (Jack et al. 2008; Weiner et al. 2010 ). For the current study, the raw 1.5 T MRI T1-weighted sagittal volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence high resolution structural images (1.25mm \u00d7 1.25mm \u00d7 1.20 mm) were downloaded from ADNI's publically available neuroimaging online databank (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/index.shtml). Before processing, all scans were viewed on a slice-by-slice basis to confirm motion and other artifacts were not present. Images were post-processed using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/) Fischl et al. 1999) . Subject data were run through the reconstruction process for skull stripping, intensity normalization, and surface segmentation. Manual intervention to correct for registration, topological, and segmentation defects were included during postprocessing. White and gray surfaces were manually inspected and corrected in accordance with the FreeSurfer manual (i.e., http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Edits). After manual intervention, images were re-processed through FreeSurfer to update the transformation template and segmentation information. Per FreeSurfer algorithms, the gray/white matter boundary was computed to serve as a reference for custom-defined surfaces. After surface generation, all surfaces were smoothed at 30 mm full-width/half-maximum Gaussian kernel to reduce the effects of noise on the results (Salat et al. 2009a; Salat et al. 2009b) . Three measures of interest were derived using FreeSurfer:\n(1) GWR: As described previously (Salat et al. 2011; Salat et al. 2009b ), images were corrected using a highly localized (to within 2 mm) nonparametric, nonuniform intensity normalization procedure to correct for inhomogeneity prior to sampling gray and white matter tissue intensity (Sled et al. 1998) . Gray matter signal intensity was measured at a depth of 35 % of the cortical ribbon thickness beginning from the gray matter/white matter border and projecting toward the gray matter/CSF border. White matter signal intensity was measured at 1 mm subjacent to the gray matter/white matter border. The GWR surface was then constructed with lower values indicating less distinct intensities (see Fig. 1 for illustration). The GWR measurement was numerically calculated as 100*(white matter intensity-gray matter intensity)/(white matter intensity + gray matter intensity). (2) Hippocampal volume: Images underwent automated segmentation (Fischl et al. 2004) . Regional volume was calculated based upon the number of voxels occupied within the region of interest. Hippocampal volume was then corrected for intracranial volume (ICV) defined by FreeSurfer's automated method . MPRAGE images were intensity normalized then segmented into CSF, gray, or white matter. Contiguous regions were detected based on intensity similarity and spatial gradient (contour). Bias fields were modeled as a three-dimensional second order polynomial. After three iterations of likelihood maximizations of the hidden Markov random field model, the estimated total intracranial volume (etICV) was computed as the sum of the gray and white matter voxels. ICV-corrected hippocampal volumes was computed as hippocampal volume/ etICV*100. (3) Cortical thickness: Both intensity and continuity information were used to produce representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest difference from the gray/white matter boundary to the gray matter/CSF boundary at each surface vertex (Fischl and Dale 2000) . The generated maps relied on spatial intensity gradients not restricted to the voxel resolution, so they were not affected by absolute signal intensity and were able to detect submillimeter features. Such cortical thickness procedures have been validated with histological (Rosas et al. 2002) and manual measurements )."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "For hypothesis testing, GWR was analyzed with a vertex-byvertex general linear model (GLM) between conversion groups adjusting for apolipoprotein \u03b54 (APOE4) carrier status (i.e., positive defined as e2/e4, e3/e4, e4/e4 versus negative defined as e2/e2, e2/e3, e3/e3 (Yip et al. 2005) ), scanner type (Han et al. 2006) , cortical thickness (i.e., a marker of brain aging (Risacher et al. 2009 )), and hippocampal volume (i.e., a marker of neurodegeneration (Braak et al. 2006) ). To assess the stability of our observations, a Monte Carlo simulation technique was applied using 5000 iterations of repeated random sampling. The simulation models related GWR to conversion status, adjusting for APOE4 status, scanner type, and hippocampal volume. Cortical thickness was excluded in the simulation models because the technique implemented does not allow for the inclusion of a per-vertex regressor. MMSE and age were not included as covariates, as the groups were matched a priori on these factors. As a secondary analysis, hierarchical models were used to compare goodness-of-fits between models. One neuroimaging marker (marker A) was related to conversion status, and we tested the incremental deviance value (i.e., a likelihood ratiobased test statistic for multivariate logistic regression) of adding a second neuroimaging marker (marker B) to the model. Next, we tested the incremental deviance value of adding the remaining neuroimaging marker (marker C) to the previous model. Six sets of hierarchical models were run, representing each possible permutation for ordering the three neuroimaging variables (i.e., ABC, BAC, BCA, CBA, CAB, ACB where A=hippocampal volume, B=cortical thickness, and C=GWR).

The observed tissue contrast difference is particularly noteworthy for several reasons. First, GWR differences occurred in light of no betweengroup statistical differences in global white matter tissue intensity and a non-significant trend for global gray matter tissue intensity differences. Second, the GWR differences were statistically independent of APOE4 status and two conventional neuroimaging markers (i.e., cortical thickness (Lemaitre et al. 2012; Thambisetty et al. 2010 ) and ICV-corrected hippocampal volume (Braak et al. 2006; Killiany et al. 1993) ). Third, findings appear relatively stable as demonstrated by the simulation results. Finally, when statistically considering the GWR variable in multivariate models with the two conventional neuroimaging markers (i.e., cortical thickness and ICVcorrected hippocampal volume), GWR and ICV-corrected hippocampal volume were consistently predictive of conversion outcome while cortical thickness was not. Therefore, it appears GWR may offer unique information regarding neuroanatomical changes linked to increased risk for conversion to dementia. Prior studies have examined tissue contrast in aging (Magnaldi et al. 1993; Salat et al. 2009b) , AD (Salat et al. 2011) , schizophrenia (Kong et al. 2012) , and epilepsy (Thesen et al. 2011 ). For example, over two decades ago, Raz and colleagues (1990) observed a change in the differentiation of gray and white matter on T1 imaging, and this tissue contrast difference was related to cognition among a small cohort (n= 26) of older adults. Using a subjective rating scale, Magnaldi et al. (1993) , reported significantly decreased regional contrast between gray and white matter in adults in the sixth and seventh decade relative to those adults in the third decade of life. These age-related differences were later replicated by Salat et al (2009b) , and extended to include regional measurements of GWR using the same FreeSurfer method implemented in the current study (Salat et al. 2009a ). GWR as quantified by FreeSurfer also differs in patients with AD (Salat et al. 2009a) relative to controls when adjusting for cortical thickness, schizophrenia relative to controls when adjusting for cortical thickness (Kong et al. 2012) , and epilepsy relative to controls (Thesen et al. 2011) , albeit with different anatomical patterns.\nThere is a strong need for early diagnosis of AD in the MCI or preclinical stages, with recent recommendations calling for identifying biomarkers, such as structural imaging changes, of underlying AD pathophysiology . The current findings extend prior work examining tissue contrast in normal (Magnaldi et al. 1993 ) and abnormal brain aging (Kong et al. 2012; Salat et al. 2011) by highlighting the clinical significance of GWR in longitudinal outcomes among older adults \"at risk\" for dementia. That is, even when statistically considering key imaging (hippocampal volume, cortical thickness) and genetic risk factors (APOE4) associated with cognitive decline, GWR was more compromised at baseline among MCI participants who converted to dementia over the 3-year follow-up period. GWR may be a particularly valuable imaging marker in MCI (and perhaps even pre-MCI) for detecting microstructural changes in the signal intensity between gray and white matter tissue and aiding in identification of individuals at risk for AD. Future research will need to examine the clinical relevance of GWR in the pre-MCI phase.\nIt is noteworthy that the observed effects in tissue contrast between the converter and non-converter MCI groups were predominantly detected in the left hemisphere. That is, in the adjusted models, significant differences were observed in the bilateral middle temporal lobe, left superior temporal lobe, bilateral subparietal region, left calcarine, and left precuneus. Many of these regions, such as the middle temporal lobe (Beckett et al. 2012) , superior temporal lobe (Arnold et al. 1991; Beckett et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2012) , and left precuneus (Baron et al. 2001; Sperling et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2012) , are directly implicated early in the AD pathological process. Furthermore, prior studies have linked hypometabolism in the precuneus to clinical memory dysfunction (Herholz et al. 2002) . The laterality of our observations may also be attributable to the enrollment criteria applied to this specific cohort, which emphasized a verbal amnestic neuropsychological profile defined by impairments on paragraph learning (Petersen et al. 2010) . Verbal episodic memory performances are mediated by left hemisphere structures, which may contribute to more lateral effects.\nThe underlying pathological mechanism for the reduction in contrast is not well understood. Changes in white matter signal intensity can occur as a function of increased water content with myelin structural changes (Blackmon et al. 2011) , small vessel disease resulting in white matter changes (van Norden et al. 2011) , or astrocytic gliosis (Kitagaki et al. 1997) . In contrast, gray matter signal intensity changes are generally due to neuronal loss (Rusinek et al. 1991) . The contrast values in the current study were calculated using T1 images, which relate cell water and lipid content of gray and white tissue. Therefore, reductions in tissue contrast ratio may be due to an increased gray matter signal resulting from decreased water content and a decreased white matter signal due to demyelination. A ratio between tissue types may offer a measure that takes into account absolute signal variability across the brain as well as field inhomogeneities.\nThe current study has a number of strengths. First, we assessed GWR, a relatively unique measure of gray and white matter structural integrity. We expand prior work (Salat et al. 2011) by assessing the clinical relevance of GWR in a sample of individuals at risk for dementia. Additionally, individuals in this sample were matched for baseline cognitive status (MMSE) and age and did not differ with respect to other key demographic variables. The ADNI data offers a number of strengths, including nationwide representation of participants, standardized neuroimaging protocol, and standardized diagnostic criteria.\nDespite these strengths, participants comprising the ADNI dataset are predominantly White and well-educated (i.e., with a mean education of 16 years). Additionally, ADNI is a cohort study and was designed to support research aimed at discovery and treatment development, which may limit the generalizability of findings. Though we focused on GWR while statistically holding constant the effects of cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, it is important to highlight the multicollinearity of neuroimaging variables as a common limitation in cognitive aging research. As an example, the calculation of GWR includes measuring the depth of 35 % of the cortical ribbon from the gray matter/white matter border. GWR and cortical thickness are not entirely independent of one another, an observation supported in our study by significant bilateral unadjusted correlation values. While the current results focus on baseline neuroimaging markers in relation to 3-year followup conversion status, the design is still cross-sectional in nature. Longitudinal studies are needed to model GWR changes over time and determine how such change affects disease progression. The current study results do not reconcile the underlying etiology associated with GWR compromise, including the mechanism(s) or pathophysiological process(es) behind degradation in tissue contrast. Additional research is needed to better understand the etiology of GWR changes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study found that individuals with MCI who later convert to dementia have poorer gray matter/white matter tissue contrast at baseline than a cohort of MCI individuals who remain stable over the 3-year followup period.
