TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) is a large-scale assessment designed to inform educational policy and practice by providing an international perspective on teaching and learning in mathematics and science, which it is a worldwide research project taking place every four years and providing data about trends in mathematics and science achievement over. In the USA at Boston College, this test is conducted under the supervision of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (International Association for The Evaluation of Educational Achievement )(IEA) Headquartered in Amsterdam / Netherlands, it is carried out every four years for the fourth and eighth grades of the participating countries. The first session was held in 1995 and consecutively until the seventh session in 2019. The Jordanian Ministry of Education is keen to keep pace with international trends in evaluating the educational process as possible. Jordan has participated in these tests since 1999 and until now (Mullis and others, 2008) . the mathematics frameworks in ( TIMSS-2019) have been updated and are appropriate for both digital and paper assessment formats. The goal is to capitalize on the benefits of computer-based assessment to begin incorporating new and better assessment methods, especially in the applying and reasoning domains (Mullis and others, 2016 ) .\nTimss-2019 test focuses on two dimensions for the 4th class maths evaluation, and they are: the content and the knowledge, and every dimension has group of domain, content dimension Determine the material to be evaluated at certain percentages, while knowledge dimension determine thinking processes to be evaluated also at certain percentages, we find that the content include three domain, numbers (50%), Measurement and Engineering (30%), and data (20%), While knowledge includes three main domains too: Knowledge (40%), application (40%), Reasoning/ inference (20%), and every domain has main titles linked to it, and every title has Substandard criteria (School Mathematics Assessment frame work, TIMSS-2019) If we take a closer look at Jordan's participation in this test from 1999 to 2015, the results were in the years in which Jordan participated (1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015) , respectively (428, 424, 427, 406) . In an analytical view of the previous results, it is noticeable that there was a significant decline in the last session in which it participated in (2015) compared to the previous results in which it participated. It is possible that the results achieved by the Jordanian students are a shock to the decision makers and those in charge of the educational system, which may be due to some individual educational policies, which have moved away from developing the essence of the educational process, and focused on the evaluation cycle in secondary education, deliberately forgetting the elements of the system. In terms of qualifying and training teachers and teaching methods, or empowering learners and developing curricula and textbooks, assessment stations at various stages, developing the educational environment and school administrations, developing the performance of educational supervisors, or focusing on the Jordan ranks 40th in the TIMSS Numeracy test, in which Jordan participated for the first time. 44 countries took part in this test. Singapore ranked first with a total score. (618), a difference higher than Jordan (230) points (Abu Libdeh, 2015) .\nThere are several studies that have examined TIMSS tests and related standards and their availability in mathematics and science textbooks for the fourth and eighth grades in some countries. The results of the Tabaza(2018) study The overall percentage of the content domain in the light of the( TIMSS-2015), standards for (4) grades, which it was as follows: numbers (80.24), geometric shapes and measurements (14.81), data display (4.75), the proportion of the cognitive dimension was as follows: knowledge (68.39), application (18.75), inference (12.85). The results of the Abu Kameel (2019) study showed that the overall percentage of the availability of TIMSS-2015 standards in the content of the Palestinian science curriculum for the eighth grade (30.5) is a small percentage.\nAlso the study of Lessani & others (2014) conducted in Singapore also indicated that Singapore has a strong and sophisticated mathematics curriculum for the eighth grade, which led to the rise of students' scores in the TIMSS test during the years (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) .\nThe results of Al-Hussan (2015) study concluded with a list of TIMSS requirements, which should be included in elementary science textbooks. Additionally, results revealed that the inclusion percentages of scientific inquiry were high in all grades, whereas the inclusion percentages of science content and cognitive domains were insufficient in science textbooks.\nThe results of Al-Grabli & Al-Abed (2015) study indicated that there is a positive effect of a training program for math teachers based on the International Study Trends in Mathematics and Science (TIMSS), on the ability of their students in mathematical knowledge, application and reasoning. And Dudeen & et al. (2012) study showed a positive relationship between the qualifications of mathematics teachers on the one hand and the achievement of students in the international test (TIMSS) on the other in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. The results of Almasa'afah (2005) study showed that there is a variation in the availability of basic concepts in mathematics textbooks from the fourth to eighth grade in Jordan, where the ratio of numbers and operations (49.7)% is the most represented in the mathematics books of other concepts.\nTeleni (2013) study showed that the content of the mathematics textbook for the fourth grade in Palestine is not compatible with the content and mental processes with the TIMSS test.\nFrom the previous studies, there is a variation in the degree of mathematics textbooks for the fourth grade to the TIMSS test criteria. The mathematics textbook for the fourth grade in Jordan was developed after 2005 more than once. So this study was conducted to find out the Extent of Inclusion (TIMSS-2019) Standards of mathematics book scheduled for the Fourth Grade Students in Jordan from Maths teachers' point of view for the Fourth Grade Students."}, {"section_title": "Study Problem and Questions", "text": "Most countries of the world seek to keep pace with global trends in evaluating the educational process through international assessments, where countries the world over publicly finance and manage the great majority of their schools, the institutions and policies established by various levels of government must create incentives for school personnel to use their resources in ways that maximize performance. Which (TIMSS) is a series of international assessments of the mathematics and science knowledge of students around the world. Due to Jordan's decline in ranking in the international rankings in the TIMSS test (2015) and its ranking (41) among other Arab countries compared to previous years, which draws to take into account for several reasons, which may include the verification of the book and the availability of TIMSS standards.
