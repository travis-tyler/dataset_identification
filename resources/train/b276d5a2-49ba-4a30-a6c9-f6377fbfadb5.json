In 2010, the first year of the recovery, metro and nonmetro employment levels grew at comparable rates. Since the start of 2011, however, net job growth in nonmetro areas has been near zero while employment in metro counties has grown at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. The stagnation in nonmetro job growth overlaps with the first recorded period of nonmetro population loss, between 2010 and 2012, which was driven by a decrease in net migration to rural areas. This lack of population growth, combined with a falling labor force participation rate, has permitted the nonmetro unemployment rate to fall slowly but steadily despite the lack of employment growth.\nStill, nonmetro employment growth is occurring in some areas, most notably in portions of the northern Great Plains where the discovery and extraction of energy resources has led to growth in both population and employment, as well as in portions of the Mountain West. However, the number of employed people was unchanged or declined in more than half of nonmetro counties.\nAverage weekly earnings for wage and salary workers were lower in 2012 than they were prior to the recession in 2007. However, in both nonmetro and metro areas, weekly earnings increased between 2007 and 2012 for the top quartile of earners, heightening inequality. More than 60 percent of high-inequality counties are also high-poverty counties, and these groups are concentrated in the South, Southwest, and Northern Great Plains."}, {"section_title": "Employment Growth Lags in Nonmetro Counties", "text": "The Great Recession had similar effects on rural and urban employment levels: both areas saw the number of employed people fall by just over 5 percent during 2008-09. Employment began to recover in 2010, with nonmetro and metro areas initially exhibiting similar trends, but job growth has since stalled in nonmetro counties. Seasonally adjusted employment increased by only 0.5 percent in nonmetro areas between the second quarters of 2011 and 2012, compared to 1.6 percent in metro areas. Over the next four quarters, nonmetro employment fell by 0.1 percent, while metro employment rose by 1.4 percent.

Nonmetro employment losses were especially large in Arkansas (down 4.1 percent) and in Illinois and Arizona (down 1.8 percent each). Nonmetro employment gains were more common in the Northern Plains, led by North Dakota (up 4.9 percent), and in the Southwest, led by Colorado (up 2.4 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Unemployment Rates Continue To Decline", "text": "Unemployment rates in rural and urban areas have followed very similar trends for the past 3 years, falling from a peak of 10 percent (in late 2009 and early 2010) to 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2013 for nonmetro areas, and 7.5 percent for metro counties. In nonmetro areas, the recent decline in unemployment rates is due to a reduction in the rate of labor force participation (the share of the adult population that is working or looking for work), rather than an increase in employment. In metro areas, unemployment rates have been driven lower by a combination of rising employment and falling labor force participation."}, {"section_title": "Nonmetro-Metro Earnings Disparities Are Largest For Higher Paid Workers", "text": "In 2012, median annualized weekly earnings for wage and salary workers who held full-time employment (or held a part-time job but desired full-time work) were $32,000 in nonmetro areasabout 20 percent lower than in metro areas ($38,500). This disparity was more pronounced at the upper end of the earnings distribution, with the 95th percentile earning 27 percent less in nonmetro areas ($91,000 versus $125,000 in metro areas). In contrast, the difference between nonmetro and metro earnings was only 9 percent for the bottom 5th percentile of earners ($10,400 versus $11,300).\nMedian weekly earnings fell by several percentage points between 2007 and 2012: -3.7 percent for nonmetro workers and -2.6 percent for metro. However, earnings fell by nearly 13 percent at the 5th percentile in nonmetro areas, while rising more than 4 percent at the 95th percentile.

The criteria for metro county status-a county that contains a designated urbanized area of 50,000 or more people or that has large commuting flows to or from an adjacent county with at least one such urbanized area-remains unchanged. Growth in the number and size of urbanized areas caused some nonmetro counties to be reclassified as metro, while a smaller number of metro counties fell below the population or commuting thresholds and were reclassified as nonmetro. As a result, the number of nonmetro counties fell from 2,052 to 1,976.\nThis reclassification has a large effect on the size of the nonmetro population and work- County-level Gini indexes measure the degree of concentration in a county's income distribution. Thus, the Gini index can be the same for two counties with very different levels of income. However, there is substantial correlation between high inequality (high Gini indexes) and high poverty rates for nonmetro counties.\nCounty Gini indexes for 2007-2011 ranged from 20.0 to 67.1 percent nationally, with the average nonmetro county Gini index (43.3 percent) very near the national average (43.5 percent). As with high poverty, counties in the South generally had more income inequality, while counties in the Midwest had less. High rates of inequality were prevalent among nonmetro counties with large concentrations of racial and ethnic minorities, counties located in Appalachia, and Western counties with high endowments of natural amenities.\nJust over 30 percent of both nonmetro and metro counties had high levels of income inequality in 2007-11 (Gini indexes of 45.7 to 67.1 percent). However, there was a stronger association between poverty and inequality in nonmetro counties: 61.3 percent of high-inequality nonmetro counties were also high-poverty counties, compared to just 24.9 percent of high-inequality metro counties, in part reflecting the higher average incomes found in metro counties.\nSignificant differences also existed based on county population size. The counties with the most equitable distribution of income (Gini index of 20.0 to 40.8 percent) tended to be the Nation's least populous nonmetro counties, while large metro counties had the highest inequality. Relative to high-inequality counties, the most equitable counties typically had higher rates of labor force participation by women and lower shares of single-parent families, as well as greater rates of homeownership and employment in manufacturing-factors associated with lower levels of poverty."}, {"section_title": "Nonmetro Areas Enter Period of Population Decline", "text": "Between April 2010 and July 2012, the estimated population of nonmetro counties as a whole fell by just under 44,000 people.

At the community level, such population loss typically reduces the demand for jobs, diminishes the quality of the workforce, and raises per capita costs of providing services. Opportunities for population growth and economic expansion vary widely from one nonmetro county to the next. Recession-related patterns of population change have emerged in recent years: while metro proximity, attractive scenery, and recreation potential have historically contributed to nonmetro population growth, the influence of these factors has weakened significantly."}, {"section_title": "New Population Patterns Emerge After Recession", "text": "Widespread job losses in rural manufacturing-caused by the recession, increased global competition, and technological changes-contributed to the nonmetro population downturn in 21 Spurred by an energy boom, large sections of the Northern Great Plains saw a turnaround from decades of population decline. Farming-dependent counties, concentrated in the Great Plains and Corn Belt, lost population as a whole despite energy-related job growth in many such counties. Farming-dependent counties have been particularly affected by an aging population, which contributes to slower population growth from natural change.\nThe housing mortgage crisis slowed suburban development and contributed to an historic shift within metro regions, with outlying metro counties now growing at a slower rate than central counties. Similarly, nonmetro counties adjacent to metro areas that had been growing rapidly from suburban development for decades declined in population for the first time as a group during 2010-12. This period may simply be an interruption in suburbanization or it could turn out to be the end of a major demographic regime.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, and, where applicable, sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion, sexual orientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or because all or a part of an individual's income is derived from any public assistance program. ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/documentation.aspx "}]
