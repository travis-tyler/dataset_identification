Individual locations designated as a Great Lakes Area of Concern had remedial action plans established that outlined impairments within each water body and the resulting loss of ecosystem services to humans, habitat, fish, and wildlife. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations began to articulate strategies and create site-specific action plans to address the environmental degradations identified in the remedial action plans. The St. Clair-Detroit River System (SCDRS), formerly referred to as the Huron-Erie Corridor, is the waterway corridor within the Great Lakes connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie ( fig. 1). The SCDRS is the major outflow for Lake Huron and the upper Great Lakes and the major source of water for Lake Erie. The SCRDS is comprised of distinct water bodies (north to south): the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River that flows into western Lake Erie ( fig. 1). Within the SCDRS, the following four areas are designated as Great Lakes Areas of Concern: (1) the St. Clair River, (2) the Detroit River, (3) the Clinton River, and (4) the Rouge River (the Clinton and Rouge Rivers are tributaries of the corridor) ( fig. 1). The SCDRS is also an international border between Michigan, United States,and Ontario,Canada (fig. 1). Land use in the region is highly urbanized and developed (for example, agriculture in rural areas) resulting in the loss and degradation of natural resources, altered landscape features, and reduced ecosystem services within the SCDRS (Hondorp and others, 2014).  In 2004, an international, interdisciplinary, collaborative research and management initiative (known as the Huron-Erie Corridor Initiative) was formed to develop strategies for implementing innovative research and management efforts in the SCDRS. In 2014, the name was formally changed to the St. Clair-Detroit River System Initiative (SCDRSI; https://scdrs.org/), and the initiative became focused on more than just restoring native fish spawning habitat (Manny and others, 2015). The current (2019) SCDRSI group has representatives from almost every operating tribal, management, and governmental agency within the corridor, as well as nongovernmental organizations, nonprofit organizations, and private consulting firms from the surrounding region. These organizations share a common vision with the goal of restoring the natural structure and function of habitats, populations, and biological communities in the SCDRS. Group membership continues to grow by recruiting new experts and organizations specializing in additional aspects of aquatic resources. The new aspects include water quality, herpetofauna, wildlife, wetlands, and fisheries, as well as a recognition of the significance of socioeconomics in the corridor. This truly holistic approach advocated by the SCDRSI emphasizes the need for a comprehensive contemporary assessment of the environmental conditions within the SCDRS to include identification of environmental threats to accommodate the numerous and, at times, conflicting agency and stakeholder needs. The current biological and environmental conditions need to be inventoried and assessed within the SCDRS to know where to focus conservation, restoration, and preservation efforts. The Nature Conservancy uses a viability analysis framework as an objective, foundational step for the conservation action planning process that details the existing conditions within the study area regarding the \"health\" of a population of plant or animal species, habitat attribute (for example, spawning or nursery areas), or other environmental characteristics (The Nature Conservancy, 2007;Foundations of Success, 2009). Accurate assessments of environmental conditions are essential for establishing conservation goals. Conservation targets (environmental aspects to conserve, such as a habitat type or species group) were selected and related key ecological attributes (KEA; measurable aspects of the target's biology or ecology that are known to be essential for survival) were identified to track the attributes' responses to management actions (The Nature Conservancy, 2007;Foundations of Success, 2009). Specific metrics (that is, indicators) were also chosen to assess the status for each of the KEA and track environmental improvements with time. The objective of this study was to present a comprehensive, contemporary viability analysis for the SCDRS to assist ongoing conservation, preservation, restoration, and remediation efforts. A contemporary inventory of the status of all conservation targets, incorporating data and information from relevant assessments and habitat plans for the region, will help identify gaps in basic knowledge throughout the corridor and provide guidance to ongoing and future conservation and management plans. The results will be used to guide and inform future research, monitoring strategies, and management and conservation planning, particularly informing SCDRSI efforts, throughout the corridor. This information will be accessible for all planners, researchers, and managers for future conservation planning in the SCDRS."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To provide a rapid contemporary assessment, the authors of this report built upon other work done within the SCDRS regarding target areas and species, data compilation, and implementation strategies. One key conservation plan completed in 2012, which included the SCDRS, was the Lake Erie Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (LEBCS) (Pearsall and others, 2012). The LEBCS was a large-scale plan developed through the conservation action planning process that delineated conservation targets, KEA, and indicators to align with other Lake Erie plans, specifically the Lake Erie Lakewide Action and Management Plan (Lake Erie Lakewide Action and Management Plan, 2008). By selecting attributes and metrics previously incorporated in the Lake Erie Lakewide Action and Management Plan, the opportunity existed for recommendations and conservation actions in the LEBCS to be implemented on a lakewide scale, with multiple agencies and organizations working together. Similarly, by having this study incorporate many aspects of the LEBCS, the results may further inform and refine planning efforts through the LEBCS and the Lake Erie Lakewide Action and Management Plan. For the selection of indicators for the viability analysis, other local conservation plans and strategies reviewed and considered included the Essex Region Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (Essex Region Conservation Authority, 2002); the Fish-Community Goal and Objectives for Lake St. Clair, St. Clair River, and Detroit River (MacLennan and others, 2003); and the Lake St. Clair Coastal Habitat Assessment (Great Lakes Commission, 2006). The St. Marys River (not shown) is another Great Lakes Area of Concern and connecting channel (between Lake Superior and Lake Huron) where a conservation action plan was completed (St. Marys River Conservation Action Plan) (Harris and others, 2009). Additional appropriate targets, KEA, and indicator metrics from the St. Marys River Conservation Action Plan were incorporated into the SCDRS viability analysis. Modifications to this initial compilation of targets, KEA, and indicator metrics were made based on solicited input from members of the SCDRSI."}, {"section_title": "Segments of the St. Clair-Detroit River System", "text": "For this study, the geographical scope includes the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair,and Detroit River (fig. 1); these waters were divided into smaller-scale areas for finer resolution. The LEBCS only divided the SCDRS into three geographic sections-St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair (including the St. Clair River Delta region), and Detroit River. Although the three geographic sections may be an appropriate spatial scale for the conservation strategy addressing the Lake Erie Basin (not shown), the scale is not ideal for localized action within the corridor. Therefore, the corridor was divided into finer-scale geographic segments that were generally uniform with respect to landscape features and influences (that is, hydrology, geomorphology, engineering, and ecology [Wang and others, 2006]) to the system. The geographic scope encompassed the head of the St. Clair River downstream to the mouth of Detroit River, ending just north of the confluence of the Huron River and western Lake Erie ( fig. 1). Multiple other conservation plans have been developed or are in development for the western basin of Lake Erie; therefore, to avoid duplicating efforts, the viability analysis for this study did not include western Lake Erie. For this analysis, seven unique segments were identified within the SCDRS-St. Clair River (upper, middle, and lower reaches), Lake St. Clair (east and west basins), and Detroit River (upper and lower reaches) ( fig. 1). No dams or navigational locks exist within the SCDRS to manipulate flow; however, the corridor is maintained as a navigational channel by a series of dikes and dredged channels, with multiple maintained navigation channels in parts of the Detroit River that alter the flow of water through the corridor (Bennion and Manny, 2011). The upper St. Clair River segment begins where southern Lake Huron narrows to form the St. Clair River (north of Port Huron, Michigan/Sarnia, Ontario) and ends at the confluence of the first tributary, the Black River, Mich. ( fig. 1). Although the upper St. Clair River segment is small (approximately 4 river kilometers [km]), the area is substantially different from the remainder of the St. Clair River to justify separation. The upper St. Clair River has the fastest water velocity of the three St. Clair River reaches, and the river characteristics (depth, flow, and river bends) are more variable compared with the more uniform middle St. Clair River reach (Liu and others, 2010). Almost the entire upper St. Clair River section is considered significant fish spawning grounds (Goodyear and others, 1982) and has the largest spawning population of the threatened lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in Michigan . The middle St. Clair River segment begins at the Black River, Mich., and ends at the Chenal Ecarte, Ontario (the first distributary of the St. Clair River) ( fig. 1). The segment is uniform throughout, interrupted by two islands (Stag and Fawn Islands) and shoals near St. Clair, Mich. (Edsall and others, 1988). The lower St. Clair River segment begins with the Chenal Ecarte, Ontario, and ends at the mouth of the various channels where the distributaries flow into Lake St. Clair. The lower St. Clair River segment comprises the largest freshwater delta in the world (Bolsenga and Herdendorf, 1993). Fish spawning and nursery areas throughout the delta and wetlands are of conservation and restoration priority (Great Lakes Commission, 2006). Lake St. Clair is the only lake considered in this viability analysis and is divided into two segments based on the two distinct lake basins-west (United States side) and east (Canadian side). These basins are distinct with respect to the land use, tributary input, and water current circulation patterns (Bolsenga and Herdendorf, 1993;Hondorp and others, 2014) and, therefore, were assessed separately. These segments begin at the end of the delta and extend to the outlet of Lake St. Clair prior to Peche Island in the Detroit River ( fig. 1). The St. Clair River contributes 98 percent of the water to Lake St. Clair and the Clinton River (Great Lakes Areas of Concern), Sydenham River, and Thames River contribute the remaining 2 percent (Edsall and others, 1988)  Approximately 95 percent of the water entering the Detroit River originates from Lake Huron through the St. Clair River-Lake St. Clair system. The upper Detroit River segment begins at Peche Island and continues downstream past the Rouge River outlet, but prior to Turkey Creek, Ontario, just north of Fighting Island (fig. 1). The upper Detroit River is primarily a navigational channel with small areas of nondredged river bottom, including areas around the two islands in this segment, Belle Isle and Peche Island ( fig. 1). The lower Detroit River has gently sloping banks, variable river width (approximately 6 km at mouth), and many islands; the largest being Grosse Ile ( fig. 1). Multiple navigational channels are maintained by dredging around the various islands and through reef areas within the lower Detroit River."}, {"section_title": "Conservation Targets in the St. Clair-Detroit River System", "text": "The goal of this effort was to provide a more detailed finer-scale resolution assessment of the conditions in the SCDRS and complement the similar ongoing conservation planning efforts in the Lake Erie Basin. Therefore, initial conservation targets and KEA were based on relevant biodiversity targets identified in the LEBCS and St. Marys River Conservation Action Plan. This initial list of potential targets was distributed to SCDRSI partners for input and feedback. Additional targets and KEA identified by SCDRSI partners or SCDRS-specific reports or habitat plans were included in the viability analysis as appropriate. Full descriptions of the targets, KEA, and indicators are in appendix 1. The seven conservation targets assessed for each applicable segment were main channels, Lake St. Clair, native migratory fishes, islands, coastal wetlands, coastal terrestrial systems, and aerial migrants. The main channels target encompassed the lotic habitats within the waters of the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, which are inhabited by many riverine species and provide habitat used for spawning and migration routes for many large, native migratory fishes in the central Great Lakes (including species assessed in the native migratory fishes target), with larvae drifting downstream to available wetland nursery habitat in Lake St. Clair or Lake Erie (Goodyear and others, 1982). Lake St. Clair is the only large area of lentic habitat in the SCDRS and contains a valuable fishery for multiple warm-water species, such as yellow perch (Perca flavescens), walleye (Sander vitreus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) . The native migratory fishes target assesses the population levels of fishes that migrate into the SCDRS or its tributaries to complete their life cycle (typically spawning), as well as the habitat required by the various species. The islands target assesses the condition of the islands in the system, natural and artificial. Coastal wetlands for this assessment are defined as areas that are permanently or periodically inundated with water and having vegetation requiring saturated soils that are hydrologically connected to the Great Lakes. Coastal wetlands provide habitat for a diverse group of species (plants and animals) as well as ecosystem services to humans through improving water quality, flood control, and shoreline protection. Coastal wetlands also provide habitat for multiple fish and bird species and provide areas suitable for bird watching, hunting, and fishing. Coastal terrestrial systems considered the terrestrial environments 0-10 km inland from shore. This distance was chosen in recognition of the influence land use/land cover practices have on the aquatic environment, as well as to align with criteria applied in the LEBCS. Aerial migrants include all types of birds (shorebirds, landbirds, and waterfowl) and other species (insects and butterflies) that use the SCDRS as a pathway during spring and fall migration. The birds use the open water, the islands and wetlands, and the terrestrial areas along the corridor that may be developed. To determine viability of the targets, KEA and associated indicators were selected from relevant previous plans, input from SCDRSI partners, experts, and literature review. The same KEA and indicators were used to assess multiple conservation targets where appropriate. Useful indicator metrics are measurable, precise, consistent, and sensitive (The Nature Conservancy, 2007). Each indicator (for each applicable segment) was assigned a status value associated with the current condition of the specified indicator when possible. Quantitative values assigned were based on recent (less than 10 years old) assessments gained through direct data collection, literature review, and expert contributions of recent monitoring program results. The status ratings (that is, \"health\" of the indicators) were classified as very good, good, fair, or poor condition (table 1; ranges for specific indicators in appendix 1) and were based on values from previous conservation plans, expert opinion, and literature review. Overall target condition was determined by the point system described in table 1 (from Pearsall and others, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "All segments were determined to be in overall fair condition, except the lower St. Clair River, which was in overall good condition (table 2).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Developing a viability analysis for the SCDRS resulted in a straightforward, visual snapshot of the current conditions within the corridor, based on the targets and indicators identified. This viability analysis is a critical first step toward systematic conservation planning based on current and up-todate information (Nel and others, 2009). This viability analysis also underscores where information gaps exist (for example, coastal wetlands and Lake St. Clair) and which indicators need condition status ranges developed (for example, native migratory fishes and Lake St. Clair). Indicators that assessed human impacts through urbanization, contrasted to indicators that strictly assessed in-water biota, were frequently classified in poor condition. However, many indicator measurements assessing biota could not be collected, or status rating thresholds for these indicators had not been developed. If all indicators are fully assessed, the overall target condition could possibly be different; however, even with the current limited assessment, many indicators were identified in poor condition and in need of restoration and remediation efforts. Compared to the indicators that required field studies, which limited data availability and assessments, most indicators dependent upon geographic information system data were assessed and assigned a status. Data gaps could be due to several reasons; for example, (1) the information has not been collected recently (less than 10 years); (2) a source of the information could not be determined; (3) the data were not in the correct form, or (4) the targeted metrics were not being collected. To minimize possibilities for the first two scenarios, the authors of this report thoroughly searched for literature, searched the internet, and communicated personally with experts to identify sources of contemporary information and data. The authors acknowledge, however, that the methods used may have missed some viable sources. To minimize the third data gap, the indicator was adjusted, when possible, to conform to data already collected, particularly if the data were derived from reoccurring standardized survey (for example, annual fish community surveys led by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry). The remaining data gaps serve to identify deficiencies in assessment data, or data access, and can help guide management efforts to close some information gaps. In addition, results may not accurately reflect the true conditions because of the limitations of the analysis. For example, most segments of the SCDRS ranked as very good for waterfowl distance to disturbance indicator. However, waterfowl suitable area included all the open water and nearshore area as habitat, but did not include the navigational shipping channels or other heavily used on-water areas as disturbance factors (for example, smaller marked navigational lanes). Therefore, results likely overestimate the area that is undisturbed because of recreational and commercial boat traffic, especially in the lower St. Clair River and Detroit River segments. The Nature Conservancy classified Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River as Important Bird Areas (Henson and others, 2010), indicating that the areas are globally significant for waterfowl and other congregatory species. Future updates to this viability analysis should incorporate the various shipping and navigational lanes to adjust the disturbance potential through these Important Bird Areas. The authors of this report were able to develop KEA quickly and efficiently as a result of previous planning efforts (for example, Essex Region Conservation Authority [2002], MacLennan and others [2003], Great Lakes Commission [2006], and Pearsall and others, [2012]) and had the explicit goals of dovetailing and integrating efforts with these other plans. The authors were able to fully assess a higher proportion of indicators (using only quantitative measures) than the LEBCS; however, the indicators evaluated were not identical, so the two studies are not 1:1 in scale and specific content. Depending on the size of a study area and the breadth of targets selected, the effort put into selecting conservation targets, KEA, and indicators could be extensive. These previous plans were thorough and developed in close collaboration with professionals in the region, so duplicating these efforts was not warranted. However, verifying that the indicators listed in these plans coordinated with the needs and capabilities of this project was extremely important as adjustments were required for many indicators. In addition to gathering missing indicator values within the segments, additional considerations derived from this viability analysis can be considered in future conservation plans and strategies. The first consideration is the development of condition status ranges and, ultimately, the desired condition for each indicator. The indicator statuses determined for this study could be considered a baseline, but determining the desired status for all indicators may be difficult given the highly urbanized landscape and irreversibly degraded state for some indicators (for example, housing and road densities). Additionally, the predicted ecosystem changes associated with climate change may not permit significant ecological shifts back to historical conditions, but instead change the ecosystem in ways currently unknown or unpredictable (Burkett and others, 2005;Mackey and others, 2006;Mackey, 2012). The goal for many indicators may be to not further degrade with time, or only move up one indicator rating (for example, from poor to fair) because of the tradeoff among improving indicator status, providing recreational and economic opportunities, and the cost of improving indicators. For example, as people are moved away from the shoreline, indicators improve (such as average distance to disturbance), but citizens' connections with the resources and recreational and economic potential become more limited. Balancing the needs of the SCDRS ecosystem with the desires of the people will include tradeoffs, and a higher-order conservation plan could bring together the various strategies employed by regional conservation planning efforts and focus on priorities that incorporate the high-ranking threats to this system described in Pearsall and others (2012). Second, even though tributaries to the SCDRS were not part of this viability analysis (except for tributary accessibility), restoration strategies may need to explicitly consider tributaries and their watersheds because this longitudinal connectivity can influence study area conditions, including KEA and study area metrics. Improvements to the watershed tributaries of the SCDRS will not only improve ecosystem conditions in that direct vicinity (for example, two Great Lakes Areas of Concern-the Clinton and Rouge Rivers), but also in the terminal portion of the SCDRS, western Lake Erie. Benefits will be seen throughout the system, especially for those species that use multiple habitats to complete their life cycle. The migratory fishes that live in Lake Erie, but migrate to the SCDRS to spawn (for example, walleye and lake whitefish), will experience improved spawning and nursery conditions. These conditions could lead to increased adult fish abundances not only in the SCDRS, but also in Lake Erie. Using the viability analysis as a framework was an efficient and effective tool to rapidly assess the current conditions of the SCDRS for the seven target areas. Small restoration efforts that are not coordinated with other habitat management efforts in an area are not ideal (Hackney, 2000). The viability analysis framework was determined useful to gain a comprehensive assessment of system conditions, aquatic or terrestrial. Importance of quantitatively assessing conditions within the SCDRS to address conservation needs and adapt to climate change has been identified as necessary to moving forward and developing restoration and management strategies (Mackey and others, 2006;Pearsall and others, 2012). This viability analysis has improved on previous assessments and provides a clear picture of where information is still lacking and what targets or segments are in need of restoration efforts. Previous work determined that only sites furthest upstream in the Detroit River, near Peche Island, have indicated signs of fish community recovery despite restoration activities throughout the river (Granados and others, 2014); results from this study also indicate that the Detroit River remains in poor condition with regard to many indicators and continues to require remediation and restoration activities. This framework also facilitated interpretation of results for interdisciplinary collaboration (that is, SCDRSI), as well as for other stakeholders. The increase in understanding of current environmental conditions could serve to increase collaboration among partners on specific projects, as well as help communicate results to the public and increase public awareness and support for local projects. Using identical metrics to measure and track environmental trends across SCDRSI partners is a critical step for a multiagency, multistakeholder collaboration to have a collective impact towards shared goals and objectives (Kania and Kramer, 2011). Finally, managers and conservation practitioners face many challenges that impede successful ecosystem restoration, especially in urban areas such as the SCDRS. The authors of this report have identified some key challenges from this project, as well as the following steps managers can consider to move forward and improve on the viability analysis framework and on the results. 1. Identify data gaps in the current assessment that can be addressed and completed. 2. Identify common, specific indicator goals that can be established among SCDRSI partners. 3. Develop conservation strategies with pragmatic priorities, actions, and desired outcomes. 4. The viability analysis should be periodically updated to track progress and adapt strategies where needed. 5. Identify sociological and economical aspects and indicators that can be incorporated into the viability analysis as well as in the management of the SCDRS as a whole (Naiman, 2013). Identifying and prioritizing areas or conservation targets of the SCDRS for improvement can help the SCDRSI partners to work more harmoniously and may improve the ability to take advantage of available funding opportunities to improve environmental conditions within the corridor. Because of the systematic process and framework used, these challenges can be addressed through continued effective cooperation, interjurisdictional collaboration, and commitment of all the SCDRSI partners."}, {"section_title": "Target-Main Channels Key Ecological Attribute-Channel Condition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Artificial Shoreline Hardening Index", "text": "Description.-This indicator reflects the percent of shoreline protected with artificial structures (for example, seawalls and rip rap) to prevent erosion. Shoreline hardening disrupts natural nearshore coastal processes that drive erosion and sediment transport and, therefore, the nature and extent of nearshore zone habitats and community structure of Great Lakes shorelines (Meadows and others, 2005;others, 2011, 2012). In the St. Clair-Detroit River System (SCDRS), hardened shorelines have destroyed wetlands and wildlife habitat and alter the flow regime of these rivers by preventing high waters from flooding inland and, instead, redirecting energy downstream. Despite knowledge that the impacts of shoreline hardening have been profound, the impacts of shoreline hardening have been understudied in the Great Lakes (Mackey and Liebenthall, 2005) and have received little attention in efforts to protect or restore coastal systems. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds used for shoreline hardening were the same as those used for the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) and Lake Ontario Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (LOBCS) (Lake Ontario Biodiversity Strategy Working Group, 2009), which were loosely based upon a shoreline hardening State of the Lakes Ecosystem Conference (SOLEC) indicator (Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). This approach will provide consistency and comparability among plans. Approach.-Geographic information system (GIS) analyses were completed in ArcMap to calculate the shoreline hardening index for each assessment unit using the shoreline hardening vector data. These data are available in the Great Lakes geospatial database (https://www.glahf.org/data/). A shoreline was considered to be hardened if lined with retaining walls or if more than 15 percent of the shoreline (per 100 meters [m] of shoreline) was hardened. Only the shorelines along the main channels and Lake St. Clair were included for those targets. The total length of shoreline classified as hardened was then calculated for each assessment unit. \nDescription.-This indicator reflects the percent of shoreline protected with artificial structures (for example, seawalls and rip rap) to prevent erosion. Shoreline hardening disrupts natural nearshore coastal processes that drive erosion and sediment transport and, therefore, the nature and extent of nearshore zone habitats and community structure of Great Lakes shorelines (Meadows and others, 2005;others, 2011, 2012). In the SCDRS, hardened shorelines have destroyed wetlands and wildlife habitat and alter the flow regime of these rivers by preventing high waters from flooding inland and, instead, redirecting energy downstream. Despite knowledge that the impacts of shoreline hardening have been profound, the impacts of shoreline hardening have been understudied in the Great Lakes (Mackey and Liebenthall, 2005) and have received little attention in efforts to protect or restore coastal systems. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds used for shoreline hardening were the same as those used for the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) and Lake Ontario Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (LOBCS) (Lake Ontario Biodiversity Strategy Working Group, 2009), which were loosely based upon a shoreline hardening State of the Lakes Ecosystem Conference (SOLEC) indicator (Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). This approach will provide consistency and comparability among plans. Approach.-GIS analyses were completed in ArcMap to calculate the shoreline hardening index for each assessment unit using the shoreline hardening vector data. These data are available in the Great Lakes geospatial database (https://www.glahf.org/data/). A shoreline was considered to be hardened if lined with retaining walls or if more than 15 percent of the shoreline (per 100 m of shoreline) was hardened. Only the shorelines along the main channels and Lake St. Clair were included for those targets. The total length of shoreline classified as hardened was then calculated for each assessment unit.

The Chenal Ecarte, and its distributaries, are the source of river flow for much of the eastern portion of the St. Clair Delta, including Walpole and St. Anne Islands, in Ontario, Canada. Adequate flow through the Chenal Ecarte is needed to maintain the current biodiversity and hydrology of the eastern half of the St. Clair Delta. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Qualitative status rating thresholds were taken from Harris and others (2009).

Other species including lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), walleye (Sander vitreus), and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) are known to spawn in the SCDRS (Thomas and Haas, 2002;Manny and others, 2010;Prichard and others, 2017;Fischer and others, 2018). As such, tracking the richness of spawning species can be an effective indicator of the recovery of these connecting channels.

Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Qualitative status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) and further investigation is necessary to define quantitative measures for this indicator. Approach.-Larval fish have been sampled throughout the SCDRS by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Science Center since 2006. The fish species richness accounted for all larval samples taken in the SCDRS in 2013. Because of the difficulty in species identification during the larval stage, the fish species richness is in terms of taxon richness, which in some instances is a species (for example, lake whitefish) and in other instances is only at the family level (for example, Cyprinidae). This would cause the data to underestimate the actual number of species in the segments. Data were from Tucker and others (2018).

Approach.-Data were used from the 2012 MDNR spring trap net survey  to characterize the status of smallmouth bass in western Lake St. Clair, and 2012 data were used from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (2014) trap net survey to characterize the status of smallmouth bass in eastern Lake St. Clair. Data from 2012 were used to maintain comparability between the west and east portions of Lake St. Clair.  (Thomas and Towns, 2011). As a top predator in the lake, walleye are important in maintaining the fish community structure of Lake St. Clair. Walleye from Lake St. Clair are also exploited by commercial fisheries in southern Lake Huron (MacLennan and others, 2003). Walleye caught and tagged in Lake St. Clair are known to have wide-ranging movements (Thomas and Hass, 2012), indicating some of the walleye in Lake St. Clair may be part of a larger metapopulation of walleye in the region. Population estimates are not available for walleye in the corridor; however, standard annual fisheries assessments, led by MDNR and OMNRF, could be used to track the relative abundance of adult fish species.\n\n\n\nBasis for Assessing Indicator.-Further investigation is necessary to define quantitative status rating thresholds for this indicator. Approach.-The percent of days that beaches were open during the swimming season (Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) was used to rate the E. coli metric across the connecting channels. Only beaches that were monitored during 2013 were used, except for Belle Isle Beach, which was sampled during 2012 and not 2013. Data were downloaded from the MDEQ website at: http://www.deq.state.mi.us/beach/Default.aspx. Beaches used in this indictor in each assessment unit included Belle Isle beach for the upper Detroit River; Pier Park beach, Lake St. Clair Metropark beach, New Baltimore Park beach, and St. Clair Shores Memorial Park beach for west Lake St. Clair; and Chrysler Park beach, Marine City beach, and Marine City diving area for the middle St. Clair River. Beaches that were closed because of reasons other than bacteria were not included in this calculation. Description.-Freshwater mussels are of significant interest in North America given the high diversity of this taxa in North America and the high level imperilment of this group (Master, 1990), as well as the ecological functions freshwater mussels provide (Vaughn and others, 2008). Among these ecological functions is the ability of freshwater mussels to filter large volumes of water, which helps to temper algal populations in productive areas and helps to reduce turbidity. Historically, much more abundant and rich in diversity, the native mussels in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair have declined substantially through the decades, most likely due to the Dreissenid mussel invasions (zebra and quagga mussels; Gillis and Mackie, 1994;Nalepa and others, 1996;Schloesser and others, 1996). However, studies have indicated coastal areas can provide native mussels refuge from Dreissenids (McGoldrick and others, 2009;Crail and others, 2011;Bryan and others, 2013). This indicator describes of the number of species collected at each site through freshwater mussel (Unionidae) surveys in the nearshore habitats of the SCDRS.\nBasis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds are from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), based on recent surveys led by D.T. Zanatta (Central Michigan University) and on expert opinion. Approach Description.-Hexagenia, a dominant benthic organism in the nearshore zone of lakes, are important indicators of nearshore health in more productive areas of the Great Lakes that are dominated by soft substrates (Edsall and others, 2005). In addition, Hexagenia can be a very important food source for many benthic feeding fishes, including lake sturgeon (Choudhury and others, 1996;Beamish and others, 1998), yellow perch (Price, 1963;Clady and Hutchinson, 1976), and walleye (Ritchie and Colby, 1988). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds for Hexagenia density (number of individuals per m 2 ) in the Lake St. Clair and main channels targets were from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), based on Edsall and others (2005) and Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2009). Mean Densities of Rotifers, Copepods, and Cladocerans in Early Summer Description.-Zooplankton are a critical food source to larval fish during the late-spring to early-summer when larval fish are transitioning from endogenous to exogenous feeding, also known as the \"critical period\" (Hjort, 1914). Without adequate zooplankton abundance (of the appropriate sizes) during this critical period, larval fish recruitment and, therefore, adult recruitment into a fishery, is limited (Cushing, 1990). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds for zooplankton density (number per liter [L]) were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012). Description.-Because many different species of fish migrate into tributaries in the Great Lakes (Trautman, 1981;Goodyear and others, 1982), connectivity to a variety of habitats is necessary to maintain populations of all of these species. Stream size is a major habitat component and is correlated with many important physical and chemical habitat variables. Headwater streams are the smallest streams, many of which may be ephemeral. Some headwater streams are far upstream within the watersheds of major rivers, while others flow directly into the SCDRS. Streams with a stream order of 1 were considered headwater streams (Strahler, 1957). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Quantitative status rating thresholds were from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), based on the proportion of headwater streams currently connected to the SCDRS. Approach.-GIS analyses were completed to determine the proportion of headwater streams within each assessment unit that are connected to the SCDRS (that is, those units not isolated because of dams). The U.S. moderate resolution stream layer (http://www.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlus/NHDPlusV1_04.php) and stream orders (http://www.horizon-systems.com/ nhdplus/StrahlerList.php) were downloaded from the online National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) database. Dam locations and the Ontario stream layer were from the Great Lakes geospatial database (https://www.glahf.org/data/). Watersheds within each assessment unit were split at the location of each of the first dams in each tributary. Percent of streams accessible were then calculated for each assessment unit.

"}, {"section_title": "Wetland Area", "text": "Description.-This indicator represents the total area of wetlands in each assessment unit. Wetlands provide multiple critical ecosystem functions and habitat for numerous plant and wildlife species, and the total area of wetlands is a valuable and direct indicator of coastal wetland viability for a particular area.

Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Data were solicited from the Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands Consortium (available at https://www.glc.org/library/2008-great-lakes-coastal-wetland-monitoring-plan) to calculate the current total wetland area in each assessment unit. In some segments, such as in the Detroit River , published assessments enabled quantitative status rating thresholds to be established. However, for most of the assessment units, quantitative status rating thresholds need to be determined for the individual assessment units. The status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012). Approach.-ArcGIS was used to calculate the total area of coastal wetlands throughout the connecting channels using the Lake Erie Basin Coastal Wetland shapefile (Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands Consortium, 2004). The file was added to by including wetlands around Belle Isle and Peche Island according to . The total area of coastal wetlands was then calculated for each assessment unit.

Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds for this indicator were based on the International Upper Great Lakes Study analysis of restoration options for increasing Lake Michigan-Huron water levels (International Upper Great Lakes Study, 2011) and were used in Pearsall and others (2012). Approach.-Water level data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (available at https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/wlevels/#observations) and then graphed to evaluate water levels in the past 5 years. The 5 years that were used to calculate the mean water levels from March through October were 2009-13. The NOAA stations used are as follows: \nDescription.-The two Dreissena species that have invaded the Great Lakes, zebra and quagga mussels, have caused significant changes in the Great Lakes ecosystem. In the nearshore zone (less than 15 m), these changes have included changes in nearshore nutrient dynamics (Hecky and others, 2004), large outbreaks of nuisance Cladophora (Auer and others, 2010), degradation of spawning reefs (Marsden and Chotkowski, 2001), and eradication of native freshwater mussels from many Great Lakes habitats (Schloesser and others, 1996). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Quantitative status rating thresholds need to be determined for Dreissena densities in Lake St. Clair and the main channels. Approach.-Dreissenid densities were drawn from McGoldrick and others (2009) for Lake St. Clair, but densities are still needed for the main channels. Native Mussel Abundance Description.-Freshwater mussels are of significant interest in North America given the high diversity of this taxa in North America and the high level imperilment of this group (Master, 1990), as well as the ecological functions freshwater mussels provide (Vaughn and others, 2008). Among these ecological functions is the ability of freshwater mussels to filter large volumes of water, which helps to temper algal populations in productive areas and helps to reduce turbidity. Historically, much more abundant and rich in diversity, the native mussels in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair have declined substantially through the decades, most likely due to the Dreissenid mussel invasion (Gillis and Mackie, 1994;Nalepa and others, 1996;Schloesser and others, 1996). However, studies have indicated coastal areas can provide native mussels refuge from Dreissenids (McGoldrick and others, 2009;Crail and others, 2011;Bryan and others, 2013). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Quantitative status rating thresholds need to be determined for native mussel abundance in the SCDRS. Approach. Description.-Lake sturgeon have been steadily increasing across the Great Lakes, with only a few populations considered large , and lake sturgeon numbers provide a useful and recognizable sign of water-quality and habitat improvements. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Based on the adult lake sturgeon research in the SCDRS (for example, Thomas and Haas, 2002; Boase and others, 2011) and expert input, status rating thresholds were developed for this indicator in the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) and were used in this study. Approach.-Total adult population estimates have been done from mark-recapture studies within the SCDRS. Estimates were provided by J. Chiotti  Description.-The survival or presence of many intolerant fish species depends on response to differing levels of eutrophication, which results in stressful conditions such as low oxygen and turbidity. Tracking the richness of intolerant species can provide an indication of ecosystem condition with regards to stress on the fish community from low oxygen or high turbidity conditions. A running average of the richness of intolerant species would recognize variability from interannual fluctuations. Native intolerant species include emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides), lake sturgeon, rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), sand shiners (Notropis stramineus), shorthead redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum), silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus). Intolerant species were taken from Ludsin and others (2001) and references therein. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-The following status rating thresholds were suggested for the western basin of Lake Erie based on a review of Ludsin and others (2001) and should be applicable to Lake St. Clair. Approach.-The regularly collected trawl data from MDNR can be analyzed for species richness, and trends can be analyzed to assess levels of eutrophication. The fall bottom-trawl data from  were used to calculate the 3-year running average of native intolerant fish species richness in western Lake St. Clair until the year 2012. Mean Dreissena Density Description.-The two Dreissena species that have invaded the Great Lakes, zebra and quagga mussels, have caused significant changes in the Great Lakes ecosystem. In the nearshore zone (less than 15 m), these changes have included changes in nearshore nutrient dynamics (Hecky and others, 2004), large outbreaks of nuisance Cladophora (Auer and others, 2010), degradation of spawning reefs (Marsden and Chotkowski, 2001), and eradication of native freshwater mussels from many Great Lakes habitats (Schloesser and others, 1996). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Quantitative status rating thresholds need to be determined for Dreissena densities in Lake St. Clair and the main channels. Approach.-Dreissenid densities were drawn from McGoldrick and others (2009) for Lake St. Clair, but densities are still needed for the main channels.  . Population estimates are not available for smallmouth bass in the corridor; however, standard annual fisheries assessments, led by MDNR and OMNRF, could be used to track the relative abundance of adult fish species.\n\n\n\n\nDescription.-The literature indicates that alteration of natural land cover within a given area has an impact on natural community condition, ecological processes, and plant and animal population viability (Newmark, 1995;Forman, 1997). By measuring the percent natural land cover of the coastal terrestrial systems, the coastal habitat fragmentation is being measured directly, and the condition of coastal natural communities and the integrity of coastal natural processes are indirectly being measured. The effect of conversion of natural land cover within the coastal terrestrial system of the Great Lakes has similar impacts on Lake St. Clair and coastal wetlands as land use conversion across the watershed, including degraded water quality and impaired biotic communities (Uzarski and others, 2005;Webb, 2008). Conversion of natural land cover also affects aerial migrants (Ewert and Hamas, 1995). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-The same indicator rankings were used in this assessment that were used in the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) and LOBCS (Lake Ontario Biodiversity Strategy Working Group, 2009). Ideally, these ratings would be based on developed relationships between percent natural land cover and biotic community metrics (for example, index of biotic integrity [IBI]); however, further research to develop such relationships is needed. Approach.-GIS analyses were completed in ArcMap to calculate natural land cover for the contributing areas of each assessment unit. A NOAA C-CAP regional land cover (2010) raster of Michigan with 30-m resolution was used for the U.S. portion. The raster was extracted using a 2-km buffer around the main channels and Lake St. Clair. Unlike the calculation of natural land cover within watersheds, the 2-km buffer was not limited to being within watersheds. The authors of this report agreed that movement of terrestrial or avian organisms would not be limited by watersheds. Represented natural land cover types included forests, wetlands, grasslands, and shrublands. The new raster was converted to a polygon shapefile to merge with the Ontario vegetation polygon. The Ontario vegetation polygon included dominant vegetation classes (excluding cropland) and was produced by Natural Resources Canada (https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/topographic-information). The merged Ontario and U.S. based shapefiles were intersected with a shapefile outlining the 2-km buffer of the SCDRS to calculate the percent natural land cover for each assessment unit. \n\nBasis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds for Cladophora density (grams dry weight per square meter [gDW/m 2 ]) were taken from the LEBCS, based on relationships determined, in part, by Auer and others (2010) (Pearsall and others, 2012). Contaminants Mercury (Walleye) Description.-This indicator has been tracked in the Great Lakes for more than 35 years by Federal, Tribal, and State agencies, primarily in recognition of the human health implications of eating fish with high concentrations of mercury (Monson and others, 2011). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-The safe level target mercury concentration established for human health reasons is 0.52 \u03bcg/g WW, (allowing for consumption of walleye by nonsensitive groups), although mercury levels in walleye are rising in the Great Lakes Region (Monson and others, 2011). Status rating thresholds were based on the Michigan Department of Community Health standards for fish mercury concentrations (http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/MDCH_MFCAP_ Guidance_Document_417043_7.pdf)-\"fair\" recommends 1 meal/month, \"good\" recommends 2 meals/month, \"very good\" recommends 4 meals/month or more. Contaminants Polychlorinated Biphenyls (Walleye) Description.-As with the contaminants mercury (walleye) indicator, this indicator has been established primarily for human health concerns. The PCBs indicator can serve well as an indicator of water quality, along with measures of other contaminants. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-As described in De Vault and others (1996) and Carlson and Swackhamer (2006), PCBs in fish have been declining since the 1970s but are still above the target of 0.1 \u03bcg/g WW established by the GLWQA. Most status ratings thresholds are listed as TBD, therefore, further investigation is necessary to define quantitative measures for this indicator. Description.-This indicator would measure how far algal blooms (with specific attention to harmful algal blooms) extend across Lake St. Clair. Recently (especially since 2011), Lake Erie has incurred blooms extending through much of its western basin. This indicator would determine the aerial extent of algal blooms, such as measured by NOAA satellite tracking, in Lake St. Clair. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-The following qualitative status rating thresholds were determined in consultation with Maryanne Evans, USGS (oral commun., 2014). Description.-Beach closures because of E. coli concentrations exceeding safe swimming levels have been a concern for much of the SCDRS in the past. The authors of this report chose to monitor the closing of beaches (the result of contamination) because of high E. coli concentrations rather than to monitor E. coli concentrations specifically. This information on the closing of beaches is simpler to maintain, update, and understand than E. coli concentrations and is a direct measure of its influence to humans' activities.\n\nBasis for Assessing Indicator.-The same status rating thresholds were used in this assessment that were used in the Lake Huron Biodiversity Strategy and LEBCS (Franks Taylor and others, 2010;Pearsall and others, 2012). Approach.-The Water Quality Index results from Chow-Fraser (2006) indicated that wetlands in the Detroit River were considered very degraded and highly degraded, whereas wetlands in western Lake St. Clair were very good. These values were not used in the results because the values were measured prior to 2004 and more thorough investigations are required in the future.\nBasis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012) based on expert opinion. Approach.-Habitat suitability for all birds data were gathered from the Great Lakes Migratory Bird Stopover Portal (Ewert and others, 2012; accessed at: https://data.pointblue.org/partners/mwadc/index.php?page=stopover-map-tool), and data were only for the U.S portions of SCDRS. The resulting polygons for the previous shorebird, waterbird, and landbird analysis were intersected to calculate the area of biodiversity hotspots of migrating birds compared to land areas classified as in conservation.

Because most status ratings thresholds are listed as TBD, further investigation is necessary to define quantitative measures for this indicator. Description.-This indicator reflects the recently discovered presence of spawning lake whitefish and ongoing survey efforts in the SCDRS (Roseman and others, 2007). The presence of spawning lake whitefish is an indicator of improving water quality since the adoption of the GLWQA in 1972 and can serve as a positive and motivational symbol of system recovery. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds and current status values for this indicator are based on ongoing surveys (Roseman and others, 2012;Tucker and others, 2018) and expert opinion, and this indicator may only apply well to the Detroit River. Evaluation of this indicator with respect to the St. Clair River is still needed. Approach.-Larval fish have been sampled throughout the SCDRS by the USGS Great Lakes Science Center since 2006.

Phosphorus reduction targets for the Lake Erie Basin are being revised per the 2012 GLWQA. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Annex 4 of the GLWQA of 2012 (United States and Canada, 2012) includes total phosphorus concentrations and load targets for Lake Erie (less than or equal to 15 micrograms per liter [\u00b5g/L] spring mean concentration), which were applied to Lake St. Clair and the main channels because of the lack of established standards for the rivers. Status rating thresholds were not developed for this indicator, except a status rating of very good; therefore, status rating thresholds need to be determined for Lake St. Clair and the main channels. Approach.-The MDEQ monitors the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers as part of the standard monitoring of the Great Lakes connecting channels. Data reported were provided by W. Keiper, MDEQ (written commun., 2014). Monthly samples were collected at two locations in each river from April to October 2012. The 2012 spring (April/May/June) mean and year median are reported in table 3. Sample collection and processing methods can be found in Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (2013) and the references therein. These results indicate that total phosphorus concentrations could be considered very good, though further refinement of this indicator is needed. Description.-Beach closures because of E. coli concentrations exceeding safe swimming levels have been a concern for much of the SCDRS in the past. The authors of this report chose to monitor the closing of beaches (the result of contamination) because of high E. coli concentrations rather than to monitor E. coli concentrations specifically. This information on the closing of beaches is simpler to maintain, update, and understand than E. coli concentrations and is a direct measure of its influence to humans' activities. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Further investigation is necessary to define quantitative status rating thresholds for this indicator. Approach.-The percent of days that beaches were open during the swimming season (Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) was used to rate the E. coli metric across the connecting channels. Only beaches that were monitored during 2013 were used, except for Belle Isle Beach, which was sampled during 2012 and not 2013. Data were downloaded from the MDEQ website at: http://www.deq.state.mi.us/beach/Default.aspx. Beaches used in this metric in each assessment unit included Belle Isle beach for the upper Detroit River; Pier Park beach, Lake St. Clair Metropark beach, New Baltimore Park beach, and St. Clair Shores Memorial Park beach for west Lake St. Clair; and Chrysler Park beach, Marine City beach, and Marine City diving area for the middle St. Clair River. Beaches that were closed because of reasons other than bacteria were not included in this calculation. Description.-Freshwater mussels are of significant interest in North America given the high diversity of this taxa in North America and the high level imperilment of this group (Master, 1990), as well as the ecological functions freshwater mussels provide (Vaughn and others, 2008). Among these ecological functions is the ability of freshwater mussels to filter large volumes of water, which helps to temper algal populations in productive areas and helps to reduce turbidity. Historically, much more abundant and rich in diversity, the native mussels in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair have declined substantially through the decades, most likely due to the Dreissenid mussel invasions (zebra mussel [Dreissena polymorpha] and quagga mussel [D. bugensis]; Gillis and Mackie, 1994;Nalepa and others, 1996;Schloesser and others, 1996).

Description.-This indicator reflects the rates of soil erosion and deposition (tons per acre per year [t/ac/yr]) of Lake St. Clair tributaries. Erosion from tributaries contributes sediment loads in the system, and sediment discharge from tributaries has been linked to higher levels of phosphorus in Lake Erie.

Approach.-Data were made available from Bird Studies Canada, which has coordinated surveys across the Great Lakes Region for as many as 15 years through the volunteer based Marsh Monitoring Program (2009). Using ArcMap, the average marsh bird IBI values were calculated for marsh routes within 2 km of the shoreline in each assessment unit. IBI values were calculated by Bird Studies Canada using the Crewe and Timmermans (2005) methodology. Marsh bird IBI values varied considerably at the few locations that were sampled annually. Because locations were not sampled consistently from 1999 to 2013, the mean IBI values for all available years was used. In addition, the inconsistent sampling led to IBI values to be driven by single sampling events or older data. The west Lake St. Clair assessment unit had a single sampling event during 2011, whereas data collected in lower St. Clair River were prior to 2005.

In the SCDRS, hardened shorelines have destroyed wetlands and wildlife habitat and alter the flow regime of these rivers by preventing high waters from flooding inland, and instead, redirecting energy downstream.

The suitability data from the raster were extracted within a 2-km buffer (inland only) along the shoreline to allow comparability across all assessment units. Roads were considered as disturbance that may alter shorebird behavior (Borgmann, 2011). To calculate the average distance to disturbances (roads), we converted the raster to points (approximately 9,000 points) to run a \"near\" analysis to calculate the distance (in meters) to the nearest road. The road layer was the same as used in the road density indicator. Although other factors such as trails and boat traffic alter shorebird behavior, these factors could not be accounted for in this analysis. Therefore, the results underestimate the disturbance of shorebirds. The use of creel data to generate angling and marina/boat ramp hotspots may allow future analysis to account for boating traffic in addition to roads.

The suitability data from the raster were extracted within a 2-km buffer along the shoreline to allow comparability across all assessment units. Roads were considered as disturbance that may alter shorebird behavior (Borgmann, 2011). To calculate the average distance to disturbances (roads), we converted the raster to points (approximately 152,000 points) to run a \"near\" analysis to calculate the distance (in meters) to the nearest road. The road layer was the same as used in the road density indicator. Although other factors such as trails and boat traffic alter waterfowl behavior, these factors could not be accounted for in this analysis. Therefore, the results underestimate the disturbance of waterfowl. The use of creel data to generate angling and marina/boat ramp hotspots may allow future analysis to account for boating traffic in addition to roads. Key Ecological Attribute-Habitat Availability"}, {"section_title": "Percentage of 2 Kilometers Shoreline Area Suitable for Shorebirds", "text": "Description.-Studies outside the Great Lakes Region indicate that the number or species richness of shorebirds is positively associated with the amount of wetland cover at a scale of 3-10 km (Farmer and Parent, 1997). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), which used expert opinion to assign values to the proportion of suitable habitat (Farmer and Parent, 1997;Fairbairn and Dinsmore, 2001). Approach.-Habitat suitability for shorebirds data were gathered from Shorebird Model within the Great Lakes Migratory Bird Stopover Portal (Ewert and others, 2012; accessed at: https://data.pointblue.org/partners/mwadc/index.php?page=stopovermap-tool). The model scores were downloaded from the online mapping portal as rasters. The Shorebird Model scores ranged from 0 (non-habitat) to 5 (ideal habitat) that were generated within the Shorebird Model from criteria such as distance to water bodies and land cover types. The suitability data from the raster were extracted within a 2-km buffer that spanned from along the shoreline to 2 km inland. Suitable habitat was considered any value greater than 1 that was converted to a polygon, and the area of suitable habitat within this 2-km buffer was then calculated. "}, {"section_title": "Percentage of 2 Kilometers Shoreline Area Suitable Habitat for Landbirds", "text": "Description.-Undeveloped areas near shorelines are important for resident and migrant landbirds. Lower densities of migrants are found in landscapes where habitat patches have less than 40 percent natural land cover (Williams, 2002). Additionally, migrant body condition may be reduced in landscapes with less than 10 percent cover (Ktitorov and others, 2008). Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), which used expert opinion to assign values to the proportion of suitable habitat. Approach.-Habitat suitability for landbirds data were gathered from Landbird Model within the Great Lakes Migratory Bird Stopover Portal (Ewert and others, 2012; accessed at: https://data.pointblue.org/partners/mwadc/index.php?page=stopovermap-tool). The model scores were downloaded from the online mapping portal as rasters. The Landbird Model scores ranged from 0 (non-habitat) to 5 (ideal habitat) that were generated within the Landbird Model from criteria such as distance to water bodies and land cover types.

Suitable habitat was considered any value greater than 1 that was converted to a polygon, and the area of suitable habitat within this 2-km buffer was then calculated. Description.-Because of the high co-occurrence of shorebirds and waterfowl, and a study indicating the number ducks present during migration was positively associated with wetland cover (Brennan, 2006), the indicator rating thresholds for shorebirds were adopted for waterfowl. Basis for Assessing Indicator.-Status rating thresholds were taken from the LEBCS (Pearsall and others, 2012), which used expert opinion to assign values to the proportion of suitable habitat. Approach.-Habitat suitability for waterbirds data were gathered from Waterbird Model within the Great Lakes Migratory Bird Stopover Portal (Ewert and others, 2012; accessed at: https://data.pointblue.org/partners/mwadc/index.php?page=stopovermap-tool). The model scores were downloaded from the online mapping portal as rasters. The Waterbird Model scores ranged from 0 (non-habitat) to 5 (ideal habitat) that were generated within the Waterbird Model from criteria such as distance to water bodies and land cover types. The suitability data from the raster were extracted within a 2-km buffer that spanned from along the shoreline to 2 km inland. Suitable habitat was considered any value greater than 1 that was converted to a polygon and the area of suitable habitat within this 2-km buffer was then calculated. Description.-This indicator is a conservative approach to ensure sufficient habitat during any given time and between migration season. As with all indicators related to aerial migrants, more study is needed to refine threshold values for this indicator."}]
