[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia exhibit significant heterogeneity across clinical symptoms, atrophy patterns, and spatial distribution of Tau deposition. Most previous studies of AD heterogeneity have focused on atypical clinical subtypes, defined subtypes with a single modality, or restricted their analyses to a priori brain regions and cognitive tests. Here, we considered a data-driven hierarchical Bayesian model to identify latent factors from atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits simultaneously, thus exploiting the rich dimensionality within each modality. Unlike most previous studies, our model allows each factor to be expressed to varying degrees within an individual, in order to reflect potential multiple co-existing pathologies. By applying our model to ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants, we found three atrophy-cognitive factors. The first factor was associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy, episodic memory deficits and disorientation to time/place (\"MTL-Memory\"). The second factor was associated with lateral temporal atrophy and language deficits (\"Lateral TemporalLanguage\"). The third factor was associated with atrophy in posterior bilateral cortex, and visuospatial executive function deficits (\"Posterior Cortical-Executive\"). While the MTLMemory and Posterior Cortical-Executive factors were discussed in previous literature, the Lateral Temporal-Language factor is novel and emerged only by considering atrophy and cognition jointly. Several analyses were performed to ensure generalizability, replicability and stability of the estimated factors. First, the factors generalized to new participants within a 10-fold cross-validation of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants. Second, the factors were replicated in an independent ADNI-1 AD dementia cohort. Third, factor loadings of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants were longitudinally stable, suggesting that these factors capture heterogeneity across patients, rather than longitudinal disease progression. Fourth, the model outperformed canonical correlation analysis at capturing associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits.\nTo explore the influence of the factors early in the disease process, factor loadings were estimated in ADNI-GO/2 mild cognitively impaired (MCI) participants. Although the associations between the atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles were weak in MCI compared to AD, we found that factor loadings were associated with inter-individual regional variation in Tau uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that distinct atrophy-cognitive patterns exist in typical Alzheimer's disease, and are associated with distinct patterns of Tau depositions before clinical dementia emerges. \nKeywords"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devasting neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Although AD commonly presents as an amnestic syndrome (Scheltens et al., 2016b) , there is significant heterogeneity across individuals. For example, there exists multiple AD variants involving atypical clinical symptoms, such as visuospatial or language deficits (Lam et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2013) . These atypical dysfunctions are often accompanied by corresponding atrophy patterns and tau deposition patterns. For example, participants with \"visual variant\" (posterior cortical atrophy, PCA) AD dementia might exhibit greater atrophy and tau deposition in posterior cortical regions (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2018) . On the other hand, participants with \"language variant\" (logopenic aphasia, LPA) AD dementia might exhibit greater atrophy and tau deposition in temporal or parietal regions (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2018) .\nWhile the above studies focused on atypical clinically-defined AD subtypes, there is also heterogeneity within typical AD dementia (patients not clearly diagnosed with an atypical AD variant such as PCA or LPA). In cohorts comprising mostly typical AD dementia participants (e.g., ADNI), studies have demonstrated that participants exhibit distinct atrophy patterns or subtypes (Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017; Risacher et al., 2017; Young et al., 2018) . Although details differ across studies, two common atrophy subtypes that have emerged across studies are defined by medial temporal or cortical atrophy (Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Ferreira et al., 2017; Young et al., 2018) . A less common subtype to be reported involves atrophy of the striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum Young et al., 2018) . Unlike atypical clinically-defined AD variants, correspondences between atrophy subtypes and cognitive domains in the context of typical AD remain unclear, with most studies reporting worse overall cognition and faster disease progression in cortical subtypes (Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al, 2015; Risacher et al., 2017 ; but see Ferreira et al., 2017 ). An exception is our previous study, which found that AD dementia participants with the medial temporal atrophy subtype suffered worse memory deficits, while AD dementia participants with the cortical atrophy subtype suffered worse executive function deficits . However, the subcortical atrophy subtype was not associated with a specific cognitive domain .\nThe relatively weak correspondence between atrophy subtypes and cognitive domains in typical AD dementia highlights a need for improvement in subtyping algorithms. Previous studies have defined subtypes solely based on brain atrophy (Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Ferreira et al., 2017; Young et al., 2018) followed by post-hoc associations with cognitive scores. Here, we proposed an extension of our previous model to estimate subtypes using structural MRI and neuropsychological testing scores simultaneously, identifying latent factors associated with distinct patterns of atrophy and cognitive deficits (Figure 1 ). The advantage of combining both modalities is that the associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits are automatically encouraged by the model. Thus, this approach enabled a more thorough investigation of atrophy and cognitive profiles, rather than restricting analyses to previously defined composite measures of cognition . This approach allows the possibility of new atrophycognitive factors emerging as a result of considering both atrophy and cognitive deficits simultaneously, thus providing insights into AD heterogeneity. Our model allows each patient to express one or more latent factors. The factors are associated with distinct (but possibly overlapping) patterns of brain atrophy, as well as distinct (but possibly overlapping) profiles of cognitive deficits. The estimated model parameters are the probability that a patient expresses a particular factor (i.e., Pr(Factor | Patient)), the probability that a factor is associated with atrophy at a voxel (i.e., Pr(Voxel | Factor)) and the probability that a factor is associated with a cognitive score (i.e., Pr(Score | Factor)). Consistent with our previous work , a key feature of our modeling approach is that it allows the possibility that multiple latent factors are expressed to varying degrees within an individual. This is motivated by an extensive literature suggesting multiple etiologies underlying disease heterogeneity that are not mutually exclusive (Schneider et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2009; Dickerson and Wolk, 2011; Murray et al., 2011; Franklin et al., 2015; Coutu et al., 2016; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016) . For example, the atrophy-cognitive profiles of a patient might be 80% owing to factor 1, 15% to factor 2, and 5% to factor 3, whereas the atrophy-cognitive profiles of another patient might be 30% owing to factor 1, 65% to factor 2, and 5% to factor 3. This is in contrast to previous \"winner-takes-all\" subtyping studies, in which a participant is assigned to a single subtype (Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017) . This motivates our use of the term \"factors\", rather than \"subtypes\".\nBecause typical AD dementia has a long prodromal stage, we also investigated whether associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles estimated from AD dementia participants (Figure 1 ) could also be discerned in \u03b2-Amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) MCI participants. Given that brain atrophy and cognitive deficits are thought to occur later in the disease process (Jack et al., 2010; , one might expect weaker associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles in the MCI participants than in AD dementia participants. By contrast, Tau-mediated injury is thought to occur earlier in the disease process (Jack et al., 2010; . The advent of 18 F-Flortaucipir, a PET tracer with high affinity for paired helical filament Tau, provides an exciting opportunity to investigate regional NFTs in vivo (Chien et al., 2013) . Thus, we also investigated whether the atrophycognitive factors ( Figure 1 ) were associated with spatial patterns of Tau deposition in MCI participants.\nMany studies have found strong relationships between tau depositions and cognitive deficits (Murray et al., 2011; Bejanin et al., 2017; Chiotis et al., 2017; Gordon et al., 2019) . In the case of atypical clinically-defined AD subtypes, studies have demonstrated strong correspondences between tau deposition patterns and cognitive domains (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2018) . For example, increased 18 F-Flortaucipir uptake in the hippocampus, bilateral occipital lobe and left temporoparietal regions were associated with worse memory, visuospatial and language functions respectively (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016) .\nHowever, in cohorts involving predominantly typical AD participants or only elderly nondemented participants, the correspondences between the spatial patterns of Tau deposition and cognitive domains are a lot less clear, with most studies showing greater global tau deposition associated with multiple cognitive domains, or greater regional tau depositions associated with global cognitive deficits (Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016; Maass et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2017; Aschenbrenner et al., 2018) . Thus, our study seeks to extend these previous studies by clarifying whether the distinct tau deposition patterns are associated with different cognitive domains in MCI participants."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "There are three stages of analyses ( Figure 2 ). First, a hierarchical multimodal Bayesian model ( Figure 1 ) was applied to AD dementia participants from the ADNI-GO/2 (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2) database to extract factors based on patterns of atrophy and cognitive performance. The relationships between factor loadings and patient characteristics (e.g., age)\nwere then examined. Second, we tested the generalizability, replicability and stability of the estimated factors, involving 10-fold cross-validation within ADNI-GO/2, independent replication using ADNI-1 and longitudinal data in ADNI-GO/2. We also compared our approach with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which has been widely used to discover brain-behavior relationships (Smith et al., 2015) .\nThird, to explore heterogeneity earlier in the disease process, we applied our model to ADNI-GO/2 A\u03b2+ MCI participants to extract factor loadings. Longitudinal stability of the factor loadings was examined. Relationships between atrophy and cognitive loadings were also explored. Finally, the association between factor loadings and the spatial pattern of Tau was also investigated in ADNI-2/3 MCI participants with available Tau PET. To maximize the number of participants, all MCI participants with available Tau PET were considered regardless of amyloid status \u2020 . \u2020 Unfortunately, there were only 21 AD dementia participants with Tau PET, so we did not perform an analysis on this subgroup because of the small sample size. Arrows indicate the data used in each analysis. We note that if A\u03b2+ was not specifically mentioned for a particular cohort, then this implied that the participants were not filtered based on A\u03b2+. The main reason for not filtering based on A\u03b2+ was to maximize sample size. According to ADNI's inclusion criteria (page 27 of https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2008/07/adni2-procedures-manual.pdf), participants must be at least 55 years old when diagnosed with AD dementia. ADNI also excluded participants whose MMSE were less than 20. In practice, AD dementia participants were on average 75 years old and 85% of the AD dementia participants were above 65 years old ( Table 1 ). Given that the cognitive tests in ADNI were not designed to detect atypical clinically-defined AD subtypes (e.g., logopenic subtypes), we could not rule out the presence of atypical clinically-defined AD subtypes. However, atypical AD variants usually have faster disease progression, early disease onset and are relatively rare. Therefore, we expect the occurrence of atypical AD variants in the ADNI cohort to be relatively low given the age range of ADNI AD dementia participants and the exclusion of participants with MMSE less than 20. Thus, we interpret the ADNI cohort as comprising predominantly typical late-onset AD dementia participants, consistent with the interpretation of some previous work with ADNI (Meda et al., 2012; Iturria-Medina et al., 2016) . It is also worth noting that late-onset AD is typically defined as being diagnosed with AD dementia at 65 years or older (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . Unfortunately, the age of onset was not available in ADNI-GO/2, while amyloid status of many participants was not available in ADNI-1. Since the gap between the age of onset and baseline age was around 3.5 years in ADNI-1 (Table 1) , Section 3.1 will include control analyses involving ADNI-GO/2 A\u03b2+ AD dementia participants, who were at least 70 years old at baseline. Thus, the sensitivity analysis in Section 3.1 was performed to ensure that factors derived with the larger sample of AD participants were not driven by heterogeneity within A\u03b2-AD and/or the subset of younger ADNI participants with AD that could reflect traditional atypical presentations."}, {"section_title": "Data overview", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Latent Factors Estimation & Characterization", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Structural MRI", "text": "Baseline MRI data from 158 AD dementia patients, 489 MCI participants, and 311 cognitively normal (CN) participants from ADNI-GO/2 were used to define a study specific template for voxel-based morphometry (VBM; Figure 2 ). All structural MRI (T1-weighted, 3.0T) were acquired with Sagittal MP-RAGE/IR-SPGR sequence and followed a standardized preprocessing protocol: Gradwarp, B1 non-uniformity and N3 correction (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-analysis/mri-pre-processing/).\nThe structural MRI were analyzed using the CAT12 VBM software (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/), yielding subject-specific gray-matter (GM) density maps in MNI space. We then applied log10 transformation to the GM density images and regressed the effects of age, sex and intracranial volume (ICV) from all participants. Regression coefficients were estimated from only CN participants to retain any interaction between AD and participants' characteristics (e.g., interaction between AD and age). The regression coefficients were then utilized to compute residuals for all participants. For more details about the VBM and regression procedures, see Supplementary Methods S1. (Table S1 ; Folstein et al., 1975) : \"MMSE: Orientation to time\", \"MMSE: Orientation to place\", \"MMSE: Immediate Recall\", \"MMSE: Attention\", \"MMSE: Delayed Recall\", \"MMSE: Language\", \"MMSE: Repetition\" and \"MMSE:"}, {"section_title": "Cognitive scores", "text": "Complex Commands\". This resulted in a total of 32 scores (Table S1 ). Table S5 shows the standard deviation of the cognitive scores across CN participants within the ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2 cohorts. The five cognitive scores with lowest variance were consistent across both cohorts and corresponded to \"ADAS: Recall Instructions\", \"MMSE: Language\", \"ADAS: Comprehension\", \"MMSE: Immediate Recall\" and \"ADAS:\nSpoken Language\". Among these five cognitive scores with limited range, the following scores were combined since they reflect similar cognitive functions: (1) \"MMSE: Language\" and \"ADAS: Naming\", (2) \"MMSE: Immediate Recall\" and \"MMSE: Delayed Recall\" and (3) \"ADAS: Spoken Language\" and \"ADAS: Comprehension\". We did not think that the remaining cognitive score \"ADAS: Recall Instructions\" was tapping into similar cognitive function as other scores, so we simply remove the score from consideration. The variance of the combined scores are shown in Table S6 . Thus, we ended up with 28 scores (Table S3) .\nAmong the 158 ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants, 9 were excluded because more than 10 cognitive scores were missing. Of the remaining 149 participants, 124 had all scores, while 25 participants had less than five missing scores. The general linear model (GLM) was used to impute the missing scores in the 25 participants (Section 2.7 of Enders, 2010) . Briefly, for each participant with missing scores, we fitted a GLM to all participants (CN, MCI and AD) without missing scores, where the observed scores were independent variables and the missing scores were dependent variables. The estimated regression coefficients were used to fill in the missing scores of the participant with missing scores.\nConsistent with the structural MRI processing, we regressed out effects of age, sex and ICV from all scores using regression coefficients estimated from the CN participants. See Supplementary Methods S1 for details."}, {"section_title": "Multimodal Bayesian model", "text": "We have previously utilized a hierarchical Bayesian model, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003) , to encode the premise that each AD patient expresses one or more latent factors, associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy . LDA (and its variants) have also been successfully used to extract overlapping brain networks from functional MRI (Yeo et al., 2014) and meta-analytic data (Bertolero et al., 2015; Yeo et al., 2015) . In the current analysis, we considered an extension of the LDA model to incorporate two modalities (gray matter atrophy and neuropsychological testing scores), herein referred to as multi-modality LDA (MMLDA). In this framework, each AD patient expresses one or more latent factors, each of which is associated with distinct (but possibly overlapping) atrophy patterns and distinct (but possibly overlapping) cognitive deficits ( Figure 1 ). The model is mathematically equivalent to that proposed by Putthividhya and colleagues (2007) .\nDetails are found in Supplementary Methods S2 and S3.\nWe considered VBM and cognitive scores of all ADNI-GO/2 participants with AD dementia (N = 149). Since most participants were A\u03b2+ (88%; Table 1), we did not exclude the small number of A\u03b2-participants, in order to maximize the number of participants. The VBM and cognitive scores of 149 ADNI-GO/2 participants with AD dementia were first znormalized with respect to the CN participants (see Supplementary Methods S4 for details).\nGiven the normalized VBM and cognitive scores of the 149 participants, as well as a predefined number of latent factors , a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm was used to estimate the probability of a patient expressing a latent factor [Pr(Factor | Patient)], probability that a factor was associated with atrophy at a voxel [Pr(Voxel | Factor)] and the probability that a factor was associated with a cognitive score [Pr(Score | Factor)]. See Table 2 for a summary of the terminologies.\nAn important model parameter is the number of latent factors . We considered = 2, 3 or 4. As will be explained in the Results, the four-factor solution was not interpretable, and so we did not explore beyond four factors.

Vertical axis corresponds to the probability of a cognitive score being associated with a factor (i.e., Pr(Score | Factor) It is worth pointing out that Pr(Score | Factor) must sum to one over all scores because it is a probability distribution. Therefore, if certain cognitive tests from a particular cognitive domain were over-represented in the dataset, then on average Pr(Score | Factor) for the particular cognitive domain would be lower. Here, there were more cognitive tests in ADNI involving memory and visuospatial executive function, so Pr(Score | Factor) was generally lower for the Posterior Cortical-Executive and MTL-Memory factors compared with the Lateral Temporal-Language factor (Figure 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Number of factors", "text": "An important model parameter is the number of latent factors. This is an unsolved problem in machine learning with no consensus on the best approach for estimating the number of factors. In this paper, we first estimated the two-factor model and then continued to increase the number of estimated factors as long as two criteria were satisfied. First, we preferred more factors as long as the relationships between the atrophy pattern and cognitive profiles remained biologically plausible. Because biological plausibility was subjective, we considered a second quantitative criterion, which was that the atrophy-cognitive relationships generalized to new participants within a 10-fold cross-validation procedure (Section 3.2.1).\nThe two-factor model revealed two factors that were very similar to the first and third factors of the three-factor model. More specifically, there was one factor associated with medial temporal atrophy ( Figure S5A1 ) and memory-related cognitive deficits ( Figure S6B1 ), whereas the second factor was associated with posterior cortical atrophy ( Figure S5A2 ) and visuospatial/executive function cognitive deficits ( Figure S6B2 ). Therefore, the two-factor estimates were biologically plausible. However, according to the first criterion, we preferred the three-factor model to the two-factor model because of the additional Lateral TemporalLanguage factor. The three-factor model also generalized to new participants (Section 3.2.1), which satisfied the second criterion.\nOn the other hand, the four-factor model revealed three factors ( Figures S7A1-3 , S8B1-3), which were similar to factors in three-factor model. However, the fourth factor was associated with medial temporal atrophy in addition to subcortical atrophy in the basal ganglia and thalamus ( Figure S7A4 ). Thus, the atrophy pattern was not constrained to a known brain system. The fourth factor was also associated with a mixture of deficits that appeared to cut across multiple cognitive domains ( Figure S8B4) . Therefore, overall, we felt that the fourth atrophy-cognitive factor did not seem biologically plausible. The fourth factor also did not generalize to new participants (Section 3.2.1).

Although the associations between the atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles were weak in MCI participants, we identified associations between some atrophy-cognitive factors and Tau PET. Specifically, greater Tau deposition in MTL regions were associated with greater loading on the MTL-Memory factor, but lower loading on the Posterior Cortical-Executive factor.\nThe contributions of this study are three-fold. First, we introduced a multimodal Bayesian model that allowed the joint estimation of atrophy-cognitive factors from VBM and cognitive scores simultaneously. We demonstrated that our model was better than CCA in capturing the associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles. Our model might potentially be applied to other neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders that are known to demonstrate disease heterogeneity.\nSecond, unlike atypical clinically-defined AD subtypes, correspondences between atrophy subtypes and cognitive domains are less clear in typical AD dementia with most studies reporting that the cortical atrophy subtype is associated with worse overall cognition and faster disease progression. An exception is our previous study, which demonstrated that the medial temporal atrophy factor was associated worse memory deficits, while the cortical atrophy factor was associated with worse executive function deficits .\nHere, we found a novel Lateral Temporal-Language factor, which emerged only by considering atrophy and cognition jointly.\nFinally, a number of studies have found strong correspondences between the spatial patterns of tau depositions and cognitive domains in cohorts mixing atypical clinicallydefined AD subtypes and typical AD dementia. However, in cohorts involving predominantly typical AD or only MCI participants, the correspondences between the spatial patterns of Tau deposition and cognitive domains are less clear. Our study is therefore one of the first to demonstrate that the spatial pattern of tau heterogeneity is associated with different atrophycognitive factors in MCI participants."}, {"section_title": "Atrophy patterns", "text": "Our model revealed three factors with distinct atrophy patterns in AD patients ( Figure   3 ). Two of these atrophy patterns were similar to results from other studies (Whitwell et al., 2012; Noh et al., 2014; Byun et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Young et al., 2018) , while the third (lateral temporal) atrophy pattern was a novel insight from the current modeling approach. More specifically, the first factor was associated with preferential atrophy of the medial temporal lobe; the second factor was associated with preferential atrophy of the lateral temporal cortex; and the third factor was associated with preferential atrophy of the posterior cortex. Our medial temporal atrophy pattern was similar to the \"medial temporal\" subtype and our posterior cortical atrophy pattern was similar to the \"parietal dominant\" subtype previously reported by Noh and colleagues (Noh et al., 2014) .\nBesides the anatomical subtypes, our medial temporal atrophy pattern is similar to the \"limbic predominant\" Tau subtype, whereas the lateral temporal and posterior cortical atrophy factors is similar to the \"hippocampal-sparing\" Tau subtype (Murray et al., 2011; Whitwell et al., 2012) . Interestingly, the \"hippocampal-sparing\" subtype was associated with younger age of dementia onset (Murray et al., 2011; Risacher et al., 2017) , and we found a similar younger age in our posterior cortical-executive factor (Table S4 ). Overall, this seems to suggest that cortical presentation is associated with younger age, whereas an MTL presentation is associated with older age.\nIt is worth noting that Murray and colleagues likely examined a mixture of early-onset and late-onset AD participants. For example, the age of dementia onset for the hippocampalsparing subtype was 63\u00b110, suggesting a majority of those participants were likely early-onset AD. Consistent with Risacher et al. (2017) and our previous study , our current results show that differentiation in participants' age exists even within the limited age range found in ADNI. However, similar to our previous study , we did not find an association between factor loadings and APOE \u03b54, while Risacher and colleagues found increased prevalence of APOE \u03b54 positivity in participants belonging to the hippocampal atrophy subtype (consistent with Murray et al., 2011) . Since Risacher et al.\n(2017), Zhang et al. (2016) and our current study all utilized the ADNI database, the discrepancy is likely a result of how the subtypes were defined, rather than cohort differences."}, {"section_title": "Atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits", "text": "Our previous work exploring latent atrophy factors utilizing structural MRI alone identified \"Temporal\", \"Subcortical\" and \"Cortical\" patterns . Although post-hoc analyses revealed that the temporal atrophy factor was associated with worse memory performance and the cortical atrophy factor was associated with worse executive function performance, the subcortical atrophy factor was not associated with any behavioral performance . Our current study extends our previous work by flexibly examining cognitive profiles using a data-driven approach, rather than restricting associations with pre-defined summary measures of cognitive domains.\nIndeed, each cognitive test can be thought of as an imperfect measurement of some underlying cognitive construct. The test might be imperfect in that it is only measuring part of the cognitive construct or it might involve cognitive processes beyond the construct of interest, random noise and measurement error. Here, the data-driven fusion of multiple related cognitive tests seeks to better capture underlying cognitive constructs, compared with using individual imperfect cognitive tests.\nIn doing so, the current approach shed new insight into the link between atrophy and cognition compared to our previous work , For example, the MTLMemory factor included not just episodic memory measures , but also orientation to time and place, which are also well-established functions associated with the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Squire et al., 2004; Hafting et al., 2005) . Similarly, the Posterior Cortical-Executive factor included various executive function measures (e.g., \"MMSE: attention\" and \"ADAS: number cancellation\"), which were not included in the ADNI executive function composite score , but have been previously shown to related to posterior parietal regions (Crutch et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2016) .\nFurthermore, the current analysis identified a new Lateral Temporal-Language factor associated with lateral temporal atrophy and language deficits. Interestingly, the distribution of scores across participants ( Figure 5 ) revealed that the range of expression of the lateral temporal factor was reduced compared to the medial temporal and posterior cortical factors,\nsuggesting that very few participants predominately express this latent pattern. This restricted expression may explain why we did not identify this pattern when exploring MRI alone . However, this factor emerged when considering joint correspondence between atrophy and cognition. Importantly, a previous study (Domoto-Reilly et al., 2012) has shown that among participants with AD dementia, deficits in the Boston naming test was associated with atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, which overlapped significantly with our lateral temporal atrophy pattern.\nIn addition to implicating the lateral temporal cortex, the Lateral Temporal-Language factor was also associated with atrophy in multiple regions within the default network. A meta-analysis by Binder and colleagues has previously suggested that the left lateralized default network is involved in language processing and semantic memory (Binder et al., 2009 ). Traditionally, the default network has been thought to include temporal lobe, precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal cortex (Buckner et al., 2008; Yeo et al., 2011) . However, previous work has also suggested that the default network can be fractionated into different functional subsystems (Laird et al., 2009; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Yeo et al., 2014) . Our first and second factors appeared to fractionate the default network in an interesting new way, where the medial temporal lobe was associated with the first factor, while the lateral temporal lobe and other default network regions were associated with the second factor.\nAlso noteworthy is that both the Lateral Temporal-Language and Posterior CorticalExecutive factors were associated with different portions of precuneus, which is consistent with the current understanding of the functional heterogeneity of this region (Margulies et al., 2009; Fornito et al., 2012) . More specifically, the Posterior Cortical-Executive factor appeared to be associated with portions of precuneus that has been previously associated with the frontoparietal control network (Figure 1 of Fornito et al., 2012 and Figures 11 and 13 of Yeo et al., 2011) . On the other hand, the Lateral Temporal-Language factor appeared to be associated with the precuneus/posterior cingulate core of the default network ( Figure 1 of Fornito et al., 2012 and Figures 11 and 13 of Yeo et al., 2011) . Thus, although default network regions (in particular the precuneus) are consistently implicated in AD, the specific pattern of regions involved might vary across individual patients.\nInterestingly, focal and pronounced atrophy in these factors have been consistently implicated in atypical variants of AD. Specifically, Logopenic Aphasia (LPA) is associated with atrophy in regions found within our Lateral Temporal-Language factor whereas patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) show atrophy in regions within our Posterior CorticalExecutive factor (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Crutch et al., 2012) . Thus, the emergence of similar patterns in the context of typical late-onset AD in the current study suggests that vulnerability in these brain networks exists along a continuum rather than being a specific feature to atypical presentations. It is possible that atypical clinical variants represent the extreme end of a continuous distribution of deficits across different cognitive domains."}, {"section_title": "Subtypes and stages", "text": "Due to the cross-sectional data used in this study, it is possible that our factors reflect different disease stages along the continuum of AD progression rather than heterogeneous disease subtypes (Ritchie and Touchon, 1992) . However, there are two reasons why our factors likely reflected disease subtypes, rather than simply disease stages (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014 Young et al., , 2018 . First, our factors reflected the impairment of distinct cognitive domains, such as memory, language and visuospatial executive function (Figure 4 ).\nSecond, one-year follow-up analyses revealed that the atrophy and cognitive loadings of the three factors were stable (Figure 7 ). However, we note that the one-year stability analysis is short and we cannot rule out the evolution of atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles within an individual. See further discussion in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Association with Tau pathology", "text": "Tau aggregations into neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (Braak and Braak, 1991) , and are consistently shown to correlate more strongly with cognitive functions than Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques (Nelson et al., 2012; Rolstad et al., 2013) . Excitingly, the advent of PET ligands that bind to Tau aggregations, such as 18 FFlortaucipir (Chien et al., 2013) , allows us to investigate the relationship between the spatial distribution of Tau in vivo throughout the course of Alzheimer's disease (James et al., 2015; LaPoint et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2017; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017) , and has been shown to relate to clinical symptoms associated with atypical AD such as Logopenic Aphasia and Posterior Cortical Atrophy (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016) .\nHere, we extended the work of Ossenkoppele and colleagues by examining Tau heterogeneity in a cohort comprising predominantly of typical late-onset AD dementia participants (a population with a more limited range of clinical deficits across non-memory domains). In the context of typical late-onset AD, associations between regional 18 FFlortaucipir and memory (or global cognition) have been identified earlier in the \"typical\" AD trajectory, among participants with MCI as well as clinically normal older controls (Maass, et al., 2017a, b; Vogel et al., 2018) . This is consistent with our findings that participants with MCI, who had higher Tau deposits in medial temporal and hippocampus regions, exhibited greater loadings on the MTL-Memory factor ( Figure 8A ). Furthermore, we extended these previous studies by showing that participants with MCI, who had higher Tau deposits in posterior cortical regions, were associated with greater loadings on the Posterior CorticalExecutive factor ( Figure 8C ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that distinct atrophy-cognitive factors are associated with distinct patterns of Tau depositions in participants with MCI. However, we did not find an association between Lateral TemporalLanguage factor loadings and tau PET in lateral temporal regions ( Figure 8B ). One might speculate that this factor should correlate with measures of language such as semantic memory. Although we did not find direct evidence for this, tests assessing language are sparse in the ADNI neuropsychological battery. It is therefore possible that the current analyses are limited in extracting a factor that robustly correlates with language performance.\nUnlike the Tau analysis, the cross-sectional associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles were weaker in MCI participants compared with AD dementia participants in both the current study ( Figure S16 ) and our previous study .\nFurthermore, while we could reliably estimate very similar atrophy factors in MCI and AD dementia participants independently , we could not reliably estimate atrophy-cognitive factors when restricted to MCI participants (results not shown). It is possible that the coupling between the atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles might emerge later in the disease process, which would explain the weak correlations among MCI. Future studies that address the association between atrophy factors and longitudinal cognition during the stages preceding overt dementia may provide insight into this possibility, and provide more direct insights into the time course of these changes. This is consistent with the perspective that Tau-mediated injury is thought to occur earlier in the disease process, followed by atrophy and cognitive decline (Jack et al., 2010; ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, our Tau analysis utilized a relatively small sample of 76 MCI participants. Second, to maximize sample size, our Tau analysis included all MCI participants with Tau PET data, regardless of amyloid status. Our control analyses using a smaller sample of A\u03b2+ MCI participants showed results consistent with the full sample, but were generally not statistically significant. Consequently, this affects the interpretability of our results.\nWe note that a recent paper demonstrated that the spatial patterns of tau deposits were associated with different cognitive domains in a sample comprising 25 A\u03b2+ MCI and 48 A\u03b2+ typical late-onset AD dementia participants (Ossenkopple et al., 2019) . By restricting the sample to A\u03b2+ participants, the study provided a cleaner link to typical AD. However, by mixing both MCI and AD dementia participants, the temporal staging of the observations became less clear. Indeed, when the analysis was restricted to the 25 A\u03b2+ MCI participants, the results were no longer significant (Ossenkopple et al., 2019) , similar to our control analysis of A\u03b2+ MCI participants (N = 32). Therefore, our study and Ossenkopple et al.\n(2019) together suggest that a minimum sample size of about 70 A\u03b2+ MCI participants might be necessary to demonstrate clear relationships between Tau deposition patterns and cognitive domains during the MCI stage of typical AD.\nFinally, we note that higher tau deposition in the hippocampus may be affected by the known off-target binding of 18 F-flortaucipir to the choroid plexus (Lee, et al., 2018) . Future studies should apply these approaches to second-generation Tau tracers (e.g., Lois, et al., 2018 ) that may show reduced choroid plexus binding."}, {"section_title": "Future work", "text": "Study-specific VBM templates for both ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2 have been made publicly available, so other researchers can potentially utilize the templates to estimate factor loadings in their own participants.

The model can potentially be applied to other heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, such as\nParkinson's disease. Furthermore, even though we have only utilized the model for two modalities, the model can be easily extended to handle more than two modalities, e.g., atrophy, cognitive scores and Tau.

The first factor was associated with medial temporal atrophy and deficits in memory and orientation; the second factor was associated with lateral temporal atrophy and language deficits; the third factor was associated with posterior cortical atrophy and visuospatial executive function deficits. Our approach allowed each individual to express multiple factors to various degrees, rather than assigning the individual to a single subtype. This is biologically more plausible than non-overlapping subtypes, given that multiple nonmutually exclusive factors likely influence this heterogeneity (such as age, co-morbid pathologies, genetics, exposures throughout the lifespan, etc). Therefore, each participant exhibited his or her own unique factor composition, which might potentially be exploited to predict individual-specific cognitive profile that may improve disease monitoring. Finally, our study suggested that these atrophy-cognitive profiles were associated with distinct patterns of Tau deposition in mild cognitively impaired participants, highlighting the emergence of these subtypes early in the AD trajectory."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are currently supported by Singapore MOE Tier 2 (MOE2014-T2-2-016), NUS Strategic "}]
