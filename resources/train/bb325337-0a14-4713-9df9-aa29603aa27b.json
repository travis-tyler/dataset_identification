[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent for the so-called Coronavirus disease 2019 . COVID-19 first emerged in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019; the second coronavirus to have arisen from China in the last two decades 1, 2 . Within months, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly both nationally and internationally, resulting in global outbreaks of pneumonia-like symptom clusters and death in some cases.\nConsequently, the World Health Organization publicly declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th\nMarch 2020. Besides SARS-CoV-2, four strains of coronavirus pathogenic to humans are associated with clinical symptoms, including common cold and pneumonia 3 . Two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (responsible for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome -SARS) and MERS (which causes the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) were notable for causing infections with higher fatalities deaths 4, 5 . However, outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS (though still circulating) were relatively limited compared to those caused by SARS-CoV-2 6 .\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel beta coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) 1 which translates into two precursor polyproteins (PP1a and PP1b), that are subsequently cleaved by viral proteases into functional non-structural proteins (Nsps) 8 . Other ORFs encodes four main structural proteins, including surface spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (See Fig. 1) , each of which has specific functions that dictate SARS-CoV-2 interactions and biology [9] [10] [11] .\nThe pathophysiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are heavily reliant on the function of Nsps and other structural proteins. Specifically, Nsps can prevent host immune response 1 . For structural proteins, the E protein is crucial in viral pathogenicity and promotes viral assembly and release 2 .\nThe S protein also facilitates viral entry into target cells, having an affinity for the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of cells of the lungs, heart, renal system 2,12 . Since the pandemic onset, scientists have contributed over 34,300 genome sequences 5 to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) and NCBI GenBank databases as of May 2020. Of this, Africa has only contributed 224 genome sequences. This is mostly due to Africa's reduced scientific research capacity, despite an abundance of expertise. As of 12th May 2020, Africa accounts for about 2% of the global COVID-19 caseload 3 . This has a massive implication for the African continent, especially as the continent currently lacks the health care system capacity to manage a full-blown outbreak effectively.\nCurrently, there is no known cure for COVID-19, with most pandemic response systems across the globe not being adequate in curbing the spread of the virus. Hence, there is a need to develop a vaccine(s) and drug(s), in which research teams across the globe are in a race against time to develop. However, this process is a multi-step process that relies heavily on specific molecular and pharmacological data. For insights into the molecular basis of developing vaccines and drugs, the pool of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from all over the world is currently being mined and analyzed by researchers. Conversely, many vaccines under development are currently at phase III of trials, implying that the vaccine development may have commenced before the index case was reported in some African countries. This, in turn, raises an important question; would the treatments and vaccines, when available, be useful in Africa?\nA previous study showed that residues near some amino acid (Lysine 31, Tyrosine 41, 82-84, and 353-357) in human ACE2 were important for SARS-CoV-2 binding 4 . To investigate mutations in the amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Africa, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa deposited in the GISAID and NCBI GenBank databases.\nBecause all cases in Africa arose from travel, it became compelling to compare COVID-19 sequences generated from the African continent with strains from COVID-19 hotspots Wuhan, China, and other countries across the world's different regions. We conducted complete genome analyses of viruses from Africa and compared them with reference sequences from Wuhan and other parts of the world using phylogenetic analysis. We also investigated the spike protein's amino acid sequences and the replicase (NSP12) to identify similarities and differences. This study shows, for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular epidemiology in Africa and will potentially provide insights into the mutations/variations in relevant proteins of viruses circulating in Africa.

For our analyses, nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were used. Also included were spike, NSP12\nand ORF1ab nucleotide and protein sequences, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Inclusion Criteria", "text": "Only complete genomes with at least 29kb of length were selected for the phylogenetic analysis, while ORF1ab and surface glycoproteins with 1273 amino acids were downloaded from the Coronavirus genomes NCBI website. Table 1 shows the details of the curated proteins of novel 7 coronavirus data downloaded. Efforts were made to download proteins for spike and NSP12 from different geographical regions globally, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania. All curated surface glycoproteins from Africa with omitted or ambiguous amino acid residues were eliminated from the analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Amino acid alignment of the surface glycoprotein", "text": "The amino acid sequence alignment of African surface glycoproteins against the Wuhan reference strain showed that sequences were almost identical, except for few positions where nonsynonymous substitutions occurred. Thirteen mutations were identified to differ between African and non-African SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (See Table 2 ). 90% of the African spike proteins had D614G substitution, while 7% had a C677H mutation. L5F and R408I mutations occurred in 2% of all cases. The remaining mutations nine mutations occurred at a rate of 1%.\nOf the identified mutations, the D614G substitution (shown in the amino acid alignment in Figure   2 ) is the most famous mutation among global SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Analysis of the spike 10 proteins from the different geographical regions of the globe revealed that Asia's sequences have a predominance of D614G substitution. Also, European sequences have mostly the D614G substitution as well as the Oceania sequences.\nThere is currently no record of the C677H, V70F, L242F, N354B, A288T, C314R, A653V and S604A mutations in the literature. Therefore, this study shows the existence of these mutations at a low percentage for the first time. However, the L5F, R408I and H49Ymutations have previously been reported in the literature. "}, {"section_title": "Amino Acid alignment of the NSP12-Replicase protein", "text": "Analysis of the NSP12 of African, global sequences compared with the Wuhan consensus sequence showed that sequences were almost identical except for deletion at position P314-in both the African and global sequences, as shown by an arrow in Figure 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa", "text": "Phylogenetic analysis of trees based on amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from different parts of Africa and global reference strains with bat coronavirus sequence showed that sequences originating from African countries clustered with each other overall African sequences did not form a monophyletic cluster as shown in Fig 4. However, there seemed to be multiple strains across South Africa, which did not all align together. This may likely mean that there were multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 strains from different regions. Furthermore, the DRC and Algeria also have two different strains, while all other African countries have only one strain. Overall, there seem to be multiple African clades that demonstrate local transmission within the African countries.\nThe number of African SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes found at the time of collecting this data (May 31st, 2020) was two hundred and thirteen (213). These sequences were selected to be included in the tree based on the completeness of the genomes. D614G substitution is a missense mutation (Aspartic acid (D) to Glycine (G) substitution), which predominantly emerged as a clade in Europe that eventually spread globally 15, 16 . D614G substitution was one of eight missense mutations occurring in the S protein, and suggested to be relatively conserved, with potential effects on S protein interactions and functions 17 . The biological and clinical relevance of this mutation is linked to the type of amino acid and subsequent protein changes that arise. Studies using (in silico) structural bioinformatics to assess the effect of D614G mutation on SARS-CoV-2 virulence and epidemiology suggests that this mutation may be neutral to protein function 16 showed cross neutralization re-activities thus indicating that the locus might not be within the epitope recognized by the host immune system and therefore not critical for humoral mediated immunity. As the D614G mutation does not prevent cross re-activities of antibodies generated against the variants, it is therefore very unlikely to interfere with the efficacy of any vaccine that will be eventually formulated. Therefore, we are of the courteous optimism that whichever vaccine that is finally approved will be beneficial to the African continent as the observed amino acid substitution is common to majority of the virus circulating in the different regions of the world apart from those from Wuhan, China.\nThe Genomes of viruses undergo evolution over time 24 . Our results showed that sequences originating from African countries clustered with each other, but overall African sequences did not form a monophyletic cluster. This lack of a monophyletic cluster may be because the analyzed sequences from the different African country were introduced from other countries.\nThe fact that the genomes formed clades shows and suggests that at this time, there has been divergence of the SARS-CoV-2 from the continent to form new clades. This suggests that there may be multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the Africa continent. Further prospective studies are needed to monitor the evolution of the virus overtime both within the continent and globally.\nAs with all studies, this study has strengths and weaknesses. This study's main strength is widespread the target African countries, cutting across all African continent (East, west, north, south and central). Secondly, this study focusses on a previously unstudied part of the world, as other studies have excluded analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Africa. Finally, this study draws on available real-time data that continues to evolve and is a reasonable representation of the landscape at this time. On the other hand, the limitations include the low number of complete genomes sequenced and deposited as at that time. Research labs within the African continent seemed to be slow in gathering sequencing data in the initial months of the outbreak in Africa, which resulted in a relatively small number of complete genomes.\nAdditionally, we cannot control for errors, lab-specific bias, handling bias, and sample collection bias because we are working with existing data collected by multiple labs. These limitations reduce the power of our results and inference. Finally, the findings in this study need to be validated using wet lab-based experiments."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown genomic variability across countries in\nAfrica, but most of the mutations that resulted in this variability align with those described in other countries of the world, including the index case in China. However, because these clades/strains are shown to predominantly cluster with strains from other continents, therapeutics (vaccines and drugs) designed based on SARS-CoV-2 strains in these continents could potentially be useful in Africa. However, the finding of novel mutations, though on a limited scale, may perhaps have implications on the manifestation, progression, severity and mortality of the infection with the virus. Our findings also call for region-specific testing of potential vaccines to ensure vaccines' efficacy developed in other settings when used in Africa."}]
