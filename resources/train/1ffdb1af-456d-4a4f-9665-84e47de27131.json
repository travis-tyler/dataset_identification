Advanced degrees open doors to expanded career opportunities and offer monetary and nonmonetary benefits to individuals and society. 1 Although on average, advanced degrees are valuable in the labor market, students pursuing a graduate or professional degree face considerable uncertainty. Research doctoral and professional degree recipients have lower unemployment rates and higher average earnings than those with master's degrees, and there is wide variation in outcomes, even among students who complete the same type of degree.

Examining these outcomes across degree, occupational and demographic categories paints a nuanced picture of the payoffs of graduate and professional education. This information is critical for prospective students and others seeking to assess the value of these degree programs. educational institutions; half of adults with research doctoral degrees are at educational institutions.

Median earnings for adults ages 25 to 64 with professional degrees are almost twice as high as earnings for those with bachelor's degrees. Master's degrees do not lead to the same earnings as other advanced degrees, but in 2015, median earnings for master's degree recipients were $66,000, compared with $52,390 for bachelor's degree recipients ( Figure 3). There is a wide range of earnings among adults with the same level of educational attainment. In 2015, 46 percent of adults ages 25 and older with professional degrees and 40 percent of those with research doctoral degrees earned $100,000 or more. Twenty-two percent of master's degree recipients and 16 percent of adults whose highest degree was a bachelor's degree earned this much. At the other end of the distribution, 15 percent of professional degree and research doctoral degree recipients earned less than $25,000. Twenty-three percent of master's degree recipients and 29 percent of bachelor's degree recipients were in this category (Figure 4)."}, {"section_title": "Employment and Earnings by Type of Advanced Degree Unemployment", "text": "Unemployment rates are cyclical for all groups, rising and falling with the overall economy. But the unemployment rate for bachelor's degree recipients is consistently about half as high as the unemployment rate for high school graduates, and advanced degree recipients fare even better than four-year college graduates. Unemployment rates for research doctoral and professional degree recipients are about half the rate for bachelor's degree recipients. In 2010, at the peak of the recent recession, the unemployment rate for master's degree recipients was 4.1 percent, compared with 5.4 percent for bachelor's degree recipients and 2.4 percent for professional degree recipients. The unemployment rate for research doctoral degree recipients peaked at 2.5 percent in 2011.

About half of the class of 2014 reported starting salaries between $40,000 and $65,000, and about 20 percent of graduates reported salaries of $160,000 or higher. 4 For the class of 2016, some firms in major markets had raised their starting salaries to $180,000, but the median for all law firms was $104,000. The overall national median starting salary for the 2016 cohort was $65,000, with medians of $59,000 for government jobs, $55,000 for judicial clerkships, and $48,500 for public interest positions. 5 Earnings variations persist when measured among practicing lawyers at all stages of their careers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual wage for lawyers in 2016 was $139,880.

Some of the variation is based on the industries in which lawyers are employed. For example, in 2016, average earnings in the air transportation industry were $214,630, but for lawyers employed in state government, the average was $93,320. Earnings also vary widely by state.

Even within one area of specialization, there may be wide variation in earnings. Figure 7 illustrates this for two medical specialties: family and general practice and obstetrics and gynecology. In both fields, physicians employed by educational institutions earn less than those working in hospitals and doctors' offices, and those in laboratories have even higher earnings. Professional degrees typically yield relatively high earnings, but this generalization is not sufficient for students making decisions about courses of study and career directions. Earnings vary considerably by field Meanwhile, more students are moving to postdoctoral study after completing their degrees, with the largest increase from 17 percent in 1999 to 25 percent in 2014 among social scientists.

Among all racial and ethnic groups,  women's median earnings were 70 to 75 percent of the earnings of their male counterparts. Understanding the causes of these disparities requires more analysis, but they are likely attributable to a combination of fields of study, types of employment, geography and labor market discrimination.\nEarnings among master's degree recipients vary by race, ethnicity and gender. In 2015, median earnings ranged from $51,240 for black women with master's degrees to $90,650 for Asian men. At least a portion of this variation is a function of occupational differences. The gender gaps among black and Hispanic master's degree recipients are smaller than those among whites and Asians. In 2015, median earnings for white and Asian women were about 70 percent of the median earnings for their male counterparts. In contrast, the median earnings of black and Hispanic women with master's degrees were about 85 percent of the median earnings for black and Hispanic men with the same level of education. Among both men and women, median earnings for master's degree recipients vary across racial and ethnic groups. In 2015, median earnings for Asians were higher than earnings for whites, and men earned more than women.

Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned a master's degree within 10 years of graduating from college, 30 percent had degrees in business and management. More than one-third of these degree recipients earned $75,000 or more in 2003. But among the 15 percent whose master's degrees were in education, only 8 percent had earnings this high, and 23 percent earned less than $25,000 ( Figure 12). 7 Figure 12 reports the earnings distribution of 1992-93 college graduates who had earned a master's degree within 10 years of finishing college. 7 NCES (1993/03), Baccalaureate and Beyond, PowerStats. Some of the variation may be due to the timing of degree completion and years of work experience. But earnings data for those who earned master's degrees in the same year also show considerable variation by field. National Science Foundation data report 2015 median earnings of adults who earned master's degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields between 2010 and 2013. As the low earnings for adults with master's degrees in the life and physical sciences demonstrate, not all STEM degrees generate earnings higher than non-STEM degrees.

People who earn master's, research doctoral and professional degrees have lower unemployment rates and higher average earnings than those who end their education with a bachelor's degree. But there is considerable variation across and within degree types. Research doctoral and professional degree recipients have lower unemployment rates and higher earnings than master's degree recipients. And field of study, area of specialization and occupation are correlated with outcomes within each type of degree. Demographic differences are also stark. Further research may shed light on how much the variation is associated with choice of field and the extent to which there are differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity and gender within fields of study and occupations. Graduate and professional programs require a large investment of time, money and effort. Students making these choices should have reliable information about their prospects. Graduate and professional degree programs are, by and large, preparation for specific occupations. Students should have a strong sense of the likely outcomes. It is not enough just to know that advanced degrees generally yield significant economic benefits. The data in this brief make it clear that, overall, master's degrees do not lead to the same financial outcomes as professional and research doctoral degrees. Master's degrees in business and management and in computer science and engineering yield high average earnings, but the same is not true for all fields of study. The share of the population whose highest degree was a master's degree grew from 6 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2016. The share with professional or research doctoral degrees increased from 2.6 percent to 3.3 percent over these years. 8 Many graduate and professional degrees are valuable investments that transform the lives of those who earn them, but the variation in outcomes indicates the need for caution in making generalizations about the value of advanced degrees."}]
