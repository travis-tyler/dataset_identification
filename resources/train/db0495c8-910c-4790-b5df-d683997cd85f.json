"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The value of parental participation in children's schooling has long been recognized by educators and researchers alike. However, identifying the specific parental behaviors that directly or indirectly benefit children's education is problematic. \"Parental involvement,\" as defined by researchers, encompasses a multitude of activities, ranging from discussions with the student about school experiences to parents' direct involvement with teachers and schools. In addition, the interaction of key family background characteristics, notably socioeconomic status (SES), must be taken into consideration when examining the impact of parental involvement on student behavior and cognitive outcomes. Despite the analytic complexities and varying definitions of parental involvement, research strongly supports its positive effect on student achievement.1 This influence has especially been demonstrated in studies concerning younger children.2 Some researchers argue that parental involvement can be a powerful mitigator of the effects of low-socioeconomic status.3 Furthermore, at a time when the American public school education system is under intense scrutiny for its inability to provide equitable programs to poorer and working-class youths, a better understanding of the effects of parental involvement could aid schools in developing programs to enhance such involvement.4 Successful intervention, however, depends on a more precise understanding of those family experiences that may ameliorate learning problems and foster achievement. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) provides a unique opportunity to study family influences on a nationally representative sample of eighth-grade students. NELS:88 is the most recent in a series of longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Previous surveys include the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) and High School and Beyond (HS&B), in which parents were surveyed for only a subset of the sample. On the other hand, NELS:88 included parental-reported information for most students (93 percent) in the sample. Thus, for the first time, we have extensive information about the home life and family experiences for most surveyed students. This information is especially important for eighth graders who are experiencing the pivotal transition between elementary and secondary school and are beginning a new phase in formulating educational experiences that will determine postsecondary education options and, ultimately, career choices."}, {"section_title": "Goals of the Study", "text": "The goals of this study are twofold. First, it will provide a profile of the characteristics of the eighth graders' families, focusing on the sociodemographic  Education, 1984), ED 247 032. 3R.

Second, the study will provide a closer look at the influences that specific types of parental involvement have on academic achievement and on whether or not American eighth graders drop out of school between the 8th and 10th grades. In this report the following questions are addressed: What are the home and family characteristics of American eighth graders? How do parents participate in their eighth grader's education, both at home and at school? Specifically, what percentage of parents: Regularly talk to their child about school experiences, high school plans, or educational aspirations after high school? Regulate television watching? Institute rules regarding homework or maintaining a certain grade-point average? Help their child with homework? Contact the school about their child's academic program or performance? Participate in school-related groups such as the PTA? How do family background characteristics such as socioeconomic status, race ethnicity, family composition (e.g., two-parent versus one-parent families), and parents' educational attainment relate to parental involvement? How does the type of school (e.g., public versus private) the eighth grader attends relate to the level (or types) of parental involvement? How do parents feel about their eighth grader's school (e.g., do they think their child is challenged and that they have an adequate say in school policy)? What expectations do parents have for their eighth grader's future education? How does parental involvement relate to student achievement or whether or not students drop out of school between the 8th and 10th grades? Many comparisons among various groups of parents were possible in this analysis. Rather than discuss all possible comparisons, general trends or patterns are highlighted and illustrative examples are given. However, whenever these patterns are noted, the proper statistic& tests to verify the pattern was performed. For all comparisons cited in the text, a Student's t-test was used to test the difference. In cases where multiple comparisons were 15 made, the critical value at which significance is found (p < 0.05) is adjusted for the number of comparisons possible within a family (Bonferonni adjustment).5 Limitations of the Study NELS:88 is a nationally representative sample of approximately 25,000 1988 eighth graders. The parent component of NELS:88, however, is not a representative sample of eighth graders' parents. Their inclusion in the sample is linked directly to the student participants. Thus, when parent-reported data are presented in this study, they are referenced to the eighth graders (for example, \"The percentage of 1988 eighth graders whose parents report...\"). Parents were surveyed for approximately 93 percent of the students.6 The majority of parents who responded were mothers (approximately 85 percent). Therefore, when the results cited in this study refer to parental involvement, with the exception of responses by single fathers, readers should bear in mind that these results primarily reflect the mother's perception of involvement. Most questions, however, were framed in the context of both parents' involvement. For example, in asking how often parents discuss school experiences the following question was posed: \"How often do you or your spouse/partner talk with your eighth grader about his or her experiences in school?\" In this analysis, the findings presented combine public and private school data, with the exception of obit 1.1 and all findings presented in Chapter 4, where individual school type differences are presented. Parents are often divided into racialethnic and sociodemographic subgroups for comparison purposes. Samples for some of these subgroups, such as single fathers, American Indians, minorities in the highest socioeconomic quartile, and students who have dropped out of school, are small. Therefore, differences among these sub-groups, even those that appear to be large, are often not statistically significant. Finally, it should be remembered that this report is descriptive in nature and that the results presented are from cross-sectional data. Therefore, while associations between parent involvement and student outcomes are noted, these findings are not meant to imply causality. 5Y. Hoschberg and A.C. Tamhane, Multiple Comparison Procedures, (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1987). 6For a discussion of the 7 percent of the students whose parents did not respond to the survey, see the report: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Characteristics of At Risk Students in NELS:88, 1992, (Washington D.C.)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 1", "text": "The Families of Eighth Graders Most 1988 eighth graders lived with both natural parents (65 percent) or with one natural and one stepparent (12 percent lived with their natural mother and stepfather or guardian and 3 percent lived with their natural father and stepmother or guardian).

Less than 2 percent of eighth graders lived in twoparent families where neither parent was the child's natural parent.  Both parents of approximately 8 percent of 1988 eighth graders' were born outside the United States, while in an additional 5 percent of cases one parent was born in a foreign country (table 1.1).

In addition to these questions, parents were asked about their involvement with their child's school, such as whether or not they were PTA members and the frequency with which they attended such meetings. Parents were also asked about their specific beliefs regarding school standards and whether or not their child felt challenged and was working hard. Parent's responses varied among different groups. The following sections describe in detail the different ways in which parents reported participating in their eighth grader's education."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Parental Involvement Measures", "text": "It is important to keep in mind that the groups of parents who were surveyed may have had different motivations for the kinds of participation measured in this survey. The direction of cause and effect (that is, whether parent's participation influences their child's performance or vice-versa) cannot be determined. Low involvement does not necessarily mean lack of interest in their child's education. Some parents may monitor their eighth grader's school-related activities less than they did previously because their child learned good study habits early and is doing well now. Consequently, the parents may not feel it necessary to take such an active role in their schooling. Other parents may indirectly influence their child's education by creating a stimulating learning environment that is not directly related to their formal schooling. Still other parents whose children are not performing well in school may take an active role in their eighth grader's education to intervene and prevent them from failing or even dropping out of school. Cross-cultural differences may also be apparent when surveying parents of different racialethnic groups. For example, in this study it appeared that Asian parents were less involved than parents of other racialethnic groups. However, often among Asian cultures, parental expectations for their child's academic success are high, but their involvement may not be directly measurable in a survey such as NELS: 88. For example, in Japan, when children begin school, the role of the mother is extremely important to make sure their child is well prepared for school. They are expected to prepare elaborate lunches and make sure their children are equipped for every activity in the school day.11 However, the presence of mothers in the school is actively discouraged since home and school life are considered quite separate and different.12 All of these factors may be operating in this study, therefore it is important to consider them when interpreting the results of this anlysis. 11L.

There were four possible responses to these questions: not at all, rarely, occasionally, or regularly."}, {"section_title": "School Experiences", "text": "The precise nature of the discussions about current school experiences cannot be determined by the survey questions. However, one can imagine these questions ranging from informal chats about the day's activities to more serious discussions about grades, behavior, or problems with classmates or teachers. Most parents (79 percent) reported that they regularly discussed school experiences with their eighth grader. However, the proportion of parents reporting such discussions increased with socioeconomic status.13 About 89 percent of high-SES parents reported regularly discussing school experiences, compared with 81 percent of middle-SES parents, and 66 percent of low-SES parents (figure 2.1). 13Socioeconomic status is a composite measure of parents' education, occupations, and income (see appendix A for more detailed description). Parents from different racial --ethnic groups reported regularly discussing school experiences with their eighth grader at different rates.14 For all levels of socioeconomic status, parents of Asian children were less like' ' than parents of other racialethnic groups to report such discussions. For example, 65 liercent of middle-SES parents of Asian children regularly discussed school experiences, compared with 78 percent of middle-SES parents of black children and 82 percent of middle-SES parents of white children ( When SES was taken into consideration, there were few differences between singlemother and two-parent families concerning discussions about current school experiences.16 About 67 percent of both low-SES single-mother families and low-SES two-parent families reported regularly discussing school experiences. Similarly, 79 percent and 83 percent of middle-SES single-mother and two-parent families, respectively, regularly discussed school experiences. However, among middle-SES families, two-parent families and single-mother families were more likely than single father families to report regular discussions about 14The sample of Native American students in NELS:88 is very small and those students from Bureau of Indian Affairs schools were not included. Therefore, even when differences between Native Americans and other racial-ethnic groups appear large, they are rarely statistically significant. All differences discussed here are among black, Hispanic, Asian, and white students. 15See table 2.2 for percentages of low-and high-SES levels. 16Comparisons made here are between single mothers and two-parent families where both parents are the natural parents of the child (about 80 percent of all two-parent families).  In both single-parent and two-parent families, parents with higher educational attainment tended to report regularly discussing school experiences more than did those parents with lower attainment. Among single parents, 61 percent of single mothers and 49 percent of single fathers who did not graduate from high school reported regular discussions, compared with 84 percent of single mothers and 81 percent of single fathers who graduated from college (table 2.1). Similarly, 60 percent of two-parent families where neither parent graduated from high school reported such discussions, compared with 90 percent of two-parent families where both parents graduated from college. Such differences were also found between parents with less than a high school education and those who graduated from high school.18"}, {"section_title": "Future Education Plans", "text": "Whether or not parents regularly discuss future education plans with their eighth grader may have a different meaning for different parents. For example, well educated parents with the resources to send their eighth grader on to higher education may take it for granted that their child will complete high school and attend college. Therefore, regular discussions about future education may not occur at such an early age. Less advantaged parents, on the other hand, may not be so assured about their child's future education and, thus, may feel the need to discuss it on a more regular basis. 17While there appears to be large differences between low-SES single fathers and single mothers or twoparent families, the sample is too small to find statistical significance. 18The exception was for single fathers, whose sample size was too small to find significance. Slightly less than one-half (47 percent) of the parents surveyed reported regularly discussing high school plans with their eighth grader, and a little more than one-third (38 percent) reported regularly discussing postsecondary education plans (see table 2.2). The percentage of parents who reported regularly discussing future education plans increased with SES, although the differences were not as great as those seen for discussions about school experiences (figure 2.4). Approximately 43 percent of low-SES parents reported regularly discussing high school plans, compared with 53 percent of high-SES parents. Likewise, 34 percent of low-SES parents reported regularly discussing postsecondary Single mothers who headed low-SES families were somewhat more likely than low-SES two-parent families (where both are the natural parents) to report regularly discussing high school education plans (table 2.2): 47 percent of low-SES single mothers, compared with 41 percent of low-SES two-parent families discussed high school education plans. Across all levels of SES, parents of black children and parents of Hispanic children were more likely to report regularly discussing future education plans than parents of white children. For example, among low-SES parents, 53 percent of the parents of black children reported regularly discussing high school plans, compared with 37 percent of the parents of white children who reported the same. Similarly, among high-SES parents 64 percent of Hispanic parents reported regularly discussing high school plans, compared with 51 of white parents who reported the same. '1 'ae same pattern was apparent for discussions concerning education plans after high school. Parents who were college graduates reported regularly discussing postsecondary education plans more than parents with less than a high school education (table 2.3).19 Among two-parent families, 30 percent of those where neither parent graduated from high school reported discussing postsecondary education plans, compared with 41 percent where both parents graduated from college. Among single-mother families, 35 percent who did not graduate from high school regularly discussed postsecondary education plans compared with 45 percent who graduated from college. Among two-parent families, similar differences were found between less-than-high-school educated and college educated parents regarding discussions about high school plans. 19Difference for single fathers is not statistically significant.  Parents were asked a number of questions regarding home rules related to school work and general discipline. For example, they were asked whether or not they enforce rules about doing homework, how they monitor television viewing, and whether or not they require their child to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA). The overwhelming majority of parents (92 percent) reported that they set rules about doing homework. Since nearly all parents reported such rules, there was little variation among parents with different characteristics. However, parents did differ in regard to television monitoring and requiring a minimum GPA ."}, {"section_title": "Television Viewing", "text": "There were several ways in which parents were asked about how they limited their eighth grader's television viewing: they were asked whether or not they limited the number of hours their child watched on a school night, whether or not they limited early-or latehour watching, and whether or not they monitored the kinds of shows watched. A majority of parents reported monitoring each of these three aspects of television watching: 62 \"scent reported limiting the number of hours watched, 69 percent monitored the kinds of watched, and 84 percent limited early-and late-hour watching by their eighth grader (table 2.4). Monitoring the kinds of programs watched and restricting early and late viewing was more prevalent for middle-and high-SES families than for low-SES families (figure 2.5). About 60 percent of low-SES parents reported monitoring the kinds of shows watched, compared with 71 percent of middle-SES parents and 73 percent of high-SES parents. Similarly, 78 percent of low-SES parents limited early/late viewing, compared with about 86 percent of both middle-and high-SES parents. No differences were apparent, however, between middle-and high-SES parents for these activities.Whether or not parents limited the number of hours of TV watching, on the other hand, exhibited a different pattern where low-SES parents were a little more likely to limit the number of hours watched (64 percent) than middle-SES parents (61 percent). No differences between either low-and high-SES or between middle-and high-SES parents, however, were found. A similar relationship was found between parents' education level and how they monitored their child's television watching. That is, parents who were high school dropouts were less likely to monitor kinds of TV viewing than high school graduates, but high school graduates were just as likely as college graduates to do so (table 2.4). This was true for both two-parent and single-mother families. Parents' employment status was also related to whetheror not television viewing was monitored though to a lesser extent than SES. Parents in two-parent families where only the father was employed were more likely to report monitoring the kinds of television shows watched (74 percent) than those in two-parent families where only the mother was employed or where both parents were unemployed (66 percent and 63 percent, respectively). Unemployed single mothers were more likely to report limiting the number of hours their eighth grader watched television (67 percent) than employed single mothers (61 percent).   Maintaining a Minimum Grade-Point Average Approximately two-thirds (73 percent) of all parents surveyed indicated that they set rules requiring their eighth grader to maintain a minimum grade-point average (GPA). Low-and middle-SES parents were equally likely to require their child to maintain a certain GPA (about 75 percent), and both these groups were more likely to report doing so than high-SES (67 percent) parents (figure 2.6). In both two-parent and single-mother families, parents who were college graduates were less likely to set rules requiring a minimum GPA than those who had a high school education or less (figures 2.7 and 2.8). For example, 76 percent of two-parent families in which both parents were high school graduates reported that they required a minimum GPA, compared with only 61 percent of families in which both parents were college graduates. Across all levels of socioeconomic status, parents of black children were more likely to set rules requiring their eighth grader to maintain a minimum GPA than parents of white children. For example, 84 percent of middle-SES parents of black children required a minimum GPA, compared with 73 percent of parents of white children (table 2.6). Another way in which parents may show support for their child's efforts in school is by helping with their homework. Not only can they provide help in subject areas in which their child is having difficulty, they are showing that they value their child's work. It is important to remember, however, that not all children require help with their homework in the eighth grade. Children who established good study habits when they were younger and who may have had significant help from their parents at an early age, may require minimal help by the time they reach the eighth grade. Moreover, not all parents are capable of helping with their eighth grader's homework. Those parents who have difficulty with the English language or who are not highly educated themselves may not be able to offer help with their child's homework at the eighth-grade level. These parents may, however, provide indirect support such as encouraging their child to do homework and providing a good environment in which to do so. Finally, not all parents may think it is appropriate to help with their eighth graders homework. These parents may feel that by the eighth grade, their child should be completing homework assignments on his or her own. Thus, they may help with homework only if directly asked by a child who is having difficulty with a specific assignment. Nearly one-third (29 percent) of all parents surveyed in NELS:88 reported that they never or only seldom helped their eighth grader with homework (table 2.7).20 A similar proportion of parents reported that they helped once or twice a month (28 percent), while 32 percent said that they helped with their eighth grader's homework once or twice a week. Only 11 percent indicated that they helped almost every day. The percentage of parents reporting never or seldom helping with their eighth grader's homework declined as their level of education increased.21 In both two-parent and single-mother families, those who had not completed high school were nearly twice as likely to report seldom or never helping with their eighth grader's homework than parents who were college graduates (48 percent of two-parent families where neither parent completed high school compared with 21 percent in families where both parents were college graduates; and 50 percent of single mothers who did not complete high school compared with 28 percent who graduated from college). Even parents in two-parent families where only one parent had completed high school were more likely to help with homework than parents in families where neither had completed high school. As the socioeconomic status of the parents increased, the percentage of parents who never or seldom helped with homework declined, especially between low and middle levels. About 42 percent of low-SES parents reported rarely or never helping with their eighth grader's homework, compared with only 28 percent of middle-SES parents and 22 percent of high-SES parents. The employment status of parents was also related to whether or not they reported seldom or never helping with their eighth grader's homework. Among two-parent families, those in which neither parent was employed were more likely to report seldom or never helping with homework (41 percent) than families where only the father was employed (28 percent), only the mother was employed (31 percent), or when both parents were employed (26 percent). Unemployed single mothers were also more likely to report seldom or never helping with homework (40 percent) than employed single mothers (35 percent). The difference between employed and unemployed single fathers was not statistically significant. \"It should be noted that the respondent parent was asked \"How often do you or your spouse/partner help your eighth grader with his or her homework?\" They were not given the option of reporting that their eighth grader had no homework. 211n two-parent families, there was no difference between those cases where both parents graduated from college or those where only one parent graduated from college. In both low-and middle-SES families, parents of Asian children and parents of Hispanic children were more likely to report never or seldom helping with their eighth grader's homework than parents of either black children or white children (table 2.8). The differences among these groups, however, were not statistically significant for high-SES parents. For those parents who reported helping their eighth grader \"almost every day,\" low-SES parents of black children were more likely to report doing so than parents of children in all other racial-ethnic groups.22 Among middle-SES parents, parents of black children were more likely to report helping every day than parents of either white or Hispanic children. 22The same appears true for high-SES parents, but the sample for black parents is too small to find statistical significance."}, {"section_title": "PTA Participation and School Volunteerism", "text": "The PTA has long served as a means of communication between parents and the school administration. Through this forum parents have been able to voice concerns about school policy and the quality of education that their child's school offers. Thus, involvement in the PTA may serve as an indication that parents are willing to actively Nrticipate in maintaining or changing the school environment. In this survey, parents were asked whether or not they were PTA members, attended PTA meetings, or were school volunteers.23 Approximately one-third (32 percent) of all parents surveyed reported being PTA members. A slightly higher proportion (36 percent) of all parents indicated that they attended PTA meetings, and approximately one-fifth (19 percent) of all parents reported that they had volunteered in the school (see table 2.9). Membership rates in the PTA rose sharply with socioeconomic status. Only 12 percent of low-SES parents reported being members, compared with 30 percept of middle-SES parents, and more than one-half (54 percent) of high-SES parents (figure 2.9). Whether or not parents attended PTA meetings or volunteered in the school showed similar, though less marked, relationships with SES. 23Parents were also asked if they participated in PTA \"activities.\" These results were very similar to those observed for attending PTA meetings, so they are not presented here. Given the relationship between socioeconomic status and PTA membership, it was not surprising that parents' membership in the PTA increased with their education level (table 2.9).24 Nearly twice as many single mothers who were college graduates (47 percent) belonged to the PTA as did single mothers who were high school graduates (25 percent); and more than four times as many who were college graduates belonged as those who did not complete high school (10 percent). Single fathers who were college graduates were also more likely to be PTA members than those with lower levels of education. Similar patterns were found for two-parent families. PTA meeting attendance and whether or not parents volunteered in the school were also related to parental education, though to a lesser extent than PTA membership. Parents of black children reported being members of the PTA and attending PTA meetings in greater proportions than parents of white children in both middle and high levels of SES (figure 2.10). Among low-SES families, parents of white children were less likely to report attending PTA meetings (22 percent) than parents of Hispanic or Asian children (38 percent and 34 percent, respectively). On the other hand, rniddle-SES parents of white children were more likely to report volunteering in the school (19 percent) than parents of black or Asian children (14 percent and 12 percent, respectively).  Parents were asked how frequently they contacted the school regarding their eighth grader's academic performance or program. Contact with the school, however, is an interactive process and whether or not the parents were responding to contact initiated by the school or initiating their own contact cannot be distinguished. In the following presentation, any contact the parents reported making to the school is labeled parentinitiated contact. Overall, about one-half (53 percent) of the parents surveyed indicated they had ever contacted the school about their child's academic performance, and a little more than onethird (35 percent) had contacted the school about their eighth grader's academic program (table 2.10). Whether or not parents had any contact with the school increased with SES and their level of education.25 Among low-SES parents, 38 percent reported contacting the school regarding their child's academic performance, and 24 percent reported contacting the school about their child's academic program. In contrast, 62 percent and 44 percent, respectively, of high-SES parents reported contacting the school about their child's academic performance or program. Similarly, parents who were college graduates reported contacting the school in greater proportions than parents who either had not completed high school or who were high school graduates. For example, in two-parent families where both graduated from college, 62 percent contacted the school about their child's academic performance, compared with only 32 percent of two-parent families where neither parent completed high school.26 For middle-SES families, there was little difference between single-parent and twoparent families in relation to their contacting the school (table 2.11). However, a greater percentage of single mothers from either low-SES (43 percent) or high-SES families (69 percent) tended to contact the school about their child's academic performance than twoparent families with both natural parents (37 percent of low-SES and 61 percent of high-SES two-parent families contacted the school about their child's academic performance). 250ne exception to this was in two-parent families where the difference between one of both parents graduating from college was not statistically different. 26The differences for single fathers were not statistically significant. In examining racialethnic group differences regarding parent-initiated contact, parents of Asian children were generally less likely to report contacting the school than parents of other racialethnic groups.27 Among middle-SES families, for example, about 41 percent reported contacting the school about their eighth grader's academic performance, compared with approximately 55 percent of parents from other racialethnic groups (table 2.12). A similar pattern was found concerning contact about academic programs. 27The exception is among low-SES parents, where parents of Asian children were not statistically different from other parents in regard to whether or not they contacted the school about their child's academic program. Parents' and Children's Views on the Level of Parental Involvement NELS:88 eighth graders were also asked about the level of their parents' participation in their schooling. Even though these questions were not worded in exactly the same way, it is possible to estimate the relative agreement or disagreement between the eighth graders and their parents.28 Table 2.13 illustrates these comparisons. Overall, given the difference in the way the questions were asked and the possible responses, there was relative agreement between parents and students, with the possible exception of television restrictions and discussions about school activities. Parents were asked about the several kinds of television restrictions they enforced, including program monitoring, the number of hours watched on a given school night, and early/late viewing. The only possible responses were \"yes\" or \"no.\" On the other hand, students were asked only one questionwhether or not their parents limited television viewingand were given four possible responses, ranging from \"never\" to \"often.\" As shown in table 2.13, more than one-third of the students (37 percent) indicated that their parents never restricted their television viewing, whereas 84 percent of the parents indicated they restricted early/late viewing. How much of the discrepancy was due to actual differences and how much was due to the interpretation of the questions is difficult to determine. Similarly, less than 60 percent of the students reported having three or more discussions about school activities during the school year with their parents, compared with almost 80 percent of the parents who said they regularly discussed school experiences with their eighth grader. Again, how a parent interprets \"school experience\" or a student interprets \"school activities\" is hard to ascertain. For instance, every day after school, a parent may ask their child how their day went. Even if the child responds, \"fine,\" this may be viewed as regularly discussing \"school experiences,\" whereas a student may view a discussion about school activities as more formal or involved.  After-School Supervision According to NELS:88 parents, a majority of eighth graders had some sort of supervision after school.29 More than three-quarters of parents (78 percent) reported that their eighth grader usually went home after school. About 13 percent participated in afterschool programs or sports activities; 7 percent went to the home of a relative, friend, or neighbor; and 2 percent went elsewhere (table 2.14). A separate question was asked of the parents regarding who was \"usually\" present in the home when their eighth grader returned from school. Approximately 64 percent of the parents indicated a parent was home, while 10 percent indicated no one was at home. 29The parents were asked, \"Where does your eighth grader usually go after school?\" No time reference is given so that it is not clear whether or not parents mean directly after school or sometime after school. Eighth graders from low-socioeconomic families were more likely to go to the home of a neighbor, friend, or relative after school (11 percent) than those from highsocioeconomic families (4 percent). On the other hand, children from high-SES families were more likely to participate in after-school activities, including sports (19 percent), than those from low-SES backgrounds (8 percent). A parent was \"usually\" at home when their eighth grader returned from school more often in low-SES families (73 percent) than in high-SES families (62 percent). Similarly, no one was at home more frequently in high-SES families (11 percent) than in low-SES families (7 percent). Chapter 3"}, {"section_title": "Parents' Expectations and Beliefs", "text": "In the NELS:88 survey, parents were asked how far they expected their eighth grader to go in school and about the adequacy of their child's current schooling. For example, they were asked how strongly they agreed with statements such as \"the homework assigned is worthwhile,\" \"my eighth grader is challenged at school,\" \"my eighth grader enjoys school,\" and so on. This chapter examines these expectations and beliefs and suggests that, at this stage in their child's education, parents have relatively high expectations and are quite positive about the adequacy of their eighth grader's schooling. Overall, the higher the level of parents' education, the further they expected their eighth grader to go in school. Even among parents who had not graduated from high school, a majority expected their eighth grader to have at least some sort of postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Parents' Expectations about Their Eighth Grader's Future Education", "text": "A majority of parents expected their eighth grader to attend college (figure 3.1). More than one-third (38 percent) expected their child to graduate from college, while one in five expected their eighth grader to earn an advanced degree. Less than 1 percent of all parents expected their child to drop out of school before high school graduation, while 13 percent expected that a high school diploma would be their child's highest attainment. An additional 9 percent of parents expected their eighth grader to receive some kind of vocational training after high school.  Among two-parent families, parents who had not graduated from high school were more likely to expect the same of their eighth grader than parents who had attained a higher level of education. In cases where neither parent graduated from high school, 2 percent expected their eighth grader not to graduate, compared with 0.3 percent where both parents were high school graduates. A similar pattern was found between single mothers who had not graduated from high school (1.7 percent) and those who had graduated from college (0.2 percent). Across all levels of socioeconomic status, parents of Asian children expected their child to earn an advanced degree at higher rates than parents of white children (table 3.2). For example, 25 percent of low-SES parents of Asian children expected their eighth grader to earn an advanced degree, compared with only 7 percent of parents of white children. Among low-and middle-SES families, parents of other minority children also expected their eighth grader to earn an advanced degree more often than parents of white children, though to a lesser extent than Asians. Among middle-SES parents of Hispanic and black children, 26 percent and 27 percent, respectively, expected their eighth graders to earn an advanced degree, compared with 13 percent of their white counterparts. Similarly, among low-SES families 15 percent of parents of either Hispanic or black children expected an advanced degree, compared with 7 percent of white parents. Past surveys indicate that about 10 percent of black and Hispanic high school seniors will earn, at the most, a bachelor's degree (compared with 27 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of Asian and white students).30 Given these historical trends, it shows the great value that parents of minority children place on high educational attainment, and that at this point in their child's education, parents still have high expectations for their future attainment."}, {"section_title": "Parents' Beliefs about Their Eighth Grader's Schooling", "text": "Parents were asked to respond to a number of statements regarding their beliefs and attitudes about their eighth grader's school. Among these beliefs were whether or not the homework assigned was worthwhile, whether their child worked hard and enjoyed school, and how well parents worked together.  Almost all parents felt that the homework their eighth grader was assigned was worthwhile (91 percent) and a majority (78 percent) felt that their child was challenged in school (table 3.3). Most parents also felt that their child was working hard (74 percent) and enjoyed school (82 percent). With the exception of schaol enjoyment, these perceptions did not vary much by SES. However, high-SES parents (87 percent) were more likely than low-SES parents (78 percent) to report that their child enjoyed school. Parents of white children (73 percent) were less likely than parents of Asian children (84 percent) to report that their child was working hard. Parents of white children were also less likely than others to state that their child enjoyed school. This was especially true among low-SES parents, where 86 percent, 84 percent, and 85 percent, respectively, of parents of Asian, Hispanic, and black children reported that their eighth grader enjoyed school, compared with only 72 percent of their white counterparts. Whether or not the parents believed that they worked well together for the school increased modestly with SES. High-SES parents (78 percent) were more likely than either middle-or low-SES parents (72 percent and 74 percent, respectively) to believe that parents worked well together for the school. On the hand, low-SES and high-SES parents were equally likely (65 percent) to report that they had an adequate say in school policy, and both these groups were more likely than middle-SES parents to report this belief (60 percent). Parents of Asian children tended to believe that parents had an adequate say in policy more than parents of Hispanic, black, or white children. This pattern was true for both high-and middle-level SES, but not for lr ,v-SES families. Chapter 4"}, {"section_title": "56", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "School Type and Parental Involvement", "text": "Parents whose children attend different types of schools (i.e., those who attend public schools compared with those who attend private schools) may often have different levels of involvement with the school. This involvement may be influenced by several factors. For instance, it is often mandatory for parents to participate in school-related activities in private schools. Even schools within the public sector can differ markedly in their demands on parents. In addition, socioeconomic status is highly associated with whether or not an eighth grader attends a public or private school. Public schools generally serve higher proportions of low-SES and minority students.31 Therefore, differences found among the types of schools may not only reflect schooling, but may substantially reflect differences in the students who attend the schools. Only about 5 percent of 1988 eighth graders attended other religious or nonreligious private schools (see chapter 1). The small number of these types of private school students included in the NELS:88 sample makes it difficult to analyze parental involvement measures by school type for each level of socioeconomic status. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind the influence of factors other than the schools themselves, notably SES, when examining differences in parental involvement among the various types of schools. In order to examine the influence that different types of schools may have on parental involvement, three school attributes were identified: school type; school environment, and how often schools initiate contact with parents.32 The NELS:88 survey identified four types of schools: public schools; Catholic schools; private, nonreligious schools (independent private schools); and private schools that do not classify themselves as either independent or Catholic (primarily religious schools such as Lutheran, Fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, and so on). For ease of presentation, this report identifies the four types of schools as follows: public; Catholic; private, nonreligious; and private, other religious. In order to further differentiate types of schools, several school environment scales were created. School environment was determined by examining responses to several questions posed to school administrators.33 These questions were grouped into three separate areas that represent: student problems, teacher engagement, and \"academic press.\"34 The student problems scale represents the degree to which administrators thought such things as absenteeism, alcohol and drug use, student weapons, physical or verbal 32School-initiated contact with the parents is presented separately because it is parent-reported. School environment factors, on the other hand, were reported by school administrators."}, {"section_title": "33See U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, A Profile of Schools", "text": "Attended by Eighth Graders in 1988, 1991 (Washington, D.C.) for a discussion of the relationship between school environment and school type. 34See appendix A for a description of how the school environment scales were constructed. These scales were based on items reported by the school administrator. Thus, readers should bear in mind that these are school-level rather than student-level items. abuse of students toward teachers, and theft were problems in their school. The teacher engagement scale is intended to measure teacher morale and attitudes toward students. 35 For example, administrators were asked whether there are conflicts between teachers and administrators, whether teachers have a negative attitude toward the students or have difficulty motivating them, and whether teacher morale is high. Finally, \"academic press\" is an indication of the intensity or competitiveness that students experience in relation to their school work.36 This scale was formulated from such questions as whether students place a high priority on learning, whether teachers encourage students to do their best, whether students are expected to do homework, and whether they face competition for grades. Finally, in the NELS:88 survey, parents were asked about the frequency with which their eighth grader's school contacted them regarding such matters as their child's academic performance and program and their child's behavior. Parents were also asked about volunteering for the school, fund raising, and so on. These items were combined into a scale that measured school-initiated parent contact."}, {"section_title": "ParentChild Discussions", "text": "The type of school that eighth graders attended was associated with whether or not their parents reported discussing current school experiences with them. Parents whose eighth grader attended public school were less likely to report such discussions than parents whose child attended private schools (table 4.1). Approximately 78 percent of parents whose eighth grader attended a public school reported discussing current school experiences, compared with 86 percent, 88 percent, and 90 percent, respectively, of Catholic, private, other religious school, and private, nonreligious school parents. A similar pattern was observed for discussions about high school plans. Public school parents (46 percent) were less likely than Catholic or private, nonreligious school parents (65 percent and 54 percent, respectively) to report regular discussions. School environment was also related to parent-child discussions about school experiences. Parents whose child attended a school with serious student problems were less likely to discuss current school experiences with their eighth grader (77 percent) than parents whose child attended a school with only minimal problems (83 percent). Similarly, parents with a child in a school with strong academic press were more likely to discuss current school experiences with their eighth grader (82 percent) than those whose child attended a school with low academic press (76 percent). The amount of teacher engagement reported by a school was related to parent-child discussions concerning both current school experiences and high school plans. For instance, 82 percent of parents whose eighth grader attended a school with high teacher engagement reported discussing current school experiences, compared with 77 percent of parents with children in schools with low teacher engagement. The frequency with which parents reported school-initiated parent contact was associated with all forms of parent-child discussions (e.g., current experiences, high school plans, and postsecondary education plans) measured in this survey. About 72 percent of parents whose eighth grader attended a school that initiated little parent contact reported discussing current school experiences, compared with 80 percent in schools with moderate contact, and 86 percent in schools that frequently contacted the parents. Similarly, 35This scale is based on an administrator's assessment of overall teacher morale and attitudes. Individual teachers may have had different responses. 36Again, it is important to remember that this is the school administrator's assessment, not the students. 40 percent of parents with children in schools initiating little parent contact reported discussing high school plans with their eighth grader, compared with 46 percent in schools with moderate contact, and 55 percent in schools that frequently contacted the parents.

'4vio school attributes-school type and student problems-were related to whether or not a parent reported setting rules about their eighth grader maintaining a minimum GPA.

However, parents whose children attended private, other religious schools tended to monitor all three aspects of television viewing (e.g., total hours watched on a school night, kind of shows watched, and early/late viewing) more than other parents (table 4.3). Among parents whose children attended private, other religious schools, 75 percent reported limiting the total number of television hours watched by their eighth graders compared with 64 percent or fewer of parents whose children attended other types of schools. Similarly 84 percent of parents with children in private, other religious schools monitored the kinds of programs viewed by their eighth graders compared with 77 percent or fewer of parents whose children attended other types of schools. School environment showed very little association with how parents monitored their eighth grader's television viewing. On the other hand, the more parents reported that they were contacted by their child's school, the more likely they were to monitor their child's television viewing. Approximately 62 percent of parents with children in schools that initiated little contact reported monitoring the kinds of television shows their eighth grader watched, compared with 70 percent in schools with moderate contact, and 73 percent in schools that frequently contacted the parents. attended a school with serious student problems (32 percent reported seldom or never helping with homework) and parents whose child was in a school with minimal student problems (27 percent). On the other hand, as previously discussed with other types of parent involvement, school-initiated parent contact showed an association with whether or not parents reported helping with homework. Among parents whose eighth graders were in schools that initiated little parent contact, 38 percent reported never or seldom helping with their child's homework. By contrast, only 29 percent and 23 percent, respectively, of parents whose eighth graders were in schools that had moderate or frequent contact with parents answered never or seldom. High PTA membership, PTA meeting attendance, and school volunteerism were related to positive school environment measures. Parents whose eighth grader attended a school with minimal student problems, high teacher engagement, or strong academic press were more likely to be members of the PTA and attend meetings or volunteer in the schools than parents associated with schools that had serious student problems, low teacher engagement, or low academic press. For example, among parents with children in school that had low teacher engagement, 28 percent were PTA members, compared with 42 percent of parents with children in schools where teacher engagement was high. Similarly, 16 percent of parents whose eighth graders attended schools with low teacher engagement volunteered in the school, compared with 29 percent of those parents whose eighth graders attended schools with high teacher engagement. PTA involvement and school volunteerism also rose as school-initiated parent contact increased. Furthermore, wh4le the school environment measures had little or modest association with school-initiated parent contact, parent-initiated contact with the school was strongly associated with how often their child's school contacted them.37 Parents with eighth graders in schools that frequently initiated contact with parents contacted the school about their child's academic performance at twice and three times the rates, respectively, of parents whose eighth graders were in schools that initiated only moderate or little parent contact (73 percent compared with 54 and 27 percent, respectively). The same pattern held for parents who contacted the school about their child's academic program: 58 percent of these parents did so when school-initiated parent contact was high, compared with 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of parents associated with schools who had moderate or minimal contact with the parents. 37This relationship suggests that parents are responding to school-initiated contact. That is, if the school is frequently contacting the parent, the parent, in turn, contacts the schoc . The direction of this interaction, however, cannot be distinguished. Chapter 5"}, {"section_title": "Parent Involvement and Student Outcomes", "text": "The final step in this study was to determine whether or not there was an association between how involved parents reported being in their children's education and how well their eighth graders performed in school. There were two measures of student outcome examined. Cognitive outcomes were measured using mathematics and reading proficiency test scores. Proficiency scores related to specific behaviors (such as reading below a prescribed basic level) were reported. Initially, both high-and low-proficiency scores were examined. However, these scores exhibited expected patterns. For example, if a particular characteristic was associated with a greater proportion of students who had low scores, it was also associated with a smaller proportion of students who had high scores. Therefore, to simplify the presentation, the relationship between parental involvement and students who score below the basic level for either mathematics or reading is reported. With respect to mathematics, this means that students cannot perform simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers. Students who score below the basic level in reading cannot perform simple reading comprehension tasks, which include reproducing detail and/or the author's main thought. The second outcome measure examined in this study was whether or not a student dropped out of school between 8th and 10th grade. The dropout status of NELS:88 participants was determined from the first followup survey conducted in the spring of 1990 (see appendix A for more details). The dropout rates presented here are only for students whose parents were included in the base-year survey.38 Because of the influence that socioeconomic status has on students' test scores and dropout rates, all estimates are presented separately for each level of SES. The results of this study indicate that the types of parental involvement measured in the NELS:88 survey had little association with whether or not either eighth graders scored below basic in reading or mathematics proficiency (table 5.1). A few modest associations were found such as a slight decline in the percentage of students scoring below basic in reading (13 percent compared with 11 percent) and math (18 percent compared with 15 percent) for middle-SES students when their parents reported being a school volunteer. Similarly, when middle-SES parents reported restricting the number of television viewing hours on a school day, their children were somewhat less likely to score below basic in reading (14 percent compared with 11 percent) and math (19 percent compard with 15 percent). By contrast, students whose parents reported helping their clifld \"almost everyday\" with homework, were more likely to score below the basic level in mathematics or reading than students whose parents seldom or never helped. A possible explanation for this result is that parents were reacting to their child's poor performance in school. An eighth grader who needs daily help with homeworK is one who is probably struggling in school. This association with homework was found at all levels of socioeconomic status. Figure 5.1 illustrates how the level of parental help with homework is related to proficiency in eighth-grade mathematics and reading among low-SES students. 38The dropout rates reported here differ from the congressionally mandated dropout report (see U.S. Dept. of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Dropout Rates in the United States: 1990States: , 1991, Washington D.C.), which included all the base-year participants in addition to a sample of base-year ineligible students.  In contrast to eighth-grade reading and mathematics proficiency, parental involvement was strongly associated with whether or not a student stayed in school between the 8th and 10th grades. This was especially true for students from poor families who are most at risk of dropping out (table 5.2). Approximate' y 14 percent of low-SES students dropped out of school between the 8th and 10th grades. As discussed in the following sections, among these students, many types of parental participation measured in the NELS:88 survey were associated with lower dropout rates. Students from middle-SES families were less likely to drop out of school than low-SES students (about 4 percent). Nevertheless, even among these students, for some types of parental involvement, students whose parents participated wt.fe less likely to drop out of school than those whose parents did not.

For example, 19 percent of low-SES students whose parents did not limit the number of hours watched on a school night dropped out of school, compared with 10 percent whose parents reported such a restriction. Requiring a certain grade-point average was also associated with whether or not eighth graders from low-SES families dropped out of school.

The results indicated that parental involvement increases with socioeconomic status and parents' educational attainment. When socioeconomic status was taken into consideration, single mothers differed little in the degree to which they participated in their eighth grader's education compared with two-parent families. There were, however, differences among racialethnic groups in parental involvement even when SES was held constant. Contrary to what one might expect, parents of black children reported greater participation in their eighth grader's education than parents of white children, and parents of Asian children reported being less involved. However, as discussed under \"Limitations of Parent Involvement Measures,\" it is not always possible to measure cultural influences as they are related to parent involvement in a broad-based survey such as NELS. For example, in a recent examination of the role of the family in the academic performance of Indochinese refugees, it was found that parents set standards and goals for each evening and provided time for their children's homework by assuming responsibility for chores. Further, culturally based beliefs of these refugees such as \"love of learning\" were rated most often as the factor accounting for their academic success. 40 The relatively high involvement reported by black parents as measured by the NELS:88 survey, on the other hand, may reflect an increased vigilance by parents for children who historically have not had the same educational opportunities as their white peers. In a recent review of mathematics and science education provided in American schools, it was shown that the proportion of classes judged to be high-ability diminished as non-Asian minority enrollment increased.41 In the NELS:88 survey, two types of parental involvement were measured. One was a measure of direct parentchild interactions that included discussions about school experiences and future education; setting home rules such as doing homework and restricting television viewing; and helping with their eighth grader's homework. The other type of involvement was school-directed participation such as attending PTA meetings and volunteering in the schools. In general, the differences observed among parent groups were greater for school-didected involvement (e.g., PTA membership) than they were for direct parentchild involvement (e.g., parentchild discussions about school experiences). For example, 12 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of low-SES and high-SES parents reported being PTA members; whereas 66 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of low-SES and high-SES parents reported regularly discussing school experiences with their child. There were few associations observed in this study between parental involvement and whether or not eighth graders scored below basic in mathematics or reading proficiency, and not all were positive. There was a modest decline in the percentage of middle-SES students who scored below basic in reading and math proficiency when their parents reported volunteering in tile school. On the other hand, students whose parents reported helping them nearly everyday with their homework were more likely to score below basic 40N, Caplan, M. Choy, and J. Whitmore, \"Indochinese Refugee Families and Academic A ;.:evement,\" Scientific American (February 1992). 41J. Oakes, Multiplying Inequalities, Santa Monica, The Rand Corporation (1990). in math and reading. This suggests, however, that parents who reported helping with their eighth grader's homework so frequently, may have been responding to a child who was struggling in school. Thus, the parents were intervening in order to prevent their eighth grader from failing, or worse, dropping out of school. Unlike the relationship between parental involvement and eighth-grade reading or mathematics proficiency, parental involvement was strongly associated with whether or not students dropped out of school between the 8th and 10th grades. This was particularly true for low-SES students who are most at risk of dropping out. For these students, differences in dropout rates were seen for many types of parental involvement, especially direct parentchild interactions. Students whose parents reported regularly discussing future education plans, whose parents restricted television viewing, and whose parents set rules about maintaining a minimum grade-point average all dropped out at lower rates than students whose parents did not do so. Middle-SES students tended to benefit from their parents' school-directed participation. These students dropped out less often when their parents reported regular participation in the PTA, as opposed to those whose parents did not do so.42 The spectrum of familyschool activities that influences a child's performance in school is complex and changes for different families, schools, cultures, and communities. Finding direct links between specific parent behaviors and student cognitive outcomes is difficult at best. Several studies have shown that various types of parental involvement are related to their child's achievement. However, these relationships are usually shown to be weak or indirect. This study also showed a weak association between parental involvement and eighth-grade reading or mathematics proficiency. However, the association between parents' participation and dropping out of school at an early age is strong and compelling, particularly for eighth graders from low-socioeconomic families. The odds of these children dropping out of school between the 8th and 10th grades were significantly lessened when their parents reported regularly participating in their schooling. This was especially true for direct parent-child involvement. These results suggest that parents play a crucial role in keeping their child in school and that innovative programs being developed at state and local levels that motivate parents to participate at all levels of their child's education should be encouraged and supported."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "In this report we have presented a descriptive profile of the NELS: 88 parents, and the extent to which they reported participating in their eight graders' education. In doing so, we wished to illustrate the breadth of information available for both parents and students in the NELS survey. We hope this analysis will serve as a springboard for researchers to pursue more specific and detailed types of analysis, especially with the current availability of the first follow-up (10th grade) survey. These analyses could take many directions from looking at other types of student outcomes to doing path analyses to determine how much socio-demographic factors such as SES and the education level of parents are modified by parental involvement. The fully linked set of NELS student, parent, teacher, and school administrator data have enormous potential as a source of current educational data for educational researchers and policy decision makers. 42The percentage of high-SES students who dropped out was too low to determine dropout differences in relation to parental involvement."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "The NELS:88 base-year study employed a two-stage, stratified random sample design.1 The population of schools was restricted to \"regular\" public and private schools with eighth graders in the United States. Excluded from the sample were Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, special education schools for the handicapped, area vocational schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. In the first stage of the sampling process, 1,052 schools with eighth grades were used for the NCES-sponsored core sample. In order to ensure a balanced sample, schools were stratified by region, urbanicity, and minority percentage prior to sampling. To make the sample more useful for policy analysis, private schools were oversampled. Just under 70 percent of the sampled schools are original selections, while 30.4 percent are replacement schools (schools drawn from the sampling stratum to replace an initial selection that refused to participate). The second stage of the sampling process was the selection of students within schools. In this stage, students who were judged by a representative from the school as being unable to complete the survey instruments were identified. Specifically, students identified as mentally handicapped, having physical or emotional problems that would seriously interfere with their ability to complete the survey instruments, or having a language barrier interfering with their completion of the survey instruments were excluded from the sample. About 5.4 percent of the potential sample was excluded for these reasons. Of those students who were excluded, a majority (57 percent) were excluded for reason of mental disabilities, with most of the rest (35 percent) excluded for language reasons, and a small number excluded because of physical disabilities (8 percent). Again for policy analysis reasons, students of Hispanic or of Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI) origin were oversampled. This oversampling was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA). On average, 26 students were sampled per school. This two-stage process resulted in the inclusion of over 26,000 eighth graders in the sample. Teachers, school administrators, and parents of the eighth graders also participated in NELS:88. Teachers were selected on a pre-assigned basis in two of four subject areasmathematics, science, English, and social studies (history/government). Each school was randomly assigned to one of the following combinations of curriculum areas: mathematics and English; mathematics and social studies; science and English; or science and social studies. Over 5,000 teachers filled out studentspecific evaluations for a total of 23,188 sample students. While the teachers were not selected as a representative sample, their evaluations of sample students are linked to the specific student records, as are parent and school administrator reports. The school administrator (principal or headmaster) of each sample school was asked to complete a school administrator questionnaire. A total of 1,035 school administrators completed school questionnaires."}, {"section_title": "Selection of Parents", "text": "One parent questionnaire was sought for each student participating in the NELS:88 survey, regardless of whether the student resided in a one-or two-parent household (or joint custody arrangement, in the case of divorced parents). The parent who was \"best i -formed\" about the child's educational activities was asked to complete a NELS:88 parent questionnaire. Thus, the parent respondent was essentially self-selected, though the screening selection by the eighth grade student and chance factors created unequal opportunities for self-selection between the two-parent home or between multiple households with dual child custody arrangements. A total of 22,651 parents completed the questionnaire (94 percent weighted-response rate). The natural mother completed the questionnaire in the overwhelming majority of cases (79 percent). In about 17 percent of the cases, the father provided the information; and in a very small percentage of cases (about 2 percent), the parent data were supplied by a grandparent, other relative, or non-relative guardian. For this analysis, a very small number of parents (less than one percent) who completed the questionnaire, but who did not reside with the eighth grader at least 50 percent of the time, were excluded."}, {"section_title": "First Followup Dropout Data", "text": "The NELS:88 first followup survey was conducted in the spring of 1990. Students, dropouts, teachers, and school administrators participated in the followup, with a successful data collection effort for approximately 93 percent of the base-year student respondents. In this report, the only variable used from the first followup survey was the dropout status of base-year respondents whose parents also participated in the base-year survey. The dropout rates, therefore, differ from those in the congressionally mandated dropout report.2 The dropout rates in that report included all base-year respondents plus a sample of base-year ineligible students."}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations", "text": "The target population for the base-year survey consisted of all public and private schools containing eighth grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Excluded from the sample were Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, special education schools for the handicapped, area vocational schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. In addition, students excluded from the sample included those with severe mental handicaps, students whose command of the English language was not sufficient for understanding the survey materials, and students with physical or emotional problems that would make it unduly difficult for them to participate. Given these limitations, users of NELS:88 data should exercise caution in interpreting findings for certain groups. For example, it is estimated that approximately 10 percent of American Indian children attend schools that are affiliated with the BIA. Thus, the estimates for this subpopulation may not be representative."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The statistics in this report are population estimates derived from the sample described in the preceding section. Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling error occurs because samples are not populations. However, the nature of the error depends upon the sample design, and the error properties of many types of sample designs (including two-stage designs such as the one used in this study) are known. Nonsampling error occurs not only in sample surveys but also in population censuses. Nonsampling error may arise from a number of sources, such as the inability to obtain cooperation from each sampled school (school nonresponse), or the inability to obtain information from each sampled student in cooperating schools (student nonresponse). A third source of nonresponse contributing to nonsampling error is found at the item level. Cooperating students or parents may not have answered every question in the survey. In addition, ambiguous definitions, differences in interpreting questions, inability or unwillingness to give correct information, mistakes in recoding or coding data, and other errors of collecting and processing the data can result in nonsampling error. States: 1990, 1991."}, {"section_title": "2U.S. Dept. of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Dropout Rates in the United", "text": "The precision with which one can use survey results to make inferences to a population depends upon the magnitude of both sampling and nonsampling errors. In large sample surveys, such as the NELS:88 study, sampling errors are generally minimal, except when estimates are made for relatively small subpopulations, such as for American Indians (N=315). The nonsampling errors are more difficult to estimate. The major sources of nonsampling error considered were school, student, and item level nonresponse. The NELS:88 base year student response rate was above 93 percent and the item response rates within instruments, for the items used to develop the estimates in this report, were above 95.3 percent. The item response rates for the items used in this study from the parent survey were 94 percent or higher. The weights used to calculate the estimates were constructed in a fashion that compensated for instrument nonresponse. Weighting procedures are explained in the NELS:88 Base Year Student User's Manual.3 The small bias due to nonresponse is documented in the NELS:88 Base Year Sample Design Report.4"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Generally, whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability of inferring that a difference exists when, in fact, it does not. In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics, a number of issues must be kept in mind. First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This is somewhat misleading since the size of the t statistic depends not only on the observed differences in means or percentage being compared but also on the number of respondents in the categories used for comparison, and on the degree of variability among respondents within categories. A small difference compared across a large number of respondents could result in a large t statistic. Second, when multiple statistical comparisons are made on the same data, it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference will be erroneously given. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha-level of .05 there is still a 5 percent chance of declaring that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of comparisons increases, the risk of making such an error in inference also increases. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferonni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrast was used. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, since SES has three categories, K=3 and there are (3*2)/2=3 possible comparisons between the categories. The Bonferonni procedure divides the alpha-level for a single t test (for example, .05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons, to give a new alpha that is corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. Standard errors for the estimates in each of the tables are presented in the appendix. The standard errors were calculated using the STRATTAB program, which uses a Taylor series approximation to calculate standard errors based upon complex survey designs.5 A version of this program is available from NCES upon request. The standard errors reported take into account the clustering in the sampling procedure; they are generally higher than standard errors calculated under the assumptions of simple random sampling. Interested readers can compute the t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables using the following formula: where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and sel and se2 are their corresponding standard errors."}, {"section_title": "Variables Used6", "text": "Classification variables were selected to describe student characteristics such as sex, race-ethnicity, and socioeconomic status; school characteristics such as region, urbanicity, and school type; and mathematics or science class characteristics such as class type and test quartiles for each student.

Educational level data were recoded as for the composite PARENT EDUCATION. Occupational data were recoded using the Duncan SEI scale as used in HS&B. Each non-missing component was standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Non-missing standardized components were averaged, yielding the SES composite. For cases where all parent data components were missing (8.1 percent of the participants), student data were used to compute the SES. The first four components from the student data are the same as the components used from parent data (in other words, education-level data, items 34A and 34B, similarly recoded; occupational data, items 4B and 7B of student questionnaire part one, also recoded). The fifth component for SES from the student data consisted of summing the nonmissing household items listed in 35A-P (after recoding \"Not Have Item\"), calculating a simple mean of these items, and then standardizing this mean. If eight or more items in 35A-P were nonmissing, this component was computed; otherwise it was set to missing. All components coming from the student data were standardized. Non-missing standardized components were averaged, yielding the SES composite for those cases where parent data were either missing or not available. The student data were used to construct SES if all components based on parent data were missing and at least one component based on student data was not missing. Otherwise SES was set to missing. The actual range for SES is -2.97 through 2.56. SES is divided into quartiles, with 1 = lowest and 4 = highest. In this report the middle two quartiles were collapsed.

Some of this information was taken directly from the QED file. QED is a standard school universe file maintained by Quality Education Data, and correlates well with the Common Core of Data maintained by the U.S. Department of Education. The list used for sampling independent schools was the membership list of the National Association of Independent Schools. The second scheme classified schools into public, Catholic, religious other private, and nonreligious other private. This classification appears on the NELS:88 base-year public-use files. In the two schemes, the public and Catholic school categories are the same, but the remaining private school categories contain somewhat different mixes of schools. 1=Public school 2=Catholic school 3=Private, other religious affiliation 4=Private, no religious affiliation SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT COMPOSITES There were three school-level \"environment\" composites that were created from variables taken from the administrator file. Scales were created by combining responses to several items asked of the school administrators. Caution should be taken when interpreting these variables in the tabulations since they are school level and not student or teacher level. For example, a variable such as \"teacher engagement\" refers to a whole school, not just the eighth grade math or science teachers. The table below shows the scales created and the input variables for each. For each of these scales, a factor analysis and a reliability analysis showed the feasibility of combining the items into a scale. (The alpha statistic for each scale is shown in the Basic level items require the ability to successfully carry out simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers. Intermediate level implies basic competencies plus the addition of simple operations with decimals, fractions, and roots. Advanced level requires the ability to master simple problem-solving tasks. Unlike basic and intermediate levels that require the rote application of rules, performance at the advanced level requires conceptual understanding and/or the development of a solution strategy."}, {"section_title": "READING PROFICIENCY (PROFREAD) 1=Below basic 2=Basic 3=Advanced", "text": "Basic proficiency is defined by competence in simple reading comprehension, including the reproduction of detail and/or the author's main thought.
