It is characterized by cognitive impairment resulting from extracellular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau) and cerebral atrophy [1] [2] [3] . Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the onset and development of the disease, and its heritability is reported to be up to 0.79 [4] [5] [6] . Previous linkage analyses have revealed genes involved in the production of A\u03b2 plaques, namely APP (A\u03b2 precursor protein), PSEN1 (Presenilin-1) and PSEN2 (Presenilin-1), as the causal genes for early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease [5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, mutations of these genes are mainly associated with the autosomal dominant types and account for less than 5% of the total number of cases [5, 16] . In fact, it is believed that in most cases, the disease is polygenic and there are other causal and/or susceptibility genes remaining to be discovered [4, 17] . Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported two dozen Alzheimer's susceptibility genes in populations of European ancestry, including APOE, BIN1, CLU and RIN3 [18, 19] . Nevertheless, most of the GWAS loci are non-coding common variants/SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) with unknown function and show small to moderate effect sizes (odds ratio [OR] < 1.2). Since these RESEARCH ARTICLE GWAS hits can only explain about 16% of the total phenotypic variance [17] , the missing heritability remains to be explained by other underlying variants (especially functionally causative variants) [20] .\nRecent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies offer powerful tools for the discovery of rare causal variants with larger effect sizes in Alzheimer's disease [21] , and previous studies have identified UNC5C [22] , TREM2 [23, 24] , PLD3 [25, 26] , PLCG2 and ABI3 [27] to be the top candidate genes harboring such variants. However, despite the successes in applying next-generation sequencing technologies, population heterogeneity has limited the success in characterizing the genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease [28, 29] . For example, many of top hits in the European populations identified by GWASs or next-generation sequencing technologies cannot be validated in Chinese populations [26, [30] [31] [32] . The investigation of the genetic susceptibility of Alzheimer's disease at the wholegenome level in Han Chinese, the largest ethnic population in the world, which has the greatest number of Alzheimer's disease sufferers [33, 34] , is therefore urgently needed. To this end, we have performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of Han Chinese patients with Alzheimer's disease to identify novel susceptibility genes."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identification of C7 as a novel Alzheimer's risk gene in Han Chinese", "text": "We used an extreme phenotype sampling strategy for WES to increase the likelihood of identifying true disease-related variants [35, 36] , followed by independent validations and functional characterization (Fig. 1A) . In total, 107 unrelated patients with an early age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AAO \u2264 55) and/or a positive familial history were selected from over 1000 genetically unrelated patients from East and Southwest China [26, 32, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . In addition, 160 in-house non-dementia individuals [42] , together with the whole-genome data of Han Chinese in Beijing (n = 103) and Southern Han Chinese (n = 105) from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 [43] , were combined as the initial population control (n = 368), based on the fact that principal component (PC) analysis showed no apparent population stratification between the studied subjects and the reference Chinese populations from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project [43] (Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

As we aimed to identify novel rare coding variants that were associated with Alzheimer's disease or enriched in patients, we filtered out the common variants and obtained 23 373 rare or low-frequency coding variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% in the 368 pooled population controls [42, 43] . The Bonferroni correction-based threshold for the exomewide significance was thus set as P < 2.139 \u00d7 10 \u22126 (0.05/23373).\nWe were able to successfully validate the previously reported association of APOE \u03b54 with Alzheimer's disease [18] (rs429358, P = 3.41 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , OR = 3.59) in our initial WES screening stage (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1 ), suggesting the reliability of the current extreme phenotype sampling approach. One rare variant in the complement C7 gene, rs3792646, leading to the missense mutant p.K420Q with a predicted damaging effect (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion score = 20.3) [49] , was the only exome-wide significant hit showing an association with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (P = 1.09 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , OR = 7.853, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 1B , Table 1 and  Supplementary Table S1) , with the exception of APOE rs429358. When the 107 patients (MAF = 0.08) were compared with 4327 East Asians from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) [50] (MAF = 0.036; P = 2.95 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , OR = 2.292, Fisher's exact test) or 11 670 Chinese individuals from the CONVERGE (China, Oxford and Virginia Commonwealth University Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology) consortium [51] (MAF = 0.029; P = 2.200 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 2.884, Fisher's exact test), the positive association between rs3792646 and Alzheimer's disease survived (Table  1) . To avoid a false-positive result, we performed logistic regression analyses with adjustment of the first three PCs (PC1, PC2 and PC3) ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ), APOE \u03b54 status and sex as the covariate(s), separately or together. The association of APOE \u03b54 with Alzheimer's disease remained significant at the exome-wide level after adjustment with PC1-3 (P adj-PC = 1.95 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , OR adj-PC = 3.20). The C7 variant rs3792646 remained one of the top hits after adjustment using different covariates (P adj-PC = 9.508 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , P adj-sex = 7.30 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , P adj-APOE = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and P adj-PC-sex-APOE = 9.90 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), although no exome-wide significant hits were observed, partly because of the small sample size (Supplementary Table S1 ). We list the top 100 rare functional variants showing suggestive associations with Alzheimer's disease (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01) in Supplementary Table S1 . The summary statistics can be freely accessed through the webserver AlzData (http://www.alzdata.org/exome.html) [52] .\nIn addition to the single-site evidence, the genelevel association based on the burden test showed that C7 had an enrichment of rare missense variants in Alzheimer's patients compared with controls (P = 2.28 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; Fig. 1C ). The SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Tests (SKAT) [53] yielded an even stronger association (P = 5.83 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) of the combined effects of rare C7 variants. When rs3792646 was excluded from the burden test, the significance of enrichment disappeared, suggesting that the signal might be driven by rs3792646. As there was a variant, rs2271708 (p.C128R), overrepresenting in controls (Fig. 1C) , we recalculated the burden test excluding both rs3792646 and rs2271708, and observed a marginally significant enrichment of rare variants in cases (P = 0.02), suggesting the existence of multiple effect alleles in C7."}, {"section_title": "Validation of the association of rs3792646 with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese", "text": "To validate the association between C7 rs3792646 and early-onset and familial Alzheimer's disease identified during the discovery WES screen (stage 1), we sequenced this SNP in an independent Han Chinese sample with early-onset and/or familial Alzheimer's disease from Beijing (stage 2, n = 103 cases). The association of rs3792646 with Alzheimer's disease could be well validated (P = 6.10 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 5.133, Table 1 ). Combing these two samples of patients with early-onset and/or familial Alzheimer's disease together, we observed a stronger association of rs3792646 with Alzheimer's disease (P = 3.73 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , OR = 6.500). We then attempted to validate the association between rs3792646 and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese cohorts of sporadic patients (stage 3): the East China cohort contains 587 sporadic cases and 274 geographically matched controls, and the Southwest China cohort contains 583 sporadic cases and 2190 geographically matched controls. We also analyzed a patient sample from Hunan, Southcentral China (n = 235 sporadic cases). Positive associations were observed in the East China cohort (P = 3.73 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , OR = 3.009, Fisher's exact test) and the Southwest China cohort (P = 1.19 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , OR = 1.588, Fisher's exact test). In the sample from Hunan Province, Southcentral China, no association with Alzheimer's disease was observed (P = 0.218, OR = 1.394, Fisher's exact test), but the risk effect remained in this relatively small sample. When we combined the subjects from Southwest and Southcentral China together (Pooled South, between rs3792646 and Alzheimer's risk with a considerably large effect size (P combined = 2.99 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , OR = 1.930).\nNotably, we observed positive associations in both early-onset (AAO \u2264 65 years old; P = 3.10 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 2.066) and late-onset subjects (AAO > 65 years old; P = 8.11 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , OR = 1.883), with a stronger effect size in the early-onset patients (Table 1) . When the patients were divided into different groups according to their APOE \u03b54 status, we observed positive associations of rs3792646 with Alzheimer's risk in both APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers (Supplementary Table S2 ), and a stronger association was found in the APOE \u03b54 carriers (P combined = 1.43 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , OR = 3.651) than non-carriers (P combined = 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , OR = 1.770) (Supplementary Table S2 )."}, {"section_title": "Association of rs3792646 with", "text": "Alzheimer's disease might be Chinese-specific While we have confirmed the association between C7 rs3792646 with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese, it is unclear whether it is Chinese-specific or not. We therefore re-analyzed the whole-genome sequencing data of 812 individuals of European ancestry from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset [54] . There were six C7 mutation carriers (including three rare damaging missense variants; Supplementary Table S3) in 296 patients and two carriers in 281 controls in the ADNI cohort (gene-based P = 0.29, OR = 2.886), suggesting a higher frequency of C7 mutations in European patients [54] , albeit the pattern might be different from that in Han Chinese. Among them, rs3792646-C (p.K420Q) and chr5:40936541 C>T (p.C128R) occurred one and five times, respectively, in 296 patients with Alzheimer's disease or late-stage mild cognitive impairment, whereas in the 281 controls, no individual harbored p.K420Q and only one individual with p.C128R was found. Although there seemed to be a trend of C7 mutation in patients, the enrichment was not significant (p.K420Q, P = 0.33; p.C128R, P = 0.20). We also retrieved the summary statistics of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project [18] , a large GWAS meta-analysis of Alzheimer's disease (17 008 cases versus 37 154 controls), to investigate the association between C7 variants and Alzheimer's disease in Europeans. No nominally significant C7 SNPs were observed. In the recently released Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) cohort [55] , there were also no significant exonic variants in C7 that showed an association with Alzheimer's disease. Only one p.K420Q carrier was found in the ADSP cohort [55] , which contains 10 570 individuals of European ancestry.

The survival test showed that carriers of the risk allele rs3792646-C had a significant (log-rank test, P = 2.04 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ) earlier onset age (51 years) than carriers of rs3792646-AA (55 years) in Han Chinese patients with an AAO < 60 years ( Fig. 2A) . No significant difference in the AAO was observed in patients with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease.\nIn order to discern whether the risk allele rs3792646-C would have a potential effect on brain structure and the function of susceptible individuals in early adulthood, we took advantage of the imaging data that were previously collected in 360 healthy university students [32, 56] , and analyzed the association of rs3792646 with brain structural changes and working memory performance. Intriguingly, the rs3792646-C carriers (genotypes CC and AC) showed significantly lower right hippocampal volume (P = 0.02) and worse working memory performance (P = 0.03) compared with the AA carriers ( Fig. 2B and C). These observations indicated that the C7 variant rs3792646 might affect the brain function of at-risk Han Chinese individuals several decades before disease onset.\nThe effects of C7 variants on Alzheimer-related endophenotypes were further investigated using the ADNI data [54] . We observed a lower hippocampal volume in only one p.K420Q carrier in the ADNI cohort [54] (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Though the association between the disease and C7 SNPs was not established in the population of European origin, two C7 variants (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S2 ) did affect the cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 and p-tau levels in the ADNI cohort [54] .

All initial (e.g. C1QA, P = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221218 ) and central (e.g. C3, P = 4.01 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) components of the complement cascades were significantly RESEARCH ARTICLE\nupregulated, whereas only C7 was significantly upregulated of the terminal complement components in patients (P = 3.21 \u00d7 10 \u221215 , log2 fold change = 0.242) (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. 3A) . Consistently, we observed an early increase and a strong positive correlation of C1q and C3 mRNA expression level with the severity of pathological changes (A\u03b2 plaques and tau tangles) in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease mouse models based on the Mouseac database (www.mouseac.org) [59] (Supplementary Fig. S3 ; C7 was unfortunately not included in this dataset). The increase of the C7 mRNA level in patients could be mimicked by the significantly increased level of C7 mRNA in U251 cells in response to A\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 3B ). All these results are consistent with recent reports that the initial complement components play an essential role in early synapse loss during the course of the development of Alzheimer's disease [60, 61] ."}, {"section_title": "Overexpression of C7 mutant p.K420Q disturbs the global gene expression pattern and affects cellular function", "text": "Previous studies showed that the complement components mainly function in glia [61] , and that astrocytes can produce C7 and other complement components [62] .

The U251 cells were engineered to stably express mutant APP K670N/M671L (U251-APP) so that they would produce A\u03b2 42 under doxorubicin induction [32, 37] . We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of U251-APP cells overexpressing wild type and mutant C7 p.K420Q to determine the potential effect of the mutant.

The mRNA expression levels of initial components (e.g. C1R, C1S and C3) and regulatory factors (e.g. C1INH and CFH) of the complement cascade were significantly increased in cells overexpressing wild type or mutant C7 relative to cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3C) . While the mRNA levels of these initial components and regulatory factors did not differ between cells overexpressing wild type C7 and mutant C7, most of the other genes (591/653) upregulated in cells overexpressing wild type C7 were downregulated in cells overexpressing mutant p.K420Q. These altered genes were significantly (P adj < 0.05) enriched in interferon-mediated signaling pathways (Fig. 3D) , among which there were three GWASreported Alzheimer's risk genes-BIN1, RIN3 and ZCWPW1 [18] -as well as several important immune genes such as OASL, IL6 and complement components (Fig. 3C) . Intriguingly, the differentially expressed genes in response to C7 wild type (enrichment P = 2.57 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) or mutant (enrichment P = 2.87 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ) overexpression were significantly enriched in a C7-involved co-expression network/module (Fig. 3E ) that was recently recognized to be dysregulated in brains of Alzheimer's patients [52] .\nWe further characterized the downstream effect of overexpression of the C7 mutant p.K420Q on A\u03b2 internalization and cell apoptosis, and observed a significant impact on the internalization of fluorescently labeled A\u03b2 42 in HM cells (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Additionally, HM cells overexpressing mutant p.K420Q showed increased apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) treatment compared with cells overexpressing wild type C7 ( Supplementary Fig. S5 )."}, {"section_title": "Overexpression of C7 mutant p.K420Q affects excitatory synaptic transmission", "text": "Besides functions in immune activation, A\u03b2 internalization and cell apoptosis, the complement RESEARCH ARTICLE system also plays a role in neuronal activity [60, 61, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Biolistic transfection on rat hippocampal slice cultures and accompanying dual whole-cell recording analyses offered a convenient study system to characterize the physiological function of target gene(s) in neurons [68] . We used this strategy to investigate the effect of C7 and its p.K420Q mutant on synaptic transmission in excitatory neurons. We found that overexpression of wild type C7 in CA1 pyramidal neurons decreased both the AMPAR (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) and NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated synaptic transmission compared with the respective neighboring control neurons (Fig. 4A1 and B1 ), but that these inhibitory effects were compromised by the p.K420Q mutation (Fig. 4A2, A3 , B2 and B3). However, overexpression of C7 or its mutant had no effect on the ratio of AMPAR-and NMDAR-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Fig. 4C1 and C2) , suggesting a general postsynaptic role of C7 in excitatory synaptic transmission. The paired-pulse ratio, which is the parameter for presynaptic release probability, was not affected by C7 or its mutant overexpression ( Fig. 4D1 and D2 ). This observation indicated that the regulatory function of C7 is postsynaptic-specific. Moreover, neither wild type C7 nor C7 mutant p.K420Q had any effect on \u03b3 -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic transmission ( Fig. 4E1  and E2 ), indicating that the C7-mediated effect is specific to excitatory synapses. Taken together, C7 likely inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons while the mutant p.K420Q impairs this negative regulation. Note that complement factors can be produced and secreted locally in the brain; it is surprising that neighboring non-transfected cells are not regulated by the overexpressed C7. Where endogenous and overexpressed C7 are located and what their extracellular levels are in the growing medium remain to be determined."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "To date, most of the Alzheimer's risk genes identified by GWASs and next-generation sequencing technologies have been found in populations of European ancestry [5, 18, 23, 24, 28, 69] . For East Asians, there has been only one GWAS in a Japanese population, with no genome-wide significant loci (excluding APOE) being reported [70] . Given the increasing burden of Alzheimer's disease and the population heterogeneity, there is an urgent need to investigate the genetic basis of the disease in the Han Chinese, the largest population in the world with the greatest number of Alzheimer's patients worldwide [33, 34] . In this study, we have used WES to identify potential risk gene(s) of Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese. By recruiting relatively homogeneous set of patients with features attributable to genetic factors (familial and extreme early onset), we have countered the limitation of a small sample size and discovered a novel exome-wide significant variant rs3792646 (p.K420Q) in the C7 gene (Fig. 1) . Importantly, this risk variant has a comparable effect size with the well-known hits TREM2 p.R47H [23, 24] and PLD3 p.V232M [25] , which were identified in populations of European origin. Intriguingly, the effect size of rs3792646 (OR = 3.651, Supplementary Table S2) was dramatically increased in the APOE \u03b54 carriers, suggesting a potential interaction between this rare missense variant and APOE \u03b54.\nThe complement system has complex roles in Alzheimer's disease, including A\u03b2 clearance, microglia activation, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and neuron death [60, 61, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Whether or not the complement system is a driving factor or a byproduct has been a controversial topic [60] . Recent studies reported that the initial component C1q and the central component C3 contribute to early synapse loss in response to A\u03b2 and/or viral infection in Alzheimer's disease [60, 61] . Our current results indicated that C7, a canonical terminal component in the complement cascade, might be also involved in the early pathological stage of Alzheimer's disease, together with the other initial components. Previous results have suggested that C7 plays a major role in the formation of the membrane attack complex and that it serves as a membrane anchor [71] . C7 deficiency contributes to susceptibility to a variety of immune and infectious diseases, such as meningococcal infection [72] [73] [74] [75] , and rare damaging variants of other complement components have been reported to be enriched in age-related macular degeneration [76] . It is also known that both infection and metabolite (e.g. A\u03b2) accumulation can activate the complement cascade [60, 61] . While, to our knowledge, no report has linked C7 with neurodegenerative disorders to date, our results indicate that C7 might function in the early activation phase, rather than in the terminal membrane attack complex as previously reported [71] . Moreover, the C7 risk allele affects the brain's morphological structure and impairs working memory in young adults and disease-related endophenotypes in patients (Fig. 2) . These results were further supported by the observation that overexpression of mutant C7 affects the global gene expression pattern (Fig. 3) Figs S4 and S5) , which would play an active role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Through the use of an electrophysiological assay with rat hippocampal slice cultures and dual whole-cell recordings, we showed that overexpression of C7 mutant p.K420Q affects the excitatory synaptic transmission of neurons (Fig. 4) . All these lines of evidence suggest a putative role of C7 and its variant in the development of Alzheimer's disease, though the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. Considering the complex roles of the complement system in Alzheimer's disease, it is still unclear whether there is a link or interaction between C7-induced changes in glial activity and changes in synaptic function. The exact mechanism of complement genes in the disease remains to be elucidated.\nConsistent with the functional assays, in silico prediction by four algorithms showed that the mutation p.K420Q was deleterious. Nevertheless, we should note that rs3792646 was also present in the general population (with an allele frequency ranging from 0.0004-0.03), leading to an argument against its pathogenic status, similar to the case of NR1H3 p.R415Q in multiple sclerosis [77] , although the situation in Alzheimer's disease might be a bit different, partly due to its late age-of-onset. We have previously shown that a common missense variant in another complement gene, CFH, conferred genetic risk to Alzheimer's disease, whereas this variant underwent pathogen-driven selection so that it was retained in the population due to the trade-off effect [32] . It is reasonable to speculate that mutant C7 might also have been positively selected during evolution, and that this has led to the observed Figure 4 . C7 mutant p.K420Q reverses its physiological regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission. (A and B) Rat hippocampal slice cultures were biolistically transfected with wild type C7 or C7 p.K420Q. Simultaneous dual whole-cell recordings from a transfected CA1 pyramidal neuron (green trace) and a neighboring wild type one (black trace) were performed.

First, although we observed an exome-wide significant association of rs3792646 with Alzheimer's disease in the WES discovery stage and validated the association in independent cohorts, it should be noted that the association of rs3792646 in the initial screening stage did not reach exome-wide significance in the logistic regression analysis. This might have been caused, at least partially, by the small sample size in this stage ( Table 1 ). As the association was initially recognized in early-onset patients that were selected by extreme phenotype sampling in the discovery stage, whereas most of the replication samples were sporadic late-onset patients, independent replication in larger cohorts with early-onset Alzheimer's disease is needed to further confirm the association. Second, the risk allele rs3792646-C was mainly found in Asian populations and was infrequent in European populations. In the ADNI [54] and ADSP samples [55] of European ancestry, we observed only one risk allele carrier out of 812 individuals and one carrier out of 10 570 individuals, respectively, suggesting a Chinese-specific effect of rs3792646. However, the results need further validation and should be interpreted with caution, as the sample size of cases of European ancestry is still limited. Nonetheless, our functional characterization indicates that the C7 mutant p.K420Q affects the expression of the interferon-mediated signaling pathways, A\u03b2 internalization and apoptosis at the cellular level, as well as the excitatory synaptic transmission of neurons, which reinforces the conclusion that C7 is a risk gene for Alzheimer's disease.\nDuring the preparation of this manuscript, we noticed a recent publication about a whole-genome sequencing-based GWAS in a Chinese population [78] . These authors identified two common variants, GCH1 (rs72713460) and KCNJ15 (rs928771), showing nominal associations with Alzheimer's disease in Chinese patients. We checked these two risk variants in our WES data, but failed to find any association between these genes/variants and Alzheimer's disease in our samples. This might be caused by different strategies that were used in Zhou et al.'s study (low-coverage whole-genome sequencing for sporadic patients) [78] and our study (WES for a relatively homogeneous set of patients with an extreme phenotype). Evidently, large sample sizes are needed for further validation of these risk genes in our current study and the study by Zhou et al. [78] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, we have identified a rare damaging variant, rs3792646 (p.K420Q) in C7, which confers risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, through exomewide screening in Chinese patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease or familial history. Although TREM2 p.R47H and PLD3 p.V232M are extremely rare or absent in Chinese patients [26, 31] , we have shown here that the Han Chinese population harbors another risk factor, C7 p.K420Q, with a comparable effect size. The C7 risk allele is most likely specific to Han Chinese. This variant could potentially contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease via disrupting immune activation and A\u03b2 processing, and is associated with changes in brain structure and function even decades before disease onset. Our results strongly suggest the active roles of C7, together with other complement components such as the GWAS hits CR1, CLU [18] and CFH [32] , in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Further validation and functional investigation is needed to characterize the mechanisms underlying the risk for Alzheimer's disease conferred by these molecules."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects: extreme phenotype sampling for exome sequencing", "text": "We employed an extreme phenotype sampling strategy in the WES stage to increase the likelihood of identifying true disease-related variants [35, 36] .

The total size of the regions covered by 2.1 million long oligonucleotide probes was 64 Mb, achieving the most comprehensive coverage of coding regions in the genome. All the genome coordinates were based on human genome build GRCh37 (hg19, http://asia. ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/grch37.html). Processed final libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 or 4000 (150-bp paired-end, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\nLow-quality raw reads were removed using Trimmomatic-0.32 [82] with the parameters 'LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWIN-DOW:4:15 MINLEN:36'. Quality-filtered reads were then aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information human genome reference assembly (build GRCh37) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner [83] . Picard Tools RESEARCH ARTICLE (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) were used to flag duplicate reads. Variant calling was performed through the canonical pipeline recommended by the Best Practice Variant Detection with the GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) [84] . Variant Quality Score Recalibration from the GATK package was used to filter spurious variants resulting from sequencing errors and mapping artifacts. ANNOVAR was used to annotate variants into different functional categories according to their locations and expected effects on encoded gene products [85] .\nIn order to achieve credible statistical power by increasing the control:case ratio, we pooled the exome data of the 160 in-house non-dementia individuals [42] with the whole-genome data of Han Chinese in Beijing (n = 103) and Southern Han Chinese (n = 105) from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project [43] as the initial population control (n = 368). PC analysis was performed to ensure that there was no apparent population stratification between the studied subjects and the reference Chinese populations from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project [43] by using the GCTA tool (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/# Overview). Based on the clustering pattern (Supplementary Fig. S1 ), there is no obvious population substructure among the East Asian populations, suggesting that it is reasonable to group the inhouse controls with Han Chinese in Beijing and Southern Han Chinese from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project [43] as the general population control. Allele frequencies of exonic variants in patients were compared to that of the population controls by using the Fisher's exact test in the initial exome-wide case-control screen. To rule out the possibility of technical artifacts due to potential population substratification, we performed a logistic regression with PC1-3 as the covariates using the open-source C/C++ toolset Plink/seq (https://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/plinkseq/). We also included APOE \u03b54 status and sex as covariates, besides PC1-3, in the logistic regression analysis.\nWe defined nonsense, frameshift, splice site and missense variants as functional if these variants were predicted to be damaging by at least one of the five algorithms (PolyPhen2 HumDiv and HumVar [44] , LRT [45] , MutationTaster [46] and SIFT [47, 48] ). Functional variants with a MAF < 5% in the 368 pooled population controls [42, 43] were analyzed to identify the exome-wide significant rare variants.

These exonic variants were directly compared to the population control by using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression analysis. All damaging missense variants with a MAF < 5% in the control population were used for the genebased burden testing [86] using PLINK/seq. The SKAT was also used to evaluate the combined effect of rare mutations using the SKAT R package [53] . Allele frequencies of the targeted loci in 4327 East Asians from ExAC [50] and in 11 670 Chinese samples from the CONVERGE Consortium (the largest Han Chinese low-coverage genome dataset so far) [51] were retrieved and used as the reference control for comparison with the Alzheimer's patients."}, {"section_title": "Independent validations in Chinese and European populations", "text": "The discovery WES screen (stage 1) revealed a significant association between C7 rs3792646 and early-onset and familial Alzheimer's disease.

Given the small sample size of Alzheimer's patients in ADNI data, patients with late-stage mild cognitive impairment were combined with Alzheimer's patients to achieve better statistical power, resulting in 296 patients and 281 controls (named 'ADNI cohort' in the text), whereas the remaining 235 subjects with early-stage or modest mild cognitive impairment were excluded from the analysis [54] . To validate the result in a larger European cohort, we obtained access to the WES data of 5815 Alzheimer's cases and 4755 controls from the ADSP [55] through the dbGaP (Genotypes and Phenotypes database) under the study accession phs000572.v7.p4 (accessed in May 2018).\nStatistical power and sample size calculations were performed using Quanto software (version 1.2.4) [87] based on the observed parameters. For alleles with a MAF of 0.05 in the general population (disease prevalence was set as 0.1), at least 279 pairs of case and control samples were needed to capture an OR of 2.0 with a statistical power of 80% under an additive model.
