[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Neurological signal processing is of significance not only the physiologist doing research and the clinician investigating patients but also to the biomedical engineer who is needed to collect, process, and interpret the physiological signals by prototyping systems and algorithms for their manipulations. While it is a fact that there does hold immense stuff (material) on the subject of digital neurological signal processing, however, it is dispersed in various scientific, technological, and physiological journals, databases also in various international conference proceedings. Consequently, it is a quite hard, more time-consuming, and often tiresome job, especially to the stranger to the domain. Hence, this study concentrates on how much time would require to access the databases belong to the brain signal/image collections, neurological signals, etc. The sixteen US-based Servers, ten UK-based Servers, and the five Servers from other countries are included in this study. Mainly, the domain name system, hyper text transfer protocol, and the Internet control message protocol query/response times are analyzed using a popular packet sniffer called Wireshark.\nBrain signal/image, DNS, HTTP, ICMP, packet sniffer, Wireshark."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The brain waves (popularly known as EEG) characterize the electrical activity of the brain. A few key points of the structure of the brain are as follows: The cerebrum, the cerebellum, the brain stem, and the thalamus are the main parts of the brain. The cerebrum is partitioned into two hemispheres, detached by a longitudinal groove over which there is a large connective band of fibers (corpus callosum). The cerebral cortex -the exterior surface of the cerebral hemispheresis devised of neurons in complex and difficult patterns, and divided into regions by sulci (fissures). Underneath the cortex recline nerve fibers that lead to variant parts of the brain and the body [1] , [2] .\nThe need for the research of EEG signals emerges from the fact that these brain signals yield a non-invasive diagnostic tool in a wealth of disorders that include anesthesia, coma, sleep disorder, encephalopathy, and epilepsy assessment in intensive care. EEG rhythms agree with the basis of behavior, that is, like sleeping, waking, coma, seizures, level of attentiveness, etc. as shown in Fig. 1 [3] , [4] .\nThe primary issue here is that the analysis of the continuous EEG signals. The prevailing idea is to exploit digital signal processing techniques to identify and classify the EEG signals of the constructive essence. To assist the classification of these patterns, feature-extraction is prototyped closely on the mechanism used by an expert neurophysiologist, is adopted. It primarily incorporates of (appropriate) segmentation of the brain wave record into stationary/quasi-stationary chunks and yielding an illustration for each one of them. Consequently, the vital task is to split the EEG signal into stationary/quasistationary sections -which can be accomplished efficiently by an adaptive pre-whitening filter owing to Wiener [1] .\nThis study mainly focuses on the different brain signal/image databases throughout the world regarding how fast/quickly access them via the network of networks (Internet). The backbone of the Internet is the Internet Protocol (IP). The IP describes the way in which a group of independent networks can communicate together to form the Internet, i.e., the network of networks. The early Internet researchers found packet switching was essential for the computer data communications across the network in contrast to the telephone network where the circuit switching plays a role. By tracing the packets during the network traffic, the network administrators can troubleshoot the network problems or issues, developers can debug the protocol implementations, security engineers can investigate the internet security issues, or anybody to understand how their networks function [5] - [7] .\nWireshark, Angry IP Scanner, Zenmap, Colasoft Capsa Free and the Ether Appe are the five free and easy use of IP traffic monitoring tools. Despite there are many free packet tracer tools available, Wireshark is one of the best and popular open source network traffic analysis tool which seizes, unpacks, and shows the contents of network traffic. This tool is broadly used in education and for the industry. This tool can be used as a protocol analyzer, network analyzer, packet sniffer and forensic tool -hence it is called as a multipurpose tool [8] - [11] . Due to the advancements in broadband Internet access and wireless local area networks (WLAN), a home network is quite common in day-to-day life which is designed using wired or wireless modem and one or more computers. The survey says that more than 85% of people in the world use some of form of the home router for their home network. Hence the students and researchers can prefer them (their home network) to learn the computer networking fundamentals in a more practical way using some open source packet sniffer tools [12] - [15] . This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the materials and methods involved in computing the DNS, HTTP, and ICMP response times from the database Servers and Section 3 includes experimental simulation results obtained using Wireshark and Ping command line tool. The conclusions are finally described in Section 4."}, {"section_title": "II. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Firstly, the survey on brain signal/image database servers throughout the globe are discussed. Subsequently, the methodologies to obtain the DNS, HTTP, and ICMP response times from the servers are discussed in detail. A NeuroMorph.org comprises contributions of digitally reconstructed neurons from over 400 laboratories around the globe with data sharing support. The SchizConnect is an open, public virtual database about schizophrenia neuroimaging (MRI) datasets with clinical and cognitive assessments. The painrepository.org is another access point for functional, diffusion, and structural MRI datasets with macroscopic level organized by the UCLA Oppenheimer Center for Neurobiology of Stress (CNS). The NeuroImaging Tools and Resources Collaboratory (nitrc.org) holds the collection of neuroimaging resources for structural and functional MRI analyses. The unthresholded statistical maps, atlases, and parcellations of the brain can be publically stored and accessed with interactive visualization in the Neurovault public repository (neruovault.org). The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) -oasis-brains.org -is a project focused on creating neuroimaging datasets of the brain publically available to the research community. The functional and structural MRI datasets of the human brain can be accessed from the OpenfMRI project which has been moved to openneuro.org. The BrainCloud (braincloud.jhmi.edu) is a biologist-friendly and freely available application which supports gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex. The Major Depressive Disorder Neuroimaging Database (MaND) holds the database and meta-analysis information in an Excel VOLUME 6, 2018 spreadsheet file which can be accessed freely from the server (depressiondatabase.org) [16] "}, {"section_title": "3) DATABASES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES", "text": "The 3D reconstruction of a complete brain from cell-body stained histology section images obtained with the highest resolution at 20 \u00b5m is available only for research in the bigbrain.loris.ca. The aim of the NeuroElectro project (neuroelectro.org) is to reproduce information about the electrophysiological properties of different neuron types from the available literature and keep them into a centralized database. The structural MRI volumes, the multimodal data (EEG, cell and field recordings), and the demographics can be obtained for education and research purposes from the Open MEG Archive (OMEGA) from mcgill.ca server which is maintained by McConnell Brain Imaging Centre from Canada. The ECoG public domain datasets are available from neurotycho.org without registration only for academic and research purposes. The Brain Machine Interface Platform (BMI-PF) contains BCI-related data which are handy for academic, research and experimental purposes [16] , [17] ."}, {"section_title": "B. DNS RESPONSE TIME COMPUTATION", "text": "The main role of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol (Layer 5 in TCP/IP) is to obtain the IP address of the given host name. The DNS lies on the top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP, Layer 4 in TCP/IP) rather than Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) due to many DNS query interactions among the DNS servers to get the response as shown in Figure 2 . For example, to obtain the IP address of the ''physionet.org'' server, the DNS query can be propagated as follows: Laptop -to -local DNS server; then local DNS server -to -root DNS server to get the information about org DNS server; then the local DNS server -to -org DNS server to obtain the information about the authoritative DNS server; then the local DNS server -to -authoritative DNS server in which the IP address of ''physionet.org'' (128.30.30.88) is available. Then, this DNS response is propagated back to the local DNS server, and this IP address is propagated back to the client finally from the local DNS server [7] . "}, {"section_title": "1) DNS RESPONSE TIME COMPUTATION USING WIRESHARK", "text": "In practice, in this study, the DNS response time is computed using the Wireshark tool. For example, the query to obtain the IP address of the server ''www.physionet.org'' and the response from the server snapshots are shown in Figure 3 . It reveals that there are two answer resource records (RRs) namely the CNAME (canonical name) and the IP address returned as the response to the DNS query. The CNAME is physionet.org; the IP address is 128.30.30.88. The response time (61.989 ms) is displayed by selecting the packet number 16 as shown in Figure 4 . "}, {"section_title": "C. HTTP RESPONSE TIME COMPUTATION", "text": "Once the IP address of the remote server is identified using DNS protocol, the Client can initiate the TCP connection on the port number ''80'' of the server as shown in Figure 5 . Then the Server may acknowledge this request to the Client; hence the one round-trip time (RTT) is involved in this action. Then again the Client may send again the acknowledgment plus the web page request to the Server. The server may respond to the query raised by the Client with one more RTT. Finally, the transmission time involved which depends on the file size or the number of objects involved in the requested web page. Figure 6 portrays the above-said sequence of activities [6] , [7] . "}, {"section_title": "1) HTTP RESPONSE TIME COMPUTATION USING WIRESHARK", "text": "In practice, in this study, the HTTP response time is computed using the Wireshark tool. For example, the query to obtain the web page from the server ''www.crcn.ulb.ac.be'' -Center for Research in Cognition and Neurosciences and the response from the server snapshots are shown in Figure 7 . In Figure, the packet number 82 is the HTTP GET request; the packet number 134 is the HTTP OK message with the response time as 894.861 ms. "}, {"section_title": "D. ICMP ECHO/REPLY ROUND-TRIP AVERAGE TIME COMPUTATION", "text": "To know the remote Server whether it is reachable or not, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets can be sent from the Client; if it is reachable, the ICMP reply/response packets will be sent back to the Clint from the remote Server as shown in Figure 8 .

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "For the preliminary discussions, the queries are sent to various Servers throughout the globe from the Client which is located in Southern India. The sixteen US-based Servers, the ten UKbased Servers, and the five Servers from other countries are investigated in this work to compute the DNS, HTTP, and ICMP response times. Figure 12 shows the DNS and HTTP response times for the 16 US based servers about brain signal/image and neurological signals. It reveals that the servers such as ''neuromorphor.org'' and the ADNI database require more HTTP response time due to many objects (images, GIFs, etc.) available on the home page. Also, for some servers (oasis-brains.org, painrepository.org, etc.), the DNS response time is higher than the HTTP response time due to the many query/response interactions among DNS servers. And for some servers (neuromorpho.org, ADNI database, etc.), the HTTP response time is greater than the DNS response time due to the nearby located authoritative DNS servers (maybe). Figure 13 shows the DNS and HTTP response times on UK based Web Servers. Figure 14 shows the DNS and HTTP response times on other countries based Web Servers."}, {"section_title": "A.

RESULTS OF ICMP ECHO/REPLY AVERAGE TIMES 1) ON US-BASED WEB SERVERS", "text": "The 100 ICMP echo packets are sent to the Web Servers, and the ICMP reply packets are propagated back to the Client from Server to obtain the average time. Figure 15 shows the ICMP echo/reply average times for the eleven US-based servers. The lowest and the highest average time are obtained from the limpsproject.com and the neuromorpho.org Servers respectively. Also, results reveal that the other five US-based Servers namely ADNI, neurovault.org, oasis-brains.org, and openfmri.org do not support (accept) ICMP packets even though the Servers are active due to the security reasons. Figure 16 shows the ICMP echo/reply average times for the twelve servers (eight UK-based and four other countries based).
