The prevalence of both conditions increases with age, contributing to rising healthcare costs. Preventive measures potentially have a large impact on health in older aged individuals but must target the earliest detectable stages of these conditions to be effective [3, 4] .\nThe kidneys and brain share some physiological features that may render them susceptible to similar pathological processes. In particular, they both have low-impedance vascular beds that may be affected by high blood pressure and increased pulsatile flow, causing tissue injury. A clear association between overt kidney failure and dementia has been reported [5] , and evidence of an association between early stages of cognitive impairment and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been presented [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nHowever, limited data are available on GFR and cognitive function in the general population [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] . An association between variations in GFR and reduced cognitive function in the healthy general population may indicate the existence of a very early disease stage with common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the dysfunction in both organs. This finding would represent an opportunity to develop preventive interventions. However, few studies of cognitive function and GFR have been conducted in the normal population, and their results are conflicting [5, 11, 15, 16] , possibly because they all assessed kidney function by estimating GFR from serum creatinine levels. This methodology may have biased the results, because GFR estimates are imprecise for GFR values in the normal range, and creatinine is influenced by non-GFR determinants that are also associated with vascular disease [17] [18] [19] [20] .\nIn the present study, we investigated the association between measured GFR (mGFR) and reduced performance on cognitive tests in healthy persons. We also investigated the same relationships with albuminuria as an additional measure of kidney dysfunction. Our aim was to identify an early stage of low-grade impairments in both the brain and the kidneys in the general population. We used a cross-sectional design to analyze data from the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey in Troms\u00f8 6 (RENIS-T6) and concurrent results of cognitive tests from the sixth wave of the Troms\u00f8 Study."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "The present study is based on the RENIS-T6 [21, 22] .

The Troms\u00f8 Study is a series of population-based surveys in the municipality of Troms\u00f8, North Norway. In this investigation, data from RENIS-T6 were coupled with results of cognitive testing conducted during the main part of the T6.\nThe sixth survey of the Troms\u00f8 Study was conducted in 2007 and 2008, with a total of 12,984 women and men participating.

Narrow confidence intervals for the beta coefficients in the regression models argue against any clinically significant associations of mGFR or ACR with performance on the cognitive tests.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the association between cognitive and kidney function in the general population has not previously been investigated using mGFR. However, estimated GFR (eGFR) has been used in some cross-sectional population-based studies [6, 13, 33, 34] . The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study, the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study all reported associations between an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , i.e., manifest CKD, and reduced performance on cognitive tests [13, [34] [35] [36] . The Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study reported that participants with eGFR < 60 ml/min/ 1.73m 2 had decreased performance within specific domains of cognition compared with participants with eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 [34] . They used a battery of neuropsychological tests organized into theoretically cognitive domains which is more extensive than the five different cognitive tests used in our study [34] . An association between eGFR in the normal range and cognitive function was not observed in the NHANES III [35] and was not examined in the Health, Aging, and Body Values are presented as n (%), means \u00b1 SD, or medians (interquartile ranges).

Table 4 Results of the multivariate linear regression analysis using the urinary ACR as the independent variable and performances on the different cognitive test as the dependent variables Composition study, the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal study or the Cardiovascular Health Study [13, 34, 36] . Consistent with the results of the present study, neither the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study nor the Maastricht Study observed associations between performance on cognitive tests and eGFR in the general population in the Netherlands [6, 37] . In contrast, both of these studies did report associations between albuminuria and cognitive dysfunction. However, in the PREVEND study, the association was present only in persons younger than 48 years and not in the age group included in the present study. Also, the PREVEND study used the Ruff Figural Fluency Test which is supposed to be more sensitive than the tests included in our study [6] .\nIn the Maastricht Study, only information processing speed was associated with albuminuria, predominantly in older individuals [37] . Since we did not test the information processing speed and our sample included younger subjects, the results are not directly comparable.\nLongitudinal studies have reported conflicting results. According to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, longitudinal increases in creatinine concentrations with increasing age were associated with more rapid decline in performance on several cognitive measures [33] . However, the calculation of eGFR using creatinine-or cystatin c-based equations is imprecise, particularly for GFR values in the normal or near-normal range [17] . In another study, Wang et al. did not observe an association between cognitive decline and mildly decreased baseline eGFR (60-89 ml/min/m 2 ) compared to an eGFR greater than 90 ml/min/m 2 after adjusting for albuminuria and other risk factors [15] . Davey et al. measured longitudinal changes in cognitive function on eGFR in a population without dementia and end-stage-renal disease. They reported that decline in cognitive function was associated with decline in renal function [5] . However, the two specific cognitive domains that declined longitudinally in association with a decline in the eGFR were similarities (abstract reasoning) and verbal memory, and since our tests did not specifically test these domains the results are not directly comparable. Helmer et al. examined eGFR as a continuous variable across the whole range of eGFR values in the general population and did not observe an association between baseline eGFR and the incidence of dementia [16] .\nThe paradoxical association between increasing mGFR and worse performance on the Digit Symbol substitution Test was attenuated when the subjects' education levels were added to the model. Both better kidney function and better education are believed to be associated with better health, including cognitive function. Previous studies have treated education as a confounder [5-7, 9, 13, 34-36] , implying that education affects both the outcome of cognitive tests and GFR. An alternative view is that the test is a measure of cognitive ability, which is also a partial determinant of education level. Based on this assumption, education would not be a confounder and should not be adjusted for in statistical analyses.\nConsistent with our findings, Rogne et al. found that a higher eGFR predicted slightly worse performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. After adjusting for education and other confounders, the association was attenuated but still statistically significant [11] . Two other studies that adjusted for education suggest that the relationship between GFR and cognitive function may be biphasic, with cognitive dysfunction associated with both a low (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and high GFR (\u2265 90 ml/ min/1.73 m 2 ) [37, 38] . However, these studies used eGFR rather than mGFR. Creatinine-based eGFR may overestimate GFR because of reduced muscle mass. In older patients, high eGFR may result from reduced muscle mass rather than hyperfiltration. Nevertheless, according to other epidemiological evidence, abnormally high GFR levels in non-diabetic persons may be a risk factor for disease. Hyperfiltration is associated with prediabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors [39, 40] , and it may also confer an increased risk for cardiovascular disease [32, 41, 42] .\nThe ACR in our study was also considerably lower than the ratios observed in studies that reported an association with cognitive impairment. In a recent meta-analysis, Georgakis et al. found a clear association between cognitive impairment and albuminuria, defined as an ACR greater than 3.4 mg/mmol. However, when the ACR was analyzed as a continuous variable, the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia was very low for ACRs that were slightly higher than values corresponding to the ACRs observed in the present study (odds ratio of approximately 1.03 for ACR 0.5 to 1.0 mg/mmol) [12] . Our study may have had insufficient power to detect an even smaller effect.\nAlthough the association between manifest CKD and cognitive dysfunction is well established, this study did not identify an early stage of impairment in both the brain and the kidneys. Our study population comprised middle-aged participants with normal or only low-grade impairments in both organs. Although an age-related decrease in GFR was identified in most participants, the cognitive changes may have been too small to be detected. The five different cognitive tests are thoroughly validated, but we cannot exclude the possibility that their sensitivity was too low to detect early stages of cognitive deficit. However, when testing for interactions of age with mGFR and ACR, we did not find evidence that increasing age changed the association with performance on the cognitive tests. Despite the similarities between the vascular beds of the two organs, one possible implication of this negative finding is that the pathophysiological processes behind age-related changes in the kidney are distinct from those responsible for cognitive impairment. This hypothesis may also partially explain the positive findings in populations where prevalent comorbidity may affect both organs.\nBecause we identified a relationship between mGFR, performance on cognitive tests and education, we performed a hypothesis-generating investigation of the association between mGFR and education (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). A highly statistically significant inverse relationship between mGFR and education was observed, such that the highest level of education was associated with a 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 lower mGFR (p = 0.001) after adjusting for several possible confounders. This finding was unexpected but may be explained by a lower prevalence of renal hyperfiltration with increasing education level. This result must be interpreted with caution, as the analysis was not specified in our original project protocol.\nThe most important strength of this study is the use of mGFR instead of eGFR, and the use of three urine samples for measuring median ACR. However, we were unable to study the effect of ethnicity because our study population included only Caucasians. The cross-sectional design limits any causal inferences, but our aim was to identify a state with low-grade dysfunction of both the brain and the kidneys rather than to study causal relationships."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We did not observe associations of mGFR or ACR with performance on the five different cognitive tests in healthy participants aged 50-62 years who were representative of the general population.
