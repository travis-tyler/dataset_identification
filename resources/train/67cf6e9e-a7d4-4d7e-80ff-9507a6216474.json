The research protocol was approved by Duke University's Institutional Review Board (IRB), and parental consent was obtained. The three surveys were encoded with a number to protect confidentiality. The pre-survey was given to the participants as part of the registration packet, approximately two months before the event. The post-survey was administered to the participants at the end of the day of the event. The follow-up survey was mailed to the participants' homes approximately three months after the event with a stamped and addressed return envelope included. Each participant assessed her own interest, knowledge, and confidence in math, science, and engineering on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = weakest, 10 = strongest) on the pre-survey, post-survey, and follow-up survey. In addition to the aforementioned items, the post-survey and follow-up survey contained other questions to assess the effectiveness of the event. Sample questions from the surveys are shown below (Table 2) , and the complete surveys can be found in the Appendix. 3.

The mean participant rating and standard deviation for each category were calculated. Repeated measure ANOVAs (analysis of variance between groups) were conducted to detect differences in ratings provided in the pre-, post-, and follow-up surveys in measures of self-perceived interest, confidence, and knowledge in each of the STEM subjects. When main effects were significant, post hoc tests were performed for specific pairwise comparisons, adjusted with least significant difference for multiple comparisons. A subset of students participated in the Capstone event two years in a row (2008 and 2009 ). To analyze a change in interest, confidence, and knowledge in STEM subjects, a repeated measures ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons were performed with responses from students who participated in the FEMMES Capstone event for two consecutive years (Fig. 1) . To analyze mean participant ratings collapsed across pre-, post-, and follow-up surveys for each grade cohort, a mixed ANOVA followed by a Scheffe's test were performed. Lastly, using responses on the post-survey, the median participant ratings for each faculty-led activity held in both consecutive years were calculated to determine the enjoyment of the activities.

Mean responses of female participants for self-perceived interest, confidence, and knowledge of math, science, and engineering on pre-, post-, and follow- up surveys are summarized in Table 3 (N = 124-138). Significant main effects (either linear or quadratic) were found by repeated measures ANOVA for all measures with the exception of one marginally significant main effect (quadratic) on interest in math [F(1,135) = 2.881, p = 0.092]. Following the ANOVA, pairwise comparisons were made for all measures. There was a significant increase in participant ratings in interest, confidence, and knowledge from pre-survey to post-survey for all three subject areas (Table 3) . Students also reported significantly greater confidence and knowledge in all three subject areas and in interest in science in the follow-up survey compared to the pre-survey. In a few cases, there was a significant decrease in ratings that occurred between the post-survey and the follow-up survey three months later; this decrease occurred in interest in science and interest in engineering."}, {"section_title": "Self-Reported Attitudes Based on Grade Level", "text": "To examine whether self-perceived ratings differed depending on the grade of the participants, analysis using a series of mixed ANOVAs (with repeated measures) was used.

Further post hoc analyses revealed that interest in science and engineering and confidence in engineering all declined as the girls got older (see Table 5 for the mean participant ratings in each grade at each survey time). More specifically, 6th-grade girls reported lower ratings for their interest in science and engineering compared to their 4th-grade counterparts. In addition, 6th-grade girls reported less confidence in engineering compared to 5th-grade girls.

In almost all cases, post-survey responses were higher than pre-survey responses, with small declines in ratings over the next three months. For girls who attended the Capstone event in two consecutive years, they sustained their increase in interest and knowledge of engineering during this time period. Furthermore, analysis of ratings by girls in the grade subsets revealed a trend of decreasing interest from grade four to six. "}, {"section_title": "Impact of FEMMES Capstone on Interest, Confidence, and Knowledge of STEM Subjects", "text": "Interest, knowledge, and confidence of all three subjects showed significant increases from pre-survey to post-survey. Post-surveys are completed by the participants after immersion in a full day of STEM activities. Thus all of the excitement and emotion is still fresh in their minds so it is not surprising that their ratings increased immediately at the end of the event. These results support those that we previously found in the first cohort of the FEMMES Capstone program (Weston et al., 2008) . In that study, no follow-up surveys were administered, precluding any conclusions about persistence of the girls' attitudes. Here we show that generally, girls' attitudes were higher during the follow-up period than prior to the event, with the exception of interest in science and engineering, which declined slightly. While these results are encouraging in general, the slight loss of interest in science and engineering over the three months is not entirely surprising. It is possible that after leaving the excitement of an immersive one-day event, the feelings of interest may have subsided. If so, a program in which girls have more long-term exposure to science and engineering activities would reverse this decline, further discussed below and in the companion paper by Chen et al. (2011) . We were most interested in the comparison of mean participant ratings between the presurvey and the follow-up survey. This analysis provides information on the \"long-term\" effects of the FEMMES Capstone event. Interest in engineering; confidence in math, science, and engineering; and knowledge of math, science, and engineering showed significant increases in mean participant ratings from pre-survey to follow-up survey. Although these changes were significant, the improvements were small in some cases. This is not surprising given the limited experience (i.e., one day) in which the girls participated. Interestingly, 16 students returned the following year, and they demonstrated a large increase in interest and knowledge in engineering and an increasing trend in all remaining measures (unpublished observations). Thus it is possible that a more sustained experience that engages the girls in fun, hands-on activities in the STEM areas may result in a more pronounced increase in interest, knowledge, and confidence. To this end, we have developed a year-long afterschool program (see accompanying paper by Chen et al., 2011) , as well as a weeklong summer day camp on Duke's campus. We are continuing to collect data before and after these programs to assess whether the multiple exposure and longer-lasting format will increase interest in, and confidence and knowledge of the STEM areas. In addition to limited exposure, there may have been several other factors that limited our ability to demonstrate significant improvement in students' ratings. First, the only areas that failed to show a significant change from pre-survey to follow-up survey were interest in math and interest in science. One possible explanation for the absence of a significant increase in interest in math is that not every participant attended a math activity since there were not enough faculty-led math activities at the Capstone event. Thus we did not have the power to detect increases in interest in math interest over time.\nAnother factor that may preclude detection of more robust changes over time is a \"ceiling effect\" in the participants' ratings. Since 10 is the highest possible rating, many students who start out at a 10 could not demonstrate a higher rating for the follow-up survey, even though they may have more positive attitudes. To control for the ceiling effect, we recommend including retrospective questions on the follow-up survey that allow participants to assess qualitatively whether their interest in science, for example, has decreased, stayed the same, or increased. Providing additional questions that assess interest, confidence, and knowledge for math, science, and engineering would not only help control for the ceiling effect but would also enable an assessment of the reliability. Since our survey only had one question assessing interest, confidence, and knowledge for each construct, we did not have sufficient questions to conduct a reliability test.\nThird, a potential source of error is that parents may tell their daughters to circle 10s on the pre-survey in hopes that it will be more likely for them to be selected for the program (though we do state that our selection process is on a first-come, first-served basis). For the follow-up survey, perhaps the girls then put down how they really feel about these subject areas. This problem would show an artificial decrease or an increase of a smaller magnitude.\nThere are two other limitations of our study. One is the potential for a non-response bias. All participants submitted completed pre-surveys as part of their registration packet. Three months after the event, we sent follow-up surveys to the participants via postal mail, with a stamped and addressed return envelope. However, in 2008, only 97 out of 230 (42%) returned the follow-up survey. Perhaps girls who were compelled to fill out the follow-up surveys and mail them back were those girls who were impacted more substantially by the Capstone event and had strong opinions, positive or negative. Although it is possible that demographic differences could explain differences in response rate and outcomes, this is unlikely since the demographic characteristics of our participating population were fairly homogenous (i.e., African American girls).\nSecond, we did not have a randomized-controlled design to detect the impact of the Capstone event on girls' knowledge and attitudes about the STEM areas. Thus we could not control for the contribution of natural increases in knowledge and attitudes due to learning in school that could have occurred regardless of attendance at the Capstone event. However, because students begin to lose interest in STEM fields in middle school (Gibson and Chase, 2002; Speering and Rennie, 1996; Gonzales et al., 2003) -and this is especially true for girls (Jones et al., 2000) , we suggest that the significant increases in mean participant ratings from pre-survey to follow-up survey were not likely a consequence of natural improvement (or even a test/retest phenomenon) but more conceivably an effect of the Capstone program itself."}, {"section_title": "Grade Level and Students' Attitudes About STEM Subjects", "text": "We were interested in determining whether the FEMMES Capstone event has a greater impact in one particular grade over the others. However, no significant interactions were found between the sequential survey testing results and grade of the participants. Although the number of participants was reasonable, it is still possible that the number of participants was too small to detect a significant difference. However, we did detect differences in the main effects of grade. The 6th-grade girls reported less interest in science and engineering and confidence in engineering compared to their younger peers. These findings agree with previous studies in which students report less interest and enjoyment in STEM domains by the time they enter high school (Alspaugh, 1998; Speering and Rennie, 1996) . Speering and Rennie's longitudinal study in 1996 found students to be less enthusiastic about science early in secondary school than they were at the end of primary school. According to the third Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Gonzales et al., 2003) findings, 4th-grade achievement scores in science and math in the United States were significantly higher than the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) international scale average while 8th-grade scores were only marginally higher. This drop in relative performance reflects the decline of interest in math and science as middle school students in the United States progress into higher levels of education. The middle school curriculum that exists in the United States has been criticized for lack of rigor and coherence that are typical of curricula in other countries (Gonzales et al., 2003) .\nWith the focus of our study on female participants, our results also agree with previous studies in which there is a gradual decline of interest in science in young females. Speering and Rennie (1996) found a striking drop in positive survey responses relating to interest and enjoyment in science in girls from 7th to 8th grade. Even though both girls and boys reported decreases in positive science attitudes, girls expressed a steeper disinterest in science throughout secondary school. Similarly, Jones et al. (2000) found that 6th-grade female students reported significantly less interest in learning about various science topics than their male peers. More females than males were also found to perceive science as difficult. Our results show that sometime before 6th grade, girls are already starting to lose interest in science and engineering. This can result from the physiological and mental changes during middle school years when girls and boys enter puberty and gender stereotypes in the physical sciences begin to solidify (Jones et al., 2000) . Consequently, late elementary school to early middle school years appear to be the critical time period to target students, especially young females, in STEM fields before their interest wavers in the subsequent years. We suggest that even a one-day FEMMES Capstone experience that targets late elementary school girls may provide them with the \"hook\" that will help to promote their interest and learning in the STEM fields."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The results from the 2008 and 2009 Capstone events suggest that hands-on workshops and female-to-female mentorship excite young girls about the potential for success in STEM fields. The trends in our data also indicate the potential for a more significant impact through long-term outreach programs, which has led us to develop a six-week-long afterschool program (see ac-companying paper by Chen et al., 2011) and a weeklong summer camp. With these three components, the FEMMES program aims to engage young females in STEM fields early on in their academic career in hope that they will continue to explore these subjects in secondary school and throughout the rest of their education.
