[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) is the most pathogenic arbovirus endemic to the United States. EEEV primarily infects birds but can be fatal to humans, horses, and some other mammals. Although EEEV transmission occurs in the Northeastern, Southeastern, and Midwestern United States, the largest number of horse and human cases have been reported in Florida, the only state where transmission occurs year round. Currently, a GIS-based risk index (RI) model is used to map EEE transmission risk to horses in Florida. This study validates that RI model using a 5-yr dataset of horse cases in Florida. RI values were similar between summer (N = 152, x = 0.59) and winter (N = 25, x = 0.66) cases, suggesting the model is effective for mapping risk during both transmission seasons. These risk values were larger and remained similar when a 100-m buffer was applied to the case locations to account for modest spatial errors in case reporting (summer x = 0.73, winter x = 0.77). In both comparisons, RI values for summer and winter cases were higher than expected at random in the Panhandle, North, and Central regions of the state, although the analysis was inconclusive in the South, where only two cases were observed. This suggests the RI map could be used to target EEEV surveillance, prevention, and control efforts in both transmission seasons in Florida."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) is an alphavirus of the Togovirus family. EEEV primarily infects birds, with infection of mammalian hosts occurring as a spillover from the typical enzootic cycle. Cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) disease in humans are quite rare, averaging seven per year nationwide, although infections in horses are much more common (CDC 2017) . Despite these trends, EEEV remains the most pathogenic arbovirus endemic to the United States. The case fatality rate of human cases of EEE exceeds 35%, with most survivors suffering severe long-term neurological complications (Villari et al. 1995) .\nEEEV is endemic throughout most of the Eastern United States, with the majority of both horse and human cases clustered in the eastern coastal states, though the endemic region extends as far west as Wisconsin (CDC). In the northeast, Massachusetts and New York have seen the greatest amount of EEEV activity (USDA 2017) . The amount of viral activity in the Northeastern United States has increased during the past few years in New England and New York (Gibney et al. 2011 , USGS 2012 , Lubelczyk et al. 2013 , and the virus may be increasing its range in New England, with the first documented EEEV activity occurring in Maine in 2009 and in Vermont in 2010 (Berl et al. 2013 ).\nIn the Northeast, EEEV transmission is temporally and spatially sporadic. Viral transmission is quite seasonal, with activity generally confined to the summer months. In addition, transmission foci of EEEV are stable for only a few years at a time (Armstrong et al. 2008 , Young et al. 2008 , with intervening periods of apparent absence of the virus. How the virus survives the winter and how it is re-introduced into foci have been nagging questions in the study of EEEV ecology. However, phylogenetic analyses of EEEV strains in the U.S. demonstrated that isolates from Northeastern United States are closely related to isolates circulating at approximately the same time in Florida (Armstrong et al. 2008 , Young et al. 2008 , White et al. 2011b . This suggests that Florida may serve as a geographic reservoir of EEEV. These data suggest that EEEV is periodically introduced to the Northeastern states from Florida through a mechanism that remains undefined. It has been suggested that migrating birds wintering in the Southern United States periodically reintroduce EEEV into the Northeast (Blosser et al. 2017) . Once of Medical Entomology, 55(5), 2018 , 1143 -1149 doi: 10.1093 Advance Access Publication Date: 2 May 2018 Research Article introduced, the virus is able to maintain itself for varying periods through an over-wintering mechanism. Recent studies support the hypothesis that this over-wintering mechanism may involve hibernating snakes (White et al. 2011a , Graham et al. 2012 . These data, when taken together, support a model in which EEEV is periodically introduced into the Northeastern states from Florida, via migrating birds or some other mechanism, which serves as a permanent reservoir of the virus. Once introduced into a focus in the Northeastern United States, EEEV is capable of maintaining itself through several seasons, possibly over-wintering in infected snakes."}, {"section_title": "Journal", "text": "Florida displayed the largest number of human cases of EEE during 1964-2017 (USDA 2017) (Bigler et al. 1976 ), including 10 from 2007 to 2016 (CDC 2017 . Apart from presenting a large number of cases and serving as the potential reservoir for EEEV for the Northeastern United States, Florida is unique in that it is the only state in which EEEV transmission occurs year-round. EEEV activity in Florida exhibits two distinct peaks of activity with a major peak occurring in May-June and a minor peak occurring in December and January (DOH 2017). The wintertime peak coincides with a peak in the populations of two species of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): Culiseta (Cs.) melanura (Coquillett), the major enzootic vector of EEEV in the Northeastern United States, and Culex erraticus (Dyar and Knab), a major vector of EEEV in the Southeastern United States (Bingham et al. 2014) . The major avian hosts fed upon by both species in Florida included wading birds and cardinals, both of which have been implicated as potentially important reservoirs of EEEV in other studies conducted in Alabama (Hassan et al. 2003 , Estep et al. 2013 ).\nIf it is true that EEEV is only maintained continuously in Florida through year round transmission unique to this state and that Florida is the reservoir of the virus for the Northeastern states, this suggests that winter transmission may represent a vulnerable point in the life cycle of the virus. If this is the case, targeted wintertime interventions might be able to interrupt transmission of EEEV, protecting not only the people of Florida, but those of the Northeastern states as well. However, for such a strategy to be practical, it is necessary to fully understand the habitats in which EEEV transmission occurs, particularly during wintertime, and be able to predict where those habitats occur.\nAlthough human cases of EEE are relatively infrequent, horse cases are frequently documented in Florida, sometimes more than 200 per year (USDA 2017). Similar to humans, horses function as dead end hosts for the virus and can be used to monitor EEE transmission. Previous work in Florida identified habitats associated with EEEV transmission to horses (Vander Kelen et al. 2012a ). Based on that analysis, Vander Kelen et al. (2014) developed a risk index (RI) model to predict EEEV transmission to horses in Florida based on habitat composition and configuration. Although the model was validated with documented horse cases of EEEV from 2004 and 2011, it has yet to be tested using a longer term data set. Additionally, studies have not explored how the model might perform differently for winter and summer transmission, which might indicate differences in habitats associated with seasonal transmissions. Therefore, the objective of this article was to validate the index model using documented horse cases over a 5-yr period, 2012 to 2016, and determine if the model performs differently by season."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RI Model Application", "text": "A spatially explicit RI model was developed by Vander Kelen et al. (2014) to predict EEEV transmission risk to horses in Florida. The model was derived from analyses of the habitats associated with EEEV transmission in Florida during 2005 -2010 (Vander Kelen et al. 2012b . The model utilizes land use/land cover data to assess risk at any location in a map using a continuous scale from 0.0 (no risk) to 1.0 (maximum risk). Risk is assessed at each individual raster, or grid, cell in a map based on the cover type of the cell, as well as the composition and configuration of cover types in nearby cells. The model assesses risk based on five individual risk variables (RV1-RV5) which are combined mathematically to produce an overall RI value. The index is computed as follows for each individual cell in the map.\nRV1 measures EEEV transmission risk to horses based on the local habitat. RV1 is based the cover type of focal cell (i.e., the cell being evaluated). RV1 values are assigned according to Fig. 1a , where higher values are assigned to those cover types where horses with EEEV were most likely to be found. Low-density residential RV2 measures risk based on wetland proximity, a factor shown to be associated with EEEV transmission (Wilson et al. 1986 , Vander Kelen et al. 2012a . RV2 is calculated based on the distance between the focal cell and the nearest cell classified as wetland, as shown in Fig. 1b . Distances less than 400 m receive the highest risk of 1.0, while those further than 1,500 m receive a zero. Distances between 400 and 1,500 m are assigned values between 0 and 1, inversely proportional to the distance. The threshold of 1,500 m corresponds to the distance that many of bridge vector mosquito species commonly disperse (Morris et al. 1991 , Estep et al. 2014 .\nRV3 measures risk based on wetland composition a factor shown to be associated with EEEV transmission (Moncayo et al. 2000) . RV3 is calculated based on the proportion of cells within 1,500 m of the focal cell that are classified as wetland, as shown in Fig. 1c . Proportions greater than 0.18 are assigned a 1.0, while those less than 0.18 are assigned a value between 0 and 1, proportional to the amount detected. Cells not surrounded by any wetlands within 1,500 m receive a value of 0.\nRV4 measures risk based on tree plantation-coniferous forest proximity, a factor shown to be associated with EEEV transmission to horses in Florida (Vander Kelen et al. 2012a,b) . RV4 is calculated based on the distance between the focal cell and the nearest cell classified as coniferous forest, as shown in Fig. 1d . Distances less than 250 m receive the highest risk of 1.0, while those further than 1,500 m receive a zero. Distances between 250 and 1,500 m are assigned values between 0 and 1, inversely proportional to the distance.\nRV5 measures risk based on tree-plantation coniferous forest composition a factor shown to be associated with EEEV transmission to horses (Vander Kelen et al. 2012a,b) . RV5 is calculated based on the proportion of cells within 1,500 m of the focal cell that are classified as coniferous forest (Fig. 1e ). Proportions greater than 0.20 are assigned a 1.0, while those less than 0.20 are assigned a value between 0 and 1, proportional to the amount detected. Cells not surrounded by any coniferous within 1,500 m receive a value of 0.\nThe overall RI value is computed using the following equation:\n. RV1 is multiplied by the average of the remaining risk values such that only cells with cover types likely to support horses can receive relatively high risk values in the final map. Averaging RV2-RV5 assures that cells located in close proximity to an abundance of both wetlands and coniferous forests receive the highest risk values. For more information on the development of the index model, please consult (Vander Kelen et al. 2014 ). The RI model was applied using land use/land cover data obtained from Florida's five Water Management Districts (WMDs), which collectively encompass the state exclusive of the Everglades. The index model was ran using the most recent land use/land cover data, an update from of the layers used by Vander Kelen et al. (2014), using identical classification schemes: Northwest Florida WMD 2013, South Florida WMD 2008, St. John's River WMD 2009 updated in 2012, Suwannee River WMD 2014, and Southwest Florida WMD 2011. This dataset includes land use and cover classified at four levels, with Level 1 being the most general and Level 4 being the most specific. This study utilized Level 2 descriptions, as they differentiated between various wetland types and residential classes which were necessary for the model. The 42 Level 2 classes were aggregated into 14 mutually exclusive classes relevant to the model. For RV2 and RV3, wetlands included any cover types classified as wetlands under the Level 1 classification, including wetland hardwood forests, wetland coniferous forest, vegetated non-forested wetland, and wetland mixed forest. For RV4 and RV5, the tree plantation-coniferous forest included Level 2 classes: tree plantations and upland coniferous forests. All datasets were converted to 30 m resolution and merged for analysis. The RI model was applied using a geographic information system (GIS), ArcMap v. 10.5 (ESRI, Inc.), to produce a map of RI values."}, {"section_title": "RI Validation", "text": "The RI model was validated using reported horse cases from 2012 to 2016. Locations of 177 of 178 documented cases were georeferenced using coordinates provided by the Florida Department of Health; location of the single remaining case was unknown and not included in the analysis. County incidence rates were calculated from horse population estimates obtained from the 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture and mapped to explore spatial patterns. The U.S. Census of Agriculture is intended to measure a complete count of farms, ranches, and their operators. Though, participation rates are not reported they are thought to be relatively complete and represent the best data available (www.agcensus.usda.gov/About_the_Census/). Total numbers of horses in each Florida county from 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture Table 18 , Equine Inventory and Sales, were used to calculate county incidence rates (cases per 1,000 horses). Season of transmission was assigned to each case based on the reporting date, where winter was considered October through February and summer March through September. These seasonal definitions roughly correspond to the timing of the equinoxes are standard in studies of arboviruses in Florida (e.g., Burkett-Cadena et al. 2015) .\nIntermediate risk variables and the overall RI associated with summer and winter cases were compared to one another using a two-sample t-test. The maximum final risk value within 100 m of case locations was also recorded, as that measure better accounts for spatial error in case reporting than the exact location. Spatial error can be caused by several factors, such as differences between the geocoded address for the case and the location of the actual transmission site or movement of a horse on a particular property. A 100-m buffer was selected in previous studies as a relatively conservative distance to evaluate whether horse cases were located in close proximity to areas mapped as high risk. The risk model was validated by comparing the RI values associated with the case locations with those for randomly generated points. The analysis was completed both using the index values at the mapped location and the maximum value within a 100-m error buffer of the location. First, the cases were sorted by the four regions of the state (Panhandle, North, Central, and South) to control for regional variations in habitat and virus transmission. Within each region, a set of random points of the same number of observed cases was generated. Then, the risk values were extracted for those random points in the same manner as for the observed cases. This process was repeated 100 times to generate a distribution of random index values for comparison to the observed cases. T-tests were used to determine if the observed cases differed from expected at random for each region, as is standard for Monte Carlo types of comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "During 2012 to 2016, at least 40 cases of EEE in horses were reported each year in Florida, with the largest number documented during 2014 (Table 1) . Incidence rates (cases per 1,000 horses) were generally higher for counties in the Panhandle and North regions compared to the Central and South (Fig. 2) . Of the 177 locatable cases, 152 were reported during summer and 25 during winter.\nWinter transmission was observed largely in the Panhandle and North, with only one case found in the Central region and zero in the South. Winter cases were highest during 2012 and 2013.\nState-wide trends (with the exception of the excluded Everglades region) in EEEV risk variables and the overall RI are illustrated in Fig. 3 , although local variation in risk is largely masked at this broad scale. Figure 4 maps the same for Marion County, the county with the highest number of horse cases, illustrating spatial variation in risk at a larger cartographic scale. RV1 maps habitats associated with horses, showing relatively high availability across all four regions of the state, with pockets of low availability associated with densely populated urban areas, large lakes, and expanses of scrubland, swamp, and other cover types less likely to support horses. High values for RV2 are widespread, as much of the state is proximal to at least one wetland. RV3 shows a greater amount of spatial variation associated with wetland abundance, although high-risk areas are widespread. RV4 and RV5, reflective of coniferous forest proximity and abundance, show distinct concentrations of high values, particularly in the Panhandle and North. The final map displays the spatial variation in overall risk across the state. High-risk areas are found in all regions, although they are more concentrated in the Panhandle and North.\nRisk values associated with horse cases, both combined and by season, are reported in Table 2 . The means for each individual risk variable were all at least 0.7 for both seasons. The mean overall index was 0.57 for summer and 0.66 for winter, although these values increase to 0.73 and 0.77 when the small error buffer is applied. No differences in risk values or the overall RI were detected between seasons (P > 0.05), suggesting that model similarly maps EEE transmission risk to horses in summer and winter.\nOverall RI values associated with the horse cases by region are reported for both the recorded locations (Table 3 ) and the maximum values with the 100-m error buffer (Table 4) . At the observed locations, the cases averaged from 0.48 to 0.61 by region, compared to 0.17 to 0.29 for random points. When using the error buffer, the cases averaged 0.71 to 0.83 compared to 0.22 to 0.48 for random points. The observed values were significantly higher than expected at random for the Panhandle, North, and Central regions. Significant differences were not found for the South region, although the power of the test is poor with only two sample cases. As the observed cases were assigned index values almost double that of random points across all regions, this suggests the risk model is useful for identifying locations that are at risk for EEE transmission to horses. of the model is that is relatively easy to apply, as it relies only on access to commercial GIS software and publicly available land use/ land cover data. The results showed that summer and winter cases had similar RI values, which suggests the map can identify locations at high risk for EEE transmission to horses during both seasons. The resulting risk map could be used for EEEV surveillance, prevention, and outreach efforts across the state, which may make it an important tool for targeting wintertime disruption of the EEEV cycle in Florida."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Although the model assessed risk for summer and winter cases equally well, mapping the case locations reveals that they display different patterns of abundance and spatial distribution. Summer cases were far more prevalent than winter cases. Though common in the Central region, summer cases were more abundant in the Panhandle and North. Winter cases were more also concentrated in the Panhandle and North regions of the state, though some occurred in the Central region. Only two cases were observed in the South, both during summer months. Especially in the South, the model identifies substantial high-risk areas where cases are seldom observed, so the risk map does not fully explain transmission patterns. An important point to note is that this model maps risk based solely on the composition and configuration of habitat. In other words, it shows which locations have habitat features capable of or likely to support EEEV transmission to horses. However, it does not predict when transmission is likely to occur at any specific location. There are a number of factors that influence when cases are observed, and many of these vary seasonally or year-to-year. Examples include meteorological variables (e.g., rainfall, weather); climatic factors (e.g., trends in annual temperatures); vector diversity, abundance, and competency; and host availability. Other external factors can also affect transmission, such as horse vaccination rates, horse abundance, and vector control efforts, some of which are challenging to quantify. Additionally, case underreporting, which is difficult to estimate, can also limit our ability to map transmission with spatial and temporal certainty. Future work might explore how some of these factors affect transmission rates. However, the utility of the model is to identify locations with an elevated risk; when other conditions are optimal for transmission, then surveillance, prevention, and control methods can be implemented in high risk areas. For example, combining temporal models with this underlying risk map might lead to refined spatiotemporal prediction of EEEV transmission to horses in Florida, as has been previously reported for St. Louis Encephalitis and West Nile virus transmission in the state (Shaman et al. 2004 (Shaman et al. , 2005 .\nThe current risk model utilizes habitat classification to assign a relative risk for EEEV transmission to horses. However, these observed habitat patterns, on which the model is based, must reflect ecological differences present at the different sites. It is likely that the different habitats within each region of Florida will support varying compositions of mosquito populations and perhaps suitable reservoir hosts as well. Thus, it will be important to attempt to understand how mosquito vector populations and the associated reservoir hosts vary among different habitats in Florida and how these variations may effect both the temporal pattern and intensity of EEEV transmission to horses. For example, a recent study conducted in Connecticut has The maximum final risk value within 100 m of case locations are also recorded to account for spatial error in case reporting. demonstrated an association of densities of Cs. melanura (the major enzootic vector for EEEV in the Northeastern states) with deciduous and evergreen forested wetlands, and the intensity of EEEV transmission with the overall density of Cs. melanura (Skaff et al. 2017) . It should be possible to employ the risk map described here to identify sites to conduct field investigations that will permit us to understand the ecological factors that are most important in the seasonal dynamics of EEEV transmission to horses in Florida. Since the model was originally developed specifically for horses, a dead end host, it will be important to evaluate if it is valid for mapping risk to other dead end hosts, like humans or other mammals, or potentially intermediate hosts, like passerine or wading birds. For example, the model recently has been adapted to map EEEV risk to white-tailed deer in Michigan (Downs et al. 2015) . Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of the current model can be tested through field studies monitoring EEEV activity in selected areas predicted to be either high or low risk. Such studies are currently underway."}]
