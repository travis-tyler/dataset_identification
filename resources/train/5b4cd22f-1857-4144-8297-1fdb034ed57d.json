[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and expanded globally, resulting in over 82 million confirmed cases as of the end of 2020. Molecular epidemiology studies across the world have generated over 330,000 viral genomic 3 sequences, shared with unprecedented speed via the GISAID Initiative (gisaid.org). These data are essential for monitoring virus transmission and spread (Meredith et al., 2020) . Of special interest is the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, spike (S), which is responsible for viral entry via its interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor on host cells. The S protein is the target of neutralizing antibodies generated by infection or vaccination (Folegatti et al., 2020; Keech et al., 2020) as well as monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs currently in clinical trials and/or approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA Hansen et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020) .\nA SARS-CoV-2 S amino acid change, D614G, is now dominant in most places around the globe (Korber et al., 2020) . Studies in vitro indicate that this mutation confers greater infectivity while molecular epidemiology correlates it with an increase in transmissibility with no evidence to date for increased virulence (Hou et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Amino acid 614 is located outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S, the domain targeted by 90% of neutralizing antibody activity in serum of SARS-CoV-2 survivors (Piccoli et al., 2020) . Initial studies suggest that D614G viruses exhibit increased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, likely due to the effect of the mutation on the molecular dynamics of the spike protein (Hou et al., 2020; Weissman et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020) . Therefore, this now dominant variant is unlikely to jeopardize natural or vaccine-derived antibody-mediated immunity generated in response to D614 S protein.\nThe low numbers of novel mutations reaching high frequency in sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes relates to the moderate intrinsic error rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication (Li et al., 2020c; Robson et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, the increasing number of infected individuals and the large reservoir of hosts susceptible to infection increases the likelihood that novel variants that impact vaccine and therapeutic development will emerge and spread by chance. Moreover, the full impact of immune selection, which can drive variant selection, has not yet influenced the pandemic, since herd immunity has not been attained. As population immunity increases and vaccines are deployed at scale this will very likely change. The potential for circulating viral variants to derail promising vaccine or antibody-based prophylactics or treatments, even in the absence of selective pressure from the drug or vaccine, is demonstrated by the failure of a Phase III clinical trial of a mAb targeting the respiratory syncytial virus (Simoes et al., 2020) , and the need for new influenza vaccines on a yearly basis. It is therefore critical to understand whether and how SARS-CoV-2 may evolve to evade antibody-dependent immunity.\nHere, we examine the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM), the primary target of the neutralizing Ab response within the RBD (Piccoli et al., 2020) , and find it to be a highly variable region of the spike protein in circulating viruses. To understand the implications of this structural plasticity, which could allow the RBD to accommodate amino acids changes that could contribute to immune evasion, we defined the clinical and epidemiological impact, molecular features, and immune response to the RBM mutation N439K. This amino acid replacement has arisen independently multiple times, and in two cases formed lineages of more than 500 sequences. As of January 6, 2021, it was observed in 34 countries and was the second most commonly observed RBD mutation worldwide, and the sixth most common S mutation. We find that the N439K mutation results in enhanced RBD affinity for hACE2, that it is associated with a similar J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 clinical spectrum of disease and slightly higher viral loads in vivo compared to viruses with the wild-type N439 residue, and that it results in immune escape from polyclonal sera from a proportion of recovered individuals and some neutralizing mAbs. N439K provides a sentinel example of immune escape, indicating that RBM variants must be evaluated when considering vaccines and the therapeutic or prophylactic use of mAbs. Long-term control of the pandemic with vaccines will require systematic monitoring of immune escape variants and may require new vaccine preparations that address the variants circulating globally."}, {"section_title": "The RBM is a variable region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein", "text": "Competing pressures influence the evolution of the spike RBM. First, the RBM mediates viral entry (Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b) and therefore must maintain sufficient affinity to engage the entry receptor hACE2. Second, it is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (Piccoli et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020) and so would be a primary location for the emergence of immune escape mutations. We set out to understand these competing pressures by evaluating the landscape of RBM sequence divergence observed in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and in other viruses of the Sarbecovirus lineage.\nWe used re-refined published X-ray structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD:hACE2 complexes (Lan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005) to define the RBM residues using a 6 \u00c5 distance cutoff (Figures 1A-D, S1A, 2) . We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences deposited in GISAID as of November 30th, 2020 and observed a high number of variants occurring in the RBM. To understand how the variability of the RBM compares to the variability of the entire RBD and the whole spike protein, we evaluated well-defined spike protein domains: within S1, the N-Terminal Domain (NTD) and the RBD (further split into RBM and non-RBM); and the S2 domain. Analysis of entropy, which estimates sequence variability at a given position in a protein alignment, identified the RBM as a highly variable region of the RBD and of the entire S protein ( Figure 1B-D) , with a median entropy within the top 10% of equivalently sized sets of randomly sampled residues ( Figure 1B) . This result is confirmed by an analysis of sequence variability that is not weighted by total counts of each variant, thereby capturing the diversity of circulating variants with mitigated bias towards oversampled variants ( Figure S1A) .\nTo understand constraints on RBM variability, we evaluated the published deep mutational scanning (DMS) data set of the RBD (Starr et al., 2020b) and compared it to sequences of circulating viruses. The DMS data defines the effect of each possible single amino acid change on both expression of the RBD and its capacity to bind hACE2. For each position in the RBM, we compared the DMS results for all amino acid replacements at that position versus only changes that have been observed in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (Figure 2) . A subset of residues shows the largest loss of hACE2 binding upon mutation (top ~1/3 of RBM residues in Figure 2 ) and, as would be expected, few natural occurrences of mutations at these residues have been observed to be circulating. However, for the majority of the RBM (bottom ~2/3 of RBM residues in Figure 2) , variation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 in circulating virus sequences confirms the tolerance to mutation predicted by the DMS data.\nTo further assess the ability of the RBM to accommodate mutations without disrupting hACE2 binding, we examined the structural dynamics and energetics of the RBM:hACE2 binding interface. We performed an approximate, residue-level decomposition of binding free energy based on the RBD:hACE2 complex X-ray structure (green in Figure 2 ) as well as molecular dynamics simulations of the complex, resulting in ~118 \u00b5s of aggregate simulation data ( Figure S1B) . Consistent with expectation, the two residues with the highest variant frequency (S477 and N439) contribute weakly to the binding energy (Figure 2) . Surprisingly, the two RBM residues with the strongest interactions with hACE2 based on the X-ray structure (K417 and E484, dark green in Figure 2 ) were not highly conserved (variant % in red, Figure 2) , with approximately tenfold more variants for E484. This could be explained by results from the molecular dynamics simulation: K417 formed close interactions with hACE2 70% of the simulation time, while E484 only 3% of the time ( Figure S1B) . The low percent for E484 is also consistent with the non-conservative amino acid replacements observed for circulating variants, e.g., the most common E484 substitution is currently E484K, with a positivelycharged lysine substituting for the negatively-charged glutamate. Overall, these results demonstrate that the RBM has a high degree of structural plasticity whereby it is able to accommodate amino acid changes without disrupting hACE2 binding.\nEvolutionary analysis of Sarbecoviruses provides further support for RBM plasticity (Boni et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Rambaut et al., 2020) . The SARS-CoV RBM is highly divergent from the SARS-CoV-2 RBM (Figure S2A -B) while maintaining hACE2 binding affinity. Additionally, there are many sequence changes in the RBM across a panel of related coronaviruses from animal isolates ( Figure S2A -B, Table S1 ). To determine the ability of members of the Sarbecovirus lineage to bind hACE2, we produced nine recombinant RBD proteins corresponding to seven animal isolates, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV and evaluated their binding to recombinant hACE2 ( Figure S2C ). We found that three of the RBDs from animal isolates showed strong affinity for hACE2: GD Pangolin, which has a highly similar RBM to SARS-CoV-2, GX Pangolin which has a more divergent RBM, and Bat CoV WIV1 which is highly divergent (Figure S2A-B) . This further indicates that the RBM is structurally plastic, retaining binding with hACE2 as a receptor despite changes to sequence. Given this plasticity, we next considered whether an RBM variant can lead to immune evasion while retaining virulence."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis of the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 RBM mutation N439K", "text": "N439K is a prevalent RBM mutation (the second most common mutation in the RBD through the end of 2020) which was first sampled in March 2020 in Scotland from lineage B.1 on the background of D614G. Using phylogenetic analysis, we determined that the earliest reported N439K sequences represented a single SARS-CoV-2 lineage ( Figure 3A ) that increased in frequency to 542 sequences in Scotland by June 20, 2020 (~10% of the available Scottish viral genome sequences for this time period). Subsequently, numbers of N439K and all other variants decreased in Scotland concurrent with control of the pandemic after initiation of stringent public health measures, with this specific N439K lineage (designated here as lineage i) not being detected since June 2020 6 ( Figure 3B-C) . However, the N439K mutation appears in >6000 additional sequences in the GISAID database as of January 6, 2021. Our analysis demonstrates that the majority of these sequences represent a second, independent lineage (designated lineage ii) which was first sampled in Romania on May 13, 2020, then Norway on June 23, 2020, and is now detected to be circulating in 32 countries (Figure 3A-C) . N439K lineages i and ii have recently received the lineage designations B.1.141 and B.1.258, respectively . We also observe at least seven instances of the N439K mutation that have arisen independently of these two large lineages, including again in the U.S. in at least four linked infections, and in Brazil and Nigeria where no lineage ii/B.1.258 has been observed, resulting in a total of 34 countries where N439K has been detected to date (Figure 3A-B) .\nSequence counts are heavily influenced by sampling frequency, which varies widely between countries, and N439K as a percentage of total sequences appears low: as of January 6, 2021 there have been 6,868 N439K observations in GISAID, 2% out of ~290,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences for the 34 countries where this mutation has been detected (Table S2) . Nevertheless, when comparing the percentage of N439K sequences over time in countries with sufficient data, the proportion can be significant: ~10% in Scotland from March to June 2020 and ~10% in Denmark from August to December 2020, both countries with high sequencing rates, and ~13% in Ireland from July to December 2020, where regional coverage is reasonable but the sequencing rate is lower ( Figure 3C) . Importantly, on the scale of a pandemic, small proportions correspond to large numbers of infections. If the proportion of N439K sequences in each country predicts what proportion of its confirmed infections are associated with N439K variants, then N439K variants correspond to approximately 764,000 of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections as of January 6, 2021 (Table S2) . If detected cases represent 5-33% of true infections, as has been estimated for the United States (Wu et al., 2020b) , then a very rough approximation of the actual cumulative number of N439K-associated infections would be in the range of 2 to 15 million.\nOverall, the spread of N439K to at least 34 countries is concerning, as is its repeated independent emergence. At the nucleotide level, all N439K variants to date have arisen from the same mutation: a C-to-A transversion in the third codon position. Interestingly, 4,209 of sequences in lineage ii/B.1.258 also carry the spike 69-70 deletion that has occurred independently multiple times in the pandemic and most notably with the Y453F amino acid replacement associated with mink infections (Oude Munnink et al., 2020) . In both cases the 69-70 deletion mutation has arisen subsequent to the RBM mutation and then been retained in all subsequent variants. This deletion has also been recently reported to provide an escape for NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies (McCarthy et al., 2020) . Very recently, this deletion has also been observed to co-occur with another RBM mutation, N501Y (Volz et al., 2021) .\nAs there is concern that mutations with high prevalence may have increased virus transmissibility, we next evaluated whether any difference could be detected in the rate of spread of the N439K lineages as compared to other lineages. As Scotland has a high sampling frequency for its population size (Table S2) , it is possible to calculate a growth rate for N439K lineage i based on a comparison with other Scottish lineages (see Methods and http://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/RiseFallScotCOVID/). We find that while the N439K/D614G lineage is one of the largest to emerge in Scotland, its growth rate is similar to the median 7 N439/D614 or N439/D614G wild-type growth rates, with no evidence for a faster growth conferred by the N439K mutation ( Figure S3A )."}, {"section_title": "N439K RBD forms a new interaction with hACE2 and has enhanced hACE2 affinity", "text": "In addition to its frequency and repeated emergence, the N439K mutation stood out from other circulating RBM mutations as having a plausible mechanism for maintenance of viral fitness. The equivalent position to N439K in the SARS-CoV RBM is also a positivelycharged amino acid (R426), which forms a salt bridge with hACE2 (Li et al., 2005) ( Figure  4A ). We therefore hypothesized that the N439K SARS-CoV-2 variant may form a similar salt bridge at the RBD-hACE2 interface (RBD N439K:hACE2 E329) ( Figure 4B) . We determined the X-ray structure of the N439K RBD in complex with hACE2 at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, and observed that this new interaction does indeed form ( Figure 4C , Table S3 ). As salt bridges can be strong non-covalent bonds and therefore the N439K mutation plausibly adds a strong interaction at the binding interface, we hypothesized that the N439K variant has enhanced binding for hACE2.\nTo test this hypothesis, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to evaluate binding of recombinant N439K S or RBD protein to recombinant hACE2. We also evaluated the N439R and K417V variants, each of which are found in SARS-CoV at these positions, and the latter of which would remove a salt bridge at the RBD:hACE2 interface. Across multiple assay formats, we found that the N439K and N439R variants exhibited a ~2-fold enhanced binding affinity for hACE2 as compared to the original N439 variant (termed herein WT) ( Figure 4D ). The magnitude of this enhancement was paralleled by a ~2-fold loss of binding affinity for the K417V variant relative to WT. Our data are in line with the DMS results (Starr et al., 2020b) , which show a two-fold loss of binding for K417V and no change for N439K/R, as the two assays are inherently different and the DMS data are much higher-throughput but lower sensitivity. We also tested the effect of the N439K/R and K417V mutations in combination. These double mutants swap one salt bridge at the hACE2 binding interface at RBD position 417 for one at position 439; we found they had an hACE2 affinity similar to the WT ( Figure 4D) .\nOverall, these data indicate that acquisition of the N439K mutation enhances hACE2 binding, which could have implications in vivo in the context of infection and transmission. At a minimum, we found no evidence for any decreased success of N439K lineage i relative to other lineages present in Scotland at the same time ( Figure S3A) . Also, the enhanced affinity could compensate for other mutations that would otherwise decrease binding (e.g. K417V), further highlighting the plasticity of the RBM and the need for surveillance."}, {"section_title": "N439K SARS-CoV-2 maintains fitness and virulence", "text": "The enhanced hACE2 affinity conferred by the N439K mutation, its geographical emergence as independent lineages as well as its prevalence among circulating viral isolates is consistent with no effect on viral fitness. We set out to directly examine N439K impact on viral fitness by evaluating clinical data and outcomes associated with virus carrying the N439K mutation versus wildtype N439, as well as by direct in vitro viral growth and competition. Clinical data including age, gender, date of diagnosis, hospitalization J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 status, and mortality were collected prospectively, and sequencing was carried out in real time, as part of the Scottish strategy for COVID-19 surveillance.\nWe used qPCR to evaluate viral load (as measured by cycle threshold, Ct) in 1,918 Scottish patients whose positive samples had been sequenced (Figures 5A-B) . Variants were either N439K/D614G (n=406), N439/D614G (n=978) or ancestral (N439/D614) (n=534). Our analysis found strong evidence that the N439K/D614G genotype was associated with marginally lower cycle threshold (Ct) than the N439/D614G genotype, even after controlling for confounders: age, sex, viral co-ancestry and epidemic stage (mean Ct value difference between N439K/D614G and N439/D614G: -0.65, 95% CI: -1.22, -0.07) ( Figure 5B, Table S4 ). Assuming the PCR was 95% efficient, then a mean Ct difference of 0.65 would represent an RNA copy number increase of 1.54-fold in N439K/D614G relative to N439/D614G. As Ct measurements were from multiple locations in Scotland, a sub-analysis of viral load using RNA standards was carried out with available samples. This analysis showed a near-complete correlation with Ct values ( Figure 5B ). D614G has previously been associated with higher viral loads/lower Ct values (Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2020; Mueller et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020) ; while our data suggest a similar trend in a na\u00efve analysis, when controlling for confounders (given above) we could not detect this effect (Table S4) .\nClinical outcomes were also obtained for a subset of these patients (n=1,591), who were scored for severity of disease based on oxygen requirement: 1. no respiratory support, 2. supplemental oxygen, 3. invasive or non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannulae, or 4. death (Figures 5C and S3B ). Whether oxygen therapy or ventilation was needed was collected retrospectively. Variant counts for the clinical outcomes analysis were: double mutant (N439K/D614G, n=399), D614G mutants (with N439 wildtype, n=735) or ancestral genotype (N439/D614, n=457). Our ordinal regression indicated that the N439K/D614G viral genotype was associated with similar clinical outcomes compared to D614G or ancestral genotypes (posterior mean of N439K/D614G genotype effect: 0.06, 95% CI: -1.21, 1.33) ( Table S5 ). All other results from the severity analysis were qualitatively similar to a previous analysis of the D614G mutation (Volz et al., 2020) . These clinical outcomes data indicate that the N439K virus is neither linked to an attenuated phenotype nor linked to increased severity.\nWe next experimentally tested growth of two representative SARS-CoV-2 isolates, GLA1 (N439) and GLA2 (N439K), both with the D614G background (Table S6) . Culture was carried out for 72 hours in Vero E6 cells with either hACE2 and TMPRSS2 overexpression, hACE2 overexpression, or no overexpression. There was no significant difference between the growth of these strains after inoculation at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.005 and 0.01. The N439K variant replicated slightly faster initially after inoculation ( Figure 5D ). These experimental data indicate that the N439K mutation does not exhibit positive or negative effects on viral growth. To further assess fitness for replication in cultured cells, we carried out a cross-competition assay using inoculation of cells at a matched MOI followed by quantitation of N439 and N439K by metagenomic sequencing over time ( Figure 5E ). N439K demonstrated similar fitness as the wildtype N439 variant, with a slight fitness advantage for N439K in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Collectively, these results indicate that the N439K mutation results in viral fitness that is similar or possibly slightly improved relative to the wild-type N439 virus. These results may relate to the improved hACE2 affinity measured for the N439K RBD in the SPR binding assays, or could relate to additional mechanisms, such as changes to spike density on the viral particle surface or changes to the conformational dynamics of the spike protein."}, {"section_title": "The N439K mutation promotes evasion of antibody-mediated immunity", "text": "Having established that the N439K mutation has no detectable effect on virus replication, we sought to test whether it promotes evasion of antibody-mediated immunity by evaluating recognition of N439K RBD by monoclonal antibodies and by polyclonal immune serum from 442 recovered individuals, including six donors who were infected by the SARS-CoV-2 N439K variant. 6.8% of the tested sera showed a greater than two-fold reduction in binding to N439K RBD as compared to WT (Figures 6A-B and S4 , Data S1). In some individuals, the >two-fold reduction diminished the RBD ED50 response below 30 ( Figure 6A , Data S1), a threshold previously determined to be a cutoff for specific binding (Piccoli et al., 2020) . Thus, the response to the RBD can be significantly influenced by the N439K mutation in a number of individuals infected by wildtype SARS-CoV-2. The majority of serum samples for which there was a loss of binding were those that had overall lower Ab titers against wildtype RBD. The sera from the six individuals known to have recovered from infection with SARS-CoV-2 N439K virus all showed less than a two-fold change in binding levels to WT RBD as compared to N439K RBD ( Figures 6A-B and S4) . This may reflect a true variant-specific response or that differential binding could not be measured due to the limited number of samples analyzed.\nTo understand our results at the level of individual antibodies, we evaluated a panel of 140 mAbs isolated from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the pandemic (likely N439 wildtype virus), which are a representative sample of the RBDtargeting mAbs generated after infection (Piccoli et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020) . We also evaluated mAbs REGN10933, REGN10987, LY-CoV555, and S309 (the parent of VIR-7831) which are either clinical stage or approved for EUA Hansen et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020) . 16.7% of these mAbs demonstrated a greater than two-fold reduction of RBD binding in response to the N439K mutation (Figures 6C-D and S5, Data S1). For comparison, we also evaluated the K417V and N439K/K417V mutations. A similar percentage, 9.7% for K417V and 14.6% for N439K/K417V, lost greater than two-fold binding to these variants (Figures 6C-D and S5, Data S1). Of note, some mAbs demonstrated a larger loss of binding to the double mutant as compared to either single mutant (Figures 6C-D and S5, Data S1). The reduced binding of mAbs to these RBD mutants was also confirmed by bio-layer interferometry analysis (Figures 6E and S6) . The mAb panel was evaluated by RBD-binding competition experiments with hACE2 as well as with three structurally-characterized antibodies defining distinct epitopes on the RBD: S304/site II, S309/site IV, and S2H14/site I, the latter significantly overlapping with the RBM (Piccoli et al., 2020) . The majority of the panel were site I, hACE2-blocking mAbs; the mAbs with sensitivity to N439K were enriched for site I mAbs with moderate or weak/no hACE2 blockade, consistent with the positioning of N439K at the edge of the RBM ( Figure 1A, Figure 6F , Data S1).\nTo define the potential biological importance of these mutations for evasion of antibody-mediated neutralization, we tested mAbs against pseudoviruses expressing S variants N439K, K417V and N439K/K417V (Figures 7A-C and S7, Data S1). Neutralization of pseudoviruses containing these mutations was significantly diminished for certain mAbs, including some that are currently in use in patients under emergency use authorization. As predicted by its non-RBM epitope , S309 was capable of neutralizing each of these variants. We also evaluated a cross-reactive camelid nanobody, VHH-72, which has enhanced potency for SARS-CoV as compared to SARS-CoV-2, predicted to be partially due to a contact with R426 in SARS-CoV RBD, the same position as 439 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Wrapp et al., 2020a) . Consistent with this prediction, VHH-72 showed enhanced potency against N439K SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus compared to WT N439 (Figure 7A,C) , highlighting the possibility that a single mutation can impact antibody efficacy positively as well as negatively. Sensitivity of a few neutralizing mAbs to mutations at positions 417 and 439 have also been reported in other studies Gaebler et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Starr et al., 2020a; Weisblum et al., 2020) , though combinations of mutations have typically not been evaluated. Overall, our results demonstrate that mutations compatible with equivalent viral fitness to wildtype can result in immune evasion from both monoclonal and polyclonal antibody responses."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Here we describe an example of a circulating RBM mutation, N439K, which can evade antibody-mediated immunity without losing fitness relative to wildtype. The success of variants with the N439K mutation is evidenced by their repeated emergence by convergent evolution on at least nine occasions, spread to 34 countries as of January 2021, significant representation in sampled genome sequences (indicative of high infection rates), the fact that the N439K RBD retains a high affinity interaction with the hACE2 receptor, and efficient replication of N439K virus in cultured cells. Additionally, we observed no evidence for change in disease severity in a large cohort of individuals infected with N439K virus as compared to wildtype N439 virus, though we acknowledge some limitations in the data collection, including variations in testing guidelines and availability of testing during the course of the study (da Silva Filipe et al., 2021) .\nThe success of the N439K mutation is consistent with our findings that the RBM is a highly variable region of S. It demonstrates the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to accommodate mutations at the RBM while retaining efficient hACE2 binding. This ability could have emerged by chance or in response to immune pressure from neutralizing Ab responses in viral hosts. There is precedent for the most immunogenic region of a viral surface protein to be highly divergent despite harboring the receptor binding site; for example, the immunogenic globular head domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin surface protein, which contains the sialic acid receptor binding site, evolves faster than the stalk region (Doud et al., 2018; Kirkpatrick et al., 2018) . The ability to readily accommodate mutations in the RBM indicates a high likelihood that potentially immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants will continue to emerge, with implications for reinfection, vaccines, and both monoclonal and polyclonal antibody therapeutics.\nA few other circulating RBM mutations have become prominent since N439K first emerged. S477N appeared in the sequence databases in March 2020 but did not become the most prevalent RBD mutation until the summer (as of January 2020 it has >19,000 counts). Consistent with the high prevalence, position 477 is the RBM position where mutations are predicted to be the most well tolerated with respect to hACE2 binding (Figure 2) . Studies across multiple mAb panels have not found this mutation to be conferring resistance Greaney et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020) . In contrast, mutations at position 484 in the RBM have been reported to confer resistance to many mAbs across multiple studies Gaebler et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020) and also appeared in a persistent (>150 day) infection in an immunocompromised individual who did not respond to treatment with a two-mAb cocktail (Choi et al., 2020) . The variant count at position 484 has been steadily increasing (>500 as of January 2021), and the possibility for no fitness consequences for these variants is notable (Figures 2  and S1B ) (Starr et al., 2020b) , as is a recent study identifying this position as particularly important for escape from polyclonal serum antibodies (Greaney et al., 2021) and the appearance of this mutation in a new, fast-growing viral lineage (Tegally et al., 2020) . The Y453F mutation has become noteworthy recently for its association with virus circulating in mink farms and its transmission back to humans (Oude Munnink et al., 2020) , and the DMS measurement indicating it confers significantly increased hACE2 binding (Starr, et al. 2020b) . To date, we know of only one example of published immune escape documented for Y453F , but more examples may arise as this new mutation is investigated further. Lastly, the N501Y mutation has gained notice in the final weeks of 2020 for its association with high rates of infection (Tegally et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2021) , though further research is needed to determine the impact on immune escape.\nSARS-CoV-2 appears to be evolving relatively slowly consistent with its low mutation rate, the highly susceptible human population, and its generalist nature (Conceicao et al., 2020) and, at present, evidence indicates it will be controllable by vaccines based on early SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (Dearlove et al., 2020) . Additionally, for the majority of our tested sera and mAbs, a single amino acid change in the RBM was not sufficient to confer resistance. Nevertheless, our data indicate that individuals with a mild antibody response to vaccination or first infection could be at risk from a virus carrying a mutation in the RBM. Furthermore, considering the high level of structural plasticity of the RBM demonstrated in the present study, there could be many combinations of RBM mutations, including some requiring compensatory changes, that are compatible with high viral fitness. Some of these combinations will contribute to efficient immune escape. For example, our data show that N439K can compensate for a mutation (K417V) that otherwise decreases receptor binding affinity ( Figure 4D ) and that several mAbs were more sensitive to these mutations in combination versus individually ( Figure  6D , Data S1). This particular combination of mutations is plausibly compatible with maintained viral fitness as it parallels SARS-CoV RBM:hACE2 interactions (salt bridge at SARS-CoV RBD position R426 and no salt bridge at V404, Figure 4A ). Current SARS-CoV-2 mutations have arisen in the absence of pressure from significant population immunity. However, as immunity to the wildtype virus becomes more widespread, immune escape mutations can be expected to increasingly circulate. In the final weeks of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 strains carrying multiple mutations in the spike protein, in both the RBM and Domain A, have been observed (Volz et al., 2021) including one strain carrying three simultaneous RBM mutations (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) (Tegally et al., 2020) . Accumulation of multiple changes may increase the risk of immune escape from vaccines that are based on early SARS-CoV-2 sequences."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Mutations in the RBM will also impact the prophylactic or therapeutic use of mAbs. In our profile of immune escape from the N439K variant, we observed resistance to a mAb which is part of a two-mAb cocktail that recently received emergency use authorization. The promise of using cocktails of mAbs is that they should significantly lower the likelihood of drug-induced selection of resistant viruses . However, if circulating viral variants already carry resistant mutations to one antibody in the cocktail, this could cause the cocktail to be reduced to a monotherapy. Additionally, we observed that two mutations together (N439K/K417V) conferred resistance in vitro to the two-mAb cocktail ( Figure 7C) .\nTwo approaches will be critical for minimizing the impact of mAb escape mutations. One is to develop mAbs with epitopes that are highly resistant to viral escape. This may include epitopes outside of the RBM and/or epitopes that are cross-reactive across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, indicating conserved epitopes with a low tolerance for mutation (Garrett Rappazzo et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020a) . A comparison of epitopes of RBM-targeting mAbs with the most conserved regions of the RBM (Figure 2 ) may also identify RBM mAbs with a higher barrier to escape. The second will be to screen patients, likely at the population level, for the presence of potential resistance variants prior to drug administration. The availability of multiple different mAb therapeutics in the clinic could provide the opportunity to tailor the choice of therapeutics to local circulating variants.\nIn general, given that access to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is expanding, and as more people develop immune responses to the wildtype virus via infection or vaccination, monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for escape mutants will be critical. While we only report on evasion of antibody-mediated immunity here, it would be surprising if similar changes are not observed that confer evasion of T cell immunity and innate immunity."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Study", "text": "This study presents the finding that the receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly variable region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and we provide a thorough characterization of the N439K RBM amino acid replacement, and the ability of this mutation to confer immune evasion without attenuating (or enhancing) fitness or disease. When this study was initiated in June 2020, the general consensus was that the slow rate of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 would result in no immediate threat to vaccines or therapies. N439K was the first RBM amino acid replacement, relative to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant used in vaccine preparations, to increase to high frequency and so can be viewed as a sentinel mutation for SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift. Since initial submission to Cell in November 2020, the emergence of multiple highly transmissible strains carrying other RBM mutations of significance has brought the study of immune evasion variants to the forefront of SARS-CoV-2 research. Future retrospective studies will confirm whether these new RBM mutations fall into the same category as N439K: mutations which do not attenuate viral fitness or disease, but cause immune evasion. Our results on the plasticity of the RBM also anticipated the emergence of the RBM mutations present in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. originating and submitting laboratories of the sequences from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org).

Median entropies were computed for each draw. The resulting 50,000 median entropies were used to build the entropy distribution of residues other than the RBM. The top 10% medians are highlighted in red. The median entropy of RBM residues was compared with the non-RBM entropy distribution to determine the variability of the RBM relative to non-RBM residues. To allow for a fair comparison, sampling was performed without enforcing residue contiguity, as the RBM is not contiguous in sequence space. Therefore, in any given sample, residues are unlikely to share any functional relationship. (C) Per-residue entropies of the mature S protein were smoothed by plotting medians of a 25-aa center-aligned sliding window. Smoothing allows to visualize local peaks of variability. The RBM residues and the NTD, RBD and S2 domains are highlighted.

Binding data with hACE2 as analyte were fit to a 1:1 binding model. Binding data with RBD as analyte were fit to a Heterogeneous Ligand binding model, due to an artifactual kinetic phase with very slow dissociation that arises when RBD is an analyte; the lower affinity of the two K D s reported by the fit is reported as the K D of the RBD-ACE2 interaction (the two reported K D s are separated by at least two orders of magnitude for all fits). The measured K D for hACE2 binding to S is likely influenced by conformational dynamics of the RBDs in the context of the prefusion S trimer. Reported K D s are an average of 3-4 replicates measured on at least two separate days, with error given as SEM.\nDifferences between the SPR assay and the published DMS binding assay (Starr, et al. 2020b ) include using targeted measurements of purified proteins expressed in mammalian cells versus yeast surface display, as well as the use of dimeric hACE2 in the DMS experiment, which incorporates avidity effects into the RBD-hACE2 binding measurements that can mask modest changes in binding affinity."}, {"section_title": "hACE2 binding measurements using bio-layer interferometry (BLI)", "text": "Binding measurements of Sarbecovirus RBDs to hACE2 were performed by diluting RBDs to 8 \u00b5g/ml in kinetic buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.05% BSA) and immobilization on Anti-Penta-His Biosensors of an Octet RED96 system (Fort\u00e9Bio).

Sequencing was carried out using an amplicon-based protocol in real-time at a rate of up to 300 genomes per week. 50% of samples were selected as surveillance samples, representing Scottish health boards proportionately based on population size, while 50% were selected to allow intervention with local issues such as nosocomial infection in hospitals and nursing homes. The N439K mutation was noted to become increasingly prevalent during April 2020. This was noted to be particularly common in the Greater Glasgow & Clyde NHS health board region but spread to adjacent Scottish health boards also.\nSequencing libraries were prepared according to the ARTIC nCoV-2019 described in detail at https://artic.network/ncov-2019. Briefly, PCR amplicons were generated using the nCoV-2019 PrimalSeq sequencing primers using 25-35 cycles of amplification. Generated amplicons were used to prepare either Oxford Nanopore or Illumina sequencing libraries.

Sequences were linked to electronic patient records and basic metadata including sample date, age, sex, admission to hospital and mortality at 28 days post diagnosis extracted. The electronic patient records of a subset of 1591 patients underwent full casenote review and clinical severity was recorded based on a 4-level ordinal scale: 1. no requirement for respiratory support, 2. treatment with supplemental oxygen via facemask or low-flow nasal cannulae, 3. intubation and ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or oxygen delivery by high flow nasal cannulae devices, 4. death within the 28 days following diagnosis. We modified the WHO ordinal scale to these 4 points as described previously (Volz et al., 2020) to avoid using hospitalisation as a criterion of severity because 1) many patients in nursing homes had severe infection but were not admitted to hospital, and 2) early in the outbreak, all cases were hospitalised irrespective of the severity of their infection.\nThese data had previously been analysed to test for an effect of the D614G mutation on the severity of disease (Volz et al., 2020) ; we extend that analysis here using the same methodology to test for an effect of the N439K mutation. Additionally, we perform a new analysis using a model with the same structure to test for an effect of both the D614G mutation and the D614G/N439K mutation combination on the viral load of infected patients, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value. Ct values were generated in different locations, on different platforms and then collected centrally.\nIn both cases we cannot estimate the marginal effect of the N439K mutation, as we only have the mutation on the 614G genetic background, so the individual effect of N439K cannot be separated from any potential epistatic interactions between the mutations.\nBriefly, the structure of the model used previously (Volz et al., 2020) and in the present study is a phylogenetic generalised additive model with mutation being the primary predictor of interest. The model controls for biological sex, age and the number of days since the first reported case in the dataset, with the latter two being included as penalised splines with a maximum of 30 knots. If the patient was part of a cluster of cases, this was included as a random effect, with individuals not part of clusters being assigned their own levels. Correlations driven by the rest of the genome are controlled for by a phylogenetic random effect using a correlation matrix generated under a Brownian motion assumption from a phylogeny estimated in IQ-TREE 2 v. 2.0.6 (Minh et al., 2020) using a HKY + \u0393 model, masking the positions recommended by De Maio et al. as of 22/7/2020 (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473/13), rooted on the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome . The priors for the severity model were those used in the previous analysis of this data. The priors for the model of the viral load were a student-t (mean = 20, scale = 10, degrees of freedom = 3) prior on the model intercept, a Gaussian (mean = 0, standard deviation = 10) prior over the fixed effects, and an exponential (lambda = 0.1) prior over the random effect, penalised spline and residual standard deviations.\nThere are two key structural differences between the model used previously (Volz et al., 2020) and the model used here. Firstly, mutation is a three level rather than two level factor (D614/N439, D614G/N439 and D614G/N439K) with the ancestral D614/N439 being the reference level. Secondly, as we are now interested in two mutations, we estimated the phylogeny used to control for the effect of the rest of the genome excluding both the nucleotide position underlying the D614G mutation and the nucleotide position underlying the N439K mutation (in addition to the sites from De Maio et al mentioned above).\nThe severity model used a cumulative error structure while the model on the CT values used a Gaussian error structure. In both cases, the models were estimated in brms v. 2.13.5 (B\u00fcrkner, 2018) . The presented models had no divergent transitions, Rhat values less than 1.01, and appropriate bulk and tail effective sample sizes for all parameters.
