Other peptides, some of which are not classically associated with AD, such as heart fatty acid binding protein, and the neuronal pentraxin receptor, also differentiated disease states. A sixteen-analyte signature was identified which differentiated AD vs. NL with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, which was better than any combination of amyloid beta (1-42), tau, and phospho-181 tau. This same signature, when applied to a new and independent data set, also strongly predicted both probability and rate of future progression of MCI subjects to AD, better than traditional markers.

Three CSF biomarkers in particular, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242), are believed to have high diagnostic accuracy for early AD diagnosis and have been PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182098 August 3, 2017 1 / 18 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nused as research criteria for the diagnosis of AD [1] [2] [3] . A number of studies have found significantly reduced CSF A\u03b242 levels in AD patients compared to normal controls with few exceptions (See [3] and [4] for meta-review and meta-analyses respectively; see [5, 6] for exceptions). In comparison to A\u03b242 levels, studies have consistently found increased CSF t-tau and p-tau levels in AD patients compared to normal controls (See [7] and [4] for meta-review and metaanalyses respectively). Furthermore, elevated levels of t-tau and p-tau have also been observed in MCI patients that developed AD compared to stable MCI patients and normal controls [8, 9] . Given the possibility that a variety of other pathological processes may be simultaneously ongoing in the AD brain (e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation and synaptic dysfunction), apart from these three core CSF biomarkers, other biomarkers could reflect pathogenesis of AD and reveal new biomarkers for AD [10] . Proteomic approaches permit large-scale assessment of the involvement of hundreds of proteins and/or peptides in complex biological processes, and may generate hypotheses both about disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. This type of approach has been used extensively to develop biomarkers and shape development of scientific hypotheses in the cancer literature [11] [12] [13] . One challenge to investigators utilizing proteomic approaches is the sheer mass of data that are obtained using these methods, both in terms of extraction of coherent trends in the data and in terms of the potential for spurious associations identified via multiple comparisons. We and others have addressed these potential problems by using machine learning algorithms to develop peptide \"signatures\" corresponding to disease state, and by employing strict criteria to avoid the potential for false discovery [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Increasingly, proteolytic fragments, rather than whole proteins, are being used for disease classification because of the expansion in the complexity of the signatures available [19] [20] [21] [22] . Therefore, in the current report we explore the use of a proteomic technique applied to proteolytic fragments in the CSF for the classification and prediction of disease progression in AD.\nProtein profiling of the CSF using advanced proteomics techniques such as 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry could help identify novel AD biomarkers. While studies using proteomics techniques have identified a number of additional AD candidates (e.g., neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR) and hearttype fatty acid binding protein (FABPH) [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ), many of these studies have been done on small cohorts [25, 29] involving small arrays of CSF markers, using less powerful computational approaches and did not validate the markers in an independent cohort. To circumvent these issues, we performed cross sectional analysis of CSF samples obtained from large and well characterized populations of AD, MCI, and age-matched normal control (NL) subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We analyzed a diverse array of peptides to determine if single or multi-analyte CSF peptide signatures could be used to (i) distinguish patients with AD from NL (disease state classification) and (ii) predict future conversion from MCI to AD in a separate population of patients (prediction of future progression)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Procedures for CSF sampling, transport, and storage have been described previously [31] . The CSF multiplex multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) panel was developed by Caprion Proteomics in collaboration with the Biomarker Consortium Project Team. A total of 320 peptides generated from tryptic digests of 143 proteins were used in this study (see S1 2015) [32], CSF samples were depleted of plasma proteins using a Multiple Affinity Removal System (MARS-14) column, trypsin digested (1:25 protease:protein ratio), lyophilized, desalted and analyzed by LC/MRM-MS analysis on a QTRAP 5500 LC-MS/MS system at Caprion Proteomics. MRM is a mass spectrometry-based platform that has been shown to be reproducible within and across laboratories and instrument platforms [33] . MRM experiments were performed on triple quadrupole (Q) mass spectrometers. The first (Q1) and third (Q3) mass analyzer were used to isolate a peptide ion and a corresponding fragment ion. The fragment ions were generated in Q2 by collision induced dissociation (CID). The 320 peptides met all the quality control criteria set by the ADNI working group."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "For the univariate analysis to identify individual peptides that are either differentially expressed between AD and NL subjects, or between MCI-AD progressors versus non-progressors, the analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) was used with age and gender as covariates and the groups to be compared as fixed effect. This model was fit on the log2 transformed quantile-normalized intensities of the peptide expression values. Outliers were identified and excluded based on the residuals from this ANCOVA model whose values were either less than Q1-1.5 x (Q3-Q1) or above Q1 + 1.5 x (Q3-Q1), where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartiles of the distribution of residuals. The significance of peptides was assessed and is reported in terms of the false discovery rate estimate (q-value) [34] , and the relevant summary statistics such as the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC), fold change, and the effect size, along with p-values are also reported. Multivariate predictive modeling analysis was then carried out to derive a signature (combination of peptides and any additional covariates) that optimally differentiates the AD versus NL subjects. The list of candidate predictors considered for selection in this signature included the list of 320 peptides of the CSF proteomic panel, plus age, gender and apolipoprotein E (APO-E) status (totally 323 predictors). An algorithm based on the logistic regression model with lasso-based penalty [35] was employed for this analysis. To ensure the stability and robustness of the selection of a subset of predictors for the optimal signature via this algorithm, a bootstrap procedure [36] was used to estimate the lasso penalty parameter. The performance of the optimal peptide signature from this algorithm that differentiates the AD and NL subjects was evaluated via a rigorous five-fold internal stratified cross-validation procedure. In this procedure, all steps of the model building and signature derivation process were fully embedded within the cross-validation [37] . The predictions of all the left-out folds from this cross-validation procedure [14] were first aggregated, and the performance measures such as the overall classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values were evaluated on these aggregated predictions. This internal cross-validation procedure was repeated 20 times, and the mean and standard deviation of these performance measures are reported.\nThe above optimal peptide signature derived to differentiate the AD and NL subjects was then tested on a separate independent group of MCI subjects at baseline to predict their future progression to AD. As the peptide signature would return the prediction results as simply AD or NL, the prediction of an MCI subject as NL was considered as \"Signature Negative\" at baseline, and the prediction of an MCI subject as AD was considered as \"Signature Positive\" at baseline. The accuracy of this prediction was then assessed relative to the true progression status of the MCI subjects to AD over the next 36 months.\nThe performance of this peptide signature was further evaluated in terms of its ability to differentiate the future \"time to progression\" from MCI to AD of these baseline signature positive and signature negative MCI subjects via Kaplan-Meier analysis. For this evaluation, the progression of MCI subjects to AD over the entire future time course until the last follow-up visit was taken into consideration. This evaluation of the AD versus NL peptide signature on the future progression of a separate group of MCI subjects to AD would not only serve as an independent verification of the utility of our peptide signature, but also put it to a greater test to see whether it is robust enough to address a different and more important question related to predicting the future disease progression in AD."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Disease-state demographics", "text": "Data from 287 subjects were analyzed, with the largest proportion (135/287 or 47.1%) coming from MCI subjects.

The subjects were balanced across the NL, MCI and AD groups in terms of age (range of means = 74.79-75.80 years, p>0.05) and education (range of means = 15.11-16.0 years, p>0.05). There were more males (59.9%) than females (40.1%) in the study, though similar numbers of male and female MCI subjects converted to AD over a three-year period (52.3 vs. 65.8%, p = 0.166, Chi-squared test). As shown previously [38] , the presence of the APO-E4 allele tracked with disease state (71.2% AD, 52.6% MCI and 31.8% NL, p < 0.0001, Chi-squared test). In addition, the presence of this allele also tracked with MCI to AD progression over a 36-month period (37.5% of non-E4 vs. 56.3% of E4 progressed to AD, p = 0.028, Chi-squared test), see Tables 1 and 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Disease-state classification: Univariate analysis", "text": "A large number of peptides were found to be differentially present in AD vs. NL subjects.

Interestingly, the APO-E peptide (LGADMEDVR), which demonstrated excellent differentiation between AD vs. NL, ranked 199/320 for predicting conversion from MCI to AD. These data suggest that individual peptide markers do a poor job of predicting MCI to AD progression on their own; hence the motivation to combine markers in a multivariate analysis to increase their utility (below)."}, {"section_title": "MCI-AD progression: Multivariate analysis", "text": "The same 16-peptide multivariate signature that was developed for disease state classification was employed on the MCI subjects, which represent a completely independent population, at baseline to predict their progression to AD over 36 months.

Though some of these peptides have been described previously as individual biomarkers (see below), the current data suggest their combination outperforms previous CSF markers and point to the possibility that other novel markers may have a previously unrecognized role in diagnostic testing as well as in understanding the pathophysiology of AD."}, {"section_title": "Review of specific analytes identified", "text": "Over the past several years, proteomic approaches have identified an alphabet soup of potential markers that may be able to permit early diagnosis of AD or predict conversion from MCI to AD [24-26,41-45]. Many of the potential markers identified by these studies have known or suspected roles in either AD or in pathological processes thought to be disrupted in AD. For example, as expected, one of the APOE peptides examined (LGADMEDVR), which is specifically expressed in APOE4+ individuals [39, 40] , showed different distributions between AD and NL subjects (Table 3 ). This finding is not surprising given APOE4's known association with AD [38] .\nOther peptides identified in this study are less classically associated with AD. For example, we observed that CSF FABPH levels were elevated in AD relative to controls and this marker has previously been identified by several studies as being associated with AD [25, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . FABPH is a small cytoplasmic protein involved in lipid metabolism and was initially identified as a potential biomarker for cardiac injury [51] but also present in neurons [52] . It is not clear if the presence of FABPH in the CSF is a marker of neuronal dysfunction, or simply a marker of neuronal destruction, since elevations of serum and/or CSF FABPH have been seen in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . These findings may imply that FABPH is released from neurons during their destruction, or alternatively that high CSF FABPH may predispose neurons to be vulnerable to oxidative stress, since overexpression of FABPH sensitizes dopaminergic neurons to the toxic effects of metabolic stressors such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine, (MPP), while low levels of FABPH are protective [58] . For these reasons, FABPH has been proposed by others to serve as a general biomarker for synaptic destruction [57] , analogous to creatine kinase or troponin for myocyte damage. We also identified NPTXR as being associated with AD, with CSF levels being lower in AD compared to controls and higher in MCI-AD converters. These data, combined with previous work demonstrating that NPTXR levels may be slightly higher in MCI subjects than controls, but drop rapidly (by~10%/year) in AD subjects, suggest that NPTXR is a dynamic biomarker [26] . The current data are also consistent with work in presymptomatic subjects carrying PSEN1 or the APP genetic mutations, who show elevated levels of CSF NPTXR [45] . The transient increases, then prominent drops, in CSF NPTXR levels suggest a complex relationship between NPTXR levels and disease state, and are reminiscent of what is seen with other AD biomarkers. For example, we previously observed pseudonormalization of several plasma biomarkers that appeared to have a transition state in MCI patients that differed from controls, then returned to baseline in AD [14] . Analogously, hippocampal blood-oxygen level dependent signals increase in MCI subjects compared to NL, but then decrease in AD subjects [59] . The complex relationship between NPTXR and disease state is evidenced by some of the conflicting data in the literature. At least two other studies have found decreases in CSF NPTXR in AD [23, 26] while one documented higher levels of NPTXR in the CSF of patients with MCI and AD [60] . The severity of cognitive impairment of the AD patients was not given in the latter study, and it is possible that the AD patients in their study were too early in their course to show a drop in NPTXR levels. Alternatively, the method of measurement (Western blot) differs compared to the current study and may account for the discrepancy. Additional markers were revealed in both the univariate and multivariate analyses. For example, neurosecretory protein VGF (VGF), a nerve growth factor-responsive molecule which is likely a precursor to several bioactive peptides, has been localized to the human and rat cerebral cortex, and in the current study was found to be lower in the CSF of AD patients (Fig 1) and ranked fourth in importance in multivariate signature (Fig 2) . Several previous reports have found depressed levels of VGF in the brain [61] and CSF [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] of AD patients relative to controls, similar to the current findings. Additionally, CSF VGF levels are also diminished in acute pediatric encephalopathy [67] and frontotemporal dementia [68] , suggesting that diminished CSF VGF may be a general marker of severe neuronal dysfunction. An additional novel finding here is the potential role of receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase-like N (PTPRN) in AD, as revealed by both the univariate and multivariate analyses. PTPRN is a transmembrane protein implicated in multiple functions, including metabolism, growth and differentiation and is expressed in neurons [69] . Previous work has indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms for the PTPRN gene were differentially related to CSF p-tau levels in an MCI-AD converter group compared to an MCI nonconverter group [69] . To our knowledge, this is the first report that PTPRN levels are depressed in the CSF of AD patients and, given PTPRN's role in metabolism [70] , may open vistas to further examine metabolic theories of the development of AD.\nThe current data also suggest a potential role for hemoglobin subunits in the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. This could point to blood contamination, but in a recent analysis of this dataset, hemoglobin subunit levels were not found to correlate with CSF erythrocyte counts [32] . It is possible that these peptides represent blood-brain barrier breakdown, which has been documented to occur in AD [71] , suggesting that this breakdown may be an early marker for MCI to AD conversion.\nFinally, a recent study also examined the current dataset and proposed a multivariate signature to predict MCI to AD conversion [32] . The 29-peptide signature in the Spellman et al. study contained peptides from several proteins found in the signature from the current study (ALDOA, FABPH, NPTXR, PRDX1, VGF), while several peptides did not overlap. It is important to note that the signature observed in the Spellman et al. study was built and then tested on the same MCI-to-AD conversion dataset. In contrast, in the current study the signature was built on one dataset (AD vs. NL) and used to predict MCI-to-AD conversion on a completely independent group of subjects, increasing the external validity of the current approach. This methodological difference may explain these differences in peptide signatures."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study suggests that a novel signature of CSF peptides outperforms traditional CSF markers for the differentiation of AD from NL and prediction of future MCI to AD conversion. Note that similar accuracy in predicting AD conversion was seen in a similar analysis using multiple markers (APO-E genotype, neuropsychological testing and multiple imaging modalities [72] ). However, it may be impractical to obtain all of these markers from individual patients. Therefore, one potential advantage of the current approach is that a single CSF study may be sufficient for prediction of progression. The current study also extends recent findings that FABPH and NPTXR may serve as CSF markers for the diagnosis of AD and prediction of disease progression. In addition, this work also highlights potentially novel biochemical "}]
