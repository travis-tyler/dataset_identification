[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 1985, 31,201 doctorate recipients graduated from 330 universities in the United States. A profile of these recipients--their demographic composition, degree-earning processes, and postgraduation plans--is drawn in this report, and comparisons are made to earlier cohorts to illustrate changing patterns in participation and outcomes at the doctoral level. These patterns are also examined by broad field, so that shifts within specialty areas can be noted as well. This year's special section highlights data on American women and minority doctorate recipients. Because averages often mask the multidimensional nature of a class of doctorates, each subgroup is discussed separately so that the whole can be seen in light of each part's contributions. The contours of each subgroup are followed over the period [1975][1976][1977][1978][1979][1980][1981][1982][1983][1984][1985], again to illustrate changing patterns of participation. The special sections of other recent reports focused on types of U.S. baccalaureate sources of Ph.D.s, their output and their \"productivity\" (1984), employment plans and citizenship characteristics of recipients entering the U.S. labor force (1983), and trends in new recipients' postdoctoral study and employment plans (1982)."}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF DOCTORATES BY FIELD", "text": "In the recent past, the number of doctorate recipients has fluctuated only slightly, down from a high in 1973 of 33,755 Ph.D.s to a near-level pattern of about 31,400 recipients each year over the last decade. The 1985 class of 31,201 recipients continues this even trend. Table A lists the number of recipients from 1960 to 1985. Figure 1 (page 2) shows a quick rise in the first half of this period, followed by a small decline and then a steady plateau in the second half. The plateau hides at least three decade-long changes in the composition of the doctoral cohort: gender make-up, field variability, and citizenship status.   universities, 1960-1985 1985 Men and Women Doctorate Recipients While the number of doctorate recipients remained roughly the same over the last 10 years, the numbers of men and women earning the degree changed substantially (see Table  B, page 3). In 1976, 25,262 of the recipients were men; in 1985, that number declined to 20,502--a decrease of 18.8 percent. Conversely, women doctorate recipients numbered 7,684 in 1976 and grew in number to 10,699 in 1985, an increase of 39.2 percent. During these 10 years, the proportion of men making up the doctoral cohort dropped from 76.7 percent to 65.7 percent, while the proprtion of women rose from 23.3 percent to 34.3 percent."}, {"section_title": "Field Selections", "text": "Field changes were also rather striking over the past decade. The steady plateau of degrees camouflaged the shifting distribution among broad fields. The field with the greatest growth, both in number and proportion, was the life sciences, which went from 5,026 Ph.D. degrees earned in 1976 to 5,748 in 1985, an increase of 14.4 percent (see Figure 2. page 4). This field experienced a small decline in the number of male recipients--120, a proportional decrease of 3 percent--counter-weighted by a large increase in women Ph.D.s--842, or 83.1 percent. Other fields that experienced growth were engineering and professional fields: both of these fields declined at mid-decade but demonstrated net growths of 11.7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, over the 10-year period. Like life sciences, professional fields saw a decline in the number of male degree earners--113, or 8.2 percent--that was offset by the increase of female Ph.D.s--259, or 77.1 percent.     Table C lists the countries included in each of the groupings herein."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Country of Citizenship", "text": "The distribution of non-U.S. citizens among fields in 1985 can be seen in Table E. Of the recipients from Taiwan, over two-thirds of the temporary visa-holders (and over three-quarters of those with permanent visas) earned their degrees in either physical sciences or engineering. Another large group of Ph.D.s--those from western Asia--tended to concentrate in the same fields. In 1985, the plurality of Canadians studying in the U.S. earned doctorates in the field of education. * Appendix Table C lists the countries included in each of the groupings herein."}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Employment Commitments", "text": "The usual entrants into the U.S. labor force at the time of graduation are U.S. citizens and those non-U.S. citizens who hold permanent visas. Typically, employment choices of new doctorate recipients involve three labor market sectors: academe, industry, and government. \"Academe\" includes 4-year colleges and univocsities, junior colleges, and medical schools. \"Industry\" covers both industry and business, including selfemployment. \"Government\" can mean federal, state, or local government. Finally, a fourth category of \"Other\" acts as an umbrella for employment with elementary and 8 17 secondary schools or with nonprofit organizations, as well as with any other type of employer not listed on the questionnaire. In 1985, 13,651 new Ph.D.s who were either U.S. citizens or permanent residents reported that they had definite employment plans in the United States. (This number represents 55.6 percent of the combined group, nearly the same as the 1976 proportion of 56.0 percent.) The largess single fraction--48.3 percent--reported that they were joining academe. Industry recruited 20.3 percent of the cohort, and another 11.7 percent intended to enter government employment. Finally, 19.8 percent of the recipients with definite employment plans fell into the category of \"Other.\" This outcome was quite different from a decade ago, when academe was the employer for 60.4 percent of the new recipients (a quarter more than in 1985), and industry was the employer for just 11.7 percent of the Ph.D.s. In one respect the outcome is substantially the same: in 1976, government hired 12.5 percent of the recipients, a minimal difference from 1985's 11.7 percent. Table F (page 10) shows the decade-long changes in commitments to labor market sectors. The table also shows that the employment plans of men and women were noticeably different from one another over the period. Figure 3 (page 11) displays employment plans by sex in 1976 and again in 1985. Then and now, academe engaged a greater proportion of women, and industry recruited a greater proportion of men. In 1976, 70.4 percent of women and 57.4 pert:tat of men made plans to enter the academic labor sector. In 1985, when fewer new recipients had definite commitments to academe, the gap narrowed but was still appreciable: 52.9 percent of women vs. 45.5 percent of men planned academic employment. Industry was becoming a more likely employment sector over the decade, but the disparity between men's and women's recruitment was still considerable. In 1976, 13.7 percent of men reported plans to go into the business sector, compared with 4.9 percent of women. By 1985, 24.9 percent of men had definite commitments to industry, compared to 12.7 percent of the new women recipients. The 1976 gap between the proportions of men and women going into government had nearly closed by 1985. In 1976, 13.8 percent of men and 8.0 percent of women said they had plans to go into government employment, whereas in 1985, 12.0 percent of men and 11.1 percent of women reported such plans. Employment plans are re-examined in the special section on women and minorities. That section also looks at field differences in terms of field composition and field selection by minorities and women. Additionally, some of the processes and outcomes of earning the Ph.D. are reviewed: length of time-to-degree, sources of support, and the status of postgraduation plans. Racial/ethnic groups are distinguishable by certain educational profiles--such as their field selections, support in graduate school, and postgraduation plans--but it is important to note that these pa.ofiles do not always describc the women of these groups. Similarly, the overall profile for women doctorate recipients is not fully pertinent to each minority group. To get the sharpest picture, it is useful--where possible--to look at educational patterns separately for women within each racial/ethnic group."}, {"section_title": "1g", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends in Proportions Earning Degrees", "text": "Data from 1975-1985 on race/ethnicity of U.S. citizens indicate some irregular trends in the proportions of the various groups (see Table G, page 13). Nonetheless, the net change for minorities has been in a slow, positive direction, despite small year-to-year reversals in proportions for some groups. American Indians, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics earned 6.3 percent of the doctorates in 1975, and together they earned 9.1 percent in 1985. Some of the proportional increase, however, is attributable to the decline of Whites earning doctorate degrees. The smallest cohort of doctorates with known race/ethnicity has historically been the American Indians. In 1975, American Indians made up 01 percent of all U.S. citizens earning the Ph.D. By 1985, they were 0.4 percent, their highest proportion thus far.' Asians comprised the next smallest group: 1.3 percent of the new U.S. doctorates in 1975 and 2.3 percent in 1985. They were the only minority group that did not experience any reverse in proportional growth over this period. Hispanics have been somewhat similar to Asians in their numbers and proportions of U.S. degree-earners: they grew from 1.2 percent of the Ph.D.s in 1975 to 2.5 percent in 1985. The largest minority component has been the Black group: they were 3.8 percent of doctorates in 1975 and 4.0 percent in 1985. I The trend for American Indians, however, is quite variable because the numbers are so low. As there have been fewer than 100 American Indian doctorate recipients in any of the years 1975-1985, their proportions will not be discussed at length. The three minority groups to be highlig;ited in this report will be Asians. Blacks, and Hispanics. However, Blacks reached their peak (4.5 percent) in 1977 but have lost a bit of ground since then. The decline appears to have slowed, but the trend has not stablilizal. As discussed earlier, the number of all women Ph.D.s increased from 7,201 (21.9 percent) in 1975 to 10,699 (34.3 percent) in 1985, a proportionate increase of 56.6 percent. While the proportion of women increased among all citizenship groups, the group showing the largest growth was U.S. women (see Table H, page 15). In 1975, women made up 23.7 percent of all U.S. citizens receiving Ph.D.s, and in 1985, they were 39.1 percent, a proportionate increase of 65 percent. In part, the proportional increase occurred because the number of male Ph.D.s declined. In 1985, the number of American women doctorates also declined, but at a slower rate than their male counterparts. Most of the U.. women Ph.D.s in 1985 were White (88.4 percent), followed by Black (6.0 percent), Hispanic (2.9 percent), Asian (2.1 percent), and American Indian (0.6 percent). The proportion of U.S. women differed within the different ethnic or racial cohorts. Each minority female subgroup grew in its proportion of total doctorates earned, and all women increased their percentages within the subgroups. Setting aside the variable Table H also shows the growth in the proportion of women within each ethnic group over time. Asian women, 22.4 percent of the U.S. Asian group in 1975, increased their proportion to 36.3 percent in 1985. Black women earned more than half of the doctorate degrees awarded to Black Americans in 1985: they grew from 34.9 percent within-grot.p in 1975 to 58.4 percent in 1985. Hispanic women approached the half-way mark in their within-group growth during the period. In 1975, they made up 20.1 percent of the doctorates earned by Hispanics; by 1985 they were 46.7 percent. White women comprised the smallest within-group proportion of doctorates, 23.5 percent in 1975 and 38.2 percent in 1985."}, {"section_title": "221", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field Composition", "text": "The U.S. minority composition within each of the seven broad fields in 1975 and 1985 is depicted in Figure 4 (page 16). Minorities increased their participation in every field. Their smallest presence was in physical sciences, despite their growth from 3.5 percent in 1975 to 5.9 percent in 1985. Minorities made the greatest contribution in the field of education, where they formed 13.5 percent of the degree-earners, up from 11.4 percent in 1975. The largest presence of Asian Americans was in engineering (7.4 percent), the largest of Blacks was in education (8.4 percent), and the largest of Hispanics was in humanities (3.5 percent). These proportions do not necessarily reflect the field selection rankings by members of each minority group. Table I (page 17) compares the field distribution of all U.S. citizen doctorates with that of minority recipients in 1975 and 1985. Among all U.S. recipients with known race in 1985, the most frequently chosen field was education (2ff .0 percent), followed by social sciences (19.5 percent), life sciences (19.1 percent), physical sciences (13.0 percent), humanities (12.2 percent), professional fields (5.8 percent), anu engineering (5.4 percent). These proportions were quite similar (within one percentage point) to the 1975 proportions, with two exceptions: at 19.1 percent, life sciences was more frequently selected (up from 14.6 percent), and humanities at 12.2 percent became less often selected (down from 16.4 percent). More than a third of the recipients chose natural sciences and engineering as their field of Ph.D.  1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1985 Women U.   In contrast, Asian Americans tended to cluster in engineering and the natural sci',,,ces (similar to the clustering displayed by their non-U.S. counterparts). Their biggest shifts occurred between engineering and life sciences: in 1975 they selected engineering more often than other fields (21.3 percent), and in 1985 they chose life sciences more frequently (24.9 percent). Hispanics were somewhat less likely, and Blacks were quite a bit less likely, to enter the natural sciences and engineering than the \"average\" American Ph.D., but they were more likely to cluster in education. Over 50 percent of the Blacks received degrees in education, although the field's popularity among Black recipients eroded somewhat in the 1975-1985 period. Conversely, Hispanics' share of degrees in education was somewhat greater in 1985 than in 1975. Hispanics P\"d Blacks followed the upward trends among all Americans in social sciences, life sciences, and professional fields."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "The proportion of women in each of the seven major fields is depicted in Figure 5, and the proportion of minority women is displayed in Figure 6. (Both figures are on page 18.) Women's field selections are shown in Table 3 (page 19). For three of the four women's subgroups in 1985--Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites--the greatest numbers of doctorates were earned in education. Asian women were the only subgroup to vary from this pattern: the largest single fraction of Asian American women earned degrees in life sciences. These proportionate field selections did not always reflect the proportionate presence of women in a field. For example, the largest number of Asian women (49 of 187) were in life sciences in 1985. However, their biggest proportionate share of the whole American Ph.D. cohort was slightly larger in engineering (1.1 percent) than in life sciences. For the other three subgroups, the clustering in education did correspond with the field in which their presence was highest. Of the 531 Black women who earned Ph.D.s in 1985, most--318--were in education; they comprised 5.6 percent of the degree recipients in that field. The largest fraction of Hispanic women, 98 out of 261, earned degrees in education, where they garnered 1.7 percent of the doctorates conferred in 1985. Like Black and Hispanic women, White women clustered in education, earning their largest number of degrees (2,595 of 7,891) and their highest share (45.8 percent) of all degrees awardtd to U.S. citizens.  1975 1985 1975 1985 1975 1985 1975 1985 1975 1985 1975 1985 Physical  The process of attaining the Ph.D. differs by racial/ethnic group and by gender, but the differences weaken when field data are examined. During the 1975-1985 period, the total time elapsed between year of baccalaureate and year of doctorate steadily increased. For U.S. citizens, the median time rose from 8.7 years to 10.5 years. In 1975, Whites had the lowest median time-to-degree: 8.6 years. They were followed by Hispanics (9.2 years), Asians (10.3 years), and Blacks (12.4 years). By 1985, Asians had reduced their time-to-degree and completed their doctorates more quickly than the others--9.7 years. Median time had increased for all other groups--Whites completed in 10.4 years, Hispanics in 11.8, and Blacks in 14.4. Figure 7 depicts the trends in time-to-degree, by race, for U.S. citizens. The time line for Whites shows a generally smooth rise upward. The trends are somewhat irregular but upward for Blacks and Hispanics. For Asians, however, the trend is quite variable. In recent years Asians had the shortest time-lapse, but this trend has not stabilized. The initial impression from survey data has been that women take more time than men to complete the Ph.D.; the strength of this impression, however, is diluted by examination of field data. In 1975, the median time-lapse for male U.S. citizens was 8.4 years, whereas for women it was 9.5 years. By 1985, men were taking a median 9.6 years to complete the doctorate, and women were taking 12.3 years. and by minority men and women, 1975 to 1985. In the first part of the period, women took about 1.5 years longer than men to complete their Ph.D.s. In the 1980s, the gap widened to 2.0, then 2.5 years. By 1985 men and women were apLrt by 2.7 years. The gap was most apparent and widening between White men and women doctorate recipients. The gap was not as pronounced for Black and Hispanic Ph.D.s, although the women still lagged the men. Again, the Asians presented a quite variable picture, with Asian women having shorter times-to-degree than their male counterparts in 4 of the 11 years.    Time-to-degree appeared to be related to field choice. Table K (pages 22-23) displays time-lapse for each of the seven broad fields (labelled \"Field\" in the table) and for those subfields in which 2 percent or more of the new doctorates earned their degrees. When time-lapse data were disaggregated by field, considerable variation appeared. For :12 a 1, example, in 1985 physical science doctorates were earned in the least amount of time, a median 6.8 years, and education degrees took the longest to obtain, 15.5 years. Asians had the shortest time-to-degree, but they were concentrated in the fields which have relatively short time-lapses. Conversely, Blacks, Hispanics, and most women clustered in education, where time-to-degree was lengthiest. Table K shows how the 1985 gap in time-lapse narrowed, both between men and women and between minorities and the total, when data were examined by field. Rather than having a 2.7 year lag, women completed their doctorates more quickly than men in engineering, at the same pace in physical sciences, and between 0.3 and 1.2 years more slowly than men in all other fields. Asian Americans, who appeared to earn their Ph.D.s most quickly, are shown to be no faster than the average U.S. citizen when looked at by field. Hispanics, who had a 1.3 year gap from the average, closed the gap in all but one field and completed degrees more quickly than the average in three of the seven broad fields. The gap for Blacks--3.9 years--was also greatly reduced when each field was looked at separately: the variance was reduced to about 1.5 years."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Support", "text": "Sources of support through graduate school may be a factor in differences in timetl-degree. A grater proportion of women than men reported their reliance on personal income--their own or their family's--as their primary means of graduate school support; in fact, the majority of women Ph.D.s said they did (52.2 percent). Moreover, a greater proportion cf Blacks depended on personal sources than any other group; again, a majority did (53.5 percent). A majority of Asians (51.3 percent) reported primary support from university-related sources. These differences were partly the artifacts of field choice: as discussed above, women and Blacks tended to cluster in fields such as education, where there was little R&D funding, and Asians tended to concentrate in the natural sciences and engineering, where a greater funding pool existed. But when the data were disaggregated by field, differences in support were still apparent between the sexes and the laws. Table L (page 25) shows the differences between men and women, by field, in their primary sources of support.2 The sexes had the greatest support differences in the fields of engineering and life sciences. Women in 1985 received proportionately more university-related support and relied less on personal income in engineering than in any other field, and this was the one field in which they completed their degrees more quickly than men. In life sciences, women were more likely to rely on personal sources and less likely to receive university support than men, and this was the field where the sexes' timeto-degree was most disparate, with women lagging men by 1.2 years. The type of support even within source categories was also somewhat variable. Typically, university-related support is offered through research assistantships or teaching assistantships. Based on primary work activities of employed scientists, research assistantships apparently would be an appropriate avenue for professional socialization, as most scientists and engineers work in the area of Research, Development, and Design.3 Again looking at life scientists, not only did more men receive university-related contributions, but also about 10 percent more men received research assistantships than did women (33.3 percent vs. 23.2 percent). Similarly for the racial/ethnic groups, comparisons of graduate school support by field demonstrate disparities.    35-graduate school. In contrast, 51.3 percent of Asian Americans reported such support, and they completed their degrees in the shortest amount of time. And while 44.6 percent of all recipients reported inimary reliance on personal sources of support, only 30.4 percent of Asians did so. Conversely, the Black group, who completed their Ph.D.s over the longest period cf time, had fewer members who reported institutional contributions as their primary source of support (25.2 percent) but more who indicated that they were supported by personal sources (53.5 percent). Blacks had the lowest proportion of university-related support in the science and engineering fields. For example, 76.1 percent of all recipients in physical sciences indicated that the university was their primary source of support, but fewer Blacks so indicated -66.7 percent. Research assistantships in physical science fields were a primary support mechanism for 61.1 percent of university-supported recipients; however, they were awarded to far fewer of the Black physical scientists-31.3 percent. In contrast with the median 6.8 years to degree for all physical scientists, the median time-lapse for Blacks was 8.5 years. This suggests that differential sources of support through graduate school may be a factor in differences in time-to-degree by gender and race. To look at this question, Table  N compares time-lapse data of recipients whose primary source of support was personal with those whose primary source was institutional, i.e., university-related; data are shown for each of the seven broad fields and each racial and gender group. An overall difference of 6.1 years in time-lapse appears between those Ph.D.s who relied primarily on their own or family resources and those Ph.D.s who received institutional support through the university. The size of the gap varied but was substantially the same for men, women, Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites (the range of difference was from 5.2 to 6.7 years). In comparing the two types of primary support groups, some interesting data appear for men and women. Time-to-degree patterns of those receiving university-related support tended to converge: with the exception of education, time-lapses in all fields differed by a matter of months. But for those relying primarily on personal sources of income for their graduate school support, time-lapses diverged again: with the exception of engineers, women lagged men by 1.1 to 3.5 years. Among the racial groups, time-todegree patterns for Ph.D.s supported by university contributions were similar in the sciences and engineering but began to vary outside those fields. Wpm personal income was the primary source of support, the variance increased."}, {"section_title": "Status of Postgraduation Plans", "text": "After the Ph.D. was obtained, differences between the races and between the sexes did not disappear. Outcomes also varied, such as the status of postgraduation plans and commitments to employment sectors. The \"status\" of plans refers to the certainty of such plans: respondents indicated either that they made a definite commitment, or were negotiating with one or more specific organizations, or were seeking a position. As depicted in Figure 9 (page 29), trends in postgraduation plans for minorities have been more erratic than the trend for Whites. In the early part of the period, Hispanics had slightly higher proportions of new doctorate recipients with definite plans than did the other groups; by 1977, however, all three minority groups had proportionately fewer members with definite status than did Whites. Asians tended to have the lowest such proportion, followed by Blacks and then Hispanics. To examine whether the rates were related to field choice, data were disaggregated by broad fields for 1985. Table 0 (pages 30-31) displays the proportions and shows that in all fields but humanities the cohort of White doctorate recipients had more members with definite plans than did any other group. It was often the case that members of an ethnic group that had high rates of definite plans upon graduating from a given field also showed little clustering in that field, and vice versa. For example, Blacks had the highest proportion with definite postgraduation plans in humanities, yet humanities was a less popular field selection for Blacks than for any other ethnic group (see Table I, page 17). What is more, Hispanics had the lowest proportion of group members with definite plans in education and professional fields, but education was the most frequent field choice of Hispanics in 1985. Similarly, Asians trailed the other ethnic groups in having definite plans following the 28 receipt of the doctorate in engineering and in life and social sciences, yet life sciences was the field most frequently chosen by Asian recipients in 1985. The differences in postgraduation plan status were not only found between the races: the sexes, too, showed disparity in plan status. The overall difference--about 6 or 7 percent more men than women had definite plans--was somewhat mitigated when data were looked at separately by field. Figure 10 (pages 32-33) shows that the gap narrowed in two fields, and in the instance of engineering was reversed. However, differences in certainty of plans persisted in some fields, with women having fewer definite plans. Repeated for women was the phenomenon observed among minority groups--that the less populated field choices had the highest proportion of recipients with definite plans. For example, engineering was the least frequently selected field by women in 1985, yet the highest proportion of women who had definite plans when they finisheo their degrees were engineers (83.8 percent). The second most popular field for women --social sciences --had the second lowest proportion with definite plans (f4.1 percent).  1 975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983  recipients are academe, industry, and government. For U.S. citizens, the distribution among these sectors and the fourth category (Other) is quite similar to the distribution among U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens with permanent visas, described on pages 8-9. However, substantial variation appeared when the data were disaggregated by race and sex or by field. (See Tables P, below, and Q, page 35.) The decline of academe as an employer of new doctorates coincided with the increase in new recipients joining industry or Other. The reduction of academic placements was most apparent in women's employment, especially White women's employment. In 1975, 70.9 percent of women who had definite work commitments in the U.S. intended to join academe. By 1985, the proportion had dropped over 18 points to 52.5 percent, with 7.9 percent being added to industry, 2.6 percent to government, and 7.9 percent to Other. Moreover, the reduction of academic jobs was very strongly seen in Black men's employment commitments: their proportion going to academe in 1975 had been 66.6 percent, but in 1985 it was 42.2 percent. The sector with the largest proportionate increase of employment commitments was industry. Every group except Hispanic women increased its share going to the business sector. This was especially true ar-ong Asians, both for men and for women. The proportion of Asian men with definite commitments to industry rose from 28.0 percent in 1975 to 43.9 percent in 1985, again at the expense of both academic jobs and government  Despite a small reduction in the share of those having definite plans to work for government--from 13.1 percent in 1975 to 12.1 percent in 1985--some groups made more commitments to government over the period. Hispanics, Black men, and White women all raised their proportions. The category of Other also absorbed some of the commitments lost from academe. Table Q shows that the shifts in U.S. employment sectors had varying impacts by field. The reduction of academic employment was 'Zeit in every field but engineering. The field hardest hit was social sciences, where new recipients' commitments to academe were down by 20.5 perms -stage point-'WCX the 1975 -i985 period.

The field w,. se recipients had the greatest increase in work commitments to industry was physical sciences. In 19Z.f. 53.9 percent of physical science Ph.Ds. planned to go into business, surpassing even she engineers in the percentage of new doctorates with such commitments."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "American women and minorities have made gains in their proportions among the new cohorts since 1975, the first year with reliable racial data. Some of the increase was due to the reduction in numbers of White men attaining the degree. There was sometimes strong diversity between the sexes and among the racialJetimic groups. Field composition and selection varied among the subgroups. The lowest proportion of minorities in 1985 was in physical sciences (5.9 percent); the largest was in education (13.5 percent). Asians tended to select engineering and the natural sciences over other fields. Hispanics, Blacks, and most of the women's subgroups tended to cluster in education. Diversity was also apparent in median times-to-degree, with women and minorities experiencing a longer time-lapse between receipt of their baccalaureate and doctorate 35 degrees. However, when field was held constant, the gap in time-to-degree diminished and in some cases was reversed. Differences among the subgroups were observed in sources of graduate school support, which almost certainly is a factor in the time-lapse diversity. Minorities and women had different sources of support than the non-minority ?nd male candidates. This was particularly true for Blacks, who had the lowest proportion of university-related support in science and engineering. When disaggregated by field, the differences in support tapered but did not disappear. Regardless of field, the persons who relied primarily on personal sources of support took much longer to complete their degrees than did recipients who reported university contributions as their primary source of sui_port. In terms of status of their postgraduation plans, a greater proportion of Whites had definite r!ans for postdoctoral study or employment than did Asians, Blacks, or Hispanics. This outcome continued even when field was held constant, except in the case of humanities. In addition, a larger share of men than women had definite plans; again, this disparity narrowed but persisted when data were disaggregated by field. When the employment sector of those with definite commitments was examined, a decline in academic employment over the 1975-1985 period was noted. Moreover, industry attracted a greater proportion of new recipients. Diminishing proportions of Ph.D.s with commitments to academe were seen most strongly among Black men and all women. Increasing proportions going to industry were observed especially among A3ian men and women."}, {"section_title": "36", "text": "'45"}, {"section_title": "APPENDIXES", "text": "APPENDIX A: The Five Basic Tables   Table titles and headings are generally self-explanatory, but a few terms need special definition or explanation. The survey questionnaire is reproduced on pages 63-64. Table 1  Number of Doctorate Recipients by Sex and Subfield, 1985  Table lA Number of Doctorate Recipients by Citizenship, Racial/Ethnic Group, and Subfield, 1985 Table 2 Statistical Profile of Doctorate Recipients by Field of Doctorate, 1985 Table 3 Sources of Support in Graduate School of Doctorate Recipients by Sex and Summary Field, 1985 Table 4 State of Doctoral Institution of Doctorate Recipients by Sex and Summary Field, 1985 Table 5 Statistical Profile of Doctorate Recipients by Racial/Ethnic Group and U.S. Citizenship Status, 1985 Tables 1 and 1A; These tables display 1985 data by subfield of doctorate, corresponding to the fields specified in the Specialties List on page 65. The \"general\" field categories--e.g., \"chemistry, general\"--contain individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"--include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not included among the specialty fields. Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to total calendar time elapsed between the year of baccalaureate and the year of doctorate; \"Registered Time\" refers to the total time registered in a university between baccalaureate and doctorate. Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20 and 21 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out at about the time the doctorate is received, these planned activities can be subject to change. However, comparisons with data from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients have shown these data to be a reasonable predictor of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate.4 Postgraduation plans of the doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), or \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown.\" The sum of these lines totals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 45.5 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 47.4 percent planned to be employed, and 7.1 percent did not report their postgraduation plans; these total 100.0 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided--showing that 11.` percent of all the chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 24.6 percer.:, research associateships; 0.6 percent, traineeships; and 0.8 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided; the percentages, listed by type of employer (educational institution, industry, etc.), total 47.4 percent planning employment. "}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who have definite postgraduation plans (item 19: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who are still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 19: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two flies \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage having \"Postdoctoral Study Plans,\" and the two lines, \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment,\" add to give the percentage having \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by work activity and by region of employment are based on those who have a definite employment commitment. They exclude those still seeking employment and those planning postdoctoral st':dy as described above.  Table 3 are data reported from item 17 on all sources of financial support during the course of individuals' graduate education. The data in the table should be interpreted as follows: 147 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences reported financial support from National Science Foundation fellowships during graduate school. This number is 4.1 percent of the male physical sciences doctorates who answered the question, and it is 37.4 percent of the males in all fields who reported NSF fellowship support. Since students indicate multiple sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent.   Tables 2 and 3. In 1977 the item on racial/ethnic group in the survey questionnaire was re), ised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of the 1977 Summary Report. Changes in the (ALB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the White category to Asian in 1978. In 1980 two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and Other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data and (2) respondents were asked to check only one ethnic category. Prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their racial/ethnic background. However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic and also checked \"White\" were included in the minority -group category; and those whose responses were \"Black\" as well as any other category were designated as \"Black.\" Beginning with the 1982 survey, this item was revised to separate questions on racial and ethnic groups. Respondents are first asked to check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, Black, or WhAce) and then to indicate Hispanic heritage. For purposes of analysis all respondents who indicated Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial identification, are included in one of three Hispanic groups. The remaining survey respondes are then counted in the respective racial groups.   Physics.
