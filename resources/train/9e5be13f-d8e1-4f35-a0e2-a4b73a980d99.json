[{"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This report, produced by SAGE staff working on development of an educational indicators program within NCES, presents five workplans to be implemented during the remainder of the SAGE base year and the planned continuation (option) year. The activities described in these workplans will produce tangible products of use to both NCES staff and users of NCES data. Moreover, implementation of the workplans will provide opportunities for joint working relationships among SAGE staff, consultants, and NCES staff. The five plans call for (1) development of a handbook containing (a) time-series data generated by NCES surveys and (b) guidelines and suggestions for use of these data in analysis; (2) preparation of a brief guide to interpreting indicator data that would be written for nonstatisticians and designed for inclusion in The Condition of Education; (3) construction of composite indexes describing the market values of the numbers and types of degrees offered at public and private colleges and universities; (4) analysis and presentation of accreditation measures for higher education institutions; and (5) design of state reports based on the Common Core of Data, describing the changing conditions of local education agency operations. Appended to this report are two SAGE products that were used in generating and evaluating the proposed indicator workplans: an outline of the variables needed for monitoring the social and economic conditions in education, prepared in draft form by Stephen Ba:ro, and a report suggesting various indicator development projects, pr(Tared by Abbott Ferriss.  Figure 1Workplan 1: Handbook of Analysis for Educational Time-Series Data Rationale NCES is the major producer of time-series data in education, both through the direct collection of these data in numerous surveys and through the reporting of annual data on education originally collected by other agencies. The Digest of Education Statistics and The Condition of Education, issued annually by NCES, are prominent examples of NCES efforts to make these data available to the public. These publications and the many others issued by the Center containing detailed information on educational processes and conditions are not designed for use by analysts of time-series data, however. For time-series and several other types of quantitative analysis, the annual values of variables must be comparable over time and made available for as many years as possible. Factors that might have affected the comparability of values in a data series (e.g., changes in item-wording or survey sampling procedures) need to be extensively documented, and corrections that have been used to remove inconsistencies of this sort from the series (e.g., previous values of a series might have been recomputed to adjust for some change in the operational definition of the variable) need to be described in detail. Finally, to be useful for a wide variety of research purposes, a publication designed for use by indicators researchers should include time series that might be related in analysis to educational data series and should discuss the variety of research issues and purposes that might be addressed by multivariate analysis of these data. Although few examples exist of publications that are so specifically tailored for time-series analysis, the usefulness for indica- At present, the Data Systems Branch within NCES is working to make available to users machine-readable data files containing the educational time series generated by ongoing NCES surveys. What is needed to promote -5-use of these data is a publication that would describe the series, discuss the comparability of series values over time, and describe ways in which these series and series generated by other surveys could be used to examine various educational issues."}, {"section_title": "Description", "text": "We propose to develop a handbook that would describe the major time series generated by NCES surveys and would provide notes on each series concerning changes in data collection concepts and procedures. Descrip-tions of time series that might be analyzed together with these educational data to address various topics would also be presented, and a special listing of data series describing educational outcomes and public pe L' tions would be included (although not generated by NCES data collections). -;ach chapter in the handbook would focus on strategies for use of time-series data in examining a particular aspect of the educational system, such as changes over time in educational revenues and expenditures, facilities and t :aff, institutional characteristics and program offerings, enrollments and attainments, and outcomes and public perceptions. Each chapter would review the data that are available for analysis, note specific types of questions that might be addressed, present descriptions of procedures and findings from prior studies, provide examples of analytical techniques that might be used, suggest other variables to include in analysis, and refer the reader to relevant publications in the area To the extent that this effort can be coordinated with NCES efforts t(. make available time-series data tapes to users, the handbook would cite which disaggregations of series can be obtained from the Data Sys ms Eranch in machine-readable form. This handbook would be prepared in a form suitable for printing and distribution by NCES or by a commercial publisher. Lists of variables included on current NCES survey forms and on those data collection instruments of other agencies that provide data for NCES monitoring and reporting would be compiled first. Various disaggrega-tions of a variable would be described in the handbook (e.g., time series for total enrollments, enrollments by sex, enrollments by race, and enrollments by sex and race would all be described in the handbook). Selection of variables to present and describe in the handbook would be made jointly by SAGE and NCES staffs. 2. SAGE staff would next search for published methodology descriptions and footnotes that refer to changes in survey procedures or in the operational definitions of variables. Such changes could affect the interpretation and comparability of series values over time. Additional information on the changes in definitions or procedures would be sought from NCES staff and the staff of the other agencies working with the various surveys. Proposals for adjusting series values for changes that have occurred would be discussed with staff working on these surveys and with NCES staff involved in development of the time-series data files based on them. Whether or not series values might be adjusted to improve their comparability over time, the measurement history of each time series would be fully documented.\nThe guide we propose to develop would include such topics as the following: chart-reading and use of table data (e.g., suggestions of ways table data can be used to verify or to expand upon information contained in charts), measurement scales and their effects on interpretation and presentation of indicator data, possible sources of measurement error in the data, and types of adjustments made to indicator values to correct for extraneous variation (e.g., the use of constant rather than current dollars can be explained and the reader can be shown how to derive indicator values from different base years). In discussions of these topics, examples would be provided and references to selected materials for further reading by the interested reader would be made. Definitions of statistical terms and procedures commonly used in indicator reports would also be presented in the guide, possibly in the format of a glossary (which might include terms that are presently defined for the reader in appendices to The Condition of Education). Although the range of topics to be included in the guide is -9-broad, the discussions of the topics will be concise. When typeset, the guide should be approximately 10-15 pages in length.\nWe propose to derive (first-approximation) product-value indexes for all public and private colleges and universities included on the longitudinal file being used in SAGE Task 2 to identify indicators of institutional viability. For each level of degree awarded by an institution (i.e., associate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral, first-professional degrees), a composite index would be developed describing the mean market value of all the degrees awarded in a particular school year. The mean market value would be weighted by the proportion of degrees awarded by the college in each field. Perceived market values of degrees in each field would be determined either by the beginning salary offers made to degree recipients in the various fields of study oy the mean salaries of workers in occupations for which certain degrees a/e required, and corrections could be made in these estimates for the rates of unem7loyment associated with the different occupations. Higher Education Product-Value Indexes (HEPVI) for institutions on the longitudinal file would then be analyzed to assess whether the ranges and types of degree programs offered by colleges and universities are associated with their being financially healthy or in distress aad the extent to which colleges in distress tend to expand programs with higher market values and eliminate programs with lower market values. HEPVI measures wo4ld necessarily be rather crude, owing to the fact that institutional reputation and discrepancies among the contents and requirements of degree programs offered by different institutions would not be taken into account. Two schools that offer the same types and numbers of degree programs, for example, may be differentially attractive to students if one of the schools is known to be especially highly regarded by the science or business communities. Similarly, students may prefer to attend institutions that uffer degrees in fields with many job opportunities but impose only minimal coursework requirements. For research purposes, the indicators that are developed would be adequate. HEPVI estimates would permit examination of the relationships between program offerings at institutions and the financial health of these institutions. However, HEPVI estimates would not be suitable for evaluating or ranking individual institutions, although the measures when reported for types of institutions (e.g., Title III institutions) would be of interest to both practitioners and policymakers in higher education. For this reason, the SAGE technical report that would be issued describing development of HEPVI and the relation over time of HEPVI estimates to the viability of higher education institutions would be written without identifying the HEPVI values for individual institutions. At the onset of this task, data on beginning monthly salary offers made to graduates at all degree levels would be obtained from the College Placement Council. The CPC Salary Survey, which provides these data and have been conducted for over 20 years, is based on a representative sample of 161 colleges and universities whose graduates' starting salary offers are obtained from the 184 placement offices serving the schools and from the graduates themselves via sef-reporting. A broad range of job types is surveyed, although teaching is eAcluded. The June CPC report includes mean salary offers based on more than 65,000 job offers at the bachelor's level, 8,000 offers. at the master's level, and 1,000 offers at the doctoral level. For each degree level, mean salary estinates are derived for various cur- Because it has been More Common in past years for science, business, and engineer-ing graduates to receive job offers by the time of the June CPC Salary Survey as compared to liberal arts graduates, a special summer survey is now conducted that attempts to provide better representation of offers to humanities and social science degree recipients. Data from both the June and the summer CPC Salary Surveys would therefore be obtained for HEPVI development."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "When the histories of the selected time series are compiled and methods for adjusting the series values to improve comparability over time have been documented, SAGE staff and consultants would begin to write handbook chapters describing ways of analyzing these data. Drafts of chapters would be submitted to NCES reviewers most familiar with the series that are presented and discussed in each chapter. Although our primary goal in each chapter will be to describe the basic data derived from NCES surveys and suggest ways in which these data might be used in analysis, we will also include in our discussions some of the important secondary statistics that can be derived from these basic data. For example, once the comparability of annual pupil enrollments and instructional staff counts for public and private elementary and secondary schools had been ascertained and each of these series had been described, we would point out the utility of pupilteacher ratios for various analytic purposes.\nThe guide should be included in The Condition of Education first. When tables or charts require knowledge of certain statistical concepts or procedures, references to particular discussions in the guide can be made to assist the reader. A sample of readers of The Condition of Education might be surveyed concerning the usefulness of the guide and asked for recommendations of how it could be improved. Further refinements in the guide could be made by NCES staff.\nAdditional salary and unemployment data would be obtained from the most current NSF-sponsored surveys of the labor force participation of scientists and engineers. For example, the unpublished report by Betty Vetter for NSF entitled Labor Force Partici ation of Women Trained in Science and Engineering and Factors Affecting Their Participation (Grant No. 5R577-19575, June 1979) presents 1978 median salaries for male and -13-female science and engineering degree recipients at all levels, and the NSF report entitled Characteristics of Doctoral Scientists and E ineers in the United States: 1977(NSF 79-306, 1977 provides salary and unemployment estimates for doctoral degree recipients in science and engineering following their college or university graduation. These data would be compared to the salary estimates available from the CPC Salary Survey and the RCG survey to determine discrepancies among the estimates for further checking and to derive unemployment estimates for use in correcting HEPVI values for doctoral degree recipients in science and engineering fields.\nPrototype indicators derived from the data elements selected in Step 1 would next be developed. Following review by NCES staff, the state reports would be prepared for printing and dissemination.\nRiskiness of education as an investment--variability of returns relative to those of other investments"}, {"section_title": "Required Resources", "text": "Eight person-months of effort are budgeted for preparation of the handbook. The work will be a sizable undertaking (it is the largest in scope of the proposed workplans) and will require frequent communications among NCES staff and SAGE staff and consultants. The finished product will be a valuable resource for indicator development activities both within and outside NCES. 14 8 To increase the likelihood that these persons will correctly understand educational indicators, a concise guide to interpreting indicator data, written in nontechnical prose, can be prepared for inclusion in major NCES chartbooks and other statistical reports.\nApproximately three person-months of effort would be required to prepare the guide (30-50 pages typewritten, 10-15 pages typeset) for NCES approval. 6 -10- can reasonably be expected to lead to well-paying jobs following graduation is one factor that determines the relative attractiveness of particular higher education institutions to students and the amount of tuition they are willing to pay. Colleges offering degrees in fields that pay well (e.g., business) can charge higher tuition rates while still attracting .sufficient numbers of applicants. Conversely, colleges specializing in fields with low starting salaries or high rates of unemployment among recent graduates are not a good investment for students unless they offer other services and have low tuition rates. Consequently, the mean market value of a degree from a college (e.g., its mean product value) may be a useful explanatory variable for determining why certain colleges are in distress or are financially healthy within a sector of higher education institutions.\nSix personmonths of effort have been estimated for completion of this workplan. This resource estimate is based on reports of the readiness of CCD survey infoimation for analysis. Should problems be encountered in the use of these data, a revised workplan would be submitted to NCES at the earliest possible time. Introductory Note for Appendices A and B The materials presented in the appendices that follow were prepared as part of the process of generating ideas for educational indicator workplans. To prevent against a too-narrow or completely data-driven approach to designing workplans, Stephen Barro was asked to prepare an extensive outline of the types of variables that might be monitored to assess the economic conditions of education. Because it included many variables related to monitoring the social conditions of education, variables that would need to be analyzed together with the economic variables identified, the outline was retitled, expanded in some areas to include other variables descriptive of the social conditions of education, and circulated among SAGE Task  Acceptances as a proportion of applications by type and level of postsecondary institution and by student characteristics c.

Although earnings estimates are available only for bachelor's and master's degree recipients, RCG does provide estimates of the unemployment rates associated with various fields of study. Moreover, RCG oversamples institutions offering education and teaching degrees and therefore can provide information on the starting salaries of degree-holders who enter the teaching profession in the year after their graduation.\nThe second step would be to draft a SAGE technical report describing the results of the analyses described in information relevant to planning for the future (e.g., 3-5 years ahead); specific standards or criteria that are essential for assessing changes in school characteristics and operations from one year to the next; and o the conceptual frameworks or paradigms that are used by school officials to interpret educational data for their districts and states. In addition to the usefulness of a statistic or indicator for state-and local-level decisionmaking (the key criterion for selection), CCD features explored during Task 2d of the previous AIR SAGE, such as response rates, timeliness of response (which can affect the values recorded for a state on CCD computer files), and the comparability of procedures used in different states to obtain the information (which may affect the choice of comparison measures for an indicator), would be used in the selection process. These same criteria would also be applied in evaluating data sources other than CCD (from which measures would be derived to place the CCD information in context).\nFollowing the selection of data elements and the indicators to be developed from them, SAGE staff would work with NCES staff in the Data Systems Branch to obtain and process data files for the 1979-80 CCD surveys (or the 1980-81 data files if the data are available by November 1981). SAGE staff would also collect the required data from other existing sources (e.g., the 1980 Census) at this time."}, {"section_title": "D.", "text": "How to Lie with Statistics.

Information on starting salaries for selected occupations obtained from this handbook can be compared to those estimates derived from other sources to assess consistency. More importantly, this handbook will provide the.most up-to-date earnicgs estimates for professional degree-holders--estimates not available from the sources mentioned in 1-3 above.\nTrade-offs between rates of return and other outcomes (e.g., World Health Statistics, 1979, 32(1).

(From the information on the 1970 Census/ELSEGIS data tape, it is not clear that this statistic can be generated; however, arrangements could be made for the 1980 data file to report median income by educational level for comparison with teachers' salaries by educational level.) These data could be generated by sex and race for comparisons within school districts. In Goals for America, the Gardner report stated: \"In high school, every academically talented student should study four years of English, four years of mathematics, four years of one foreign language, at least three years of science, and three years of social studies\" (1960, p. 85). To accurately assess the attainment of this goal, high school seniors would have to be classified according to academic aptitude (a 9-point scale would be adequate for this purpose) and according to the number of years of their high school study of these subjects. It is not sufficient to report that the curriculum of the school \"offers\" a program providing \"x\" years in each of the subjects. Rather, it is necessary to show that the graduating seniors completed programs that included various numbers of years schooling in the subjects. This information may be obtained on students who were graduated the preceding year. 1.5 The drop-out rate. The percentage of llth grade students who did not continue to the 12th grade (and continue to reside within the district). 1.6 Expenditure for instruction per pupil, by type of school. Some of these, which may be subject to such periodic sampling determinations, are: 1.8.1 By grade and age, the state of the cognitive development of the child, determined through testing. 1.8.2 Measures of the access of children to information about the world from media outside the school system; that is, newspapers, maga zines, television, radio, conversation with adults, etc. 1.8.3 Reading skills and the use of information so acquired to arrive at decisions. 1.8.4 The extent of use of various standardized (or identifiable) methods of instruction in the classroom. 1.8.5 Continuation of secondary school graduates into higher educa tion and the influences impeding such continuation. 1.8.6 The extent to which elementary and secondary schools enable children from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds to respect and appreciate their own and others' origins. 1.8.7 Measures of the safety and security of persons in the school environment and of the changes in responsibilities for maintaining safety and security as students progress through the grades. The above (1.8.1-1.8.7) will be recognized as items of \"fundamental research topics relevant to education\" from the NRC/NAS report to NIE   Laboratory, 1976). Analysis of continuation ratios may also be conducted by state, but such data are subject to the effects of interstate migration to a greater extent than are national totals. 2.2 Graduates. The interface between high school graduates and entrance into the next higher level of study provides an indicator of \"efficiency\" in the educational system. The ratio of first-time college enrollment to high school graduates the previous June provides one such indicator. Another is provided by the ratio of college baccalaureates to high school graduates four years earlier. -58-2.3 Teachers. In the current period of declining elementary and secondary enrollments, there has not been a corresponding decline in instructional staff, with the consequence that the ratio of pupils to teachers has declined, a movement thought beneficial to learning in the  In addition, it is advisable to reassess the objective, to establish, for example, the optimal size for a school district. It may be that the large size of many school districts is inefficient. 3.

However, if it were the case that too few schools either had changed accreditation status or were other than fully or provisionally accredited during the period described by the data, analyses would be modified accordingly. For example, although the types of agencies and their standards for awarding accreditations to universities and colleges in distress could still be compared to those agencies accrediting financially healthy schools, we might also explore whether composite indicators of accreditation status could be developed for selected institutions within the different sectors based on the accredited statuses of their major study areas and professional schools. Data for these analyses could be obtained directly from the various accrediting agencies, and the composite indexes could be included along with the analyses of accreditation status based on the Task 2 longitudinal file in the planned SAGE technical report.]\nA SAGE technical report would be prepared concerning the development of these reports and recommendations for their continued production by NCES staff based on future CCD surveys (e.g., the software specifications for producing state reports by computer).

According to a recent issue of the Education Directory, \"the best available method of acertaining the general standing or quality of an institution of higher education in the United States is to examine its accredited status.\" Accrediting agencies include regional associations of colleges and schools, professional associations or special professional accrediting commissions, state departments of education, and state universities. This information is available from USOE publications or from each institution. Information also is available on institutions that are recognized candidates for accreditation. A measure is proposed for operating institutions, that is, institutions with students, by type, that are not accred- Educational Organization: Higher Education (Part B) Source: Fall Enrollment in Colleges and Universities (NCES, annual). Enrollment by institution has been collected and published since 1939. Several student characteristics and a number of institutional characteristics are assembled (student characteristics: sex, full-/part-time status, undergraduate/graduate/professional status, freshman status, 10 fields of study, and ethnicity; institutional characteristics: public/private, university, other 4-year, 2-year, state where located). Because of the -62- potential for linkage of the data with other characteristics of the institution, a number of additional traits may be added to the data for analysis. Each survey depicts the institutions, providing the static structure of higher education at one point in time. By linking survey to survey over time, the dynamics of changes in the institutional structure of higher education may be revealed. The problem is to identify significant characteristics for study and to generate statistical indicators that will uncover changes that may be taking place. Jaracz attempted to do this for changes in the types of intitutions for 1953 to 1954 (see section 3.2). Transitions, however, must be examined over a long time period in order to detect routine changes, persistent changes, abrupt departures, etc. For this reason, time series are necessary. Changes in institutional type should be linked to parallel changes in enrollment by type. A number of policy-relevant indicators might be generated from institutional data: 4.1 The changing support base of higher education, the predominent current change being a decline in privately-supported institutions and an increase in publicly supported ones, especially at some levels, e.g. 4.6 Changes in enrollment by major field for institutional types."}, {"section_title": "4.7", "text": "Changes in enrollment by major field for ethnic aE21221."}, {"section_title": "Changes in enrollment by major field by sex.", "text": "A logical indicator of enrollment would be the percent of the population enrolled in the several types of higher educational institutions. This cannot be done for segments of the population defined by age because information on age of the enrolled population is not available in HEGIS. Ratios of enrollments to the size of age cohorts have been used, however, despite the uncertainty underlying such indicators. Table 2 illustrates the problem. While the ratio of NCES enrollments in higher education to the population 18-24 years old is almost identical with the ratio of Census enrollments in higher education to the same population base, the two nevertheless differ greatly from the actual enrollment rate for that age group. As a consequence, the expression of the enrollment data as a function of the population by age is not recommended. -65- Salary information is presented according to 65 positions for administrative personnel and according to six ranks for faculty. The amount of salary is reported by sex and level in $500 intervals. In addi-tion, there is information on expenditures for fringe benefits to personnel."}, {"section_title": "5.1", "text": "Salary by level or position. Actual salary comparisons may also be made when salaries of populations with equivalent education or experience can be identified. A long-standing deficiency of such models has been the need for information on transitions of higher education instructional staff from one state to another from year to year. Among the items of information that must be grossly estimated are the rate of retirement, the rate of mortality, the rate of transfer to employment in other industries, the rate of induction of foreign scholars into U.S. higher education, and so forth. Without adequate estimates of these parameters, such models of higher education manpower can only be minimally reliable. NCES's faculty survey, of course, is the primary source of such information. Short of reliable estimates of the above-mentioned parameters, some internal comparisons may be made with the data. By \"internal comparisons\" is meant comparison of certain statistics between subsets of the data: male instructional staff with female instructional staff, instructional -69-staff in universities with those in other 4-year institutions, and so forth. To illustrate, changes in the frequencies by academic rank of men and women for 1974-75 and 1975-76 may be used to compute synthetic transition coefficients from level to level. (The term \"synthetic\" is used to acknowledge that the derived coefficients do not take into account the loss of personnel due to reasons such as retirement, death, and transfer to other professions.) The comparison shows the differential rates of mobility for the two (Table 3). The rate of progression of males up the academic ladder exceeded that of females in the two top ranks, but females exceeded males in progression from instructor to assistant professor. Such transition coefficients should be linked in time series for annually assembled data. These data may also be used to estimate the rate of  Synthetic transition coefficients were obtained by dividing the total increase in the number of persons at a particular faculty rank by the total number of persons at the next lower faculty rank during the preceding year. For example, the rate of upward mobility for males who were associate professors in 1974-75 was computed in the following way: Increase in the number of male professors from 1974-75 to 1975-76 (58,874 47,087 = 11,787) divided by the number of associate professors in 1974-75 (48,456)  The framework that is needed would enable the analysis of the input of fiscal resources and the expenditures of revenues in relation to the quality of the institutional product--the quality of the degrees produced. Since the data are not released by institution, such an approach would be -72-possible only on an analytical level, and the published results could not identify institutions. However, even this approach must await the development of an adequate criterion of institutional quality (e.g., to assign weights to degrees produced by an institution). This framework could lead to identifying administrative and educational practices that produce a better product per unit of expenditure and thus would provide models for institutions to emulate. Within institutions, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the analysis of per-student expenditures by field of study, in efforts to monitor and control expenditures. This work has been initiated by state boards of control of higher education, notably in Florida and Arizona. It is a contribution to the general subject, of concern to administrators and agencies that support higher education, of the costs of educating a student. 7."}, {"section_title": "Graduates of Higher Education", "text": "Source: Postsecondary Education, Earned Degrees Conferred. Two potential uses of these data are to reflect the quantitative functioning of the educational system and the qualitative functioning of the system. Data on degrees have been extensively used to reflect the former, but the use of degrees to evaluate quality of the system has not been developed. Indicators of quantity may be developed as ratios of input to output of the system, using degrees as output divided by the input of students at an earlier point in time. The generally uniform grading of the educational system makes this possible, it being a system of at least 13 levels of \"output\" each of which may be considered \"input\" to the next higher level. The assumption is that the output from one level continues schooling into the next level and completes the course of study without interruption.

Experimental models should then be developed in an attempt to identify additional models that produce reliable and policyrelevant results. Personnel for this work require a high degree of sensitivity to interactions among variables within the educational system. The second use of the equation would be to place it within a system of equations that comprise the educational system. For example, one equation might predict the input of students into the system, based upon assumptions about the married rate, the fertility rate, the enrollment rate, and other relevant independent variables. This input equation would be placed within the system of other equations which predict (a) the distribution of students by subject, (b) the distribution of graduates by subject, (c) the distribution of first post-school jobs by specialization, and so forth. In short, interactive equations could be developed which would simulate the functioning of major segments of the educational system.
