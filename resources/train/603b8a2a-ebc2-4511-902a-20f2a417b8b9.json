[{"section_title": "", "text": "Why is this important? T HE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF DOCTORAL EDUCATION is widely considered among the world's best, as evidenced by the large and growing number of international students each year, many of them among the top students in their countries, who choose to pursue the doctoral degree at U.S. universities. But the continued preeminence of U.S. doctoral education is not assured. Other nations, recognizing the contributions doctorate recipients make to economies and cultures, are investing heavily in doctoral education. Unless doctoral education in the United States continues to improve, the world's brightest students, including U.S. citizens, may go elsewhere for the doctoral degree, and they may begin careers elsewhere as well. Annual counts of doctorate recipients are measures of the incremental investment in human resources devoted to science, engineering, research, and scholarship, and they can serve as leading indicators of the capacity for knowledge-creation and innovation in various domains. The changing characteristics of this population over time-including the increased representation of women, minorities, and foreign nationals; emergence of new fields of study; time it takes to complete doctoral study; expansion of the postdoctoral pool; reduced academic employment opportunities after graduation-reflect political, economic, social, technological, and demographic trends and events. Understanding the connections between these larger forces and the number and characteristics of doctorate recipients is necessary to make informed improvements in this country's doctoral education system. Doctorate recipients begin careers in large and small organizations, teach in universities, and start new businesses. Doctoral education develops human resources that are critical to a nation's progress-scientists, engineers, researchers, and scholars who create and share new knowledge and new ways of thinking that lead, directly and indirectly, to innovative products, services, and works of art. In doing so, they contribute to a nation's economic growth, cultural development, and rising standard of living.  ........................................................................................

More detailed information and related technical tables are available in the technical appendix to this report, available online at www. nsf.gov/statistics/sed/. Data collection. Survey instruments were mailed to institutional coordinators at each doctorate awarding institution. The institutional coordinators distributed the survey forms to individuals receiving a research doctorate, collected the forms, and returned them to the survey contractor for editing and processing. Data were also collected using Web and telephone versions of the survey. Respondents who did not complete critical survey items were contacted by mail to request response to these items. The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago (NORC) currently conducts the SED under contract to the National Science Foundation. Survey response rates. In 2011, 93% of research doctorate recipients completed the survey instrument. Limited records (field of study, doctoral institution, and sex) are constructed for nonrespondents from administrative records of the university-commencement programs, graduation lists, and other public records-and are included in the reported total of doctorate recipients. Response rates for 2001-11 are provided in the technical appendix. Recent data changes. After a multiyear review of Doctor of Education (EdD) degree programs participating in the SED, 77 programs were reclassified from research doctorate to professional doctorate in 2010 and another 66 programs were reclassified in 2011. No additional reclassifications of EdD degree programs are planned. SED data are no longer being collected from graduates earning degrees from the reclassified EdD programs, and this has affected the reporting of the number of doctorates awarded by sex, citizenship, and racial/ethnic category.
