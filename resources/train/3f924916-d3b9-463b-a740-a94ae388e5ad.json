It is estimated that less than 2 percent of all gross farm sales in the United States can be considered as locally marketed food sold directly to consumers or to local intermediaries (Low and Vogel 2011) . Even in areas with intensive agricultural production, such as Santa Barbara County in California, more than 95 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed are imported and 99 percent of the production is exported (Cleveland et al. 2011) . With increasing specialization in the agricultural industry and falling transportation costs, today's food system is dominated by large industrialized farms 1 that supply consumers separated by a vast number of \"food miles.\" 2 Put simply, consumers are physically disconnected from their food as a result of globalization of the economy.\nDespite increasing concentration of agricultural production, interest in local food among consumers is growing. Local foods-foods grown nearby or supplied locally-are seen as providing greater nutrition, taste, and freshness than nonlocal foods ). In addition, many wish to keep money in local economies, strengthen social relationships between producers and consumers, and minimize food miles while gaining social bene its from preservation of agricultural land. All of these forces have led to growing support for increased \"localization\" of food production (Halweil 2004 , King 2010 .\nCan local farms survive the growing pressures generated by globalization? In the United States, the number of small commercial farms has been declining sharply (Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb 2010, Stanton 1990 ). Globalization has led to an integration of market prices, but production costs remain primarily local because most farming resources are immobile. Among local farmers facing high labor costs, there is growing concern about whether they can remain economically viable in a market increasingly dominated by cheaper nonlocal foods. Nevertheless, even in regions with extremely high wage costs, some local farmers continue to operate despite the inherent production disadvantages. They may be producing high-quality goods and/or have an advantage in terms of better serving consumers; others choose to continue to operate despite suffering inancial losses (Arita, Naomasa, and Leung 2012, Naomasa, Arita, and Leung forthcoming) . In general, little empirical study has been done on how globalization affects the future economic viability of relatively small local farms.\nThe decline of local agricultural production in advanced economies has received much attention and concern, but its links to international trade have rarely been explored empirically. Our study empirically investigates the impacts of import competition and globalization pressures on local farms using the open island economy of the state of Hawai\u02bbi and its fresh fruit and vegetable farms. Linking micro-level farm data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture (National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) 1997 (NASS) , 2002 (NASS) , 2007 to detailed crop-level information on imports from the U.S. mainland and foreign countries, we econometrically test the impact of import competition on the growth and survival of individual farms.\nHawai\u02bbi presents a particularly interesting case for examining the impacts of globalization on the economic viability of local farms for several reasons. Because it is isolated from cheaper sources of labor, Hawai\u02bbi faces some severe production disadvantages. Farm labor costs there are 40 percent higher than on the mainland and, on average, Hawai\u02bbian farms are less than half the size of mainland farms in terms of sales and two to three times smaller in terms of acreage (Arita, Naomasa, and Leung 2012) . Compared to its export competitors, Asia and South America, Hawai\u02bbi suffers from signi icantly higher labor, energy, transportation, and other input costs (Parcon, Loke, and Leung 2010) . The vast majority of the food consumed in the islands is produced elsewhere and imported, and there is increasing concern about the future of the local agricultural industry. 3 Residents have expressed strong support for preserving local production. They are willing to pay a premium of $1 to $3 per pound for local foods (Ulupono Initiative 2011), 4 and the state is taking a remarkably active stance in increasing food localization by advocating for it as part of its development strategy. 3 The exact percentage of food products imported is unknown. However, it is thought to exceed 85 percent (Page, Bony, and Schewel 2007) . 4 Shoppers were willing to pay premiums of $1.75 for a pound of apples and bananas, $1.69 for a pound of tomatoes, and $2.13 for a pound of locally produced rib-eye steak. 5 For example, Hawai\u02bbi's constitution speci ies that \"The State shall conserve and protect agricultural lands, promote diversi ied agriculture, increase agricultural self-suf iciency, and assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands\" (Hawai\u02bbi State Constitution, Article XI, Section 3).\nIn addition, because of Hawai\u02bbi's extreme geographic isolation, the vast majority of the state's fresh fruit and vegetable production goes to local markets, 6 allowing us to precisely de ine and measure local fresh fruit and vegetable farm activity. Food systems tend to be complex, and \"local food\" has so far been ambiguously de ined and proven to be dif icult to intractable to measure. Empirical studies that have assessed local food production and consumption have employed ad hoc de initions and generally crude geographic boundaries (Hinrichs 2000 , Ostrom 2007 .\n7 Our de inition of local food is conveniently de ined by the state's boundaries."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "A further advantage for our study is Hawai\u02bbi's island economy, which makes it is easier to track the amount of food coming into the state. Hawai\u02bbi imports a large number of agricultural products and thus trades openly and routinely with the rest of the United States and with other countries. With detailed in-shipment data, we can account for all fresh fruit and vegetable produce imported from both foreign countries and the mainland to conduct an analysis that includes intra-country food trade.\nWe econometrically assess how imports have affected individual farm production. To our knowledge, this is the irst study to quantitatively examine the impacts of import competition on individual farms. We examine not only how import competition affects farm growth and survival but how it may affect various farms differently. The scale of agricultural operations varies widelyfrom small family farms to vast corporate production involving thousands of acres. Micro-level data regarding farms' size, productivity, and use of capital allow us to examine farms of various sizes and degrees of commercialization. Small noncommercial farms are generally less pro itable and less productive than commercial farms (Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb 2010) . Their operators often view farming more as a way of life than as a business and rely on off-farm income to support their households. Examining how imports affect various types of farms differently allows us to investigate potential structural changes that may occur from globalization.\nOur micro-level approach is theoretically motivated by recent models of international trade that have highlighted the important role of irm heterogeneity. The impacts of globalization are mostly conceptually understood in terms of aggregate, top-to-bottom frameworks. Recent theoretical and empirical contributions in the trade literature have focused on the role of producer heterogeneity, a critical component in understanding deeper structural changes occurring in response to globalization. The studies, guided by the work of Melitz (2003) , have demonstrated that, with irm heterogeneity in productivity, falling trade costs lead to contraction among less productive irms in favor of expansion by more ef icient ones. The resulting reallocation of production generates important aggregate productivity gains. Empirical studies of the manufacturing sector (Greenaway, Gullstrand, and Kneller 2008 , Kim, Reimer, and Gopinath 2011 , Bernard, Jensen, and Schott 2006a have found that irm heterogeneity increases openness to trade and exposes irms 6 Hawai\u02bbi exports the majority of its other agricultural products. Top export commodities include seeds, sugar, ornamental plants, cattle, and molasses.\n7 A commonly accepted de inition of locally consumed food is food consumed within a 100-mile radius of production.\n8 Our de inition is in line with the de inition used by many large private food retailers. Wal-Mart de ines local food as food grown within the state in which it is sold. Other stores, such as Whole Foods, apply a 200-mile rule (Schmit 2008) .\nto competition. In the process, less ef icient irms are weeded out and more ef icient ones bene it through export. Previous studies have analyzed the impact of globalization of heterogeneous manufacturing irms 9 but not of agricultural producers. As in manufacturing, rising levels of imports may also generate structural changes in agricultural production because imports place greater competitive pressure on some types of farms than on others. The United States increasingly relies on imported food (Huang and Huang 2007) , and its agricultural industry has undergone dramatic structural shifts as a result. The number of small commercial farms has declined while the number of very large, capital-intensive farms has grown, a trend that is a source of ongoing concern among policymakers and academics (Aubert and Perrier-Cornet 2009 , Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb 2010 , Hazell 2005 . Technological improvements biased in favor of relatively large farms and lower average rates of return for relatively small farms have been suggested as causes of the decline (Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb 2010) , but trade may be an important unexamined contributor.\nOur empirical results suggest that increasing competition from imports in Hawai\u02bbi has adversely affected the growth of its fresh fruit and vegetable farms. Our estimates of the effect of imports on farm survival are less robust; increasing competition from imports has had little impact on farm exit overall. However, we ind evidence that the size and commercial nature of a farming operation in luences how the farmer responds to import competition. Increased competition marginally increases the likelihood of a commercial farm's exit but has little or no in luence on whether a small noncommercial farm will exit. Thus, operators of noncommercial farms likely base exit decisions primarily on other, nonmarket factors and are less responsive to competitive pressures. Our work suggests that, in a modern open economy that is subject to high labor costs, ongoing globalization will lead to a decline in local farm production but noncommercial farms are less likely to be affected."}, {"section_title": "Decline of Small Commercial Family Farms in the United States", "text": "According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) farm typology, farms may be categorized as very large commercial farms ($1,000,000 or more), large commercial farms ($250,000 to $999,999), small commercial farms ($10,000 to $249,999), and noncommercial farms (less than $10,000). Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb (2010) examined the number of farms in each category and their share of U.S. production between 1982 and 2007 and found a steady decline in the share of U.S. agricultural production generated by small commercial family farms and disproportionate growth by very large commercial and very small noncommercial farms. While the share of U.S. farms composed of the largest operations (more than $1 million dollars in annual sales) grew from 24 percent in 1982 to 59 percent in 2007, the share of small commercial farms (sales of $10,000 to $249,999 annually) fell from 41 percent in 1982 to just 14 percent in 2007. Furthermore, while the number of very large farms more than tripled, the number of small commercial farms declined by 41 percent. Meanwhile, the number of the smallest farms (those with sales of less than $1,000 annually), classi ied here as noncommercial, more than doubled. Despite the signi icant increase in the number of noncommercial farms, the share of U.S. agricultural production contributed by such farms actually fell between 1982 and 2007.\nThe decline of small commercial family farms in the past few decades likely re lects both globalization and simultaneous advances in technology that have made the United States one of the most ef icient agricultural producers in the world. However, the spread of agricultural technology to developing countries, combined with those countries' lower labor costs, have increased competitive pressure on U.S. producers. Since technological improvements tend to be biased in favor of very large operations because of economies of scale (Allen and Lueck 1998) , small-to medium-sized farms may be more severely affected by expanding globalization. According to Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb (2010) , fewer than half of the smallest farms in the United States in 2007 generated a pro it, and the ones that did relied primarily on off-farm income. Farms with sales of $1,000 to $9,999 performed slightly better-60 percent showed a pro it in 2007. That same year, 85 percent of the largest farms showed a pro it.\nThe rate of survival of noncommercial farms (those with sales of less than $1,000 annually) likely depends on several factors. First, 50-70 percent of noncommercial farmers rely on off-farm sources of household income (Hoppe, MacDonald, and Korb 2010, Goetz and Debertin 2001) . Many of the small noncommercial farms can be classi ied as multi-income family farms. Operators of such farms are often driven by motives unrelated to pro it and view farming as a way of life rather than a business (Blank 2002) . These farmers are often descendants of agricultural families who inherited the farms (Blank 1998) . A sizeable portion of the production of such farms may be for household consumption rather than for sale. Furthermore, some of these farmers continue agricultural production in large part for tax bene its (Bittenbender 1993) . 10 Thus, small noncommercial operators have many reasons for remaining in operation despite increased competitive pressure."}, {"section_title": "The Case of Hawai\u02bbi: Surviving Globalization Despite Comparative Disadvantages", "text": "Hawai\u02bbi is geographically isolated thousands of miles from the continental United States and all foreign markets and thus faces some unique economic challenges that mainland states do not. The cost of labor, land, energy, and transportation is high, making Hawai\u02bbi one of the most expensive places in the United States to operate a farm Leung 2010, Parcon et al. 2011) . The state's small size, and thus smaller scale of farms, further aggravates the cost disadvantage (Arita, Naomasa, and Leung 2012) . Today, much of the food consumed in Hawai\u02bbi is produced on the mainland and imported, providing Hawai\u02bbian consumers with less expensive food and a greater variety of products. Those relatively inexpensive imports bene it Hawai\u02bbian consumers in general but increase competitive pressures for Hawai\u02bbian producers.\nAs a small open economy, Hawai\u02bbi faces keen competition from both foreign and mainland-U.S. producers. Parcon et al. (2011) found that Hawai\u02bbi is at a severe disadvantage in terms of input prices compared to its foreign competitors and that Hawai\u02bbi's factor costs for labor, electricity, fertilizer, land, and other inputs are among the highest in the world. Arita, Naomasa, and Leung (2012) found that Hawai\u02bbian farm production is 15-20 percent less ef icient, on average, than production by U.S. farms overall. Figure 1 assesses economic and inancial performance measures for Hawai\u02bbian and mainland farms of different economic classes in terms of sales. We ind that Hawai\u02bbian farms generally do not perform as well as mainland farms. Large commercial farms on the mainland signi icantly outperform their Hawai\u02bbian counterparts in terms of output-input ratio, return on assets (ROA), and net pro it per acre. Hawai\u02bbi's small commercial farms perform almost on par with mainland farms. However, since large commercial production contributes the vast majority of overall U.S. agricultural products, the igure indicates that Hawai\u02bbi is at a signi icant ef iciency disadvantage."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Figure 1 also shows that both Hawai\u02bbian and U.S. farms exhibit economies of scale in agricultural production. Output-input ef iciency, net pro it per acre, and ROA are all increasing with farm sales. Small farms tend to be at a disadvantage in input, marketing, and transportation costs and are unable to take advantage of technologies that could reduce production costs (Paul et al. 2004 ). The average Hawai\u02bbi farm produces half the revenue of the average mainland farm because of the relatively small size of island farms (Arita, Naomasa, and Leung 2012) . In addition, many small noncommercial farms on the mainland and in Hawai\u02bbi routinely suffer net losses that exceed 40 percent. Government payments (Key and Roberts 2006), use of production for household consumption, and other nonmarket factors likely explain why many of these farms remain in operation."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Approach and Hypotheses", "text": "We use Hawai\u02bbi as a case study to empirically investigate the economic impacts of globalization and import competition on local agricultural production. We irst ask whether increased imports of food products into Hawai\u02bbi have had any effect on the number of local farms. Increased imports from abroad may not necessarily lead to a reduction in locally produced products. For fresh fruits and vegetables in particular, many products are imported because they cannot be produced locally. Such products increase the diversity of foods available to local consumers rather than introduce competition. Furthermore, even though agricultural commodities are often de ined as homogenous, there can still be considerable product differentiation. Locally produced foods can differ signi icantly in terms of taste and quality from imported counterparts and may enter the market in a different season. Consequently, local and imported products may not directly compete with each other. Together, these factors suggest that imports do not automatically pose a threat to local production.\nWe then examine the impacts of import competition on farm survival since farm exits are an important component of the structure of an agricultural industry. As in other industries, entry and exit account for a signi icant share of changes in agricultural production and are an important aspect of industry growth (Petrin, White, and Reiter 2011) . With heterogeneous producers, competition favors relatively ef icient irms over less ef icient ones. Theory suggests that increasing pressure from imports accelerates this process, forcing Agricultural and Resource Economics Review the inef icient irms to shrink and exit over time while allowing the more ef icient irms to enter and to expand their operations (Melitz 2003) . However, the process is complicated in agriculture because many farm businesses are not fully commercial and thus may not respond in a typical way to market forces.\nTo assess the impact of import competition on micro-level production reallocations, we test two dimensions-full-time versus part-time farmers and farm size in terms of annual sales. We de ine full-time farms as ones in which the primary operator reported working less than 50 days per year in an off-farm job and part-time farms as those in which the primary operator reported working 50 or more days in an off-farm job. We use this distinction as an indicator of the farm's level of commercial engagement. Since full/part-time farming may be an imperfect way to classify farms, we also use farm size 12 as a measure of commercial motivation. Following USDA convention, we classify farms with sales of less than $10,000 as noncommercial, farms with sales of $10,000 to $249,999 as small commercial, and farms with $250,000 or more in sales as large commercial. This test may also allow us to examine whether additional trade is likely to force the exit of less productive farms.\nWe test three hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: An increase in import competition decreases the entry and expansion of farms.\nHypothesis 2: An increase in import competition increases the likelihood of a farm's exit.\nHypothesis 3: Import competition asymmetrically impacts farms according to their degree of commercialization and size of operation.\nWe employ two measures of import competition-import shares and changes in total imports. The literature on import competition has generally relied on shares of imports as the de facto measure of market openness (Chen, Imbs, and Scott 2009 , Bernard, Jensen, and Schott 2006b , Greenaway, Gullstrand, and Kneller 2008 . Turner (1980) argued that changes in import shares are an appropriate proxy for import competition since they control for the majority of unobserved factors. While many unobserved factors can be controlled for with time and sector effects, the measure nonetheless suffers from endogeneity issues. A positive production shock can be re lected in a corresponding drop in the level of competing imports. For example, favorable weather conditions in Hawai\u02bbi could increase local production and thus decrease Hawai\u02bbi's demand for imports. Changes in total imports are susceptible to the same endogeneity concerns. Only a few studies have devised instrumental variable methods in an attempt to deal with such issues (Chen, Imbs, and Scott 2009) ; however, effective instruments are generally not available.\n13 Given the endogeneity inherent in available measures of import competition, our estimates should be interpreted as upper bound estimates."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use con idential farm-level data for 1997, 2002, and 2007 for the State of Hawai\u02bbi from USDA NASS's U.S. Census of Agriculture. The data set contains production information for virtually every farm in the state. Data on shipments of fresh fruit and vegetables to Hawai\u02bbi from mainland and foreign sources were provided by the market analysis and news branch of the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Agriculture. Virtually all of Hawai\u02bbi's vegetable production stays in the state, as does the majority of fruit produced. Only a few fruit products (pineapples, bananas, and papayas) are exported. We are unable to determine precisely how much of the produce represented in the data is nonlocal (exported to the U.S. mainland or foreign countries), but we believe that the amount is negligible (less than 15 percent of all of Hawai\u02bbi's produce is exported (Page, Bony, and Schewel et al. 2007) ) and that we are thus justi ied in treating our study as an analysis primarily of local food. Unlike the majority of studies examining the competitive effects of outside sources of production, our model considers both foreign and interstate imports. More than 90 percent of the nonlocal fresh fruits and vegetables consumed in Hawai\u02bbi come from the U.S. mainland. Given that most trade in food products in the United States is interstate and not international, we more effectively capture the competitive effects of outside sources of production. Table 1 displays summary statistics for the fresh fruit and vegetable farms used in our analysis. In 2007, approximately 59 percent of the farms were considered part-time operations, and 52 percent of the farms generated less than $10,000 in sales and thus were classi ied as noncommercial. The average size of a farm in terms of sales was $82,064; however, the large standard deviation indicates signi icant heterogeneity in size. Approximately 3.3 percent of the farms were considered to be large commercial operations (generating $250,000 or more in annual sales), but those farms generated 80 percent of Hawai\u02bbi's total fresh fruit and vegetable sales.\nWe observe that the average rate of growth in the number of farms in Hawai\u02bbi has declined signi icantly in recent years-from 4.0 percent for 1997 through 2002 to -0.7 percent for 2002 through 2007. Relative to commercial farms, the number of noncommercial farms grew at a signi icantly faster rate; however, the high standard deviation indicates that there is substantial volatility and heterogeneity in farm growth. In terms of survival rate, large commercial farms fare much better than noncommercial farms.\n14 We ind that full-time farm operations are signi icantly larger than part-time ones, that operators of noncommercial farms have the highest average age, and that large commercial farms have been in operation longer than part-time noncommercial farms. Table 2 reports rates of growth and survival of farms and the average rate of growth in imports for each census period by the crop subsectors used in our analysis. The data reveal signi icant volatility in imports and a strong degree of variation among the individual sectors. Growth and survival rates also vary signi icantly across years.\n14 Survival rates were calculated as the percentage of the total number of farms represented in the data that did not go out of business during the following ive years denoted by the fact that they were again reported in the next agricultural census. This approach likely fails to include a nontrivial number of farms that were not reported in the next census but did not actually exit. For example, a change in ownership of a farm would assign a new census ile number to the farm even though it did not exit and may not have ceased production. "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "To test hypothesis 1, we apply an empirical strategy that augments a model of farm growth to include import competition. Our speci ication is similar in application to models in Schott (2006a, 2006b) , Greenway, Gullstrand, and Kneller (2008) , and Kim, Reimer, and Gopinath (2011) , which tested the impacts of imports and trade costs in models involving heterogeneous irms. In our model, two ive-year cohort periods (1997-2002 and 2002-2007) are pooled to generate a larger sample and more robust estimates of the effect of import competition. 15 The econometric speci ication tests the effect of the ive-year change in import competition on the ive-year change in farms' real total production sales and includes necessary controls:\nThe dependent variable Growth ict is the percentage change in real total production sales between years t and t -5 for farm i producing in cropsector c.\n16 \u2206Import_Competition ct is the percentage change in level of import competition for sector c between years t and t -5 from all foreign and U.S. mainland imports.\n17 Following Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006b), we code the import competition variable at the sector level and cluster effects may exist within crop groups. We include a time effect, \u03b4 t , to control for unobservable changes across the two periods; a sector ixed effect, \u03b4 c , (identi ied at the crop level) to control for all unobservable shocks occurring within different crops; and a county effect, \u03b4 k , to control for the in luence of spatial and geographic factors. 18 The effects are captured through dummy variables. Z it includes other farm-level control variables. Following Weiss (1999), we include initial farm size and farm age as important control variables for farm growth. Since previous work has shown that multiproduct manufacturing irms have a higher rate of survival than single-product irms (Bernard and Jensen 2007) , we include a control variable for multiple crops. Following previous treatments from the literature, we include a dummy variable that equals one for farms that produce more than one crop and zero otherwise.\n19 Figure A1 in the online appendix (available from the authors) shows the distribution of multi-crop activity for the farms in the analysis: 39 percent are single-crop farms and there is a highly skewed distribution of multi-crop activity.\nThe correlation matrix of the variables is provided in Table 3 . We ind that growth in farms is negatively correlated with our measures of imports, farm size, and farm age and with the multi-crop dummy variable. Survival is negatively correlated with import growth and positively correlated with farm size and age and with the multi-crop dummy. Operator age is negatively correlated with survival but the coef icient is not signi icant. Overall, the correlation analysis supports use of the variables included in our models. Table 4 presents the regression results for different speci ications of import competition and farm participation-all farms, full-time farms, and part-time farms. Our Breusch-Pagan test rejects the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity for our speci ications on all farms and full-time farms. To adjust for the role of heteroskedasticity, we calculate robust standard errors, which are reported in parentheses. Given potential correlation within sectors, we also have to adjust our standard errors for clustered effects. The coef icients on changes in import Can Local Farms Survive Globalization? 241 Arita, Hemanchandra, and Leung competition (total change in imports and change in import share) are negative and highly signi icant in the all-farms model. A 1-percent increase in imports leads to a 0.437 percent decline in farm production for all farms collectively, and a 1-percent increase in import share leads to a 0.989 percent decline in production by all farms. The effect of import competition on part-time and fulltime farms is similar. For part-time farms, the percentage change in imports has no signi icant effect on production, but the effect of the change in import share is negative and signi icant. Farm size has a highly signi icant effect on the rate of growth of both full-time and part-time farms. R-squares from the estimates shown in Table 4 range from 0.144 to 0.281. Given that the model seeks to explain the rate of growth (rather than the quantity of production), the model explains a reasonable amount of variation. Table 5 reports results for noncommercial, small commercial, and large commercial farms. We ind that generally all three types of farms are negatively affected by import competition. Small commercial farms contract the most in response to increasing imports. The effect of import competition on 1997-2002 and 2002-2007 .

The results of the regression that tests hypothesis 1 show that increases in imports adversely impacted the production of local Hawai\u02bbian farms. Thus, imports do indeed compete with local products despite consumers' potentially higher valuation of local products or preference for variety. Hypothesis 2 posits that farm survival decreases in response to increased competition from imports. To test this hypothesis, we estimate rates of farm survival in periods t and t + 5 in response to changes in imports, \u0394Import_Competition ct-5 , from periods t -5 and t using a simple probit regression:\nWe again include farm size, farm age, multi-crop activity, time, crop sector, and county dummy variables. Hoppe and Korb (2006) found that operator age is 1997-2002 and 2002-2007 . Coef icients for the regression constant and dummy variables are suppressed. *, **, and *** denote signi icance at a 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent level respectively.\nalso an important factor that in luences farm survival rates. Therefore, we also include the farm's primary operator's age and its squared term as additional controls and expect that survival rates will be higher for farms operated by middle-aged individuals. Table 6 reports the probability of survival under increasing import competition for all farms, full-time farms, and part-time farms. The concordance rates re lect the models' ability to explain the variation in survival rates. The concordance rates generated in our models exceed 0.6, which suggests that the models adequately explain farm survival. We ind that the rate of survival is slightly lower for part-time farms relative to full-time farms. That indicates that our model better explains variation in survival of full-time farms.\nAs in the model of farm growth, we analyze both changes in total imports and changes in import share to measure import competition. We ind little evidence of farms failing at a faster rate in response to increasing competition 1997-2002 and 2002-2007 . Coef icients for the regression constant and dummy variables are suppressed. *, **, and *** denote signi icance at a 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent level respectively. from imports. 20 Other than for full-time farms, the coef icients for import shares are insigni icant. Full-time farm exits are marginally affected by import competition, which suggests that they are more responsive to market forces than part-time farms. Farm size, farm age, and the operator-age-squared term are of the expected sign. The survival rate for multi-crop farms is greater than the rate for all single-crop farms and full-time single-crop farms. These results suggest that import competition does not have a signi icant impact on farm exit despite its adverse impact on growth. Table 7 reports results for the impact of import competition on survival rates for noncommercial, small commercial, and large commercial farms. We ind no signi icant effect for noncommercial farms. The results suggest that small commercial farms are signi icantly impacted by increasing import levels. However, since the coef icients for import share are insigni icant, the results are not very robust. The coef icient for import share on large commercial farms is statistically signi icant but is of the wrong expected sign, 20 We tested different lag lengths for import share, and the results were not signi icantly different. 1997-2002 and 2002-2007 . Coef icients for the regression constant and dummy variables are suppressed. *, **, and *** denote signi icance at a 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent level respectively.\nCan Local Farms Survive Globalization? 245 Arita, Hemanchandra, and Leung another indicator that small sample bias is in luencing the results for large commercial farms.\nThe results of the survival model suggest a weak relationship between import competition and farm exits and some heterogeneity in the effect for different types of farms. The lack of response to competition by noncommercial farms reinforces the idea that those farmers are not as strongly motivated by pro it."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results indicate that import competition has adversely impacted the growth of farms in Hawai\u02bbi's fresh fruit and vegetable sector. Nonlocal products from the mainland and abroad either directly or indirectly compete with Hawai\u02bbian products. Thus, even if Hawai\u02bbi farmers produce differentiated products or enjoy advantages associated with local production or higher quality, imported products still have a signi icant impact.\nThe results for farm survival are less conclusive. We ind some evidence that import competition systematically affects small commercial farms more than noncommercial farms. The results also provide some evidence that globalization is leading to structural changes in the agricultural sector in Hawai\u02bbi by favoring large farms over small farms; however, the results are not robust.\nThe fact that we do not ind a signi icant impact of import competition on farm exit suggests that many incumbent farmers are reluctant to cease operations despite shrinking pro its. Nonmarket factors may explain their reluctance. High ixed costs associated with entering agriculture may also contribute to resistance to exiting. Thus, unlike the manufacturing sector, where globalization can have dramatic structural impacts through reallocation of production resources, strong nonmarket forces associated with agriculture may provide a buffer against some of the impacts of competition.\nLimitations of our empirical research design may affect the indings. The tenyear period used in our analysis may not be suf icient to capture the impact of competition on farm survival. Since exit decisions typically are based on longterm forecasts, import luctuations in the short term may have little bearing on those decisions. Additionally, we were unable to control for the endogeneity between imports and production. The lack of an exogenous variation in imports and effective instrumental variables diminishes the con idence of our estimated results. Future work employing a longer data series and instrumental variables will provide a more comprehensive empirical research design to test the hypotheses.\nReallocation of activities within a farm in response to competition may also explain why Hawai\u02bbi's farms are relatively resilient to import competition. Farmers may adapt to globalization by changing the crops they produce. Recent studies in international trade have examined multiproduct irms and found that irms may reallocate their production mixes in response to changes in trade. Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010) and Liu (2010) found that multiproduct irms drop less pro itable products to focus on core competencies when faced with import pressures. However, we tested that idea in regressions not reported here and found little evidence that Hawai\u02bbian farmers change their product mixes in response to competition from imports.\nWe have not econometrically examined the role of farm entry. Today, the average farmer in the United States is approximately 55 years old (NASS 2007). Many began farming at a young age and continue to operate despite declining pro its. Given the age structure of U.S. agriculture, a potentially signi icant challenge for future industry growth is the retiring of these farmers. While many of the farms with older primary operators also have secondary operators or family members who could take over, the likely degree of turnover is unknown. Since our results suggest that increases in food imports will adversely affect entry of new farms, additional research is needed to analyze impacts of competition associated with agriculture's age structure."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our econometric analysis suggests that the outlook for Hawai\u02bbi's farms is guarded. Imports were found to adversely affect the entry and expansion of local farms and to have asymmetric impacts for various types of farms with small commercial farms being most severely affected. Our study provides interesting insight into the economic viability of local farms. Note that our analysis is based purely on the supply side and does not address important demand-side factors related to local food production. Relative to imported products, local foods tend to enjoy important quality and brand recognition advantages. Considering the dif iculties of competing in global markets, the future of local farms in Hawai\u02bbi and across the United States may depend on cultivating demand preferences of local consumers and enhancing product differentiation. More demand-side analysis is needed to examine the role of these factors in supporting local farms.\nWhile this study is motivated by concern about the decline of local farms, the bene its of trade must also be recognized. Given Hawai\u02bbi's high labor cost and scarcity of land, some food must be imported. Any interest or effort to protect local farms must be cautiously weighed against the gains associated with trade and each sector's comparative advantages."}]
