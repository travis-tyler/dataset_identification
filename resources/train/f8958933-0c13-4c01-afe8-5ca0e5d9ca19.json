[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "exacerbating effects on A\u03b2 pathology. In contrast and unexpectedly, PGRN deficiency significantly reduces diffuse A\u03b2 plaque growth in these APP/PS1 mice. This protective effect is due, at least in part, to enhanced microglial A\u03b2 phagocytosis caused by PGRN deficiency-induced expression of TYROBP network genes (TNG) including an AD risk factor Trem2. PGRN-deficient APP/PS1 mice also exhibit less severe axonal dystrophy and partially improved behavior phenotypes. While PGRN deficiency reduces these amyloidosis-related phenotypes, other neuronal injury mechanisms are increased by loss of PGRN, revealing a multidimensional interaction of GRN with AD. For example, C1q complement deposition at synapses is enhanced in APP/PS1 mice lacking PGRN. Moreover, PGRN deficiency increases tau AT8 and AT180 pathologies in human P301L tau-expressing mice. These human and rodent data suggest that global PGRN reduction induces microglial TNG expression and increases AD risk by exacerbating neuronal injury and tau pathology, rather than by accelerating A\u03b2 pathology."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Progranulin (PGRN) is a secreted glycoprotein widely expressed in several tissues and plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes including development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. In the central nervous system, PGRN is expressed in neurons and microglial cells and is thought to have neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory properties [11, 60] .\nMutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) that result in its haploinsufficiency cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration Abstract Progranulin (PGRN) is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Genetic studies demonstrate an association of the common GRN rs5848 variant that results in reduced PGRN levels with increased risk for AD. However, the mechanisms by which PGRN reduction from the GRN AD risk variant or mutation exacerbates AD pathophysiology remain ill defined. Here, we show that the GRN AD risk variant has no significant effects on florbetapir positron emission tomographic amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 levels, whereas it is associated with increased CSF tau levels in human subjects of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative studies. Consistent with the human data, subsequent analyses using the APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis show that PGRN deficiency has no (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein [11, 60] . However, genetic studies have also suggested a role of PGRN in other neurodegenerative disorders. Homozygous loss-of-function mutation in GRN was found to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) [71] . In addition, PGRN has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies have reported GRN mutation carriers with an AD clinical presentation [7, 17, 41, 43, 59, 62] . Common GRN haplotypes were associated with increased risk for AD in a Belgian late-onset AD patient group [8] . The rs5848 T allele of GRN, which causes at least 10-20% reduction of PGRN protein levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [57, 63] , increases risk for AD as well as FTLD [50, 63, 70, 81] .\nThe mechanism(s) by which GRN variation or mutation modifies AD pathophysiology is(are) poorly defined. AD is pathologically characterized by extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides (A\u03b2 plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Synapse loss is widespread and pronounced. In AD, the chronic A\u03b2 accumulation causes cerebral neuroinflammation by activating microglia [35] . PGRN expression has been shown to correlate with densecore plaques [58] , and is increased in activated microglia around A\u03b2 plaques [3, 58] and peripheral blood [16] . A previous study has described greater A\u03b2 plaque and worsened behavioral impairment in transgenic AD mice with conditional PGRN deletion using LysM-cre mice [56] . However, a recent study as well as earlier publications raises concerns about the efficient and specific targeting using the LysMcre mice and cautions against conclusions drawn from the experiments with the mouse line [5, 79] .\nIn the present study, we investigate the mechanism by which PGRN reduction from the GRN rs5848 T allele as well as GRN mutations increase AD risk and modify AD pathophysiology. To this end, we first analyze florbetapir positron emission tomographic (PET) amyloid imaging and CSF biomarkers in human subjects with the GRN AD risk variant using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. In addition, we examine the APPswe/ PS1\u0394E9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis and human P301L tau-expressing mice with global PGRN reduction. Previous studies have suggested that there is a different level of vulnerability in the human versus mouse brain to PGRN reduction. Although PGRN null (Grn \u2212/\u2212 ) mice recapitulate some of pathological features of FTLD such as microgliosis and retinal degeneration, Grn heterozygous (Grn +/\u2212 ) mice do not, and both fail to show TDP-43-positive inclusions, a key pathological hallmark of FTLD. Therefore, Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice have been studied as the best available mouse model for human PGRN haploinsufficiency-related FTLD [1, 27, 29, 42, 47, 53, 61, 78, 80] . Given this evidence, although GRN rs5848 T allele causes 10-20% reduction of PGRN in humans and GRN mutation carriers with AD clinical presentation are all heterozygotes, we utilize Grn \u2212/\u2212 as well as Grn +/\u2212 mice. Our human and rodent data show that PGRN reduction has minimal effect on dense-core amyloid plaques and is protective against diffuse A\u03b2 plaque growth, while it is associated with increased tau pathology. Thus, PGRN reduction may affect AD pathophysiology by causing tau dysfunction, distinct from A\u03b2 pathology."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mice", "text": "All animal studies were conducted with approval of the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W.

The combined sample size is more than 700 cases. We first analyzed the florbetapir-PET amyloid imaging data. There is progressive increase of the PET radioactive amyloid ligand florbetapir uptake (SUVr) across the clinical spectrum ( Table 1) . As expected, the APOE \u03b54 allele modifies the extent of florbetapir-PET signal, as previously described (Table 1 ) [64] . We segregated the florbetapir-PET results by the GRN rs5848 genotype, which is reportedly linked with decreased PGRN level and increased AD/FTLD risk [8, 22, 50, 57, 63, 70] . Characteristics of the ADNI participants with different GRN rs5848 genotypes are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 .

Strikingly, there is a GRN rs5848 T allele gene dosage-dependent increase of CSF tau levels ( Fig. 1c ; Table 1 ). In addition, there is a statistically significant difference between GRN rs5848 genotypes after correction for covariates (age, sex, diagnosis, and APOE \u03b54 copy number) ( Fig. 1c; Table 1 ). Importantly, the difference in CSF tau between GRN rs5848 genotypes (CC vs. TT) is greater than the one between NL and EMCI in the ADNI dataset (Table 1) .

Only male mice were used for A\u03b2 and ThioS analyses at 6 months of age, to avoid a potential gender effect previously reported in the APP/PS1 strain [45] . The ThioS staining of dense-core amyloid plaques shows either no change, or a slight decrease, in different regions and with different plaque metrics in the 6-month-old and 16-monthold APP/PS1 mice ( Fig. 2a-d; Supplementary Figure 1) .

Co-staining with ThioS and anti-A\u03b2 antibody shows that PGRN deficiency significantly decreases the ratio of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques to dense-core amyloid plaques in 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice ( Fig. 2f, g; Supplementary Figure 1) . The histological analysis was confirmed by ELISA analysis of tissue from these mice. The insoluble fractions from APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice yield significantly less A\u03b2 42 after extraction with formic acid (Fig. 2h) . Immunoblot analysis shows that TBSsoluble A\u03b2 or APP fragments are equal with and without PGRN expression (Fig. 2i, j) , suggesting that the reduction of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques in 16-month-old APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice is not due to changes of APP metabolism. Thus, neither PGRN haploinsufficiency nor its absence accelerates the onset of A\u03b2 plaque in 6-month-old mice. In contrast, PGRN absence reduces diffuse A\u03b2 plaque significantly and selectively, compared to dense-core amyloid plaques in 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice."}, {"section_title": "PGRN deficiency increases CD68-positive microglia near A\u03b2 plaques in APP/PS1 mice", "text": "As a reduction in diffuse A\u03b2 plaque in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice is unexpected and inconsistent with a previous study [56] , we sought to examine how PGRN deficiency prevents diffuse A\u03b2 plaque growth. PGRN is involved in neuroinflammation in the brain and an increase in CD68, a common marker for activated microglia, has been reported in several aged Grn \u2212/\u2212 strains as well as human PGRN-deficient FTLD cases [48, 55, 56, 75, 82] .

At 6 months, the Grn \u2212/\u2212 phenotype is substantially more prominent than the APP/PS1 single gene increase of threefold magnitude (Fig. 3a, b) . The CD68 increase is present at 6 months of age, when A\u03b2 plaques are first forming, and at 16 months, when A\u03b2 plaque density is maximal, the increase reaches 30-fold WT levels in APP/PS1 and 50-fold WT levels in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3c, g ). For APP/PS1 hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the increase of CD68-positive microglia is most prominent near A\u03b2 plaques. High-resolution confocal microscopy confirms that the enhanced CD68-immunoreactive microglial processes interdigitate with A\u03b2 plaques in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3a, e) . Quantitatively, the CD68-positive area colocalized with the vicinity of A\u03b2 immunoreactivity is significantly greater for both 6-and 16-month-old APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, compared with APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 3f, h ). We also examined whether PGRN deficiency affects microgliosis and microglial morphology in 6-monthold mice using anti-Iba1 antibody, a general marker for microglia. Although PGRN absence slightly increases Iba1-immunoreactive area and Iba1-positive microglia in both hippocampus and cortex, regardless of APP/PS1 transgene, the increases fail to reach statistical significance (Supplementary Figure 2a, 2b, and 2c) . High-resolution confocal microscopy shows no significant morphological change by PGRN deficiency in Iba1-positive microglia despite a significant increase in CD68-immunoreactive area (Supplementary Figure 3) . These results using anti-Iba1 antibody are consistent with previous studies using different Grn \u2212/\u2212 strains [1, 75] . In addition, triple staining with ThioS, anti-A\u03b2 antibody, and anti-Iba1 antibody shows that microgliosis rarely occurs near small ThioS-negative anti-A\u03b2-antibody-immunoreactive diffuse A\u03b2 plaques while microglia accumulate robustly around ThioS-positive A\u03b2 plaques in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice, regardless of the presence of PGRN ( Supplementary Figure 4a and 4b) .

Despite an increase in CD68-positive microglia in Grn \u2212/\u2212 background, there is no significant difference in typical pro-inflammatory (iNOS, IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and IL6) and anti-inflammatory genes (Arg-1, TGF\u03b2, Fizz1, and Ym1) between WT and Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice or APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4a, b) . To explore changes of any other microglial genes by PGRN deficiency, we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using 2-month-old WT and Grn \u2212/\u2212 brains (Z. Klein et al., unpublished observations) and analyzed upregulated genes in Grn \u2212/\u2212 brains (FDR < 0.05, logFC > 0.2) using the database STRING website [76] . In a functional protein-protein interaction module of differentially expressed genes detected by the STRING, there is a cluster with TYROBP forming a major hub that consists of many microgliarelated genes including an AD risk factor Trem2 [14] , as well as Ms4a7, one member of the AD risk MS4A gene cluster [41] . Details of the 36 genes in the cluster are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . We also sought to validate our data using the microarray dataset in a previous study with 6-or 9-month-old different Grn \u2212/\u2212 strain [65] . Interestingly, 18 of 36 genes in the cluster from our study were also upregulated in the microarray dataset. We further analyzed them by the STRING and named the genes in the cluster TYROBP network gene (TNG) (Fig. 4c;  Supplementary Figure 5) . Consistent with the immunohistochemical data, Cd68 is also found in the TNG. Several lysosomal cysteine proteases including cathepsin S (CatS) and cathepsin Z (CatZ), which are highly expressed in immune/inflammatory cells, complement system proteins (C1qA, C1qB, and C4B), and Lyz2 [also known as Lysozyme M (LysM)] are also in the TNG. Using qRT-PCR of 6 genotypes, upregulation of at least 10 of 18 genes in the TNG was confirmed in frontal cortex of 6-month-old Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, regardless of APP/PS1 transgenes (Fig. 4d) . Since previous studies have reported that TREM2 and TYROBP are involved in microglial phagocytosis, which in turn is implicated in A\u03b2 accumulation in AD [14] , we next sought to test the effect of increased TNG expression by PGRN deficiency on microglial phagocytic function. Grn \u2212/\u2212 microglia engulf a significantly greater amount of fluorescent beads compared to WT cells at two different concentrations (Fig. 4e, f) . Together, these results show that PGRN deficiency causes TNG expression and facilitates microglial phagocytosis. Thus, increased phagocytosis by TNG-positive microglia surrounding ThioS-positive A\u03b2 "}, {"section_title": "PGRN deficiency reduces dystrophic neurites and partially restores behavior deficits of APP/PS1 mice", "text": "Given the detectable reduction of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques in 16-month-old APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, we examined whether PGRN deficiency affects axonal dystrophy and a memory deficit in APP/PS1 mice. LAMP-1-positive dystrophic neurites are associated with all sizes and ages of A\u03b2 plaques and are present from the earliest detectable stages of A\u03b2 deposition in AD mouse models [28] . We performed triple staining using ThioS, anti-A\u03b2 (2454) antibody, and anti-LAMP-1 antibody and detected the dystrophic neurites even in ThioS-negative and anti-A\u03b2-antibody-immunoreactive diffuse A\u03b2 plaques in both 6-and 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice (Supplementary Figure 6a and 6b) . This demonstrates an association of the LAMP-1-positive dystrophic neurites with diffuse A\u03b2 plaques, regardless of the presence of ThioSpositive amyloid filaments. Consistent with diffuse A\u03b2 plaque results, the dystrophic neurites are significantly reduced in both hippocampus and cortex in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5a-c) . To examine spatial memory, we tested 16-month-old APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice in the Morris water maze. The APP/PS1 mice require a longer latency time to locate a hidden platform across forward learning trials and spend less time in the target quadrant during the probe trial 24 h after learning trials compared to WT mice, as previously reported [26] (Fig. 5d, e) . PGRN deficiency reduces the spatial learning acquisition deficit in APP/PS1 mice at certain time points, although APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice are indistinguishable from APP/PS1 mice in the probe trial (Fig. 5d, e) . For APP/PS1 mice, the PGRN null state reduces axonal dystrophy and improves memory impairment moderately, in contradistinction to enhanced AD risk in humans with PGRN reduction."}, {"section_title": "PGRN deficiency increases accumulation of C1q on neuronal synapses", "text": "To explain the contradiction described above as well as moderate effects of PGRN deficiency on behavior deficits despite a significant reduction in diffuse A\u03b2 plaques in APP/PS1 mice, we considered whether other phenotypes and molecular pathways might be modulated differentially. Our human data with the GRN AD risk variant have shown an increase in CSF tau levels, which reflect neuronal damage accompanied by neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies indicate that complement activation, especially an increase in C1q, mediates neuronal synaptic damage in AD and PGRN null mice [36, 53] . As the TNG also includes C1qA and C1qB, we examined whether PGRN deficiency affects synaptic accumulation of C1q in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Consistent with the RNA analyses, C1q immunoreactivity is increased in dentate gyrus and frontal cortex in Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6a,  b) . Although there is no significant increase in the C1q immunoreactivity in APP/PS1 mice, the immunoreactivity is further increased in frontal cortex of APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, compared to Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6a, b) . Importantly, the staining pattern of the anti-C1q antibody is consistent with several previous studies [12, 53, 72] . We also tested another anti-C1q antibody that is validated by C1q null mice [36, 72] , and confirmed a similar distribution pattern of C1q in both dentate gyrus and frontal cortex and an increase in the immunoreactivity in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Figure 7) . High-resolution imaging analyses of PSD-95 and C1q colocalization show an increase in the colocalization in Grn \u2212/\u2212 and APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6c, d) . The colocalization pattern of PSD-95 and C1q is also similar to that in a previous study [36] . These results suggest that PGRN deficiency enhances synaptic accumulation of C1q that has been reported to cause neuronal damage [36, 53] in APP/PS1 mice. Thus, while PGRN deficiency-induced microglial TNG expression protects against diffuse A\u03b2 plaques, it simultaneously has a detrimental effect on neurons, a downstream target of A\u03b2 accumulation, which can also, at least in part, explain the moderate effects on behavior deficits in PGRN-deficient APP/PS1 mice. , and APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice.

We first tested whether tau phosphorylation is increased in APP/PS Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice by immunoblot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. Although no difference in tau phosphorylation between 16-month-old WT and APP/PS1 mice is observed, there is a significant increase in phosphorylation of tau at S404 in 16-month-old APP/ PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, compared with WT mice (Fig. 7a, b) . A trend toward an increased tau phosphorylation at T181 is also observed but does not reach statistical significance. It should be noted that APP/PS1 mice do not exhibit tau pathologies including neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, to further investigate human tau pathology in the absence of A\u03b2 accumulation, we took advantage of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector that expresses human P301L tau 1-441 under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter. This AAV vector has been used to accelerate tau pathologies in mice and prominent AT8 pathology has been detected at least at 28 days post-injection [2] . We injected the AAV expressing human P301L tau (and GFP) into the entorhinal cortex of WT and Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Figure 8a) and analyzed tau pathologies at 28 days postinjection. To detect tau pathology, we used AT8 (PHF phospho-S202 and phospho-T205) and AT180 (PHF phospho-T231) antibodies because they have been most commonly used for this purpose and are commercially available. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that both AT8 and AT180 signals are significantly increased in Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT (Fig. 7c, d, f, g ). High-resolution confocal microscopy confirms an increase in neuronal AT8 and AT180 pathologies in Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7e) . In contrast, HT7 staining for human tau shows no difference in total viral-mediated expression of human mutant tau in entorhinal cortex between WT and Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Fig. 7h ; Supplementary Figure 8b ). It should be noted that the human CSF (Fig. 1) and mouse brain tissue (Fig. 7) showed differential effects of GRN on phospho-tau and total tau. Nonetheless, the human data from GRN AD risk variants together with mouse data from human P301L tau-expression in knockouts show that PGRN reduction exacerbates tau pathology in AD irrespective of A\u03b2 pathology."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The major conclusions of the present study are that GRN AD risk variant increases CSF tau levels without affecting A\u03b2 pathology in humans and that PGRN deficiency exacerbates tau pathology while it protects against diffuse A\u03b2 plaques in mice. The opposing effects of PGRN deficiency observed in mice are, at least in part, associated with induction of microglial TNG expression, including TYROBP, an AD risk factor TREM2, and a complement protein C1q. Importantly, PGRN deficiency can modify microglial phenotype and enhance tau pathology independent of A\u03b2 pathology.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate how PGRN reduction by GRN rs5848 variant or GRN mutation could modify AD pathophysiology and increase AD risk and we unexpectedly found that GRN rs5848 T allele and PGRN deficiency have no exacerbating effects on A\u03b2 pathology in humans and rodents, respectively. Moreover, complete absence of PGRN prevents diffuse A\u03b2 plaque growth leading to less severe axonal dystrophy and a partial rescue of behavior phenotypes in an APP/PS1 amyloidosis mouse model. This protective effect could be explained by an induction of the TNG expression by PGRN deficiency. Interestingly, the enhanced TNG expression is not due to an increase in microgliosis because PGRN absence has no significant effects on the number of Iba1-positive microglia or typical pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes at 6 months of age. There is also a further increase in expression of several TNG components in APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, although we detect no significant changes in the TNG or pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory genes in APP/PS1 mice, in distinction to previous studies investigating neuroinflammation in AD mouse models [68] . This discrepancy is likely explained by a difference in mouse age [33] . Many previous studies have used aged AD mouse models while we performed qRT-PCR analysis using 6-month-old animals. In fact, we observed a dramatic increase in CD68-immunoreactive area in 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice while there is no such change at 6 months of age. We also showed that PGRN deficiency facilitates microglial phagocytosis in vitro, consistent with a previous study using PGRN-deficient peripheral macrophages [40] . It is thus possible that increased TNG expression cooperatively facilitates microglial phagocytosis to reduce diffuse A\u03b2 plaque pathology. Importantly, a recent study has shown upregulation of very similar microglial gene network including TREM2, TYROBP, MS4A7, CD68, C1qA, C1qB, and Lyz2 by PGRN deficiency [53] , supporting this conclusion. The mechanisms by which PGRN deficiency induces microglial TNG expression will require further investigation.\nCD68 has been commonly used as a marker for \"activated\" microglia. However, we detected no significant changes in microglial morphology or in expression of typical pro-and anti-inflammatory genes by 6-monthold Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice despite the dramatic increase in CD68-immunoreactivity and TNG mRNA levels. It appears likely that CD68 is upregulated as a part of the TNG involved in protein degradation following phagocytosis together with cathepsins CatS and CatZ in Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice, rather than as a marker of typical microglial \"activation\", although the precise role of CD68 in lysosome remains unclear. Our data thus caution against simple interpretation of CD68 immunohistochemistry as microglial activation. In future studies, careful characterization of microglia by gene expression analyses, in addition to CD68 immunostaining, will be necessary to determine specific microglial phenotypes.\nA reduction in diffuse A\u03b2 plaques is detected only in 16-month-old APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice despite increased TNG expression by PGRN deficiency at 6 months of age in our study. We found that microglia are rarely present around small ThioS-negative and anti-A\u03b2 (2454) antibodypositive diffuse A\u03b2 plaques whereas pronounced microglial accumulation is observed around ThioS-positive amyloid plaques even in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice, regardless of PGRN. Consistent with this result, we also found that PGRN deficiency has no significant effect on Iba-1-immunoreactive microgliosis on APP/PS1 background. Importantly, recent studies have shown that microglia and TREM2/TYROBP play a critical role in reducing the diffuse A\u03b2 deposition associated with already formed A\u03b2 plaques and in reducing axonal dystrophy [15, 77, 83] . Our results thus suggest that Grn \u2212/\u2212 microglia may prevent diffuse A\u03b2 plaque growth from ThioS-positive dense-core amyloid plaques most efficiently, rather than delaying the initial formation (onset) of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques. Furthermore, this is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced phagocytosis. In human florbetapir-PET analysis with the ADNI dataset, we have not seen a reduction of A\u03b2 pathology by GRN AD risk variant. This result might be due to the PET tracer possessing a higher affinity for dense-core amyloid plaques, although the full in vivo specificity of the tracer remains to be determined [44] .\nOur A\u03b2 plaque results are, however, inconsistent with a previous study using a different AD mouse model with conditional PGRN deletion [56] . One potential explanation for this contradiction is that the previous study utilized the LysM-cre mice lacking endogenous Lyz2, a gene significantly upregulated in Grn \u2212/\u2212 and APP/PS1 Grn \u2212/\u2212 mice in previous [53, 65] and our studies. Humans have one lysozyme gene, while mice have two encoding LyzM and LyzP [23] , and the gene product lysozyme is reportedly increased in CSF of AD patients and has a protective role in A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro and in fly [34] . Lyz2 deficiency alone might affect A\u03b2 pathology directly or indirectly by compromising TNG-related microglial phenotypes by PGRN deficiency. Alternatively, artificial PGRN reduction in a subset of neurons and microglia by LysM-cre mice [5] and/or AD mouse models used may yield complicated outcomes reflecting the varied and multifactorial and indirect actions of PGRN on A\u03b2 pathology. However, regardless of difference in mouse models, our analyses of human florbetapir-PET and CSF A\u03b2 42 dataset clearly suggest that GRN rs5848 T allele increases AD risk not by altering A\u03b2 accumulation.\nIn contrast to A\u03b2 pathology, our analysis of ADNI database shows that GRN rs5848 T allele increases CSF tau levels in a T allele dose-dependent manner. The difference between GRN rs5848 genotype CC and TT is greater than the one between NL and EMCI in the ADNI cohort, suggesting an importance of this change for increasing AD risk. We also found that PGRN deficiency increases tau AT8 and AT180 pathologies in human P301L tau-expressing mice. PGRN haploinsufficiency causes FTLD with taunegative and TDP-43-positive inclusions [3, 19, 60] . However, in several GRN mutations, tau pathology is observed in addition to TDP-43 inclusion, showing an association of GRN mutation with tau pathology [52, 59, 62] . Although we utilized the AAV vector to examine tau pathologies in mice, AAV injection can be associated with impairment of the blood-brain barrier and inflammation during the period in which abnormal tau aggregates are formed. In addition, as expression from AAV may be transient, germline-modified tauopathy models may be closer to chronic human diseases. Of note, the recent report that PGRN haploinsufficiency increases tau phosphorylation in P301L tau transgenic mice [37] strongly supports our conclusion from AAV studies. The mechanism by which PGRN reduction increases CSF tau levels and tau pathology will be a fruitful site for further investigation. Both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms are possible, since neuroinflammation has been implicated in tau pathology as described previously [54] . The TNG-related microglial phenotype by PGRN deficiency might exacerbate tau phosphorylation despite a reduction in diffuse A\u03b2 plaque pathology in a non-cell-autonomous manner, similar to previous studies using IL-1\u03b2-overexpressing mice and CX3CL1-deficient mice [25, 51] . Our results of C1q immunostaining suggest that greater neuronal injury by enhanced C1q accumulation may exacerbate tau phosphorylation and release into the CSF in GRN AD risk variants. It will be interesting to analyze C1q levels in CSF or brain sections of humans with GRN AD risk variant.\nIt also remains unclear how the GRN AD risk variant affects CSF tau but not CSF p-tau181 in our human study and how it is related to our mouse studies showing an increase in AT8 and AT180 pathologies by PGRN deficiency. CSF phospho-tau is thought to reflect phosphorylation states of tau in the brain [6, 30, 67] . While CSF p-tau181 has been widely used in CSF biomarker studies, other p-tau epitopes such as p-tau199, p-tau231, p-tau404 are also increased in AD patients [6, 30, 67] . A study comparing p-tau181, p-tau199, and p-tau231 using the same samples shows similar discrimination between AD and control [6, 31] . Previous CSF biomarker studies as well as the ADNI dataset in this study suggest that p-tau181-negative p-tau species are also present in the brain and released into the CSF of AD patients. Interestingly, although CSF p-tau181 shows a discrimination between AD and control, the relationship between CSF p-tau181 and AT8 (p-tau202 + 205) and AT180 (p-tau231) pathologies is still controversial and CSF p-tau231 showed a better correlation in AD in previous studies [9, 10] . In the present study of APP/PS1 mice lacking PGRN, we detected no significant difference in phospho-T181 tau while there was an increase in phospho-S404. Therefore, one potential hypothesis to connect between our human and rodent results is that the GRN AD risk variant or PGRN reduction might affect p-tau181-negative p-tau species to cause AT8 and AT180 tau pathologies. Again, further investigations using the postmortem brain with GRN AD risk variant as well as genetically modified tauopathy mouse models will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nDespite evidence that PGRN haploinsufficiency causes FTLD in human, most of previous studies have failed to see significant effects with mechanistic insight in Grn +/\u2212 mice [1, 27, 42, 53, 61, 80] . In the present study, we also observed no obvious phenotypic changes in Grn +/\u2212 mice with or without APP/PS1 transgene, compared to WT. The mechanism by which PGRN reduction differentially affects human and mouse brain functions is currently unclear and further investigation will be required.\nIn summary, studies with an amyloidosis mouse model lacking PGRN and genetic associations in the ADNI database argue against global PGRN reduction having an exacerbating effect on A\u03b2 accumulation. Critically, as an alternative hypothesis for an increased AD risk by PGRN reduction, our studies of human CSF tau levels and human P301L tau-expressing mice show a role of PGRN in tau pathology. Furthermore, identification and characterization of TNG and a TNG-related microglial phenotype in this study provide novel insights into understanding of neurodegenerative disorders including AD and FTLD."}]
