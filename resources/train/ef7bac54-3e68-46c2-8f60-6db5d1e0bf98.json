[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Deep learning applied to MRI for Alzheimer's classification is hypothesized to improve if the deep learning model implicates disease's pathophysiology. The challenge in testing this hypothesis is that large-scale data are required to train this type of model. Here, we overcome this challenge by using a novel data augmentation strategy and show that our MRI-based deep learning model classifies Alzheimer's dementia with high accuracy.\nMoreover, a class activation map was found dominated by signal from the hippocampal formation, a site where Alzheimer's pathophysiology begins. Next, we tested the model's performance in prodromal Alzheimer's when patients present with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We retroactively dichotomized a large cohort of MCI patients who were followed for up to 10 years into those with and without prodromal Alzheimer's at baseline and used the dementia-derived model to generate individual 'deep learning MRI' scores. We compared the two groups on these scores, and on other biomarkers of amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration. The deep learning MRI scores outperformed nearly all other biomarkers, includingunexpectedly-biomarkers of amyloid or tau pathology, in classifying prodromal disease and in predicting clinical progression. Providing a mechanistic explanation, the deep learning MRI scores were found to be linked to regional tau pathology, through investigations using cross-sectional, longitudinal, premortem and postmortem data. Our findings validate that a disease's known pathophysiology can improve the design and performance of deep learning models.

The first two can be estimated from CSF levels of A\u03b2 and tau, or by direct visualization using PET-sensitive radioligands.\nNeurodegeneration, a term currently used to encompass neuronal or synaptic loss 3 , can be estimated from PET-based measures of parietal cortex metabolism, or MRI-based measurements that reflect the structural integrity of the hippocampal formation.\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in principle, holds promise for MRI-based classification of neurogenerative diseases, including AD 4,5 . Furthermore, while some studies have examined classifying MCI conversion using machine learning frameworks, they have done so using other architectures like SVM 6 , examining only up to 36 months 6-8 , using clinical information in the model 7-9 , and few have examined performance independently against existing biomarkers. We hypothesized that designing a deep learning model that considers AD's known pathophysiology and anatomy would improve the model's classification ability. Because 'cell sickness' occurs first and foremost in the pathophysiology of AD 3,10,11 , before dramatic neuronal loss, a classifier is predicted to be improved if it is based on alterations in voxel signal intensity rather than on volume shrinkage. Additionally, informed by the brain's anatomical complexity, particularly the areas whose AD's pathophysiology targets, a classifier is expected to improve if it is based on 3D than on 2D MRI information.\nThe challenge with a 3D classifier that depends on voxel signal intensity is that its training is estimated to require an unusually large number of scans from cases and controls, more than is typically available for AD. Having access to large-scale datasets is a common challenge for deep learning in all fields, and strategies have been developed for data augmentation 12 . We deploy a novel data augmentation strategy that is particularly well suited for MRI-only datasets, by including scans acquired from the same patient across multiple visits. By training, validating, and testing the classifier at the level of individual subjects, instead of individual scans, we minimize the potential limitations of this approach, namely data leakage.\nWe elected not to augment data by traditional methods of image perturbation, like rotating or applying transformations, since structural MRI data have well known preprocessing pipelines to spatially align images. We did not include available clinical information, as studies have done prior 7 , to avoid a model dependent on information that might be sparse or unavailable, as might be the case of clinical evaluation outside of a carefully controlled and harmonized setting, like ADNI.\nIn the first series of studies, we used this data augmentation strategy to accumulate a large-scale dataset of MRI scans generated from patients with AD dementia and controls, and from which we could test our hypothesis about a deep learning model that uses an intensity-dependent 3D classifier. Confirming our hypothesis, the model, which generates individual 'deep learning MRI' scores reflecting AD probability, was found to classify AD dementia with very high accuracy. Moreover, although voxels from the whole brain were included in the model, the most predictive areas turned out to encompass the hippocampal formation. This anatomical profile supports the biological premise of our classification, potentially placing our deep learning MRI scores within the 'neurodegeneration' biomarker category.\nWhile these results were encouraging, AD progresses through a prodromal stage before causing dementia, presenting clinically as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 13 .\nOnly a subset of patients with MCI has prodromal AD, and in contrast to AD dementia, where a clinical evaluation is often sufficient to diagnose the disease, our ability to diagnose prodromal AD when presented with an MCI patient is currently inadequate.\nWith increased awareness and concern over AD, a growing number of MCI patients are presenting to clinicians wanting to know whether they have prodromal AD, and, if so, how quickly they will progress to dementia. Showing that the deep learning algorithm can address the clinical questions that relate to prodromal AD would not only better validate its classification capabilities, but since derived from conventionally-acquired MRI scans, would potentially expand its clinical utility. Accordingly, in the second series of studies we set out to test how well the deep learning MRI scores, derived from the deep learning model trained on AD dementia, performs in detecting prodromal AD and in predicting time to dementia progression.\nAdditionally, we compared its performance to other biomarkers of amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration. Based on the premise of deep learning's classification abilities, we hypothesized that deep learning MRI scores would outperform other MRI-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration. At the same time, given the proposed temporal profile of AD's neuropathology 14 , we hypothesized that amyloid or tau biomarkers would outperform the deep learning MRI score in classifying prodromal AD. Additionally, we investigated the link of deep learning MRI scores to amyloid and tau pathology, using cross-sectional, longitudinal, premortem and postmortem data, providing mechanistic explanation for the deep learning MRI score.\nThe diagnostic cutoffs for all AD biomarkers are traditionally derived from patients in the dementia stage, and biomarkers shift over the disease's progressive course, particularly dynamic during its early stages. Since cutoffs for prodromal AD\nhave not yet been established for any of the biomarkers, the best experimental design with which to test these hypotheses is to clinically follow a large group of MCI patients as they progress to dementia, so that the patients can be retroactively dichotomized into those with and without prodromal AD at baseline. Biomarkers can then be tested to determine which best classifies prodromal AD and which best predicts progression. The challenge with this design is that, based on current estimates, approximately 5 years of clinical follow-up is needed in order to allot sufficient time for the majority of prodromal AD patients to clinically manifest as dementia 15, 16 . Here, we were able to implement this experimental design thanks to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which has been acquiring biomarker data in a large population of MCI patients since 2005 and to test the two hypotheses about which biomarker best classifies prodromal AD, and which predicts progression to dementia."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Classifying the dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease", "text": "The deep learning model was trained, validated, and tested on 975 MRI scans repeatedly acquired in patients in the dementia stage of AD, versus 1943 MRI scans repeatedly acquired from healthy controls. In the test set, a 'deep learning MRI' score was derived for each scan from the model, with the score reflecting the probability of each scan having AD. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the deep learning MRI scores accurately classified AD dementia vs. healthy controls with an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) of 0.973 ( Fig.   1a ).\nNext, we generated an AD 'class activation map' to determine whether the deep learning MRI scores derived from the model were regionally dominated. We find that the deep learning MRI scores are dominated by alterations in voxel signal intensity that localized to anterior medial temporal lobe, in the vicinity of the anterior entorhinal cortex and hippocampus ( Fig. 1b ). We note that while the class activation map localized to the left more than the right anterior medial temporal lobe, in agreement with previous findings 17-19 , contralateral areas emerged with lowered thresholding."}, {"section_title": "Classifying the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease", "text": "From ADNI, we identified a cohort of participants who were diagnosed with MCI at baseline and who had a complete set of CSF amyloid and tau biomarkers and structural MRI (N = 582; the inclusionary and exclusionary algorithm is illustrated in Fig. S1 ).\nAmong these, 205 participants progressed to AD dementia at follow up ('MCI progression' group), and thus had prodromal AD at baseline, while 179 participants remained MCI stable for at least 4 years ('MCI stable' group) (Fig. 2) . The dementiaderived deep learning classifier was used to generate deep learning MRI scores on each individual case.\nROC analyses revealed that the deep learning MRI score outperformed all other biomarkers in classifying the MCI-stable from the MCI-progression group (Fig. 3 ). The AUROC of deep learning MRI score was 0.788 (Accuracy at Youden (ACC)=75%), superior to CSF A\u03b2 (AUROC=0.702 ACC=66.7%, significantly lower than the deep learning MRI score, p=0.0141), CSF tau (AUROC=0.682, ACC=66.4%, p=0.0161), CSF tau/A\u03b2 (AUROC=0.703, ACC=68.5%, p=0.0161); superior to MRI-based measures of hippocampal volume (AUROC=0.733, ACC=67.7%, p=0.0484), entorhinal cortex volume (AUROC=0.64, ACC=62.5%, p=2.01E-6), and entorhinal cortex thickness (AUROC=0.685, ACC=64.1%, p=1.71E-4); and, finally, superior to Mini-Mental State Exam (AUROC=0.648, ACC=63.3%, p=6.70E-5), and to neuropsychological measure most sensitive to the early stages of AD, the RAVLT retention score 20 (AUROC=0.686, ACC=67.7%, p=2.28E-3).\nAdditionally, the deep learning MRI score was found to outperform or perform as well when tested in a subset of participants in whom additional PET-based biomarkers were available --FDG-PET that by measuring parietal cortex metabolism is considered a biomarker of neurodegeneration 21 , and AV45-PET, which by using an amyloid radioligand is a biomarker of amyloid pathology 22 . In this subset, the deep learning MRI score classified prodromal AD with an AUROC=0.815 (ACC=78.6%), compared to the AUROC of 0.782 (for PDG-PET (ACC=75.4%) and 0.751 (ACC=71.4%) for amyloid-PET, although the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 3 , bottom panel)."}, {"section_title": "Predicting progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia", "text": "Survival analyses were performed to determine which biomarker best predicted progression to AD dementia among the MCI groups. Results revealed that compared to other biomarkers, the deep learning MRI score best predicted time to conversion to AD dementia, as illustrated by the survival curves of high and low deep learning MRI scores and tau/A\u03b2 ratios (Fig. 4 ). The deep learning MRI scores showed better prediction capability (|z|=11.0, p=4.35E-28) than CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology (A\u03b2 |z|=6.37, p=1.87E-10, tau |z|=5.70, p=1.18E-08, tau/A\u03b2 |z|=5.41, p=6.29E-08); than MRI-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume |z|=8.80, p=1.35E-18, entorhinal volume |z|=6.02, p=1.75E-09, entorhinal thickness |z|=7.42, p=1.21E-13); and, than behavioral measures (MMSE |z|=5.72, p=1.07E-08, RAVLT retention |z|=6.88, .

The deep learning MRI scores were found to associate more with tau pathology (with an MRI-autopsy interval below 2 years, Braak staging: r=0.397, p=7.70e-3; Thal staging: r=0.196, p=0.203) ( Fig. 5 bottom panel) . To further explore the regionality of this relationship, we found that the deep learning MRI score correlated with tau levels mapped by tau-PET, with strong correlations observed with tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex (r=0.449, p=1.66E-15)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The level of performance achieved by our deep learning model in classifying AD dementia supports our hypothesis that a disease's pathophysiology should be considered when evaluating performance as well as justifying the data augmentation strategy used. Further validating the assumptions, design, and implementation of our model is the fact that, despite incorporating information from the whole brain, the class activation map was dominated by signal in the anterior entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, precisely where AD pathophysiology begins 3, [17] [18] [19] 24 .\nStronger validation of the deep learning model was provided by the second series of studies when the dementia-derived classifier was applied to the prodromal stages of AD. Supporting the first hypothesis of this study, we found that our deep learning MRI scores outperformed other MRI-based measures of neurodegeneration in both classifying prodromal AD and in predicting progression to dementia. Refuting the second hypothesis, we found that the deep learning MRI scores performed at least as well and typically outperformed biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology.\nWe do not consider this unexpected finding a challenge to the primacy of amyloid and tau pathology in the neuropathological progression of AD 25 . The deep learning MRI scores were found strongly linked to tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex, a region where AD pathology begins 24 , and its superior performance likely reflects this sensitivity.\nIt is possible, therefore, that tau-PET would outperform the deep learning MRI score and other biomarkers. ADNI, however, has only begun acquiring tau-PET in 2015, and there is currently insufficient data to test this prediction in our experimental design.\nFuture analyses from ADNI and other long-term PET studies will be able to test this prediction.\nThe observation that the deep learning MRI scores outperformed biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in predicting time to dementia is less surprising. As a biomarker of neurodegeneration, this finding agrees with prior studies 26 and with the current model for the temporal sequence of AD's neuropathology 25 . Since in this scheme neurodegeneration occurs last, accurate biomarkers of it are more proximal to the development of dementia.\nThe strength of our prodromal AD study is that by relying on progression to AD dementia as a way to retroactively identify patients with prodromal AD, we overcame the limitation that precise biomarker cutoffs for prodromal AD have not yet been established. We designed the analysis based on prior studies that suggest that the majority of MCI patients with prodromal AD will progress to dementia within 4-5 years 15 , an assumption confirmed in our study. Furthermore, approximately half of the MCI cohort ended up having prodromal AD, which agrees with previous approximations 27 .\nStill, a potential weakness of our study is the possibility that a minority of patients in the stable MCI category are harboring prodromal AD at baseline. The number of misclassified patients is likely to be low 27 , and so this potential imprecision would not be expected to significantly alter our results. Tracking stable MCI patients for longer periods might address this concern, but would in fact raise a new one: when tracking patients for a decade or more, particularly given the high incidence of AD in older populations, some are expected to develop AD de novo after the baseline evaluation.\nWe can conclude that our findings and their conclusions are beyond reproach for a 5-year time window after initial evaluation, a clinically meaningful epoch for both patients and clinicians.\nOur study provides the proof-of-principle that imaging-based deep learning models that are examined in concert with a disease's pathophysiology will yield a highly accurate model and improve performance in prognosticating disease. Showing that deep learning can enhance the utility of MRI in prodromal AD is the more important clinical implication of this study. Ordering \"neuroimaging studies\" 28 is the current standard of care when evaluating a patient with MCI suspected of having AD, most typically the conventional MRIs from which the deep learning MRI scores were derived.\nThe rationale for this recommendation and its routine clinical implementation is not to 'rule in' AD, but rather to exclude other non-neurodegenerative causes of dementia, such as strokes, bleeds, and tumors. Deep learning algorithms that can extract useful information for the purposes of prodromal AD detection, from conventional MRIs that have in any case been acquired, has the additional advantages of reducing patient burden and cost incurred by lumbar punctures, injection of radioactive ligands, or other additional testing."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants in the Alzheimer's disease dementia study", "text": "All data were obtained from ADNI, a multi-site observational study, which were acquired in accordance with each site's respective Institutional Review Board, including obtaining written consent acquired from each participant.

In this study, the training, validation and test sets were partitioned at subject level to ensure non-overlapping subjects.
