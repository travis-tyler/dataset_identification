Over time, education data have accumulated, and at the present, large volumes of data with numerous types of statistics have been collected as operational data. This research article takes the advantage of these data and applied predictive data mining approaches to study the performance of general education diploma students (year 12 of school). The decision tree as a classification method has been applied and a prediction model is constructed with ability to show relatively high accuracy of students' performance prior to year 12 of school, using 30% test data of nearly 6000 student's records. The significant variables that influence students' performance are identified which would help stakeholders and decision makers plan ahead and have more time to prepare for decisions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, information has proven to be a significant asset. Many organizations are ready to invest substantial funds and resources into procuring data of a certain type. Many global technology enterprises such as Google and Facebook depend on the revenue derived from their ability to display targeted advertisements to prospective viewers. Their ability to manage 1 and process large quantities of data is one of the fundamental strengths of these companies. Two of the most important and closely related technology fields that have emerged in recent decades are data mining and business intelligence (BI). Today, if businesses want to maximize their profits, utilizing the technology in these fields is imperative. Applying BI in any organization would be by building a new data access approach of the history transactions data, providing fully aggregated multidimensional visualized information that is an essential aid for decision makers. Data mining presents a similar approach but performs deeper analysis and processing of the organization's historical data, which could reach the point of predicting potential customers for a certain service, for example. Using data mining algorithms that are designed wisely to study, 2 analyze, and examine the data interactions, data mining could provide nearly perfect anticipations of an organization's performance depending on the type of information stored. Currently, many data mining algorithms are optimized for artificial intelligence 3 and machine learning developments. Educational organizations are also striving to enhance their services and improve their students' performance, which can be through the use of data mining. Students have always been the focal point of all teaching and learning institutions. In the interest of better education and superior student performance, the Ministry of Education in Oman has continuously developed and utilized technology within the education process. There are multiple approaches regarding how to enhance education in general, for instance by studying successful educational systems in other countries or by implementing international standards. However, studying historical data presents a considerably easier, lower cost, and more dependable approach. Reviewing statistics has often proven efficient in large businesses. In addition, the data analysis field has grown vastly in recent years. Data mining algorithms are one of the repeatedly used methods for studying data to reveal information important for decision makers.\nThis article focuses on a data mining study on general education diploma students' records. Students at this level have distinguished attention and concern from family and community due to this level's importance as a final year in school and as a gateway to higher education.\nThis study offers several contributions:\nI. The study identifies and discusses many of the significant factors that influence students' performance at grade 12 in Omani schools. II. The study successfully implements various predictive and descriptive data mining algorithms, and the results show high predictive ability of the models. III. The study provides a great deal of groundwork for future educational data mining (EDM) studies specifically in Oman for the Ministry of Education."}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "Data mining is \"the process of finding patterns from a large amount of data by applying some techniques.\" 4 Data mining places great scientific attention to detail in large volumes of data. Its use of arithmetic calculations makes it robust and it precisely reveals information patterns from row data. Data mining results could add incredible value to educational organizations. \"As a result, it would assist the educators in providing an effective teaching approach.\" 5 \"Big organizations use it primarily for finding new ways to increase their profits and to minimize cost.\" 4 Data mining techniques include regression, classification, clustering, association rules, and time series analysis, as shown in Figure 1 . Each approach contains a large quantity of algorithms and models that have been studied and modified over time by different researchers. Success rates differ depending on data and the circumstances of the problem."}, {"section_title": "Educational data mining", "text": "EDM is an emerging field that combines the power of data mining technologies with the education sector. EDM focuses on studying data from educational systems such as learning management systems. Prediction of a student's performance and behavior is achieved using prediction algorithms that include classification, regression, and density estimation. 6 Clustering is done by grouping students with similar characteristics, such as interaction patterns and learning curves. Learning analytics is a field similar to EDM. Both of these fields have goals related to improvements in educational architectures overall, which also studies and analyzes educational data. 6 The EDM process consists of five important points, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The first step is to collect the targeted raw educational data, which can be obtained from learning management systems, registration systems, and educational surveys; the second step is preprocessing the data to match the input format for the desired EDM method, this could include removing empty and null data and creating cubes if using online analytical processing for multidimensional data. The third step is to implement the EDM methods on the data prepared. In the fourth step, educational business questions should be answered depending on the results of the third step. The last step is to modify the education process accordingly, or to defer this step until after further investigation has been conducted that can provide more accurate results. 6 "}, {"section_title": "Classification", "text": "Classification is one of the most popularly applied approaches to data mining. Algorithms in this category aim to create classification models using the training data so that prediction of results falls into one of the classes estimated by the classification algorithm. Each algorithm has its own learning technique to detect data that are related to other data in the data set, which helps it build an accurate model that could predict values that are unknown, the popular classifiers are support vector machines, decision tree, neural networks, naive Bayes, and rule-based classifiers. 7 For each of these classifiers, there are a number of algorithms and versions that have been modified and enhanced over time. Researchers often apply multiple algorithms and compare results and accuracy because different algorithms work better in specific scenarios. Parneet Kaur et al. 8 have applied multiple classifiers on a data set of 152 school students, including multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes classifiers, sequential minimal optimization, decision tree algorithm J48, and reduced error pruning decision tree. The study concluded with multilayer perceptron showing the best performance with 75% accuracy of prediction. Anuradha and Velmurugan 7 have targeted student results for undergraduates in their final year, and the data set used included student results of the semesters in college in addition to personal and precollege data collected using surveys. The study applied the J48 decision tree algorithm, naive Bayes classifiers, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and two rule learners classification algorithms, OneR and JRip. The results of the study show that all of these methods performed well with an accuracy of above 60%, and most of the classifiers produced high accuracy rates for the average student's performance. The exception to this was JRip, which predicted more accurately for students with distinctive performance, 7 in their work many input attributes of college student data for analysis were used, and the results of this study could be very beneficial for higher education managers wishing to enhance their education process. Mustafa Agaoglu 9 targeted instructor's performance using the course evaluation questionnaires usually completed by students at the end of each semester. He applied four different classification tactics and seven classification models, including decision tree algorithms (C5.0 and classification and regression trees), support vector machines, artificial neural networks (ANN; quick with two hidden layers (ANN-Q2 H), quick with three hidden layers (ANN-Q3 H), and multiple method (ANN-M)), and discriminant analysis. Table 1 presents the summarized results of this study. Although this study perfectly applied many of the classification algorithms with high accuracy rates, its data set was retrieved from university students' evaluations of the courses and the instructors. It could be beneficial for universities nonetheless, as its attributes are limited to the questions included in the questionnaires and it excludes other significant values like the instructor's experience, age, health condition, academic degree, and number of working hours.\nThe decision tree method splits data into subgroups called nodes and leaf nodes. This method is fast and easy to understand, although considered among algorithms of slow learners. It is often combined with complex data mining methods to reduce the number of variables by selecting the best variables. Decision trees reflect how strongly related each node is to the parent node. The result of the decision tree shows the strongest variables at the upper level, followed by the next level until the tree reaches the leaf node. Variables can be used multiple times in the child nodes. Nodes usually represent a part/class of any variable within the input variables. Decision trees are known to deal with classes or discrete variables particularly in the output/predictor variable (e.g. marks of the student must be in classes such as A, B, C, D, F, or 0, 1, 2). For this research, students' final year results at school is the criterion variable. Although this data is usually a collection of marks for each subject, it was converted into classes to be accepted by the decision tree method. See Figure 4 as an example of the decision tree basic structure."}, {"section_title": "Regression modeling", "text": "Linear regression is one of the most used methods to comprehend algorithms. It represents the data as a linear graph and primarily shows the relationship between different variables. Usually, studies select a dependent variable or predictor that they focus their analysis on, and then they examine how other variables are related to the main variable. This provides an indication of strong, positive, weak, negative, or no relationship. Commonly, linear regression creates a straight line fitness of the data, but in some cases the analysis may not result in a straight line, which is read as a nonlinear relationship.\nLinear regression can be categorized into two types: simple linear regression and complex linear regression. Simple linear regression is where one independent variable is tested against the dependent variable. It provides a direct analysis of a one-to-one relationship. However, more commonly multiple independent variables have a variant effect on the main variable. In this case, a complex linear regression approach is implemented. This approach measures how the combination of variables could form the predictor. In the opposite of linear regression is logistic regression, Figure 2 . Outline of the EDM process (Adapted from Calvet et al. 6 ). EDM: educational data mining. which is applied when a predicted variable is not continuous, for example, binary answers like yes/no, male/ female, or married/bachelor. Since it is difficult to create a linear diagram using binary variables, the probability of the variable is used instead. Burgos and his colleagues 10 have an interesting application of the logistic regression algorithm in modeling students' performance to prevent dropouts. Their dataset consisted of 124 students registered in five courses with 12 graded activities to be completed within 20 weeks. The study aimed to predict dropout rates in early stages of the courses in order to apply an intervention plan to improve student performance and prevent students from dropping out, the predictor variable was either dropout or pass, logistic regression was applied instead of linear regression. The generated prediction models were applied to the students enrolled in the following academic year, over weeks 4, 7, and 10, since week 4 was a due date for activity 1 and week 10 was the courses' halfway point. Students who were identified as potential dropouts based on the logistic regression model were contacted and informed by instructors as per the intervention plan, which resulted in a dropout rate of only 11% instead of the 26% seen the year before, showing about 14% improvement. 7 This study reflects the promising potential of the EDM field and how it enhances education processes. Many EDM studies do not reach the level where they solve real educational issues, provided that it is the sole objective of such studies. This study reflects the promising potential of the EDM field and how it enhances educational processes. Many EDM studies do not reach the level where they solve real educational issues, provided that it is the sole objective of such studies.\nDepren et al. 11 conducted a study that involved a large data set and critically compared classification algorithms. In their research about the performance of EDM methods, the authors stated, \"logistic regression outperforms other algorithms in terms of measuring classification performance.\" The data set used by Serpil K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Depren et al. 11 was obtained from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study records of 6250 eighth grade students in Turkey. It involved 11 factors related to student information and mathematics, and a binary dependent variable indicating mathematic achievement. The study tested multiple classification methods: two decision tree algorithms (random forest, and J48), a Bayesian network algorithm (naive Bayes), an ANN algorithm (multilayer perceptron), and the logistic regression algorithm. All algorithms performed above 74% for correct-classification ratio, with logistic regression showing the highest performance at 78.6%."}, {"section_title": "Clustering", "text": "Clustering is similar to classification but is an unsupervised approach to grouping similar elements of data together. The clustering algorithm needs to discover the clusters without any prior idea about the labels or the classes of information. 12 The algorithm measures the distance to the centroids in the cluster to decide on similarity between objects. 13 Clustering is more of an exploratory or descriptive approach that inspects related data. Although it can be applied in many fields related to EDM, there are some remarkable research areas where clustering can group study patterns and student behaviors, particularly on online learning services. 13 There are many different clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and self-organizing feature maps such as the unsupervised neural network technique. \"K-means' clustering algorithm is one of the most classic and widely used clustering algorithms.\"\n14 K-means clustering uses a K value as the number of required clusters and subsequently distributes the data set into K clusters. 13 It can easily cluster large data sets. 12 For such large data sets, however, it is difficult to guess how many clusters (K) should be given to the Kmeans clustering algorithm. The x-means algorithm is a modified K-means method that can automatically estimate the ideal number of clusters (K) that should be applied, based on Bayesian information criterion. 13 Study published in 2010 by Alex J Bowers 15 applied hierarchical clustering analysis to analyze a data set of 188 student marks over 12 years in two US schools in different districts. The result of this entire process was combined in a novel comprehensive cluster-gram that included a clustertree of the hierarchical clustering, a heat map of students' subject marks, and categorical information including dropout rates, rates of taking the ACT 1 exam, gender, and district.\nSingh et al. 16 applied the K-means clustering algorithm in research that aimed to understand and enhance student performance at the university level. The authors used a data set of 99 complete student records and applied K-means with different numbers of clusters each time. They then used a silhouette measure (a measurement of the similarity between objects in the same cluster) to select highest suitability that resulted as three clusters. 16 The results showed the number of students distributed through the three clusters, which could help university management obtain a better idea about student performance. Although this study was simple and concise, it could be improved by applying other data mining algorithms or by increasing the data set to include a broader number of students and/or a larger number of attributes."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The secondary data collection method is applied in this research. This approach is excellent for data mining methods with a large data sets target. This research uses transactional educational data already collected and stored over the last 3 years. Using this type of data is highly beneficial but requires the organization's permission and instructions for use, because formerly these data were gathered only for targeted applications. The data required for the research are scattered across the databases and stored in a way that it involves countless techniques to reshape and connect it in order to provide more meaning for the research. Larger data sets can provide rich and varied information that reflects real-world statistics and interactions. This is essential for organization improvement and for decision makers, as it can help in spotting irregularity and extracting key performance indicators.\nThe research methodology in this article is a simple flexible data mining reconstructed structure. It creates a mining structure view from raw data extracted from a database. It then applies data mining methods to reveal relevant information. Often, a great deal of feedback occurs during the execution of data mining. Therefore, each step of the framework (Figure 3 ) is able to return back to the previous step to enhance the results and ensure better performance of the data mining methods, which helps provide reliable information."}, {"section_title": "Data planning", "text": "This project focuses on taking advantage of the vast data already collected and used by the Ministry of Education in Oman for other education purposes.

Both Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent and Bayesian with K2 prior produced very similar decision trees, while the entropy method produced a very large decision tree structure. Since the decision tree method prefers discrete predictors, the total results of students in year 12 were classed as A, B, C, D, F, as shown in Figure 5 , representing 100-90, 89-80, 79-65, 64-50, and 49-0, respectively. The graph in Figure 6 represents the resulted decision tree with density highlighting the class 'A' students of year 12 result.\nThe decision tree method identified the five attributes that most affected a student's total results in grade 12.

Predictions with accepted accuracy have proven benefits in many fields, for example, in climate and weather conditions, and such predictions need to be utilized more in the education sector. Education stakeholders could also benefit from how descriptive data mining techniques can summarize and show relationships between data. Bearing in mind these relationships could save time and effort in understanding the students' data and how student performance is reflected. The research article outcomes propose many possible modifications for the education process. For example, since the average result of classmates has a significant impact on the results of individual students, elevating low achievers' performance could be done by mixing low achievers with high achievers. Also, as per the study results, the total result from year 11 is a high positive indicator for year 12 performance. Therefore, schools, parents, and students themselves should begin to work together from year 11 to improve student performance. In reality, only subject results from year 12 are used to express the performance of general education diploma students; however, this study proved scientifically using data mining that previous years have a sizable impact on this performance, statistically speaking. Although this study involved about 6000 students and 3 years of their study records, the results are not conclusive for direct decision change at ministry level. Higher decisions have higher responsibility that forces for extensive testing and approval of outcomes and to include all possible inputs.
