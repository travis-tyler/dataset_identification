Thus, bias in these survey methods increases the uncertainty in the diagnosis of AD.\nWith respect to this point, an automated and physician-friendly computer screening of AD is urgently needed. Several research groups have investigated various fully automated approaches in AD studies (Bedell et al., 2014; Beheshti, Olya, & Demirel, 2016; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Franke, Ziegler, Kl\u00f6ppel, & Gaser, 2010; J Martinez-Murcia, G\u00f3rriz, Ram'irez, & Ortiz, 2016; Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008; Mikhno, Redei, Mann, & Parsey, 2015) . Despite recent progress in the automated assessment of AD, the development of an automatic approach that addresses the uncertainty of diagnosing AD is still challenging and requires further data. Previous studies have shown that neuroimaging data along with advanced pattern recognition techniques can be used for predicting clinical scores (Moradi, Hallikainen, H\u00e4nninen, Tohka, & Neuroimaging, 2017; Shen et al., 2011; Stonnington et al., 2010) as well as chronological age (Cole, 2017) . The brain-age technique was recently introduced as a powerful biomarker that can be used to estimate an individual's neuroanatomical age (Duchesne & Gravel, 2016; Franke et al., 2010) . The use of the brain-age technique has helped reveal the abnormal brain changes in many brain studies such as those of AD (Franke et al., 2010) , the prediction of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (Gaser, Franke, Kl\u00f6ppel, Koutsouleris, & Sauer, 2013) , and investigations of the brains of children and adolescents (Franke, Luders, May, Wilke, & Gaser, 2012) , long-term meditation practitioners (Luders, Cherbuin, & Gaser, 2016) , and schizophrenia patients (Koutsouleris et al., 2014) .\nHere, we introduce the \"Brain-Age Score\" (BAS), which we define as the difference between an individual's chronological age and his or her neuroanatomical age, as a fully automated and reliable index that can be used to assess the level of AD in individual subjects. We developed an automated brain-age framework based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) features obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data in order to estimate the neurological age among healthy controls, individuals with MCI, and individuals with AD.\nThe proposed framework was trained on 385 samples from the IXI dataset (http://www.brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/) and the OASIS dataset (http://www.oasis-brains.org/). We evaluated the proposed framework on 147 AD patients, 112 progressive-MCI (pMCI) patients, 102 stable-MCI (sMCI) patients, and 146 healthy controls (HCs) acquired from the J-ADNI dataset. More information about J-ADNI is provided in the Appendix and (Fujishima et al., 2017) . To test the efficiency of the proposed framework, we performed a correlation test between the BAS and the neuropsychological screening tools (i.e., MMSE, CDR, ADAS, and FAQ) as well as between the BAS and anatomical MRI measurements (i.e., normalized gray matter (nGM), normalized white matter (nWM), normalized cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF), mean cortical thickness, and hippocampus volume).\nIn light of the relevant literature, we hypothesized that the BAS would show adequate performance in the screening of the level of AD in a fully automated manner, using only a standard MRI scan.\nOur findings demonstrate that (1) the BAS is capable of being used to diagnosis an individual's level of brain atrophy, and (2) it can be considered a reliable automated index for clinical applications as well as neuropsychological screening tools."}, {"section_title": "| LITER ATE RE VIE W", "text": "In this section, we review the brain-age models as well as feature selection procedures in a series of neuroimaging studies. Several research groups have investigated automated methods to estimate the neuroanatomical age from sMRI data. As an example, the team of Gaser and colleagues (Franke et al., 2010) introduced an automated framework in the basis of GM density maps through a standard VBM procedure and a regression model for estimating the brain-age of healthy subjects. They examined the influence of different factors such as MRI preprocessing, regression models, data reduction, the use of different scanners, and the training sample size on the age estimation accuracy using sMRI data. In another study (Gaser et al., 2013) , the researchers modeled a brain-age framework using a structural MRI database of 320 healthy controls obtained from the IXI and OASIS datasets, and they estimated the individual brain ages of MCI patients from the ADNI dataset. They reported an accuracy value of up to 81% for predicting conversion to AD in MCI patients at the baseline. The authors in presented longitudinal alterations in BAS in the 150 AD patients, 112 pMCI patients, 36 sMCI patients, and 108 HCs from the ADNI dataset, where correlation values of r = \u22120.46, r = 0.39 and r = 0.45 (p < 0.001) were achieved between baseline BAS and the MMSE, the CDR and the ADAS scores, respectively. In (Koutsouleris et al., 2014) , the researchers examined neuroanatomical age estimation in individuals with schizophrenia and other mental disorders. They trained their proposed brain-age framework using a structural MRI database of 800 healthy subjects examined at five different centers, and then, they evaluated individuals in at-risk mental states for psychosis, borderline personality disorder, and major depression and schizophrenia subjects. The researchers in (Luders et al., 2016) considered a brain-age framework to investigate the neuroanatomical age in subjects who had been regularly engaging in meditation for a period of years.

They stated a mean BAS of 4.66 and 5.97 years for GM and WM modalities, respectively, among TBL patients. In another study , the authors conducted a brain-age model by combining the GM and WM modalities from 2,001 healthy controls to investigate the brain age on HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects. According to this research, they realized that HIV-positive subjects have a significantly greater BAS in comparison with HIV-negative subjects.\nMany researchers have presented different dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods in machine learning for neuroimaging studies. For instance, the authors in (L\u00f3pez et al., 2009) conducted a data reduction on features extracted from single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images by means of principal component analysis (PCA). In (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2010) a new data reduction method was introduced by the means of partial least squares (PLSs) to overcome the curse of dimensionality. The authors applied the proposed PLSbased method on SPECT data and extracted the score features for an AD classification task. The PLS-based data reduction has been widely used in different neuroimaging studies (Chaves, Ram\u00edrez, G\u00f3rriz, & Puntonet, 2012; Khedher, Ram\u00edrez, G\u00f3rriz, Brahim, & Segovia, 2015; Ram\u00edrez et al., 2010; Segovia, G\u00f3rriz, Ram\u00edrez, SalasGonz\u00e1lez, & \u00c1lvarez, 2013) . The researchers in (Liu, Zhang, & Shen, 2016 ) used a sparse-based feature selection method to find informative features from template space for AD classification and MCI conversion prediction. In , the authors proposed a feature-ranking strategy for identifying the most informative features from a high-dimensional space in an AD classification task. The dimensionality of selected features was determined by the mean of fisher criterion. It is worth nothing that the most of these approaches were hired in classification studies.

The details of the feature-ranking strategy were as described Beheshti, Demirel, Farokhian, Yang, & Matsuda, 2016) . The proposed feature selection approach is applied only on training data. In the present study, we sorted all voxels based on the respective correlation value of each voxel value and the subjects' chronological age, in an ascending order. Then, we increased the number of ranked features from 1 to utmost number of features, along with the calculation of the respective mean absolute error (MAE) during the cross-validation strategy.\nBased on the cross-validation strategy, we divided the training data into different k-folds, where, in each step, k-1 folds are randomly used for training a regression model and the remained fold for testing. This process is performed k different times by leaving a different fold as test data, which are then used to estimate the respective MSE values. In this study, k = 5 was used. For each iteration (i.e., increasing the number of ranked features), the total MAE was calculated by the averaging of MAEs obtained across the cross-validation.\nThe optimal number of ranked features that minimizes the total MAE was selected as the optimal subset.
