The stereotypical belief connected to math is the idea that men are good at math and women are bad at math. In the survey, students had to respond to eleven statements on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 being totally agree, 5 totally disagree). Five of the items were retrieved from the gender schema measurement scale created by Smetackova (2015) . Only the items appropriate for measuring stereotypical beliefs connected to math were used from the initial nineitem scale created by Smetackova (2015) . A pre-test of the survey demonstrated that the items based on the Smetackova (2015) measure were interpreted as too extreme, which might result in low variation and non-response. Therefore, six additional more nuanced statements were included. After a factor and reliability analysis three items were removed due to cross loadings. Eight items for the measurement scale were retained (KMO measure of sampling adequacy is 0.913 and all KMO values for individual items are greater than 0.860. Cronbach's Alpha is 0.937).\nThe eight items used to construct the variable stereotypical belief are: -men are often better at math than women (Smetackova, 2015)\n-women do not have the 'right brain cells' for math (Smetackova, 2015) -men are born with talent for math (Smetackova, 2015) -men are better at logical thinking than women (Smetackova, 2015) -I think that in general girls need to work harder for math than boys -I think boys understand math faster than girls -I think girls need more time to understand complicated math than do boys -I think boys are better in solving complicated math problems than are girls The variable stereotypical belief is constructed by calculating the average of the items for each respondent."}, {"section_title": "Academic self-concept", "text": "Academic self-concepts are defined as beliefs and judgements about one's performance in a subject (Pajares & Miller, 1994) .

Six of these statements were based on the measurement scale for academic self-concepts for math used by Arens, Marsh, Pekrun, Lichtenfeld, Murayama and vom Hofe (2017). Arens et al. (2017) retrieved items for their measurement scale from the Project for the Analysis of Learning and Achievement in Mathematics (PALMA) that analyses adolescents' developments in math (Pekrun, vom Hofe, Blum, Frenzel, Goetz & Wartha, 2007) . The measurement scale of Arens et al. (2017) was complemented by six more emotionally focused statements from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
