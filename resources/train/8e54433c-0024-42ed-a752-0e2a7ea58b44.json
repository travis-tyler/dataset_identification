Information has been gathered as well on numerous independent variables, such as standard demographics, and variables measuring educational support, parent's socioeconomic status, family composition, language use, and home environment. The core of intervening variables encompasses school experiences such as exposure to given curriculum content and structure, assessment and evaluation systems, social relations, school behavior, and participation in extracurricular activities. Comparisons of high school students at different points in time can help to address critical issues of educational achievement and equality of educational opportunity, such as the following: Has the quality of education in American high schools improved or deteriorated over the past ten and twenty years? What particular school and student variables are related to any changes that may have taken place? Which of these variables are manipulable, that is, can improve policies and practices so that higher levels of achievement, increased rates of school completion, and a better quality of educational experience will result? Is there a narrowing of the gap between different gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status groups in such basic educational outcomes as tested achievement and persistence in school? Is equally high quality schooling received by different gender, socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups? What policies and practices have proved most effective over the years in bringing about higher levels of educational opportunity for all? There has been much public discussion of and concern about American education in the two decades during which the NELS data have been gathered. Scores on standardized achievement tests declined in the 1960s and 1970s. The tested achievement of non-Asian minority groups has lagged considerably behind the test scores of whites and Asians. International comparisons of test results have heightened public anxiety about whether American schools are achieving as much as they can, or as much as they need to achieve to maintain the nation's international economic competitiveness. Major efforts to improve schooling in the United States were undertaken in the 1980s and continue at this time. The vi breadth and depth of the NELS data setswhich contain a substantial body of student questionnaire data as well as test results, and an array of additional information ranging from school records to parent, teacher, and school administrator reportsprovide a deepened picture of the educational processes that contribute to the achievement trends of the last two decades, and a deepened understanding of the interplay between school factors and community and family context in influencing educational results. The NELS data sets provide as well a body of rich information on post-high school outcomes that can be related to educational antecedents studied in the earlier data collections of each study, and which thus help to clarify the consequences for individuals and society of trends in achievement and persistence in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. by NCES was High School and Beyond. HS&B was initiated in order to capture changes that had occurred in education-related and more general social conditions, in federal and state programs, and in the needs and characteristics of students since the time of the earlier survey. Thus, HS&B was designed to maintain the flow of education data to policymakers at all levels who need to base their decisions on data that are reliable, relevant, and current. Base year data collection was conducted in the spring of 1980. Students were selected using a two-stage probability sample with schools as the first-stage units and students within schools as the second-stage units. Unlike NLS-72, HS&B included cohorts of both tenth and twelfth graders. Since the base year data collection in 1980, four follow-ups of the HS&B cohorts have been completed: one in the spring of 1982; one in the spring of 1984; one in the spring of 1986, and (for the sophomore cohort only) one in the spring of 1992. The four NELS program cohorts (NLS-72 seniors, the HS&B sophomores and seniors, and NELS:88 eighth graders) are displayed in Figure 1-2 according to their initial and subsequent survey years and their modal age at the time of each survey. As illustrated, NLS-72 seniors were first surveyed in 1972 at age eighteen and have been resurveyed five times since, with the last survey occurring in 1986, when these respondents were about thirty-two years of age. The HS&B cohorts have been surveyed at points in time that would permit as much comparison as possible with the time points selected for NLS-72. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. The base year study, conducted in the spring term of the 1987-88 school year, selected 26,432 potential eighth grade participants, of whom 24,599 were successfully surveyed in 1,052 public and private schools. Additional data were gathered from eighth graders' parents, teachers, and principals. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Freshening' the NELS88 sample to represent the twelfth grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The NELS:88 third follow-up is taking place in 1994, at a time when most sample members are in postsecondary education or in the labor force. A major goal of the 1994 round is to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B, and to continue cross-wave comparisons with previous NELS88 rounds. Additionally, the third follow-up will permit researchers to assess the effect of eighth grade and high school curricular experiences on postsecondary education choice. The 1994 follow-up will provide the means by which access of individuals with different backgrounds to different kinds of educational institutions can be examined. The third follow-up will facilitate study of the influences of The process referred to here as 'freshening\" added students who were not in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country or because they were not in eighth grade in the spring term of 1988. The 1990 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in tenth grade in the spring of 1990. The 1992 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in twelfth grade in the spring of 1992.  32   I I  10  9  8  7   6  5   4   31   30  29  28   27  26  25   24  23   sal   22 44   21   20   19   18  17  16  15   high school education experiences on postsecondary education and employment opportunities and choices. Labor force participation, postsecondary persistence, curricular progress, and family formation are further research topics which will be explored by the third follow-up. Additionally, the 1994 survey will provide a basis for assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route, and will measure the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other postsecondary institutions. A fourth follow-up is scheduled for 1998. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. NELS88 is a longitudinal study. In such a study, a probability sample of a population is drawn at one time (for NELS:88, 1988 eighth graders) and the same individuals are measured at later times (for NELS:88, 1990(for NELS:88, , 1992(for NELS:88, , 1994(for NELS:88, , 1997. In a crosssectional survey a probability sample is drawn of the population at one point in time. NELS:88 data can be analyzed longitudinallyone can examine what happens to the eighth grade cohort over time (for example, one can measure gains in mathematics achievement between 1988 and 1992, or who drops out of school between 1988 and 1990). The capacity to measure change in individuals over time is a distinctive strength of the NELS88 design. Following individual educational histories generally provides the best basis for making causal inference about educational processes and their effects. The base year of a longitudinal survey is also, by definition, a cross-sectional survey. Hence NELS88 base year data can also be analyzed cross-sectionallyresearchers can look at the situation of a nationally representative sample of eighth graders in 1987-88. NELS.88 has a special sample freshening feature which effectively supplies two additional nationally representative cross-sections: the nation's spring 1990 sophomores, and spring 1992 seniors. Thus the first and second follow-up data can also be analyzed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Cross-sectional data provide a snapshot at a single point in time. The capacity for longitudinal analysisthe measurement of individual-level changeis the paramount strength of NELS:88. However, group-level cross-sectional data as well can be employed to measure stability and change over time, when cross-sections are repeated to form a time series. NELS88 provides two examples. (1) Across waves within NELS:88, one can measure group-level change across successive cross-sectionseighth graders in 1988, sophomores in 1990, and seniors in 1992. An instance of this would be examining eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade math scores of Hispanics relative to whites to see if disparities became larger, smaller, or remained the same as grade level increased? (2) At the intercohort level, one can use a single round of NELS:88 in conjunction with a corresponding population taken from comparable studies (e.g. ,  and HS&B) as repeated cross-sections (e.g. of seniors in 1972, 1980/82 and 1992) to measure trends. Such cross-cohort analysis is the subject of this monograph. The three NELS study seriesNLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88offer a number of possible time points for comparison. The possible comparison points, and the considerations of content and design 2 This kind of analysis is only appropriate if the phenomenon to be studied is not subject to extremely rapid change, since it does not permit historical trends and grade level differences to be disentangled. Note that this measurement would involve use of three overlapping but non-identical samples. For example, not all eighth graders would progress to tenth grade at time 2 (1990), and to be representative of tenth graders (in 1990) the sample would have to be freshened with individuals who were not eighth graders in 1988, and so on. In contrast, a longitudinal measurement would employ an identical (that is, a single) sample surveyed at three time pointsthe eighth grade cohort in 1988, 1990, and 1992following individuals who remain in school regardless of whether they progress in modal sequence, and following individuals who leave school as well, that is, who become dropouts or early graduates. 1c1 which may affect the comparability of data across the cohorts, are discussed in detail in the remainder of this monograph. Appendix A documents specific comparison items that appear on the 1972, 1980, 1982, and 1992 high school senior questionnaires. For the convenience of users interested in sophomore cohort comparisons, Appendix B provides a crosswalk between the 1980 HS&B and 1990 NELS:88 student questionnaires."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "Conducting Trend Analyses of NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 Seniors: Analytical Implications of Design Differences Between the Studies This methodology monograph discusses the kinds of comparisons that can be made between NELS88, HS&B, and NLS-72, and the time points at which these comparisons can be made. This report also points to issues of similarity and difference in sample design and test and questionnaire content. NELS.88 has been specifically designed to facilitate comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B. At the \"student\" level, three kinds of comparative analysis are possible (described below and summarized in Table 1). 1) Cohorts can be compared on an intergenerational or cross-cohort time-lag basis. Both crosssectional and longitudinal time-lag comparisons are possible. For example, (1-A) cross-sectionally, NELS88 1992 results (when restricted to sample members who are seniors) can be regarded as the third in a series of repeated cross-sections of twelfth graders. That is to say, the status of NELS:88 second follow-up seniors in 1992 can be compared to HS&B base year seniors in 1980, and to NLS-72 seniors in 1972. Longitudinally (1-B), change for NELS:88 1990 sophomores two years later (that is, in 1992, when the cohort included both students and dropouts) can be compared to changes measured in 1982 from a 1980 HS&B sophomore baseline. 2) Fixed time comparisons are also possible, in which groups within each study are compared to each other at different ages though at the same point in time. Thus NLS-72, HS&B senior cohort and HS&B sophomore cohort sample members could all be compared in 1986, some 14, 6, and 4 years after each respective cohort completed high school. (For example, employment rates in 1986 of 22, 24, and 32-year old high school graduates can be contrasted.) The only available fixed time comparison using NELS88 data, however, involves contrasting HS&B fourth follow-up and NELS.88 second follow-up 1992 results. One might, for example, compare the 1992 educational expectations of the two cohorts to explore how 17-18 year olds differ from 27-28 year olds in this respect. Or one might utilize the 1992 life values responses (questions concerning the importance to the respondent of being successful in work, having lots of money, having strong friendships, and so on) to compare HS&B Fourth Follow-Up sophomore cohort members with NELS88 Second Follow-Up survey participants. 3) Finally, longitudinal comparative analysis of the cohorts can be performed by modeling the history of the age/grade cohorts. NELS-88 trend comparisons need not, however, be strictly limited to NLS-72 and HS&B. Comparisons are also possible using transcripts data collected for high school seniors, not only for HS&B 1982 graduates and NELS:88 1992 graduates, but also for 1987 and 1990 graduates in NAEP schools' Other national probability samples as well may provide comparison points.' a Care has been exercised in designing and implementing the academic transcript study in NELS:88 to maximize the comparability of NELS:88 transcript data with the high school transcript data for 1987 and 1990 graduating seniors. While an independent high school transcript study was not conducted in NLS-72, course taking summary information was collected from school records for the 1972 seniors. For a detailed account of cross-cohort transcript comparison issues, see Ingels and Taylor, 1994. For example, major national studies of high school seniors, employing test and survey measures, were conducted in 1960 (Project Talent) and 1965 (the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey) (see Schrader and Hilton in Hilton led.) 1992 for a discussion of comparability issues); also, the high school graduating classes of 1975-93 have been surveyed (and followed up as young adults) by Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth, a key source of trend data on, in  sophomores versus 1990Sophomores\" 2. 1982/1992Sophomores Two Years Later versus 1990Sophomores Two Years Later 3. 1979/80-82 Continuous High School Careers of 1980Sophomores versus 1989/90-1992Continuous High School Careers of 1990Sophomores: Transcript Comparison 4. 1972/1992: 1972Seniors' 5. 1972/1992 Institution-level comparisons. Comparisons are not limited to cohorts of individuals; not just the student samples, but also the baseline school samples of NELS:88, HS&B, and NLS-72 are nationally representative, and considerable data have been collected about school-level characteristics. However, the only natural comparison points are of NLS-72 (1972) and HS&B (1980) high schools, since the NELS88 base year school sample was limited to eighth grades.'   * 19731974197619861986197919921986NELS:88 1988* 199219981992(1986, 1992  Based on the population of students in eleventh grade and/or age seventeen in 1985-86."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "Individual-level comparisons. In Table 3, natural comparison points are highlighted. However, with technical adjustments, comparability can oftentimes be achieved even when age/grade/stage parallelism has not been strictly maintained.' In addition, survey rounds that coincide with a graderepresentative sample are noted by an asterisk. Thus, HS&B (sophomore cohort) in 1980 and NELS:88 in 1990 are nationally-representative samples of sophomores; NLS-72 in 1972, HS&B (senior cohort) in 1980, and NELS:88 in 1992 comprise nationally representative samples of seniors. The NELS:88 sample was freshened to make it representative of the nation's sophomores (1990) and seniors (1992). Sample freshening was not conducted in HS&B and the sophomore cohort does not constitute a valid probability sample of the nation's 1982 seniors. Nevertheless, 1982 HS&B sophomore cohort and 1992 NELS:88 can be compared, for both examine a nationally representative sample of sophomores two years later consisting of students (most, but not all of them, seniors), early graduates, and dropouts.' HS&B 1982 seniors can also be compared to 1972 NLS-72 and 1992 NELS88 seniors, though not without some sample and statistical adjustments.\" There are two major kinds of differences between NLS-72, HS&B and NELS:88 that must be taken into account. One difference pertains to the sample and research designs; another pertains to differences in questionnaire or cognitive test content that may affect the possibility of drawing valid comparisons. Data users who are familiar with NLS-72 and HS&B will find that despite the considerable similarity between these studies and NELS:88, there are also significant sample definition and statistical design differences. Analysts intending to compare these cohorts should note these differences. Similarly, while some effort has been made to maintain trend items over time, strict test and questionnaire overlap across the three studies is not considerable. Differences In sample design. The overall sample design for NELS:88 is essentially similar to the design employed in HS&B and NLS-72. In the base year, students were selected through a two stage stratified probability sample, with schools as the first units and students within schools as the second stage units. In NLS-72, all baseline sample members were spring term 1972 high school seniors. In High School and Beyond, all members of the student sample were spring term 1980 sophomores or seniors. Because NELS:88 began at eighth grade, its follow-ups encompass (like the HS&B sophomore cohort two years later [1982]) students (both in the modal grade progression sequence, and out of sequence) and dropouts. HS&B was designed to provide two separate cohortsa representative sample of 1980 sophomores and a representative sample of 1980 seniors. NELS:88 is designed to provide a See, for example, the account by T.L. Hilton and J.M. Pollack on estimating postsecondary enrollment change over time using NLS-72 fourth follow-up (conducted over 7 years after graduation) and HS&B third follow-up (conducted just less than six years after high school graduation) data, in Hilton (ed.) 1992. There are a number of special definitional issues in comparing NELS:88 and HS&B dropouts. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see the companion volume to this monograph, Conducting Trend Analyses: HS &8 and NELS:88 Dropouts, (Ingels and Dowd, National Center for Education Statistics, 1994). Specifically, out-of-sequence students (non-seniors) and non-students (such as dropouts and early graduates) must be removed from the HS&B analysis sample, and an adjustment made for the exclusion of students who were seniors in 1982 but were not part of the HS&B base year sampling frame, that is, 1982 seniors who were not 1980 sophomores in the U.S. A simplifying assumption here would be that in results and characteristics, these out-of-sequence 1982 seniors are essentially similar to the HS&B 1980 sophomores who failed to progress in the modal grade sequence. representative sample of 1988 eighth graders, a further representative sample of 1990 sophomores, and finally a representative sample of 1992 seniors. In the High School and Beyond first follow-up, students were not added to the original sample (that is, the 1980 sophomore cohort sample was not freshened in 1982 with seniors who had not been sophomores two years before and who therefore had no chance of selection into the HS&B baseline). However, in NELS88, owing to the desire to provide sample representativeness at three distinct points in time, new students can enter the study at tenth grade through two routes: sample freshening (addition of 1990 tenth graders who were not 1988 eighth graders or who were not in the United States in 1988) and change of eligibility status.\" Thus, while the base year designs of the three studies were essentially similar, because an eighthgrade baseline was chosen for NELS:88 and a high school baseline for NLS-72 and HS&B, two further differences arise when one compares the NELS:88 follow-up rounds with the other studies: 1) the more variable, typically smaller and unrepresentative within-school samples in NELS:88 first and second follow-up as contrasted to the more uniform, larger, and representative within-school student samples of HS&B' and NLS-72 (see Table 4). 2) the fact that, unlike HS&B in 1980, NLS-72 in 1972, or NELS:88 in 1988, NELS:88 1990 and 1992 high schools do not constitute a probability sample of schools; In addition, despite the fundamental similarity of the base year designs, there were some differences in school and subgroup sampling and oversampling strategies across NLS-72, HS&B and NELS:88.\" Such differences are documented in detail in the various sampling, technical, and comparative analysis reports (listed in the reference section of this document) associated with each study. Such differences have implications for intercohort analysis. For example, the NELS:88 sample of high schools lacks national generalizability; school-level contrasts should therefore not be drawn between 1972 and 1980 high schools in NLS-72 and HS&B, on the one hand, and NELS:88, on the other. Likewise, subtle differences in stratification schemes limit comparisons that can be made. NELS:88 contains an Asian oversample, but HS&B and NLS-72 do not. NELS:88 contains a substantial oversample of non-Catholic private schools, a school type much more thinly represented in the other two studies. There are special considerations in comparing the NELS:88 and HS&B dropout and early graduate populations. In the NELS:88 second follow-up, dropouts who had obtained alternative credentials such as a GED were administered the student rather than the dropout questionnaire, along with"}, {"section_title": "IS 17", "text": "For further information on sample freshening, see chapter 3 of the NELS:88 first follow-up or second follow-up student component user's manuals. The HS&B 1980 sophomore and senior samples are fully in-school representative, but the HS&B sophomore 1982 (first follow-up) sample is not, because transfers into the school had no chance of selection into the sample. An important additional difference, that may carry some consequences for comparability but will little affect analytic strategies, involves student sample replacement strategies. NLS-72, unlike HS &B and NELS:88, permitted replacement of noncooperating students under certain circumstances. While HS&B and NELS:88 made no attempt to replace students who refused to be part of the survey, HS&B did permit, but NELS:88 did not, replacement of selected students who subsequently died, were discovered to have been listed in error, or who dropped out of school after selection but prior to the survey session. HS&B and NELS:88 also conducted a sample update to accommodate transfers into the baseline schools between the sample selection and data collection phases of the studies. were retained, of whom 25,150 were enrolled in 992 HS&B schools; 96 percent of these 25,150 students participated in the HS&B first follow-up. (The remaining 4,587 sample members were surveyed as dropouts, transfers out, or early graduates.) There was also some attrition, owing to mergers and closings, in the school sample (975 base year schools remained in the school sample; additionally, 17 schools that had received pools of base year sample members were included in data collection activities). The 1982 cluster size reported for HS&B in the table above includes seniors and non-seniors because the sophomore cohort in 1982 did not constitute a nationally representative senior sample. NELS:88 second follow-up (1992) statistics are based on sample members who were in the twelfth grade in the spring term of the 1991-92 school year in the contextual sample of schools. There were 15,643 seniors in 1,374 such schools, as well as an additional 378 non-seniors. NELS:88 base year statistics reflect 1,052, participating schools, an eighth grade sample of 26,432, of whom 24,599 participated. The NELS:88 senior sample in the table above is spring-based and therefore excludes early graduates, who should not be included in senior year trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B (though of course the HS&B and NELS:88 early graduate cohorts can themselves be compared)."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "the early graduate supplementthough classified as completers and appearing on the student data set in NELS:88,GED completers were not part of the student sampling frame for HS&B in 1980 or NLS-72, and therefore must be excluded from trend comparisons of seniors. (In HS&B's first follow-up [1982] such sophomore cohort alternative completers were administered the dropout questionnaire.) Questionnaire assignment in the two studies is summarized in Table 5. Use of appropriate subgroup membership flags permits the analyst to define dropouts in the same way in both HS&B and NELS88; however, for respondents such as GED holders, some items that otherwise would be available cannot be compared because the dropout questionnaire was not administered to this group in NELS:88. On the other hand, NELS:88 GED recipients should be excluded from comparison with HS&B early graduates. It is also possible to manipulate HS&B data so that a non-HS&B dropout definition is used, in which individuals in non-diploma alternative arrangements are not regarded as dropouts. (For details, see Ingels and Dowd, 1994). Overall differences in cluster size are summarized in Table 4. For NLS-72, the target sample size was 18 students per school; for the HS&B base year, the target was 36 students per school; and for NELS:88, the target sample size was 24 eighth graders (or 26.2, counting the Asian-Hispanic oversample). Numbers selected and participating for the baseline and senior surveys of the three studies are summarized in Table 4. NIS-72, HS&B, NELS:88 Content Overlap. Content (and format) overlap across the three studies should be viewed in terms of questionnaire, cognitive test, and transcripts data. Questionnaire Overlap. A crosswalk for NELS:88 intracohort and NLS-72, HS&B, NELS:88 intercohort comparisons is provided as an appendix (Appendix A) to this monograph. There are many topics that are covered in one study but not the others, or that are covered by questions that are substantially (or subtly) different. Nonetheless, a core of items is comparable across all three, and a larger number of items comparable across HS&B and NELS:88. Some items are repeated in identical form across the studies. Others appear to be essentially similar despite small differences in wording or response categories; analysts must exercise their own cautious judgments about such cases. For a number of items with like question wording, dissimilar response categories were employed. In many such cases, comparability can be achieved by recoding the response categories so that they are compatible. The crosswalk identifies items that are plausibly similar across studies (or waves or components). Again, researchers must exercise their own cautious judgment before choosing comparison items. While most items listed in the crosswalk are transparently comparable (for example, the ten life values items in NLS-72 were repeated almost without change\" in stein or response categories in HS&B in 1980 and NELS88 in 1992), other items are more problematic for comparisons. It may be useful to illustrate this issue by providing a few examples of potentially problematic comparisons."}, {"section_title": "IS", "text": "For detailed discussions of item comparability issues for the 1980 and 1990 sophomore data, see Rasinski, Ingels, Rock, and Pollack, 1993;and Ingels, Scott, Undmark, Frankel, and Myers, 1992, Appendix D. "}, {"section_title": "2C", "text": "The homework questions in NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 provide one example of problematic comparability. NLS-72 asked 'Approximately what is the average amount of time you spend on homework a week?\" and provided response categories of 'No homework is ever assigned, I have homework but don't do it, less than 5 hours a week, between 5 and 10 hours a week, more than 10 hours a week.\" In HS&B the question stem was retained, and while additional response categories were provided, they can be mapped into the broader categories of the NLS-72. In the NELS:88 first and second follow-ups, homework was inquired about using a two-column response format that distinguished in-school and out-of-school, and cut points were used for the response options that do not readily map into the NLS-72 and HS&B scheme. It is possible to devise various schemes for trying to compare the NELS88 homework results with the earlier studies. Nevertheless, there is no objective criterion against which to evaluate the success of any such attempted mapping. Future occupational expectations provide a second example of problematic comparability. There are items that ask about future occupational expectations in all three studies. Unlike the HS&B and NELS:88 items, the NLS-72 item is not keyed to a specific age and uses \"like\" instead of \"plan or expect\". Can the NLS-72 item be compared to NELS88 nonetheless? Again, researchers must make their own judgments about comparability, and these judgments may depend in part on specific analytic objectives. For example, the NLS-72 questions would seem to license loftier or more wishful ambitions (the NLS-72 wording is \"circle the one number that goes with the best description of the kind of work you would like to do\"; the NELS88 wording is \"which of the categories below comes closest to describing the job or occupation that you expect or plan to have...when you are 30 years old\"). In comparing NLS-72 and NELS88 seniors, one finds that females have higher future occupational expectations in 1992 than in 1972. Since the wording of the NLS-72 item might be thought to minimize the large observed difference between women in the two cohorts, one might feel additional confidence that the trend toward higher female occupational expectations was real. Nonetheless, it remains possible to entertain at least some skepticism that these items are fully comparable, given that one instances aspirations and the other expectations, and that one is indefinite as to point in time and the other refers to age 30. Many more examples could be cited, but the larger point would remain the samedata users should assess carefully the comparison items listed in the crosswalk to ensure that they meet their analytic requirements. Cognitive Test Comparability. IRT methods have been used to put mathematics, vocabulary, and reading scores on the same scale for 1972, 1980, and 1982 seniors.\" Additionally, there are common items in the HS&B and NELS:88 mathematics tests that provide a basis for equating 1980-1990 and 1982-1992 mathematics results. In general, however, the tests used in the three studies differ in many ways. Though group differences by standard deviation units may profitably be examined, caution should be exercised in drawing time lag comparisons for cognitive test data. One particular caveat that should be entered concerns the NELS :88 mathematics and reading tests. NELS:88 used multiple, adaptive forms of these two tests, so that a broader range of ability could be measured. Due to such differences in methodology and item pool characteristics, subgroup differences (for example) that are detected by the NELS:88 math and reading tests may have a somewhat different meaning than differences registered in the earlier tests, and interpretation should be qualified accordingly. The HS&B sophomore cohort and NELS:88 provide a strong basis for explaining changes in high school achievement over time. Both studies measure how much was learned over the last two years of \" See Rock, Hilton, Pollack, Ekstrom and Goertz, 1985, for details. high school, and provide a wealth of individual-level explanatory variables. However, in comparing HS&B and NELS-88 test results, differences between the two cohorts may not always be typical of longer term trends. Hence, one might consider using the NAEP trend line (the NAEP trend sample is based on multiple age cohorts, and provides data from as early as 1969) to locate the HS&B and NELS .88 cohorts. (For further information about NAEP trend data in mathematics, science and reading, see Mullis et al. 1991. Note also that for NELS88 and NAEP 1992 mathematics achievement, NELS:88 provides a NAEP-equated score). Ttanscript Comparability. The HS&B, NAEP (1987,1990) and NELS:88 high school transcript studies were designed to support comparisons. Despite the large similarities between the four transcript studies, there are some differences in design and content that must be taken into account when planning comparative analyses. (For a detailed account, see the companion monograph in this seriesIngels and Taylor, 1994). Certain generalizations may also be made about course enrollment trends based on data collected for 1969 public school graduates in the Study of Academic Growth and Prediction (Hilton, 1971;Tuma et al. 1989), and based on transcripts of 1975-82 high school graduates in the Department of Labor's NLSY (CHRR, 1993). Weights, Flags, and Unweighted (Sample) Ns for Sophomore and Senior Cohort Comparisons. Table 6 sketches the weights, flags, and sample Ns associated with sophomore and senior intercohort comparisons. Need for caution in comparing data across cohorts. Accurate trend measurement faces several challenges. Sampling error tends to be more of a problem for intercohort comparisons than for intracohort, since there is sampling error each time an independent sample is drawn. Differences in two sample means estimated from independent samples will be a function not only of the real differences in means, but also the sampling errors associated with both measurements. Hence small (but not therefore necessarily unimportant) differences may be harder to detect. In estimating trends based on results from two or more sample surveys, a number of nonsampling errors also may arise. Differences in instrument format and wording, data collection mode or methodology, are potential sources of nonsampling error. While the requirements of change measurement dictate that the same measures be repeated in the same way, there are also strong disincentives to holding measures and methodologies constant. The goals, the subject, and the technology of education measurement do not remain static. The educational policy agenda changes over time; the manner and matter of education changes as curriculum content and instructional methods are revised; improvements arisein survey methodologies, data capture technologies, and in measurement techniquesthat promise large benefits if implemented. Finally, the instrument design process for NLS-72, HS&B and NELS:88, in which development of instruments has proceeded through broad consensus of the user community at different points in time, militates against a strongly conservative approach to content, format, and methodology, nor is there any correct or simple way to resolve all tensions between improved measurement and comparable measurement. Hence, though the studies were designed to be as comparable as possible, caution must nonetheless be exercised in comparing NLS-72, HS&B and NELS:88 data. Student response rates differed and the characteristics of the nonrespondents may also differ across the studies. While nonresponse adjustments in the weights serve to compensate for nonresponse, no adjustment procedure can do so perfectly. Item response rates for questions that appear in both surveys differ as well, nor, in This N represents sophomore cohort cases (participants) delivered in the first follow-up. In the second follow-up, 1990 sophomores who were ineligible in the base year but deemed eligible for the first follow-up were added, for a new total of 17,754 1990-participating sophomore cohort members. general, have missing data been imputed. Differences in context and question order for trend items in the various student questionnaires; differences in test format, content, and context; and other factors such as differences in data collection methodology, may also influence the accuracy of intercohort comparisons."}, {"section_title": "SENIORS", "text": "More specifically, there were differences in mode and time of survey administration across the four cohorts. For example, NELS:88 seniors were generally surveyed earlier in the school year than were NLS-72 seniors (many NELS:88 seniors were surveyed in January and February of 1992, though survey work continued into May); NLS-72 baseline seniors were surveyed quite late in the school year. 21 NLS-72 survey forms were administered by school personnel; HS&B and NELS:88 survey forms were administered primarily by contractor (NORC) staff. In NLS-72, seniors marked answers on an answer sheet (separate from the test booklet) while in 1980 and 1982 (HS&B) and NELS:88, answers were marked in the test booklet. The HS&B format of inclusion of answers as an integral part of the test booklet is thought to have given a modest advantage to HS&B test takers (see , for further details). Other differences between the NLS-72 and the HS&B/NELS:88 tests include improved mapping in the latter tests and the procedure of blackening an oval versus blackening a box (Hilton, 1992, cites a study by Ear les, Guiliano, Ree & Valentine, that indicates such format differences are significant for speeded tests, accounting for about one half a standard deviation in difference of result)? There are differences in questionnaire construction across the three studies. NLS-72 and NELS:88 senior questionnaires used skip patterns more extensively than did the HS&B senior instrument; the NELS:88 and HS&B questionnaires were longer than the NLS-72 questionnaire. NLS-72 and HS&B senior cohort sample members were subjected to their first measurement as seniors; HS&B sophomores were administered their second measurement as seniors, and NELS:88 eighth graders their third. We do not believe that problems associated with repeated measurements (such as remembering past responses to individual items) are likely to be a difficulty, both because of the sheer number of test and questionnaire items asked, and the two year intervals between data collections. However, participation in a longitudinal study in theory may influence the survey member's subsequent behavior or attitudes. Since most NELS:88 1992 sample members had also been surveyed as eighth and 21   22Indeed, while in the spring 1972 baseline 16,683 seniors in 1,061 schools completed an NLS-72 student questionnaire, 257 schools that could not (because, for example, their school year ended earlier in the spring) take part in the base year were added, in accordance with the original designthese seniors had now left their schools but they were asked some retrospective (senior year) questions. Such individuals who redress the school frame undercoverage bias in the NLS-72 base yeardo not appear on the NLS-72 base year files that would typically be employed for comparisons of high school seniors, although the presence of some retrospective data for these individuals permits refinement of comparisons grounded in 1972 data. The implications of context and format differences for trend comparisons have been well described in the NAEP literaturesee especially A.E. Beaton and R. Zwick, 1990, The Effect of Changes in the National Assessment: Disentangling the NAEP 1985-86 Reading Anomaly (Princeton, N.J.: ETS, NAEP Report 17-TR-21), which discusses the effects of changes in item context, assessment booklets and procedures. For some NAEP reading tests the impact of such changes was apparently larger than the trend effects that were being measured."}, {"section_title": "3C", "text": "tenth graders, such \"panel effects\"\" are in principle possible with this group (as with HS&B sophomores two years later, in 1982). In contrast, 1972 and 1980 seniors (and 1980 sophomores) were new to NLS-72 or HS&B. Any of these differences may, to some unknown extent, affect the comparability of the NELS data sets, and make the task of accurate trend measurement more difficult to accomplish."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Discussions of longitudinal conditioning or panel effects (also known as \"time in sample bias\" or \"panel conditioning\")--for example, whether strong effects potentially exist or could affect data qualitymay be found in Kasprzyk, D., Duncan, G., Kalton, G., & Singh, M.P., eds.
