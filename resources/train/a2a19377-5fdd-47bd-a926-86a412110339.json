Many assume that research universities, especially public institutions, are the backbone of American efforts to prepare undergraduate students in STEM fields and that these institutions are fulfilling this responsibility. This report demonstrates that many small and mid-sized independent colleges are preparing postsecondary students for a career and/or graduate study in STEM fields, and they are doing so in a more efficient way than larger institutions, contrary to public assumptions about the importance of scale. Report findings suggest that, as a sector, small and mid-sized private institutions perform better than public institutions in students' persistence and undergraduate degree completion rates in STEM fields and they substantially outperform public nondoctoral institutions. Small and mid-sized private colleges also perform better on the time-todegree metric, as an overwhelming proportion (80 percent) of bachelor's degree recipients in STEM fields earned their degrees in four years or less at these institutions, compared with 34 percent at public four-year nondoctoral institutions and 52 percent at public four-year doctoral institutions. Study results also suggest that STEM graduates of small and mid-sized private colleges are more likely to plan to attend graduate school and just as likely to enroll immediately in a graduate program as their peers who graduated from larger public universities. The productivity and efficiency of small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities are further demonstrated by comparisons between specific private colleges and larger research universities. Report findings indicate that in many individual academic disciplines, small and mid-sized colleges produce as many or more science majors who obtain PhDs than large research universities. For example, the number of students graduating from Allegheny College (Meadville, PA; 1,849 undergraduate enrollment) who later received doctorates in chemistry between 2006 and 2010 was 25, an output comparable to that of two nearby research universities. During the same period, 30 graduates of the University of Pittsburgh (17,413 undergraduate enrollment) and 25 graduates of Carnegie Mellon University (5,484 undergraduate enrollment) obtained doctorates in chemistry. Moreover, a higher percentage of students who attained a baccalaureate degree in chemistry from Allegheny College between 2001 and 2005 subsequently completed a PhD in the discipline (36 percent) than did graduates from the University of Pittsburgh (13 percent) or Carnegie Mellon University (24 percent). Report findings suggest similar results in the biological sciences. For example, one out of every four graduates in biological sciences from Swarthmore College (Swarthmore, PA; 1,500 undergraduate enrollment), Haverford College (Haverford, PA; 1,163 undergraduate enrollment), Grinnell College (Grinnell, IA; 1,524 undergraduate enrollment), and Oberlin College (Oberlin, OH; 2,907 undergraduate enrollment) went on to complete a PhD, a rate higher than that of the large public research universities in their respective states: Pennsylvania State University (16 percent; 35,002 undergraduate enrollment), the University of Iowa (13 percent; 20,233 undergraduate enrollment), Iowa State"}, {"section_title": "Strengthening the STEM Pipeline: The Contributions of Small and Mid-Sized Independent Colleges", "text": "University (10 percent; 22,230 undergraduate enrollment), and Ohio State University (8 percent; 37,605 undergraduate enrollment). Additional results in computer science, physics, and mathematics and statistics confirm that a number of smaller private colleges produce a higher percentage of science majors who pursue PhDs in STEM fields than many large research universities produce. At a time when federal and state officials have made a priority of increasing the number of Americans with advanced degrees in STEM fields and when state and federal spending is under increasing pressure, the educational effectiveness and contributions of small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities in meeting these national goals must not be overlooked. Indeed, the most cost-effective strategy for increasing the supply of STEM workers for the U.S. economy is to reduce college student attrition in STEM fields. In order to reap the full benefits of a strong STEM workforce through higher education, policy makers should assist the sector of education in which colleges and universities have demonstrated that they can prepare many people for STEM careers effectively and efficientlynamely, small and mid-sized private colleges. intRoduCtion Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) expertise is necessary to sustain American competitiveness in the global economy. Technological innovation has been and will continue to be a primary driver of U.S. economic growth. Employment in STEM occupations is projected to expand faster than employment in non-STEM occupations (Lockard & Wolf 2012). In addition, employees in STEM occupations typically have higher average salaries and lower unemployment rates, a pattern that has persisted even during the recent economic recession (U.S. Department of Commerce 2011). However, despite the clear demand for STEM skills by employers, the U.S. is not producing enough people with expertise in STEM fields (Chen 2013). Too many students lack the interest or the ability to work in STEM fields or jobs that require either a bachelor's or an advanced degree in a STEM field. Strengthening the STEM education pipeline has been raised to the center of the policy stage in the last decade, especially since the publication of Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future (National Academy of Sciences et al. 2007). This report recommended increasing investment in STEM programs, enhancing the STEM teaching force, and enlarging the pool of students pursuing degrees and careers in STEM fields. Other government agencies and organizations also examined this issue and made similar policy recommendations (Government Accountability Office 2006; U.S. Department of Education 2006; National Science Board 2007; Business-Higher Education Forum 2010; U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee 2012; and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology 2012). In addition, the National Academy of Sciences' report argued for very large federal investments in universities to support the increase in production of STEM degree holders. The role of colleges and universities in preparing scientists and engineers has been highlighted in debates about the nation's need for a large STEM workforce. Many assume that research universities are the backbone of preparing postsecondary students in STEM fields and that they are effectively fulfilling this task. Much less well-known are the substantial contributions of small and mid-sized colleges in STEM education. This report demonstrates that many small and mid-sized independent colleges are preparing postsecondary students for careers and graduate study in STEM fields more efficiently than larger public universities. By examining national postsecondary data collected by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation, this report addresses the following four questions: How do small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities compare with other types of institutions in terms of students' persistence to an undergraduate STEM degree after entrance into a STEM field of study? Many small and mid-sized independent colleges are preparing postsecondary students for careers and graduate study in STEM fields more efficiently than public universities. How do bachelor's degree recipients from small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities compare with graduates from other types of institutions in their time-to-degree in the STEM fields? Upon receipt of a bachelor's degree in a STEM field, what are the plans of graduates of small and mid-sized institutions for future studies? How do small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities fare in preparing undergraduates who later earn doctoral degrees in STEM fields? This report compares private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions (small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities) with three other types of four-year institutions: public nondoctoral, public doctoral, and private doctoral institutions."}, {"section_title": "Persistence to a STEM degree", "text": "The Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) follows cohorts of students who enroll in postsecondary education for the first time (Wine, Janson, Siegel, and Bennett 2013). The study collects data on student persistence in and completion of postsecondary education programs, their transition to employment, demographic characteristics, and other indicators. Members of the most recent cohort of BPS, with a sample size of nearly 16,700 students, were initially surveyed at the end of their first academic year (2003)(2004) and then in follow-up surveys at the end of their third (2005)(2006) and sixth (2008)(2009) years after entry into postsecondary education. Therefore, BPS is a good data source to study the postsecondary education experiences of students, including their persistence patterns. To analyze the persistence patterns of students in STEM fields, we examined all first-time students who enrolled in four-year institutions in 2003-2004 and entered into a STEM field within three years after initial enrollment (that is, students who declared a major in a STEM field in or before academic year [2005][2006]. To understand better the effects of different types of institutions on the persistence patterns of students, we further limited our population to those who never transferred out of their first postsecondary institutions of study (about three-fourths of the students who enrolled in four-year institutions). Table 1 summarizes the spring 2009 status of the students who had entered into STEM fields by summer 2006. As presented in Table 1, public nondoctoral institutions had the lowest persistence rate in STEM fields, 41 percent. In contrast, 62 percent of students who entered STEM fields at private nondoctoral institutions persisted in those fields after three or more years, a result comparable to rates at public and private doctoral institutions. Moreover, the percentage of students who obtained bachelor's degrees in STEM fields at private nondoctoral institutions was higher than that of public doctoral institutions (59 and 56 percent respectively). These statistics indicate that small and midsized private institutions performed better than public institutions in students' persistence and degree completion rates in STEM fields and they substantially outperformed public nondoctoral institutions. "}, {"section_title": "Time-to-Bachelor's Degree in STEM Fields", "text": "To answer the second research question, we used data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) conducted by NCES (Wine, Janson, and Wheeless 2011). The B&B study examines students' education and work experiences after completion of a bachelor's degree, including workforce participation, income and debt repayment, and entry into and persistence through graduate school programs, among other indicators. The most recent B&B cohort was drawn from bachelor's degree recipients in academic year 2007-2008 and has a sample size of approximately 19,000 students. To analyze the time-to-degree (that is, time from initial enrollment to degree completion) for bachelor's degree recipients in STEM fields, we reviewed bachelor's degree recipients in all STEM fields, including computer and information sciences, engineering and engineering technology, biology, physical science, mathematics, chemistry, and agriculture. To focus on the effects of different types of institutions on graduates' time-todegree, we limited our population to those who did not transfer out of their first postsecondary institutions. Table 2 displays the time-to-degree for 2007-2008 bachelor's degree recipients in the STEM fields. The findings here are stark. Small and mid-sized independent institutions produce bachelor-level graduates in the STEM fields more efficiently than their public peers. As illustrated by Figure 1, at small and mid-sized independent institutions, an overwhelming proportion (80 percent) of bachelor's degree recipients in STEM fields earned their degrees in four years or less, compared with 34 percent at public four-year nondoctoral institutions and 52 percent at public four-year doctoral institutions. "}, {"section_title": "STEM Bachelor's Degree Recipients' Plans for Graduate Study", "text": "A policy goal of STEM education is to produce more graduates with advanced degrees in STEM fields. The B&B survey asked graduating college seniors about their plans for graduate study. Table 3 summarizes the plans for graduate study by the 2007-2008 bachelor's degree recipients in STEM fields. As Table 3 indicates, a much larger proportion (57 percent) of graduates in STEM fields from small and midsized independent institutions planned to apply to graduate school upon receipt of their bachelor's degrees, compared with slightly more than 40 percent of graduates from public four-year institutions, where a considerable proportion of graduates (over 40 percent) were undecided about their plans for graduate study. This suggests that bachelor's degree recipients from small and mid-sized independent institutions are more committed to advancing their education in the STEM fields at the time of their graduation from college. The 2009 follow-up to the B&B study collected information on the respondents' enrollment status in 2009. Table 4 summarizes this information by the respondents' bachelor's degree institution sector. The statistics show that about one-fifth (19 percent) of the bachelor's degree recipients in STEM fields from small and mid-sized independent institutions immediately enrolled in master's or doctoral degree programs after obtaining their bachelor's degrees, a comparable percentage with public four-year doctoral institutions (22 percent) and exceeding that of public fouryear nondoctoral institutions (14 percent). "}, {"section_title": "Comparisons by Sector", "text": "To answer the final research question, we examined data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), an annual census of doctorate recipients from accredited colleges and universities in the U.S. (NSF 2014). According to SED, more than 130,000 doctoral degrees were awarded by U.S. academic institutions in STEM fields between 2006 and 2010 (the most recent five years for which data were available at the time of analysis). 3 Table 5 presents the distribution of institutions by type from which the 2006-2010 doctorate recipients in the STEM fields obtained their baccalaureate degrees. The most noticeable category of the baccalaureate institutions of the STEM doctorate degree recipients is foreign institutions-40 percent of the 2006-2010 doctoral degree recipients in the U.S. obtained their bachelor's degrees from foreign institutions. This percentage is especially high in engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences, where about half of the doctoral recipients obtained their bachelor's degrees outside the U.S. This suggests that the United States still has a long way to go to produce more \"home grown\" scientists. A further look at 2006-2010 doctoral degree recipients in STEM fields who earned their bachelor's degrees from U.S. four-year institutions (excluding unknown, unclassified, or special-focus institutions; see Table 6) found that 20 percent of them earned their bachelor's degrees from small and mid-sized independent institutions, compared with 21 percent from private doctoral, 12 percent from public nondoctoral, and 48 percent from public doctoral institutions. As a reference, small and mid-sized independent colleges awarded only 17 percent of the total number of bachelor's degrees in STEM fields produced by all four-year institutions in the U.S. between 2001 and 2005, while private doctoral institutions accounted for 13 percent of the total bachelor's degrees in STEM fields, public nondoctoral institutions accounted for 20 percent, and public doctoral institutions accounted for 49 percent (see Figure 2). 4 This comparison suggests that STEM graduates of small and mid-sized colleges are more likely to complete doctoral degrees in STEM fields than are graduates of public four-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Efficiency by Institution and Discipline", "text": "The productivity and efficiency of small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities can be further demonstrated by comparing specific institutions with select larger research universities. 7 When individual academic disciplines are examined, even some of the largest research universities do not produce more science majors who attain PhDs than do smaller colleges. Moreover, a number of smaller colleges produce a higher percentage of science majors who attain PhDs than many large research universities produce. 8 Below are a few examples: 9 Chemistry: The number of students graduating from Allegheny College (Meadville, PA; 1,849 undergraduate enrollment) 10 who later received doctorates in chemistry between 2006 and 2010 was 25, an output comparable to that of two nearby research universities (see Table 7 on the next page; small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities are bolded in Tables 7-16). 11 Slightly more graduates (30) of the University of Pittsburgh (17,413 undergraduate enrollment) and a similar number of graduates (25) from Carnegie Mellon University (5,484 undergraduate enrollment) obtained doctorates in chemistry during that time. In addition, Furman University (Greenville, SC; 2,814 undergraduate enrollment) produced more future PhDs in chemistry (21) than nearby private research institution Clemson University (15 students; 13,813 undergraduate enrollment), while Butler University (Indianapolis, IN; 3,657 undergraduate enrollment) produced the same number of graduates in chemistry who would eventually complete PhDs in the field (17) as its neighboring state flagship institution, Indiana University (30,319 undergraduate enrollment).  Not only did these smaller private colleges produce more future chemists than local research institutions, they did so more efficiently. Table 8 indicates that a higher percentage of students who attained a baccalaureate degree in chemistry from Allegheny College between 2001 and 2005 subsequently completed a PhD in the discipline (36 percent) than did graduates from the University of Pittsburgh (13 percent) or Carnegie Mellon University (24 percent). Furthermore, Furman University out-produced Clemson University (18 percent vs. 12 percent) and Butler University out-produced Indiana University (12 percent vs. 10 percent) on this measure during that same period. Biological Sciences: The number of students graduating from Oberlin College (Oberlin, OH; 2,907 undergraduate enrollment) who later received doctorates in biological sciences between 2006 and 2010 was 66 (see Table 9, above), exceeding the total of nearby private research university Case Western Reserve University (65 students; 3,587 undergraduate enrollment) and many nationally-recognized research universities that enrolled far more The superior efficiency of small and mid-sized independent colleges in preparing students for doctoral work in biological sciences is demonstrated by Computer Science: A number of smaller private colleges produced as many graduates who later completed PhD degrees in computer science as much larger research universities did (see Table 11). For the period 2006-2010, Swarthmore College (Swarthmore, PA; 1,500 undergraduate enrollment) produced the same number of graduates who later received doctorates in computer science (eight) as the University of Houston (27 Many small and mid-sized independent colleges proved to be more efficient in producing future computer scientists than public research universities. For example, although it enrolled fewer than one-tenth of the undergraduate student body as its nearby public research university (3,484 vs. 35,002), computer science majors who graduated from Bucknell University were twice as likely to complete a doctoral degree as their peers who completed their undergraduate studies in computer science at Pennsylvania State University (6 percent vs. 3 percent, see Table 12). Likewise, graduates in computer science from DePauw University were twice as likely (4 percent vs. 2 percent) to complete a PhD degree than graduates of the in-state flagship university, Indiana University, even though it enrolled more than 12 times as many undergraduate students as the small private liberal arts college (30,319 vs. 2,365). Hope College (Holland, MI; 3,068 undergraduate enrollment) produced fewer eventual PhDs in computer science than the in-state flagship, the University of Michigan (24,517 undergraduate enrollment), yet its computer science graduates were more than twice as likely to complete their doctoral education in this discipline (9 percent vs. 4 percent). Mathematics and Statistics: Although it enrolls fewer than 5 percent of the total undergraduate enrollment of instate flagship Pennsylvania State University (35,002 undergraduate enrollment), Swarthmore College (Swarthmore, PA; 1,500 undergraduate enrollment) produced the same number of baccalaureate graduates in mathematics and statistics who completed a PhD between 2006 and 2010 (14; see Table 15). Even more impressive, Swarthmore baccalaureate graduates in mathematics and statistics were more than six times as likely to complete their doctoral degrees (26 percent vs. 4 percent; see Table 16). Similarly, the number of students graduating from St. Olaf College (Northfield, MN; 2,994 undergraduate enrollment) who later received doctorates in mathematics and statistics between 2006 and 2010 was 12, exceeding the in-state public flagship University of Minnesota (11 students; 32,474 undergraduate enrollment).

This report shows that small and mid-sized independent institutions have higher student persistence and degree completion rates in STEM fields and shorter time to the bachelor's degree. In addition, bachelor's degree recipients from small and mid-sized independent institutions in the STEM fields are more committed to advancing their education at the time of graduation, and many of them immediately enroll in graduate-level degree programs after obtaining their bachelor's degrees. Finally, graduates of small and mid-sized colleges are more likely to pursue doctoral degrees in STEM fields than graduates of public four-year institutions; in many individual academic disciplines, small and mid-sized colleges produce as many or more science majors who obtain PhDs than large research universities. Moreover, smaller private colleges are more efficient producers of graduates who go on to earn STEM doctorates than are public universities. It is easy to understand the structural reasons why smaller institutions succeed in this arena. Overall, attrition at large state universities is much higher than at small colleges, and the gap between large universities and small colleges in attrition rates is even larger in science courses than it is in other fields. Students at small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities are usually more engaged in effective educational practices and reported making greater strides in their learning and development (CIC 2011). This may be attributed to the faculty's emphasis on teaching, smaller class sizes, mission-centered curricula, and the fostering of active forms of pedagogy that keep students connected to the process of learning in meaningful ways. In the sciences, these institutional hallmarks translate to more personal attention from faculty members in the classroom and in the laboratory, as well as opportunities for students to preview their future lives as scientists through open-ended, independent research projects that require a combination of technical expertise, critical thinking, and communication skills (Cech 1999). STEM fields are sequential and cumulative. A student who encounters academic difficulty is at risk of abandoning a major in a STEM field without help from a faculty member in getting back on track, a distinctive role of faculty members at small and mid-sized private colleges and universities."}, {"section_title": "Policy Recommendations", "text": "At a time when federal and state officials have made a priority of increasing the number of Americans with advanced degrees in STEM fields and when state and federal spending is under increasing pressure, the educational effectiveness and cost effectiveness of small and mid-sized nonprofit independent colleges and universities in meeting national goals must not be overlooked.
