[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract MRI-based hippocampal volume analysis has been extensively employed given its potential as a biomarker for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and accurate and efficient determination of hippocampal volumes from brain images is still a challenging issue. We compared an automated method, FreeSurfer (V4), with a published manual protocol for the determination of hippocampal volumes from T1-weighted MRI scans. Our study included MRI data from 125 older adult subjects: healthy controls with no significant cognitive complaints or deficits (HC, n=38), euthymic individuals with cognitive complaints (CC, n=39) but intact neuropsychological performance, and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=37) or a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (AD, n = 11). Pearson correlations and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between results of the manual tracing and FreeSurfer methods and to estimate their agreement.\nResults indicated that these two methods derived highly correlated results with strong agreement. After controlling for the age, sex and intracranial volume in statistical group analysis, both the manual tracing and FreeSurfer methods yield similar patterns: both the MCI group and the AD group showed hippocampal volume reduction compared to both the HC group and the CC group, and the HC and CC groups did not differ.

While automated and semi-automated methods for segmentation and quantification of the size and shape of the hippocampus were available and used in certain groups (Csernansky et al. 2002; Csernansky et al. 2005; Hogan et al. 2006; Shen et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2006b) , in most studies Becker et al. 2006; Bouix et al. 2005; Gerig et al. 2001; McHugh et al. 2007; Saykin et al. 2006; Shenton et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2004; Yushkevich et al. 2007) , researchers employed manual tracing of hippocampal boundaries from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using various software tools (e.g., Analyze (Mayo Clinic 2008) , BRAINS (Iowa Mental Health Clinical Research Center 2008) , 3D Slicer (NAMIC 2008) , ITK-SNAP (Yushkevich et al. 2006) ).\nAccurate and efficient MRI segmentation of the hippocampus is still a challenging issue. Although experienced anatomic tracers can be reliable, manual segmentation is a time consuming process and may not be feasible for large-scale neuroimaging studies. For example, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Mueller et al. 2005 ) is a landmark investigation sponsored by the NIH and industrial partners designed to collect longitudinal neuroimaging, biological and clinical information from 800 participants that will track the neural correlates of memory loss from an early stage. All ADNI participants have clinical and cognitive assessments and 1.5 Tesla structural MRI every 6 or 12 months for 2-3 years. Manual segmentation is therefore not ideal given the thousands of MRI scans to be analyzed.\nA feasible strategy for hippocampal segmentation in largescale studies should minimize human interaction involved in the processing pipeline. Diffeomorphic mapping is a notable method for semi-automatic segmentation that has been used by Csernansky and colleagues in many hippocampal studies (Csernansky et al. 2002; Csernansky et al. 2005; Hogan et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Wang, et al, 2006a) . FreeSurfer Fischl et al. 2002; Fischl et al. 1999 ) (available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) is an automated software tool for whole brain segmentation and cortical parcellation. Because FreeSurfer is freely available on the web, it has been widely used in the neuroimaging field. One recent study (Tae et al. 2008 ) reported a comparison of hippocampal volumes measured using the authors' manual method and FreeSurfer V3.04 on 21 female patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 controls. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs, calculated based on Cronbach's alpha) for testing inter-rater reliability were at a level of 0.85 for both left and right hippocampi (no p values were reported). In this work, we examine data from a different and larger cohort using a newer version of FreeSurfer, and perform a similar analysis comparing hippocampal volume determined by FreeSurfer V4 and a published manual protocol (McHugh et al. 2007 )."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "In this report, we analyzed data from a well characterized cohort recruited from a study of memory circuitry in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we briefly describe this data set, the two hippocampal segmentation methods examined in the paper, and our methods for comparison."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Baseline hippocampal data were available for 125 subjects from four categories: healthy older adults with no significant cognitive complaints or deficits (HC, n=38), euthymic older adults with cognitive complaints (CC, n=39) but intact neuropsychological performance, older adults with amnestic MCI (MCI, n=37), and adults with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (AD, n=11). Demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 .\nStructural MRI volume scans were obtained on a GE Signa 1.5 T Horizon LX magnet with echo speed gradients using a standard head RF coil. A T1-weighted threedimensional spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) coronal volume was acquired. Parameters were TR=25, TE=3 or min, flip angle=40 degrees, 1 NEX, and slice thickness=1.5 mm (no skip), yielding 124 contiguous slices with a 24-cm field of view and a 256 \u00d7 256 matrix with 0.9375 mm in-plane resolution. Further details about this data set are available in (Saykin et al. 2006 ) and in (Wang et al. 2006b )."}, {"section_title": "Manual and automated segmentation", "text": "Hippocampal and intracranial boundaries were obtained using (1) a manual protocol reported in (McHugh et al. 2007 ) using the BRAINS software package (Iowa Mental Health Clinical Research Center 2008), and (2) a fully automated method using the FreeSurfer V4 package Fischl et al. 2002; Fischl et al. 1999) . In manual segmentation ( Fig. 1 ), images were reformatted into isotropic 1-mm voxels and resampled into the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus using the BRAINS software (Iowa Mental Health Clinical Research Center, 2008) . Manual traces were performed in the coronal plane with reference to markings placed in the axial and sagittal views to guide boundary determination. This protocol followed the guidelines of (Jack 1994; Watson et al. 1992) in segmenting the hippocampus with refinements in defining the posterior and anteromedial extents (Andreasen et al. 1993; Torres et al. 1997) . Key features included: (1) tracing in the plane of the long axis of the hippocampus to obtain a better view of the hippocampal tail; (2) the \"telegraphing\" function was used to transfer boundary definition obtained in the axial and sagittal views to the coronal view for guiding boundary determination; and (3) key medial temporal lobe structures were traced together to eliminate boundary overlap. Total incracranial volume (ICV) was also traced to include the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebrospinal fluid. Complete details about the manual segmentation protocol and boundaries are available in (McHugh et al. 2007) . A 3D binary image was reconstructed from each set of 2D hippocampal segmentation results. Two sample manual segmentation results are shown in the left column of Fig. 2 .\nIn automated segmentation, FreeSurfer was employed to automatically label subcortical tissue classes using an atlasbased Bayesian segmentation procedure. A subjectindependent probabilistic atlas was pre-computed from a training set of subjects whose brains were manually labeled. These labels together with intensity values were mapped into Talairach space to enable voxelwise correspondence across subjects. A probabilistic atlas was then created by computing three types of probabilities for each voxel in Talairach space to encode probabilities of class labels, functions of neighborhood patterns and profiles of intensity values. Once the atlas was available, an individual brain MRI could be segmented as follows. Preprocessing steps included an affine registration with Talairach space, intensity normalization, skull strip, and a high dimensional nonlinear volumetric alignment to the Talairach atlas. FreeSurfer calculated the probability of a class at each voxel location as the probability that the given class appeared at that location in the training set times the likelihood of getting the subject-specific intensity value from that class. An initial segmentation was generated by assigning each point to the class for which the above probability was greatest. The neighborhood function was then used to recalculate the class probabilities and re-segment the data using the new class probabilities. This procedure was repeated until the result converged. Details for the FreeSurfer method were reported in Fischl et al. 2002; Fischl et al. 1999) . The complete FreeSurfer analysis pipeline was performed without any manual intervention. The FreeSurfer V4 package (v4.0.2) was installed on Quarry (a supercomputer located at Indiana University), an IBM HS21 Bladeserver cluster running Red Hat Linux. The estimated left and right hippocampal volumes were extracted directly from the aseg.stats files. The estimated total intracranial volume (ICV) was re-calculated using the talairach.xfm (new method used in post v4.2.0) instead of the talaiarch_with_skull.lta transform (old method), which was found to be more accurate according to the ICV page on the FreeSurfer website (FreeSurfer Wiki 2009) . Further details about the FreeSurfer method for ICV estimation were available in (Buckner et al. 2004) .\nA sample FreeSurfer volume-based labeling is shown in Fig. 3 . Based on each label map, we extracted the left and right hippocampi as two 3D binary images. To visually compare the FreeSurfer and manual tracing results, we transformed both results back to the original image space. Shown in Fig. 2 are two sample manual tracing results (left) and the corresponding FreeSurfer results (right). FreeSurfer results tend to be larger and more inclusive than manual ones and contain several local excursions on the surfaces."}, {"section_title": "Methods for comparison", "text": "Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Pearson correlations and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between volume generated by FreeSurfer and the manual tracing method and to estimate their agreement. Given a variety of available ICC measures that may yield different values for the same data, we briefly describe below (1) the goal of this study and (2) how to choose an appropriate ICC for our reliability test to achieve the goal.\nLet D 1 be the data used in this study and D 2 be the data we will collect in the future. For D 1 , we have both FreeSurfer and manual tracing results available. Although our manual tracer is experienced and reliable, manual tracing is a very time consuming process and won't be applicable for our future data set D 2 that is much larger than D 1 . Therefore, our plan is to use FreeSurfer instead of manual tracing to process D 2 . The goal of this study is to perform a feasibility test for our plan and make sure that FreeSurfer can produce accurate results. Since running FreeSurfer on the same data multiple times always generates the same result, the intra-rater reliability for FreeSurfer is 1.0. Therefore, the focus of this study is to Thus, in our statistical scenario, we aim to collect all the data (i.e., D 1 \u222aD 2 ) using one rater (i.e., FreeSurfer) and currently have two raters (i.e., FreeSurfer and manual tracing) on a subset of the data (i.e., D 1 ) for purposes of estimating inter-rater reliability measured by ICC. We followed the procedure suggested in (McGraw and Wong 1996) to select an appropriate ICC for this type of reliability analysis. We employed a two-way mixed model, since the two raters (i.e., FreeSurfer and manual tracer) were a fixed effect while the target ratings (i.e., hippocampal volumes) were a random effect in our study. We tested the single measure reliability instead of the average measure reliability, because our goal was to evaluate the reliability of the ratings for a typical single rater (i.e., FreeSurfer) rather than the mean of all the ratings. We selected \"consistency\" as the model type instead of \"absolute agreement\", since we were more interested in seeing the consistency of the relative standing of the measures than absolute agreement between two raters. In short, the SPSS option for this type of ICC analysis can be summarized as the \"two-way mixed model of single measure intraclass correlation with consistency type\". The formula for computing this type of ICC is available in (McGraw and Wong 1996) and can be found in the formula entry for Case 3 model ICC(C,1) in Table 4 of (McGraw and Wong 1996) . In our experiments, we performed the above analysis within each group as well as across groups.\nIn addition to comparing the FreeSurfer results directly with the manual tracing results to estimate their agreement, we performed a group analysis (SPSS General Linear Model) separately for each method examining whether hippocampal volumes differ significantly among the HC, CC, MCI, and AD groups. Our goal was to see if the FreeSurfer and manual tracing methods would yield a similar pattern of group differences. In these analyses, we also tested effects of age, education, sex and ICV on volume measures determined by each method, and then involved age, sex and ICV as covariates in our linear models."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We analyzed both raw hippocampal volumes and \"relative hippocampal volumes to ICV\" that were calculated as the raw volumes divided by the corresponding ICVs. Fig. 4 shows the plots of the FreeSurfer measures against the Table 2 manual tracing measures. A visual inspection of Fig. 4 indicates that FreeSurfer volumes as unadjusted numbers are systematically larger than manual results. After adjusting ICV, this trend gets substantially reduced. We computed and examined Pearson correlations across groups and within each group for not only hippocampal volumes but also ICV measures, and Table 2 summarizes the results. The correlations within each group and across groups for absolute and relative hippocampal measures are all significant at the level of r \u2265 0.757 except r=0.66 for relative RHV in the AD group. The correlations for ICV are all significant at a higher level of r \u2265 0.919.\nWe also computed and examined ICCs for testing interrater reliability across groups and within each group. Table 2 ), small disturbance on either FreeSurfer or manual ICV estimate could cause a big change between the ICC for RHV and the ICC for relative RHV to ICV, given such a small sample size (n=11). A similar pattern was also observed in Pearson correlation results (Table 2) : r=0.901 for RHV and r=0.660 for relative RHV for the AD group. In addition to comparing the agreement of FreeSurfer directly with manual tracing, we performed group analysis (SPSS General Linear Model) on data sets measured by both methods to determine if a similar pattern of group differences would be obtained. We first examined the effects of age, education, sex and ICV on the left and right hippocampal volumes determined by both FreeSurfer and manual methods, using a linear regression model; and the results were summarized in Table 4 . The following patterns were obtained in both methods: the effects of age and ICV were significant (p\u22640.05) and the effects of education and sex were not significant. After that, we ran our linear models to examine the diagnostic group effect (HC, CC, MCI, and AD) on the hippocampal volume with age, sex and ICV as covariates. Age-, sex-and ICV-adjusted hippocampal volumes were plotted in Fig. 5 . Similar betweengroup differences were detected using manual tracing and FreeSurfer: (1) for manual tracing data, we had degrees-offreedom (df)=6, F=13.836, p<0.001 for left hippocampus and df=6, F=13.120, p<0.001 for right hippocampus; and (2) for FreeSurfer data, we had df=6, F=17.620, p<0.001 for left and df=6, F=15.788, p<0.001 for right.\nMore detailed results on pairwise group comparisons were reported in Table 5 . For both FreeSurfer and manual tracing methods, the following patterns were observed. The AD group showed hippocampal volume reduction compared to both the HC (left p=0.001 and right p=0.002 for manual tracing data, left and right both p<0.001 for FreeSurfer data) and CC (left p=0.004 and right p=0.011 for manual tracing data, left p<0.001 and right p<0.001 for FreeSurfer data) groups. The MCI group also showed hippocampal volume reduction compared to both the HC (left and right both p<0.001 for manual tracing data, left p=0.001 and right p=0.002 for FreeSurfer data) and CC We did observe a disagreement between FreeSurfer and manual methods for detecting the volume difference of the left hippocampus between MCI and AD: while the difference is significant for FreeSurfer (p=0.044), it is not significant for manual method (p=0.428). Table 5 summarized all the above pairwise comparison results as well as reported the corresponding effect size for each case. Since the sex effect on each hippocampal volume measure was not significant (Table 4) , we also tested another linear model without including sex as a covariate. That is, we only controlled the effects of age and ICV in the model, and the results were either identical or extremely close to those reported in Table 5 .\nWe also examined the difference between left and right hippocampal volumes within each group and across groups using paired samples t-tests. Similar left and right differences were detected using manual tracing and FreeSurfer: the left-right hippocampal volume differences were significant within each group and across groups (right>left, p\u2264 0.001).\nAs mentioned earlier, FreeSurfer volumes as unadjusted numbers are systematically larger than manual results (Fig. 4) . After adjusting for age, sex and ICV, this systematic difference remains to some extent (Fig. 5) . By visual inspection of the entire sample (see Fig. 2 for two examples), we noticed that FreeSurfer results tend to (1) be more inclusive than manual tracing results, especially in the tail region, and (2) have quite a few local excursions on the surfaces. To examine whether this is the cause of the systematic difference shown in Fig. 5 (i. e., FreeSurfer Volume>Manual Volume), detailed analysis of shape differences between these two sets of results would be a useful topic for future investigation."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We compared an automated method, FreeSurfer (V4), with a published manual protocol for the determination of hippocampal volume from MRI scans, using data from an existing MCI/AD cohort. Although the two methods might not result in the same volume estimates, our correlation and reliability analyses showed that the hippocampal volumes determined by the manual tracing method and the FreeSurfer method were not only significantly correlated to each other at levels ranging from 0.76 to 0.90 but also showed significant agreement measured by ICCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.89. To test whether the two methods could detect between group differences with similar sensitivity, we conducted additional statistical analysis to examine the hippocampal volume difference between left and right sides as well as among four groups: HC, CC, MCI and AD. Both the manual tracing method and the FreeSurfer method detected significant differences between left and right hippocampal volumes within group and across groups. Both methods also yielded the following patterns: The AD group and the MCI group showed hippocampal volume reduction compared to both the HC and CC, and the HC and CC groups did not differ. We have hypothesized that the CC group may represent a pre-MCI stage of AD and therefore eventually provide an earlier therapeutic opportunity than MCI as new disease modifying agents are assessed. In this regard it is noteworthy that both manually traced and FreeSurfer segmented hippocampal volumes, adjusted for age, gender and ICV, were significantly reduced relative to HC only in the MCI and AD groups, with the CC group showing an intermediate level between MCI and HC. Although volumetric methods did not identify differences between the HC and CC groups, the CC group showed similar but more significant patterns of decreased gray matter density relative to the HC group on whole brain and hippocampal ROI analyses, and further details are available in Saykin et al (2006) . In summary, the two methods could yield different volume estimates but produce similar capacity for group discrimination, suggesting that the FreeSurfer method may be useful for automated determination of hippocampal volumes for group testing in large-scale MCI/AD-related MRI studies. Reproducibility is also very important in that another use in clinical trials could be as a biomarker for detecting the effects of putative disease modifying treatments.\nAlthough the convergent validity of hippocampal volume determined by FreeSurfer has been tested in this work and other similar studies (e.g., (Tae et al. 2008 )), future research should examine alternative situations, such as data from different scanners, of different resolutions, contrast profiles, or with different signal to noise ratios. Another potentially important research direction is to assess if FreeSurfer can also generate more complex morphometric measurements beyond volume (e.g., orientation or shape features) (Shen et al., 2009) or if additional post-processing steps need to be developed in order to achieve such a goal.\nOverall, FreeSurfer represents an advance in robust automated volume determination that agrees reasonably well with a manual tracing method for examining the hippocampus. With additional software enhancements, ever improving scan quality, and additional validation, this and related automated methods are poised to make significant contributions to medical image analysis which in turn can provide robust biomarkers for research and clinical applications."}]
