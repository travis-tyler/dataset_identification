Recent studies suggest a 20-to 30-year interval between the first development of amyloid positivity and the onset of dementia [2, 3] . The clinical spectrum of AD includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia (ADD) [3] . SCD in individuals with unimpaired performance on cognitive tests is considered to represent the first symptomatic manifestation of AD [4] . Meta-analysis suggests that older people with SCD are twice as likely to develop dementia as individuals without SCD, and each year approximately 2.3% and 6.6% of elderly individuals with SCD may progress to dementia and MCI [5] . Due to AD, amnestic MCI with gradual and progressive episodic memory impairment is likely to be prodromal AD or MCI [6, 7] .\nDespite extensive research in the AD field, no treatment has yet been developed to modify AD progression. Therefore, it is important to manage modifiable risk factors in the prevention of dementia [8] . Further research is also needed to find new risk, protective, and prognostic factors for AD.\nOver the past decade, remarkable advances in biomarker identification have been made, including neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and others. Now, these biomarkers provide the ability to detect evidence of the AD pathophysiological process in vivo. The biomarkers associated with A\u03b2 plaques include cortical amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) ligand binding [9] [10] [11] or low CSF A\u03b242 [12] . The biomarkers that are indicative of fibrillar tau are elevated CSF tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau) and cortical tau PET ligand binding [13, 14] . Biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury are elevated CSF total tau (t-tau) [14] , temporo-parietal or precuneus hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose PET [15] , and cortical or hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16] . Recently, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework suggested ATN classification for the diagnosis of AD using biomarkers for studies with specific goals [14] .\nPET, MRI, and CSF biomarkers are very sensitive; however, the PET and MRI methods are costly and CSF studies can be complicated by headaches and back pain. Therefore, other cost-effective and noninvasive methods for the early diagnosis and prediction of AD are needed. The Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD (KBASE) is a prospective cohort study that began in Seoul and surrounding areas in 2014 and it is aimed at recruiting cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals and patients with MCI or ADD to identify new biomarkers, particularly blood biomarkers, in the early detection of AD and risk factors for AD [17] . The validation cohort of KBASE (KBASE-V) is an independent nationwide cohort to reconfirm new potential biomarkers that were identified in the KBASE study and is intended to find risk and prognostic factors for AD as additional studies.\nthe Blessed Dementia Scale-ADL (BDS-ADL) [27] ; the CDR and Global Deterioration Scale [19] ; and the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) [28] .\nWe measured height, weight, handgrip, hip and waist circumferences, mobility and balance using gait speed, the Timed Up and Go Test [29] , and the one leg standing test [30] . The Parkinsonian symptoms were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [31] . We also conducted several questionnaires and scales to investigate the modifiable lifestyle risk factors, and these assessments included the following: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [32] ; simple appetite questionnaire [33] , Eating Behavior Scale [34] , and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) [35] for evaluating nutritional status; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [36] , Stanford Sleepiness Scale [37] , and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [38] for sleep evaluation; and the Cardiovascular Health Study Frailty Index [39] . Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the Asian Working Group criteria [40] . The above clinical evaluations, such as those that were performed at baseline, were repeated annually, and the NPI and UPDRS were performed every two years.\nAll of the participants underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis to measure the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) [40] and the proportion of fat every year. Participants also underwent laboratory tests every two years, including a complete blood count; blood chemistry; lipid panel; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); C-peptide; glycated hemoglobin; adiponectin; homocysteine; the venereal disease research laboratory test; thyroid function test; routine urine analysis; and urine microalbumin.

The MRI protocols were based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative phase 2 (ADNI-2) MRI protocols [49] . The 3D T1-weighted MRI parameters were as follows: TR = 7.32 ms, TE = 3.02 ms, TI = 400 ms, Flip Angle (FA) = 11 \u2022 , and the voxel resolution was 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 mm 3 in the General Electric (GE) Discovery MR750 scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA); TR = shortest (6.8 ms), TE = shortest (3.1 ms), FA = 9 \u2022 , and voxel resolution was 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 mm 3 in the Achieva scanner (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA, USA); and TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.14 ms, TI = 900 ms, FA = 9 \u2022 and voxel resolution was 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 mm 3 in the Skyra and Trio Tim scanners (Siemens, Washington, DC, USA).

The N3 intensity nonuniformity correction algorithm was used to calibrate the intensity difference that was caused by an inhomogeneity in a magnetic field [51] . Corrected T1-weighted images on native space were aligned to the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 standard space [52] . Nonbrain tissue was excluded while using the BET algorithm to focus on the brain [53] . The registered images were classified as gray matter, white matter, and CSF while using an advanced neural-net classifier [54] . The inner surfaces of the cortex were extracted from the partial volume corrected white matter mask using deformable spherical mesh, and then the outer surface of the cortex was automatically extracted using the constrained Laplacian-based automated segmentation with the proximities algorithm [55] . Cortical thickness values in native space were calculated using the Euclidean distance between the linked vertices of the inner and outer surfaces [56] .\nAfter intensity inhomogeneity correction, the corrected T1-weighted images were segmented into the left and right sides of the hippocampus using FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) [57] . The hippocampal volumes were normalized for total intracranial volume, defined as the sum of gray matter, white matter, and CSF volumes. The optimal cutoffs for the hippocampal volume and mean cortical thickness were generated with a ROC analysis to ascertain the optimal threshold for the sensitivity and specificity calculation using data from the ADD and CN groups. The cutoff values that yielded the best Youden's index (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1) for ADD diagnosis were 3.07 mm (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 85.9%) for mean cortical thickness and 4.67 cm 3 (sensitivity 67.3%, specificity 80.3%) when averaging right and left hippocampal volumes."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography", "text": "Eighty participants underwent three-dimensional 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET and 3D T1-weighted MRI using a 3.0 T Biograph mMR (PET-MR) scanner (Siemens, Washington, DC, USA) at baseline.

The data were reconstructed into a 256 \u00d7 256 image matrix using iterative methods (six iterations with 21 subsets) and were corrected for uniformity, ultrashort echo time-based attenuation, and decay reduction. We aligned the 11 C-PiB PET images to the corresponding T1-weighted MRI using rigid body transformation. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of each region of interest (ROI) was obtained by dividing the mean value for all voxels within the ROI by the mean cerebellar gray matter uptake value. The Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) protocol atlas was used as the definition of ROIs for quantitative image analysis while using SUVR [58] .\nComposite SUVR values were formed by averaging of the SUVR values for the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices [9] . The cutoff value that yielded the best Youden's index for ADD diagnosis from the CN group was 1.21 (sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 100%) for the composite cortical PiB retention SUVR.

The images were reconstructed using an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm with four iterations and 16 subsets. Similar to PiB PET, the 18 F-flutemetamol PET images were transformed to the corresponding MRI. SUVR was obtained by using the pons as a reference region and then parcellated using the DTK protocol atlas [58] . Composite SUVR values were calculated by a simple average of the SUVR values for the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices [11, 60] .

First, the percentage of subjects who were APOE \u03b54 carriers in the present study (22% of MCI participants) is lower than in the APOE \u03b54-enriched multi-center research studies, such as ADNI (54% of MCI participants) [65] and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle study (55% of MCI participants) [67] . Assuming that APOE \u03b54 is closely related to increased amyloid positivity, the lower rate of \u03b54 carriers in this study is consistent with the lower rate of amyloid positivity in this study. Second, the inclusion criteria of MCI may have contributed to the lower observed rate of amyloid positive cases. We included the participants with poor performance in at least one of word list immediate recall, word list delayed recall, word list recognition, and visual memory test, in the MCI group. Therefore, it is likely that the MCI participants in the present study represented more heterogeneous group of individuals who, on average, had milder levels of impairment. Such individuals might be more typical of those who would present in a clinical setting for initial diagnosis.\nAmyloid positivity rates (19.8%) in the CU participants, including the CN and SCD participants, were lower than in the ADNI, but were similar to those that were reported in the Japanese ADNI [65] . The difference may be due to age differences between the ADNI and KBASE-V. The CU participants of ADNI were older than those in the KBASE-V. The proportion of the CU participants was as high as 167 (56.6%) in the KBASE-V. Thus, the KBASE-V is well suited to investigate the natural history and prognostic factors of preclinical AD. The CSF AD biomarkers were investigated in 139 (47.1%) participants, and the clinical features and natural course according to ATN classification can be studied in CU and other groups.\nIn this study, the CN and SCD groups showed very different clinical features. The delayed recall tests for episodic memory and language function were significantly worse in the SCD group than in the CN group. However, visuospatial function and executive function test scores, except for the Stroop test, were not different between the SCD and CN groups. These findings are similar to those of a previous report [68] . General cognitive function, such as MMSE and CDR-SB, was not different between the CN and SCD groups. These results were also compatible with those from previous studies [68, 69] . Depression scale scores in the SCD group were not different from those in the MCI and AD groups, but they were significantly higher than those in the CN group. The cause of SCD may be depression in some participants [70] . Alternatively, depression may be an early detection marker of AD [71] . We included the depression score as a covariate in the analysis to compare the clinical and neuropsychological variables among the groups, because depression was a key covariate in this group comparison. In the future, the comparison of clinical course between SCD with depression and SCD without depression is needed in a long-term follow-up study.\nIn this study, the subjective memory questionnaires could not differentiate between the SCD and MCI groups. The SCD individuals may complain of a memory impairment that is similar to that reported by MCI patients. The CDR-SB scores began to significantly increase from the MCI stage and ADL impairment began at the mild ADD stage. Therefore, CDR-SB and ADL are less likely to be used as a measure of drug efficacy in SCD and they may be useful in MCI [72] . Abnormal behaviors on the NPI and visuospatial dysfunction were noticeable from the mild dementia stage. The delayed recall score of LM did not differ between the MCI group and ADD group after correction for multiple comparisons. The LM delayed recall test appears to show a floor effect, even at the mild ADD stage, since the LM delayed recall score was almost zero in the participants with mild ADD of a CDR 0.5 or 1 in the KBASE-V. The results are similar to those of the previous report [73] . Therefore, the LM tests may not be suitable in monitoring the natural course of ADD.\nBMI and nutritional state were decreased in the ADD group when compared with the other groups. Approximately 29% in this mild ADD group had sarcopenia, which is compatible with the results from a previous study [74] . Sarcopenia has been linked to higher levels of physical limitation and disability in older people [40] . As dementia progresses, significant impairment of nutritional indicators is observed [75] . We need to identify and treat sarcopenia and malnutrition to prevent disability in patients with dementia.\nThe cutoff of CSF A\u03b242 levels for distinguishing ADD from the CN participants in the KBASE-V was much higher than in the ADNI [65] . The possible causes of the discrepancy with the ADNI were as follows. First, it is well recognized that interlaboratory variability in the immunoassay-based measurement of CSF A\u03b242 is very large [76] ; hence, the interlaboratory variability might be a reason of higher cut-off value in our study. Second, a small sample size may be related to the higher cutoff value of CSF A\u03b242 levels. Third, it may be associated with age difference between the ADNI and KBASE-V. The participants in the KBASE-V were younger than those in the ADNI. Fourth, the mean score of the CSF A\u03b242 levels in each group of the KBASE-V was higher than in the corresponding group of ADNI, but it was similar to that in the corresponding group of Japanese ADNI [65] . There may be ethnic difference in CSF A\u03b242 levels. Finally, we could not exclude a technical error. The possibility seems to be low, since we determined the acceptable precision of xMAP-Luminex with AlzBio3 kit (average between-run %CV for A\u03b242 through five runs was 9.1 (2.0) %) using pooled nine CSFs before the measurement of our samples.\nAlthough not being statistically significant, except for the comparison between the ADD group and the other groups, CSF t-tau and p-tau and the accumulation of amyloid on amyloid PET increased as the clinical spectrum of AD progressed. CSF A\u03b242 levels were significantly decreased from SCD to MCI and ADD. This is compatible with a previous report [77] . Cortical atrophy was more severe in the SCD group when compared with that in the CN group. Hippocampal atrophy seems to be prominent, beginning at the MCI stage. According to the ATN classification, the proportion of those in the Alzheimer's continuum increased as the clinical spectrum of AD progressed.\nThere are some limitations in this study. First, the number of participants was relatively small. In particular, the number of MCI and ADD participants was small. Second, the amyloid PET or CSF biomarker studies were not conducted in all patients. Third, the CSF AD biomarker study was only conducted in approximately half of the participants. Therefore, ATN classification can be applied in approximately half. Fourth, the sensitivity of CSF t-tau was low. We have included cortical atrophy and hippocampal atrophy on brain MRI in the neurodegeneration markers.\nIn conclusion, we constructed a KBASE-V cohort consisting of CN, SCD, MCI, and ADD participants, which are followed-up for three years. This cohort showed clear differences in neuropsychological tests and AD biomarkers, according to the clinical spectrum of AD. This cohort is suitable to reconfirm the potential new AD biomarkers that were identified in the KABSE. It is also useful to find the risk and prognostic factors for AD and to evaluate the natural course of disease according to the AD clinical spectrum."}]
