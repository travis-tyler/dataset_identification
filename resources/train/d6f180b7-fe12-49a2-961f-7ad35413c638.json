Methods: We analyzed whole genome sequences (WGS) from 351 members of 67 Caribbean Hispanic (CH) families from Dominican Republic and New York multiply affected by LOAD. Members of 67 CH and additional 47 Caucasian families underwent WGS as a part of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). All members of 67 CH families, an additional 48 CH families and an independent CH case-control cohort were subsequently genotyped for validation. Patients met criteria for LOAD, and controls were determined to be dementia free. We investigated rare variants segregating within families and gene-based associations with disease within LOAD GWAS loci. Results: A variant in AKAP9, p.R434W, segregated significantly with LOAD in two large families (OR = 5.77, 95% CI: 1.07-30.9, P = 0.041). In addition, missense mutations in MYRF and ASRGL1 under previously reported linkage peaks at 7q14.3 and 11q12.3 segregated completely in one family and in follow-up genotyping both were nominally significant (P < 0.05). We also identified rare variants in a number of genes associated with LOAD in prior genome wide association studies, including CR1 (P = 0.049), BIN1 (P = 0.0098) and SLC24A4 (P = 0.040). Conclusions and Relevance: Rare variants in multiple genes influence the risk of LOAD disease in multiplex families. These results suggest that rare variants may underlie loci identified in genome wide association studies.

The disease is characterized by progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive functions, leading to loss of autonomy and ultimately requiring full-time medical care. Pathologically, LOAD is defined by severe neuronal loss, aggregation of amyloid b (Ab) in extracellular senile plaques, and formation of intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein.\nOver the past decade, genetic research in LOAD has been dominated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a hypothesis-free scan of the genome using dense genotyping arrays based on common variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). Several genes within LOAD susceptibility loci cluster in specific pathways, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] including amyloid processing, oxidative stress and immune or inflammatory pathways. Collectively, GWAS demonstrates that apart from the strongest risk factor, APOE-e4 a large number of loci with modest effect size also contribute to LOAD risk. Common variants identified through GWAS may not have functional consequences, simply reflecting linkage disequilibrium with the unobserved causal variants. It is also possible that these causal variants are rare and have large effects, such as TREM2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and are not covered by commercially available GWAS platforms. In fact, putatively damaging variants have already been identified (for example TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7) in some of these LOAD susceptibility loci, advancing our understanding of disease risk. [14] [15] [16] Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides a comprehensive and detailed investigation of human genetic variation allowing interrogation of coding and noncoding regions of the genome. Increasingly, WGS studies have provided the strongest evidence that rare genetic variants can have large cumulative effects on human diseases. [17] [18] [19] [20] Family-based studies represent an implicit enrichment strategy for identifying rare variants. 21 Transmission of variants from parents to offspring maximizes the chance that multiple copies of rare variants exist in the pedigree. Moreover, compared with analyses using unrelated samples, sequencing in families provides data concerning identical-by-descent or sharing among relatives, greatly reducing false positives and permitting detection of sequencing errors, while facilitating the identification of alleles that cause genetic disorders. 22, 23 In the current report, we focused on Caribbean Hispanic families multiply affected by LOAD. The frequency of LOAD among multiplex families from the Dominican Republic is known to be significantly higher (5-fold) than expected for similarly aged individuals in a non-Hispanic white population from the United States. 24 Furthermore, we found that a moderate degree of inbreeding was present and a predictor of LOAD risk in this population. 25 As part of the national Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), we identified several chromosomal regions with strong evidence for linkage in Caribbean Hispanic families with multiple LOAD cases. 26 In the present study, we used WGS data (Data S1) from 67 families as discovery to detect rare variants in previously identified linkage regions and in previously reported LOAD candidate genes. Genotyping in additional WGS on additional 47 Caucasian families were used to replicate the findings from the CH families."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Family characteristics", "text": "All participants (Table 1) were recruited after providing informed consent and with approval by the relevant institutional review boards both in the United States and in 27, 28 predominately from the Dominican Republic. As a part of the ADSP, a set of 67 CH families and 47 Caucasian families were selected for whole genome sequencing from approximately 1400 families reviewed. Selection was based on the number of affected individuals, the number of generations affected, age at onset of clinical symptoms, and presence of APOEe4 alleles. 29 Whole Genome Sequence analysis of GWAS linkage peaks Details about WGS methodology and variant calling pipelines can be found in Data S1. Three regions demonstrating linkage previously identified 26 using GWAS data were prioritized for WGS data analysis. Results from genome-wide linkage analysis revealed a strong linkage signal (HLOD = 3.6) on chromosomal region 3q29. 26 We previously reported microsatellite linkage analyses in this region as strongly associated with LOAD in Caribbean Hispanics, 30 including a single family that achieved a LOD score of 1.28. WGS data was generated for four of the family members with LOAD. Analysis of the WGS data was limited to an approximate 2 Mb region encompassing the 1-LOD interval around linkage peak (3q29: 197,052,973 bp-199,212,658 bp). We also selected two chromosomal regions where we observed genome-wide significant linkage and association signals across the families: 7p14.3 and 11q12.3. 26 Annotation of the identified variants in these linkage regions was performed using the ANNOVAR software. 31 Whole genome sequence variants prioritization"}, {"section_title": "Consensus linkage regions", "text": "We followed a principled filtering strategy (Fig. 1 , Table S4 ) to test the segregation of rare variants with LOAD status in the three linkage regions: 7p14.3 and 11q12.3 and 3q29 (Table S6 ). The first criterion used to prioritize the identified variants was based on familial segregation of cases. We required that at least 75% of the patients with LOAD and WGS data in the families were carriers. Additionally we also prioritized variants that were observed in at least five affected individuals in multiple Caribbean Hispanic families.\nWe filtered variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 0.10 in the ADSP families and with an MAF of 0.02 in Caucasian and African American populations in ExAC database (for exonic variants) 32 and 1000 genomes project (for intronic and intergenic variants) 33 to restrict our analyses to rare variants in the population. Functional annotations were also used as filtering strategy, that is, variants were analyzed in order of increasing priority: exonic, inter-genic, intronic and others (non-coding RNA, 3 0 /5 0 UTR, upstream/downstream gene). We also included any intronic or intergenic variants with a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) 34 score of greater than 30 to include highly conserved and putative non-exonic regulatory variants in the analyses.

Population allele frequencies for novel variants were estimated from unaffected persons in the Caribbean Hispanic population from samples/families that we have amassed over 15 years. Genotypes were generated using the KASP TM genotyping technology which uses allele-specific polymerase chain reaction for accurate calling of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. 35 Single variant association analyses SNV genetic associations were restricted to individuals 60 years of age or older and were tested using General Linear Models in generalized estimating equations (GEE) to adjust for familial correlation in the data.

We also tested gene-sets that included both loss of function variants and variants that had a high CADD score (>30). The CADD score filter captures putatively non-functional variants in the non-coding regions. For most genes (Table S5) , we did not observe variants in non-coding regions with a high CADD score. In addition functional characterization of GWAS loci have indicated that cis-regulation is a common mechanism underlying these associations. 39 The most frequent elements affected are transcriptional enhancers and silencers that regulate transcription through long-range interactions, typically located more than 1Kb from their target genes. Therefore, to examine the top GWAS signals, 4 we have considered a chromosomal region of 1 genes within AE1 Mb encompassing the reported LOAD-GWAS SNPs.

We tested models of association also adjusting for (1) age, sex, population substructure, ancestry proportions for African-American and native American ancestry (Data S1) and (2) including APOE-e4 dosage with other covariates.

The two different variants in AKAP9 were previously identified, were considered rare in populations African-descent, and were not present in European-descent or East Asian-descent individuals in the 1000 Genomes database. AKAP9 is located on chromosome 7q21-22, and it encodes a member of the A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family. The Akinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) are structurally diverse proteins that bind to the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell.

The MYRF gene encodes a transcription factor that is required for central nervous system myelination and may regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation. It increases expression of genes that affect myelin production. Mutant huntingtin mice show progressive neurological symptoms and early death, as well as age-dependent demyelination and reduced expression of myelin genes that are downstream of MYRF. 43 A missense mutation in ASRGL1 has been associated with autosomal recessive retinal degeneration, 44 but it has not been previously related to Alzheimer's disease or neurodegenerative disorders. In patients with retinal degeneration, variants in ASRGL1 are thought to be the cause of protein misfolding, intracellular mis-routing and aggregation of misfolded proteins. It is expressed in brain, specifically in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. 45 Examination of known LOAD genes (e.g., from large GWAS-based meta-analyses) confirmed the role of rare functional variation in CR1 (P = 0.049), BIN1 (P = 0.0098), and SLC24A4 (P = 0.040). CR1 encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein in the innate immune system. It is a receptor for the complement components C3b and C4b. It has been consistently identified as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. 3, 4, 46 BIN1 encodes the bridging integrator 1 gene, which has also been consistently associated with Alzheimer's disease in GWAS studies. 4, 47 BIN1 is present in neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia, and its primary role is thought to be in endocytosis and trafficking in neurons and immune response in glia cells. 48 SLC24A4 is a solute carrier that has been associated with pigmentation traits in European populations. However, more relevant to LOAD is its association with blood pressure in African Americans, as LOAD may be influenced by vascular disease. 49 Of the genes identified within the 2 Mb region surrounding the previously identified GWAS loci from the IGAP study, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] several were nominally significant. CYP3A43 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids, and are part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 7q21.1. MSH5 encodes a member of the mutS family of proteins that are involved in DNA mismatch repair or meiotic recombination processes. Women with premature ovarian failure were found to carry a mutation in MSH5 suggesting a role in meiotic recombination. Genetic variants in a gene within the major histocompatibility complex, HLA-DQA2, were associated with LOAD in this study. However, this gene has low expression in brain and has been associated with multiple inflammatory disorders.

Family-based WGS on previously localized linkage regions remains a particularly powerful strategy for causal variant identification. Several new disease susceptibility genes have been successfully identified using linkage analysis coupled with WGS, in complex phenotype disorders such as hearing impairment, 50 familial goiters, 51 and familial hypertension. 52 Taken together the results here imply that rare variants in multiple genes are likely to increase the risk of LOAD. Large families multiply affected by LOAD are extremely helpful in identifying novel rare variants even in genes previously investigated by other means. For example, loci identified by genome wide array studies have pointed to a large number of genes many of which have rare variants suggesting that these loci were in linkage disequilibrium with one or more of the mutations. How variants in these multiple genes lead to a common phenotype of LOAD needs to be investigated. However, investigations of gene functions may point to potential targets for new treatments or preventive measures. associated phenotypic data used in primary data analyses were stored at Study Investigators institutions, and at the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD, U24AG021886) at Indiana University funded by NIA.
