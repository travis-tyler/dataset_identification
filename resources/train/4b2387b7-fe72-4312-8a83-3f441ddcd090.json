[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Neurofilament light chain (NFL), an axonal cytoskeletal protein reported to"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Neurofilament (NF) is a crucial axonal cytoskeletal component comprising three subunits, namely, neurofilament light chain (NFL), neurofilament medium chain (NFM) and neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) [1] . The disruption of NF in neuronal damage occurring within neurodegenerative conditions, results in the release of NF into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [2] ; consequently giving rise to elevated NFL concentrations in the CSF, as has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [3] and other neurodegenerative diseases [4] [5] [6] [7] .\nWith the invasive nature of CSF collection via lumbar puncture, the potential of employing NFL as a biomarker for disease diagnosis or progression, and possibly for screening, further drove the investigation of blood NFL alterations, in disease [2, [8] [9] [10] . Employing the Alzheimer's Disease Neurodegenerative Initiative (ADNI) cohort, Mattsson and colleagues reported significantly higher plasma NFL in AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients compared to controls [11] . Additionally, higher plasma NFL has been associated with compromised cognition and hippocampal atrophy both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.\nFurthermore, plasma NFL was inversely associated with brain glucose metabolism, longitudinally in the same highly characterized ADNI cohort [11] . More recently, a study conducted on autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) families found that plasma NFL was higher in the asymptomatic mutation carriers (aMC) and symptomatic mutation carriers (sMC) compared to their non-carrier (NC) relatives, wherein plasma NFL concentrations were reported to be about 1.3-fold higher in aMC and 3.6-fold higher in sMC [12] .\nHowever, plasma NFL in individuals with preclinical AD prior to cognitive impairment, characterised by neocortical amyloid-\u03b2 load (NAL) measured via positron emission tomography (PET) and subjective memory complaints, has not been investigated previously.\nFurthermore, the association between plasma NFL and cognitive performance in cognitively normal elderly individuals has also not been examined. Therefore, the current study investigated the association between plasma NFL and NAL, employing a standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) cut-off value of 1.35, categorising study participants as high NAL (SUVR\u22651.35; NAL+) and low NAL (SUVR<1.35; NAL-), given that the aberrant build-up of NAL begins as early as two decades prior to the clinical manifestation of AD [13] . Based on the Memory Assessment Clinic-Questionnaire (MAC-Q) [14] , NAL+ participants were further categorised into subjective memory complainers (SMC) and noncomplainers (non-SMC) to examine NFL alterations within the preclinical cohort subset at highest risk of AD (NAL+ SMC). The current study also examined whether plasma NFL levels inversely correlated with cognitive performance within cognitively normal elderly individuals.\nOur investigations were therefore aimed at gaining better insight into whether axonal injury, reflected by increased plasma NFL, is present in the early pathogenesis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Study participants belonged to the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health (KARVIAH) cohort, at baseline. All participants were residents of Anglicare, New South Wales, Australia.\nCohort volunteers (N=206) were required to meet the set screening inclusion and exclusion criteria to be eligible for the KARVIAH cohort. Briefly, the inclusion criteria for the KARVIAH cohort comprised an age range of 65-90 years, good general health, no known significant cerebral vascular disease, fluent in English, adequate/corrected vision and hearing to enable testing, no objective cognitive impairment as screened by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score \u226526. MoCA scores lying between 18-25 were assessed on a case by case basis by the study neuropsychologist following stratification of scores according to age and education [15] . The exclusion criteria comprised, the diagnosis of dementia based on the revised criteria from the National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's Association [16] , presence of acute functional psychiatric disorder (including lifetime history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), history of stroke, severe or extremely severe depression (based on the depression, anxiety, stress scales; DASS) and uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP > 170 or diastolic BP > 100).\nOne hundred and five participants out of the 134 volunteers meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, underwent neuroimaging, neuropsychometric evaluation and blood collection, as the remaining either declined undergoing neuroimaging or withdrew from the study. Within these 105 participants, 100 participants were considered to have normal global cognition based on their Mini-Mental State Examination score [17] (MMSE \u226526), and were included in the current study. Plasma NFL concentrations were reported in all 100 participants considered to have normal global cognition. All volunteers provided written informed consent prior to participation, and the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia, provided approval for the study."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of neocortical amyloid-\u03b2 load via PET", "text": "All study participants were imaged within three months of blood collection.

"}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations were calculated for NAL+ and Figure 1 ). However, after adjusting for age, significance disappeared between quartile 1 and 3, and only a trend remained between cognitively normal participants [11] . Furthermore, associations between brain atrophy and plasma (and CSF) NFL concentrations reported previously in MCI, AD (and cognitively normal) individuals with both high and low CSF A\u03b2 load [32] , indicate that NFL is a general neurodegeneration biomarker, with high levels in many disorders such as PSP and FTD (Refse intro), which also is consistent with the observations of NFL between NAL+ and NALparticipants in the current study. However, we observed a trend of elevated plasma NFL in SMC compared to non-memory complainers within the NAL+ subset employed in the current study -the cohort subset likely to be the most advanced in the preclinical AD pathogenesis trajectory.\nInterestingly, Mattsson and colleagues, also observed that MCI and AD APOE \u03b54 non-carriers had significantly higher plasma NFL concentrations compared to \u03b54 carriers. Within the current study as well, APOE \u03b54 non-carriers had a higher mean plasma NFL (37.49 pg/ml) compared to APOE \u03b54 carriers (32.18 pg/ml), although it did not reach significance presumably due to the relatively small numbers in the latter group. However, within the APOE \u03b54 non-carrier cohort subset, a trend of higher NAL was observed in participants with plasma NFL lying within Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1, suggesting that the onset of axonal cytoskeletal disruption may commence as early as this preclinical phase of AD.\nWithin the current study we did not observe a significant correlation between plasma NFL and hippocampal atrophy (data not shown): an observation in line with findings reported by Pereira and colleagues, wherein plasma NFL was associated with brain atrophy only in symptomatic cases, while CSF NFL concentrations were associated with brain atrophy in AD, MCI and cognitively normal subjects [32] . Similar observations have also been reported in the autosomal dominant form of AD (ADAD) by Weston and colleagues [12] . No association between plasma NFL and neocortical glucose metabolism (data not shown) was observed within the current cross-sectional study, which is in agreement with the findings reported by Mattsson and colleagues [11] .\nPlasma NFL was observed to correlate strongly with age in the present study. This correlation is consistent with previous studies reporting significant correlations between age and NFL in both, CSF and plasma (or serum) from healthy controls, individuals with pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative disease and within cohorts comprising healthy controls, MCI and AD patients [3, 7, 9, 11, 33, 34] .\nAdditionally, plasma and CSF NFL concentrations have previously been reported to be inversely associated with MMSE, the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and the Trail Making Test-B scores in participants with MCI, sporadic AD, ADAD and bipolar disorder [3, 11, 12, 35] . The current study also observed that plasma NFL correlated inversely with cognitive performance, particularly, verbal and visual episodic memory, executive function and working memory and global cognition suggesting that higher plasma NFL concentrations are associated with inferior cognitive performance in elderly individuals with normal global cognition as well.\nWe acknowledge that the current study has limitations with regard to its relatively modest sample size. However, the present study also has its strengths given that it utilizes a highly characterised, cognitively normal cohort with a representative proportion of preclinical AD individuals, in agreement with other established cohorts [36, 37] , employing PET for NAL measurement, a stronger marker of AD neuropathology compared to CSF A\u03b2, as employed previously [11] . Additionally, the study also incorporates a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and most importantly, a highly sensitive assay to measure plasma NFL. Further investigation of the association between NAL and NFL in cognitively normal elderly individuals via an orthogonal method, for example mass-spectrometry (MS), may be employed for validation given the differences between immune-assay based techniques and MS: Immune-based methods detect both modified and unmodified members of a specific protein species, as well as possible oligomeric forms. but also potentially bind to other offtarget proteins in the sample, as the monoclonal antibody recognises an epitope which may also be presented in an unrelated protein. In contrast, the exact primary sequence of the peptide being measured is known in MS, however this technology only measures those peptides that are unmodified therefore restricting itself to a subset of all the isoforms of a specific protein carrying that sequence. Additionally, differences between native folded protein and denatured protein also contribute to disparities in measurements of the same protein employing orthogonal techniques. "}]
