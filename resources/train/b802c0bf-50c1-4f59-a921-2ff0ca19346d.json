[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) developed a new hierarchical classification scheme to standardize mapping techniques and terminology throughout all its reserves. The Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) obtained habitat information from various sources and reclassifed habitats according to the NERRS scheme using a geographic information system (GIS). Mapping the Mission-Aransas NERR manually at a high spatial resolution was desired, but proved challenging because of its considerable size (185,708 acres) and limited accessibility to privately-owned land areas. Existing digital habitat information was identified and obtained from partner agencies in an effort to create a comprehensive habitat map of the Mission-Aransas Estuary and the adjacent watersheds. Geospatial habitat information available within the Mission-Aransas Estuary and the adjacent watersheds were identified and assessed for appropriateness of this project by the following attributes: scale, resolution, habitats identified, location, accuracy, accessibility, and temporal relevance. The University of Texas at Austin Bureau of Economic Geology (UT BEG) had a high-resolution habitat dataset of the wetlands on Texas barrier islands. A portion of this data on Matagorda Island is within the Mission-Aransas NERR boundary and was used as a case study for reclassifying data to the NERRS classification scheme. The Matagorda Island data were provided to the Mission-Aransas NERR in vector (polygon) format, and this document outlines the procedures used to reclassify this type of data. However, vector data is not the only type of data available, and an additional method of reclassification using a raster format was also explored. This document demonstrates the process of vector and raster data reclassification for geospatial habitat information. The Matagorda Island wetlands data were originally classified using the Cowardin classification scheme, which implemented codes describing specific habitats to the modifier level (Cowardin et al.1979). Reclassification of this data from a Cowardin scheme to the NERRS scheme required the data be organized into a hierarchical database structure. A look-up table was created to compare the two classification schemes. Reclassification of the vector data required the application of the join-relationship tool supplied within the GIS environment. Reclassification of the raster data required the application of the reclassification tool supplied within the GIS environment. One of the major differences in the NERR coding system to the Cowardin classification is that upland habitat is described in great detail. Since the Matagorda Island data only contained wetland habitat information, several NERR codes were not correlated to this dataset. This report documents the methods, challenges, and recommendations of reclassifying existing data to the NERRS classification scheme. It represents the first phase in the creation of a comprehensive high resolution habitat map. Future work will incorporate additional datasets for complete coverage of the Mission-Aransas NERR habitat areas."}, {"section_title": "IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS", "text": "This project followed protocol guidelines outlined in the Recommended Guidelines for Adoption and Implementation of the NERRS Comprehensive Habitat and Land Use Classification System (Walker and Garfield 2005). The reclassification of existing data followed the NERRS classification implementation process (Figure 1), but was modified to the reclassification process."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this project was to provide baseline mapping resources at the reserve level by reclassifying existing data sources utilizing the NERR classification scheme. The approach used for this project was to obtain digital data resources from within the reserve, reclassify them according to the NERRS scheme, and compile the data into a single comprehensive habitat map of the Mission-Aransas NERR. This report documents the reclassification process for one dataset and provides analyses of the process. "}, {"section_title": "Identify Existing Map Resources", "text": "Several classification projects relevant to the Mission-Aransas NERR were in progress at the start of this project (Appendix A). The University of Texas at Austin Bureau of Economic Geology (UT BEG) mapped Matagorda Island, Texas, wetland habitats using high-resolution mapping techniques in vector format. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Change Analysis Program (NOAA C-CAP) provided a classified land cover dataset of the Mission-Aransas NERR using 30-meter Landsat imagery. These data and future datasets will be incorporated into a GIS using ESRI's ArcGIS 9.2 software."}, {"section_title": "Select Mapping Scale", "text": "Map scale was variable among available data. The NERRS recommends that for aerial photography a mapping scale should be between 1:24,000 and 1:3,000. The NERRS also recommends that if using \"heads-up\" (i.e., on-screen) digitizing techniques are used to maintain a consistent on-screen viewing scale (e.g., 1:3000 to 1:5:000) and use a minimum mapping unit (e.g., 0.25 acre) to ensure database integrity. The wetland habitats for Matagorda Island from UT BEG were chosen as an appropriate dataset to reclassify because aerial imagery was shot at a mapping scale of 1:8,000 with an accuracy of +/-40 ft, (White et al. 2002). This dataset also had a minimum mapping unit of approximately 0.055 acres (Tom Tremblay, personal communication)."}, {"section_title": "Design and Document GIS database structure", "text": "The goal of the NERRS classification scheme was to classify both habitat and land use cover types simultaneously creating a seamless classification. The NERRS Classification Scheme consists of a merger and expansion of two well-accepted and utilized classification schemes: Cowardin et al. 1979 andAnderson et al. (1976). There are eight total systems within the NERRS classification (Table 1): five (5) wetland and deepwater habitat systems adopted directly from Cowardin et al. 1979, one (1) cultural land use system, one (1) snow-and-ice habitat system (adopted directly from Anderson et al. 1976), and one (1) upland habitat system expanded from Cowardin et al. 1979 (Walker and. Table 1. NERRS classification structure based on Cowardin et al. 1979and Anderson et al. 1976(modified from Walker and Garfield 2005. Asterisks indicate subsystems that were added by NERRS and incorporated with Cowardin et al. 1979 Each system becomes increasingly detailed as part of a five-level, nested hierarchical structure that allows data to be collapsed or expanded to the level of detail desired by the user (Figure 2). Each level represents a useful and logical break in some parameter of the community, becoming increasingly detailed as more levels are integrated. The Mission-Aransas NERR GIS database design accommodates all of these classification levels in a single attribute table to meet the hierarchical requirements. The application of a numeric heading system enhances the utility of the structure within the GIS to allow for efficient sorting and querying. Additional attributes can be added to the table as more detail is needed (such as concatenated value, modifiers, notes, dates, and/or hyperlinks to further information.) The attributes used for the reclassification of the UT BEG wetland habitat dataset on Matagorda Island included 20 fields (Table 2). "}, {"section_title": "Develop a Flow diagram for the Implementation Process", "text": "The process used to reclassify data using the NERRS scheme is dependent on data format (Figure 4). Raster and vector files are the two common formats used in a GIS. Vector files are made up of mathematical descriptions of objects such as points, polygons, lines, and text. Raster files are made up of pixels and have an associated resolution (ESRI, 2006). Advantages of working with vector data are they require less disk space and geometric computations take less time. Raster files use a matrix to store their data (cell-based) and can assign numeric values to continuous, thematic data to represent this data more realistically. The Mission-Aransas NERR assessed a subset of Matagorda Island data in its original vector format, and additionally converted the file to raster format to demonstrate how both raster and vector data can be reclassified. The detailed steps involved in this reclassification of both types of data are documented in Appendix B. Create a Look-Up Table ( "}, {"section_title": "Document Key Habitats", "text": "The Mission-Aransas NERR is home to a variety of key habitats such as seagrass, mangroves, marsh, oak mottes, oyster reef, mud tidal flats, and riparian corridors. Matagorda Island is a barrier island that spans several counties along the south-central Texas coast and the southern-most portion of this island encompasses 17,583 acres within the northeastern Reserve boundary ( Figure 5). Matagorda Island has many key habitats including valuable wetlands with key marsh and mud tidal flat habitat. This data is part of a much larger project to perform a change analysis in comparison with the National Wetland Inventory imagery collected in 1991-1992 along the Texas coast. The more recent wetland habitats were identified by UT BEG using the Cowardin classification scheme (Cowardin et al. 1979), and were provided to the Mission-Aransas NERR for integration into the NERRS habitat classification database. The Matagorda Island data was selected as a case study for this project for the following reasons: \u2022 It was the most recent account of wetland habitats for Matagorda Island as of June 2007. \u2022 The purpose of this dataset was to compare mud tidal flats and marsh habitats in 2001 to the USGS NWI dataset of 1992-93, so a long-term change analysis has already been established. \u2022 Accurate ground-truthing was completed. \u2022 The area of Matagorda Island that resides within the Mission-Aransas NERR boundary is relatively small (17,583 acres); therefore, the data associated with this region was very detailed, but not entirely cumbersome to manipulate within the GIS environment. \u2022 UT BEG is completing additional mapping of wetlands within the Mission-Aransas NERR area. Therefore, the reclassification techniques defined for Matagorda Island will be the same techniques required to reclassify the more comprehensive data that will be available in March 2008. In the future additional data that may be incorporated into the Mission-Aransas NERR include the NOAA C-CAP and a benthic habitat mapping project by Texas A&M University Corpus Christi and NOAA Coastal Services Center, as well as an invasive species dataset from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (Appendix A). "}, {"section_title": "Apply NERRS Classification Codes", "text": "Four major steps are required when reclassifying from an existing classification to the NERRS scheme and entering it into the GIS database. First, a look-up table is created to \"map\" the existing code to the new NERR code (Appendix B). This is manually intensive, but using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel is an excellent way to manipulate the data. Second, determining the best format to process the data is required to establish classifying with the best spatial resolution, in a feasible amount of time. Larger datasets may require reclassification at a lower accuracy to decrease the process time. However, an automated raster reclassification method may be used to process a broad area fairly quickly. If high spatial resolution is required, a more discrete data format such as vector may be best when assessing extremely defined boundaries or very small spatial extents. Once the data format is selected, the reclassification process can take place using the appropriate tools. A raster data file can utilize the Reclassify tool located within the ArcToolbox extension within the ArcGIS environment. This tool is automated, but still requires significant manual data entry within the reclassification box. A vector data file can be reclassified in two ways: 1) converting the vector to raster or 2) using a join relationship to link the tables. Both methods were assessed (Appendix B) and while the raster file displayed the reclassification more quickly, there was some reduced accuracy since the raster-based structure converts the discrete polygon line to a jagged edge. Conversely, the join tool retains the original boundary lines, but may require more manually intensive data entry if the dataset is very large. The establishment of an Excel look-up table (LUT) identifies and links the old coding system to the new NERRS codes. A LUT is essential for large reclassifications regardless of file type, because it is more easily manipulated. The LUT is valuable as both an external GIS reference resource for quick searches and drill-downs, but also as an internal GIS dataset that can be used to create join relationships within the GIS and help expedite data entry (Appendix C). Reclassifying data is beneficial in one sense because it can make data more understandable to the map reader; however, the detriment is that original values are lost during the reclassification process."}, {"section_title": "Perform a Standard Map Accuracy Assessment", "text": "As data is entered into a GIS, it is common to perform an accuracy check for errors and discrepancies at this level. A standard map accuracy assessment is not required in this method since existing data sources are being used to generate the comprehensive habitat model."}, {"section_title": "Generate Metadata", "text": "Metadata should be documented in conjunction with data entry for efficiency and accurate process tracking. Creating metadata \"after the fact\" can contribute to data loss and inaccuracies when post-processing in the GIS environment. All data for this project was generated using and the Federal Geographic Data Clearinghouse (FGDC) standard template within the ArcCatalog interface (Appendix D). This provides a user-friendly format in which to modify text. Careful review of the metadata should be performed prior to distribution as in some instances; the metadata can be overwritten if not experienced with the application tool."}, {"section_title": "Analyze Data and Process", "text": "The Matagorda Island data provided by the UT BEG was reclassified using the NERRS scheme using two very different methods. The first method required using a join relationship to link the look-up table (LUT) to the original dataset to assign the proper habitat codes to the appropriate polygon. As part of the reclassification process, each hierarchical level was assigned a unique, concatenated code that was included as part of each row (each polygon) attributes. The reclassification consolidated 15 classes within the Cowardin system, to 11 classes in which 1 indicated that no data was available (Table 3 and Figure 6). Estuarine Subtidal Unconsolidated Bottom dominated the region of interest covering 5393.1 acres. Estuarine Intertidal Emergent Wetland (Persistent) was the second most common habitat at 2,909.8 acres. Palustrine Perennial was the least dominant with a total of about 16 acres in the region.

While the new structure follows several old classification systems, it is sometimes difficult to manage and doesn't appear to be set up for relational database purposes, unless a composite key will be used. The current protocol doesn't appear to remove redundancies One of the first issues encountered using a raster reclassification is that Cowardin codes can be descriptive to the modifier level. The Matagorda Island dataset has some features that were classified with Water Regime information. However, since the new NERR coding system does not specifically account for this level of detail, it was necessary to truncate the original Cowardin codes that contained these modifiers, and move the information to a separate, more descriptive column. Once this was done, the reclassification grouped like-habitats by System, Subsystem, Class and Subclass.  (Figure 1). 1.1.2. Use separate headers for each field and identify the original code, the new code, and its descriptive information with as many attribute fields as you wish. 1.1.3. Concatenate any field to help identify Cowardin items. 1.1.4. Save the file as a .csv or .dbf file for insertion to the GIS.   (Figure 2).  Once this function runs, right-click the layer and click OPEN ATTRIBUTE TABLE. The table will display numerous columns that may or may not be relevant to the analysis (Figure 4). Clean up of the data is performed by renaming some columns and hiding others to make a more intuitive database.  Since the Matagorda Island dataset has some features that were classified with Water Regime information (modifier), applying the new classification scheme grouped these attributes into a single category at the Subclass level, and therefore does not allow us to differentiate the modifiers within the Subclass. To resolve this issue, it was necessary to truncate the original Cowardin data codes that contained these modifiers, and move the information to a separate, more descriptive column. Modifying the original polygon file (or some duplicate of the original data) is the most efficient way to manipulate the data into the needed format. A query was run for each code that contained a modifier and updated to reflect the modifier's meaning ( Figure 5). In addition, the habitat \"original\" code was revised to reflect only to the Subclass level in the NERRS hierarchy ( Figure 6). Codes with Modifiers A, C, F, N, P Figure 6.
