[{"section_title": "Introduction and Significance", "text": "Background for research question. Transgender individuals, whose birth sex does not match their current gender identity, face numerous barriers to accessing culturally-competent and comprehensive reproductive healthcare. [1][2][3][4][5] One of the most pervasive barriers includes a lack of knowledgeable providers to care for transgender patients. 6 This deficit extends into all disciplines, including reproductive healthcare. A recent study of OB/GYNs found that 80% did not receive training in residency on the care of transgender patients, and less than 30% felt comfortable caring for female-to-male patients. 7 Additionally, even when providers care for transgender patients, both healthcare providers and transgender patients may hold common misconceptions about the sexual health risks, sexual behavior, and screening requirements of transgender patients. [8][9] Presently, most transgender men do not undergo complete sex reassignment surgery, and if they do have a hysterectomy, it is often later in life; thus, most transgender men have a cervix for most of their lives 10 and require the same reproductive health screenings as nontransgender women. [11][12] However, current research suggests that female-to-male (FTM) transgender men are significantly less likely to be up to date on preventative reproductive screening than cisgender women. [13][14] Additionally, transgender men may have a higher prevalence of risk factors for reproductive tract cancers, including smoking. 15 Furthermore, when transgender men do get pap smears, they are more likely to have unsatisfactory samples than cisgender women, 16 requiring additional follow-up and repeat testing. Both physical and psychological barriers to preventative healthcare for transgender men have been elucidated. Psychological barriers include increased (and sometimes very severe) patient anxiety about genital exams, a frequent history of trauma, and patient desire to ignore and disconnect from natal reproductive organs. 2,17 Moreover, long-term testosterone use can cause vaginal atrophy, increasing physical discomfort during the exam 17 and causing cervical atrophy that can mimic dysplasia. 18 Despite these significant barriers, however, proper screening of natal reproductive organs is important to prevent poor outcomes, as cancers of natal reproductive organs have been described in transgender men. [19][20][21][22] Another commonly neglected consideration in the care of transgender men is the provision of full spectrum family planning. This includes either the prevention of pregnancy or starting a family, whether that means becoming pregnant themselves, adoption, or surrogacy, depending on the patient's desires. Transgender men may continue to ovulate unpredictably while taking testosterone, even if they are no longer menstruating. Therefore, while the risk for pregnancy is certainly reduced while on testosterone, the risk is not eliminated. 17 However, a recent study of transgender men presenting to a clinic in San Francisco found that nearly half of the transgender men were at risk for pregnancy. Most of the participants desired to prevent pregnancy at that time, but were using either no contraception or only condoms. 23 Data suggest that transgender men may mistakenly believe that they are unable to get pregnant because they are amenorrheic, which can result in unintended pregnancies. 24 Additionally, pregnancies in transgender men may be identified later, since there is no missed period. This is particularly important, given that testosterone is categorized by the FDA as Category X, and can cause virilization of a developing fetus. Thus, it is imperative that healthcare providers discuss and counsel transgender patients on use of contraception while using testosterone. Conversely, many transgender men desire to have children, including genetically-related children. [25][26][27][28] While many transgender men have maintained their fertility 29 and have been able to successfully carry pregnancies later in life (after monitored cessation of hormone therapy), little data is available regarding the long term impact of testosterone therapy on fertility and fecundity. Thus, discussing family planning prior to starting testosterone is imperative. This includes discussing options regarding egg cryopreservation, as well as other family planning options, including pregnancy, surrogacy, or adoption."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions and Goals.", "text": "The first purpose of this study is to examine the knowledge of transgender men with regards to reproductive health screening. The study will then examine the participants' comfort discussing these issues with their healthcare providers, and furthermore, whether or not transgender men have had conversations with their healthcare providers about their sexual or reproductive health. Finally, the study will evaluate the experiences and barriers transgender men have had in obtaining comprehensive reproductive healthcare."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "We hypothesize that transgender men have misconceptions about their reproductive health needs, including their risk for pregnancy and their need for routine sexual health screening. We also hypothesize that transgender men often feel uncomfortable bringing up issues of reproductive health and family planning with their healthcare providers, and thus, have not had adequate discussions with their healthcare providers surrounding these issues."}, {"section_title": "Significance and rationale for RQ", "text": "Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that there is a need for improved fullspectrum sexual health services for transgender patients, including preventative care, anticipatory guidance, and family planning. Given the lack of readily available sexual health information (books, pamphlets, etc.) that speak to the experience of transgender men, [30][31] these patients may look to healthcare providers to provide them with accurate health information. However, the amount of attention paid to transgender health needs in medical education is inadequate, 32 leaving physicians untrained to care for an entire demographic of patients. This study provides additional insight into the impact of these deficits, allowing us to determine how the current educational status of both of providers and patients may impact the experience transgender men have when seeking reproductive healthcare and family planning services."}, {"section_title": "Research Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population.", "text": "The study population includes transgender men who are eighteen years of age or older.

However, ANOVAs were also conducted to compare responses to the Comfort Seeking Care, Health Knowledge, and Provider Conversation sections to determine if there were differences in responses for various demographics. A p-value of 0.05 was used as the cutoff for significance, and Levene's test was used to assess equality of variance between populations. Given the gravity of most of the questions (e.g. knowing whether or not you are at risk for pregnancy), for Health Knowledge questions, participants who answered \"Unsure\" were grouped with those who answered incorrectly. Analysis of the qualitative data obtained from the free-response question was conducted by the primary investigator only, ensuring consistency in coding of participant themes.

This ranged This theme about assumption of sexual practices and desires was also noted by participants when seeking out contraceptives and family planning. When they sought out care for contraception, one participant noted that the provider \"assumed that I was a lesbian and told me that I didn't need birth control.\" Furthermore, another participant shared that they were \"turned towards sterilization\" when they requested IUDs or other birth control methods, since it was presumably assumed that they would never want to carry a pregnancy.

Some participants noted that they felt their provider was \"trying to be courteous, but just didn't know how to be,\" and others noted that their provider outright refused to use their preferred name or gender pronouns, even when asked to. Multiple participants described that their healthcare provider was culturally-sensitive and knowledgeable, but that their ancillary staff were not. Participants' experiences included having to out themselves in public waiting rooms when checking in, as front desk staff questioned their identity due to perceived mismatches when masculine-presenting patients provided identification with \"female-sounding\" names or gender markers. One participant shared their experience at a public STI/HIV testing clinic: \"There were two lines to wait, and the clerk pointed me to the male line so I went. When the doctor saw me and realized that I am trans, he took me by the shoulder and paraded me out to the female line. It was really humiliating. I did not go back for my results.\" Some participants noted that the physical environment was sometimes insufficient to care for transgender men, particularly in \"women's health\" centers. In one case, a participant shared their experience when they were referred to a diagnostic center for a transvaginal ultrasound: \"They only had women's restrooms, so the receptionist didn't know what to do with me\u2026 I had to \"out\" myself repeatedly in front of other patients.\" During an appointment for a transvaginal ultrasound, another participant shared that \"the ultrasound technician Undoubtedly, one of the most impactful portions of the study was the free-response section that allowed participants to share their experiences seeking reproductive healthcare and/or family planning. One theme elucidated here was that participants often felt their healthcare providers made assumptions about their sexual behavior and practices; most often, participants felt their providers assumed that they were heterosexual and did not want to bear Furthermore, participants noted that they often felt their providers lacked the knowledge necessary to care for transgender patients. This belief is supported by the low level of training most providers receive regarding LGBTQ healthcare. 32 This has enormous implications for transgender health, and make patients less likely to trust their providers as a knowledgeable source of information. Moreover, this was one the reasons participants noted that they were less likely to seek care in the first place. Finally, a significant portion of transgender patients had either received insensitive or discriminatory healthcare. This ranged from the refusal to use requested pronouns or names to outright refusal of providers to treat the participant due to their gender identity. These experiences undoubtedly contribute to a message that the healthcare setting is not welcoming of transgender patients, and result in patient harm. Participants noted numerous experiences where they self-treated serious medical conditions or skipped care entirely, resulting in poor health outcomes. Given these experiences with the healthcare community, where participants often find providers who are not knowledgeable about their healthcare needs, or a healthcare environment that is not culturally sensitive, it is no surprise that numerous participants noted either a fear of seeking care, or at the very least, a fear of disclosing their gender identity when seeking healthcare."}, {"section_title": "Strengths", "text": "The biggest strength of this study is that it is the first of its kind to assess the health knowledge and experiences of transgender men seeking reproductive healthcare and family planning.

Many of the participants noted that they felt their providers were not adequately trained to care for transgender patients, and that there were not enough resources for transgender men to learn about reproductive health or family planning on their own. This highlights a key future area for research-methods to improve both undergraduate and graduate medical education regarding transgender health, and to improve health education resources for transgender men. Education for providers should not just focus on clinical care guidelines, but education on cultural sensitivity (e.g. importance of using preferred pronouns, terminology). This education should extend to ancillary staff in healthcare settings, since they are often the first individuals patients interact with and set the tone for the office. Furthermore, the results of this study highlight that many transgender men want to have children, including children that are biologically related. However, most participants noted that they had not had discussions about fertility preservation prior to starting testosterone, and that their providers had not discussed family planning with them in general. Future studies should continue to assess the unique needs and barriers transgender men may have when seeking family planning services and seek to improve the number of transgender men who are informed about all of their options for family planning."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Transgender men in this study did not feel that their healthcare providers were knowledgeable about their reproductive health and family planning needs. Additionally, they often did not feel comfortable seeking reproductive healthcare, especially in settings traditionally designed for and/or marketed towards women (e.g. OB/GYN offices, 'Women's Health Centers'). As anticipated, comfort seeking care was improved for participants who primarily receive care in health centers that serve LGBTQ patients. Overall, participants had a high level of health literacy and were aware of their recommended reproductive health and family planning needs. Many participants experienced negative, insensitive, or discriminatory care at some point in their lives. As a result, some participants noted a fear of healthcare environments. These negative experiences included providers with inadequate knowledge, providers who refused to use requested names or pronouns, and those who refused to see transgender patients altogether. One of the most pervasive themes was that participants felt their healthcare providers made assumptions about their sexuality, sexual behaviors, and desire to have children. This has the potential to result in inadequate assessment of risk behaviors, and as a result, inadequate screening and care. Future research should focus on improving medical education regarding transgender health. This includes not just the clinical aspects (e.g. screening requirements, hormone therapy, etc.), but on cultural sensitivity and competency. Given that many transgender individuals have had deeply negative experiences with the healthcare environment, regaining trust with the community will require much more than just academic knowledge. As one participant so eloquently stated: \"'Understanding,' in a clinical sense, is not the same as treating me as a worthy human being.\""}]
