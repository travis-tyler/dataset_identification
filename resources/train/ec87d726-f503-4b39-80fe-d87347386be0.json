As populations age, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing dramatically. Currently, in the United States, 5.5 million people are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, with this number estimated to rise to 15 million by 2050 [1] .\nGiven the rising magnitude of this public health problem, educational materials that visualize the progressive impact of Alzheimer's disease would help patients, families, and medical practitioners understand the diagnosis and disease process. Computerized tomographic (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomographic (PET) scans are often used for such purpose but may be difficult for the non-radiologist to interpret. We believe three-dimensional anatomic models are ideal for education and counseling, enabling individuals to hold the Alzheimer's process in their hands, touching and visualizing its impact.\nAnatomically, Alzheimer's disease affects the cerebral cortex and mesial temporal lobe structures, most prominently the hippocampus. Reduced hippocampal volume as measured by MRI has been long recognized as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease [2] . Other radiologic biomarkers include amyloid-specific imaging (Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging), tau-PET imaging, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and measures of cortical thickness or brain volume [3] . We chose to build models that emphasized progressive loss of cortical and hippocampal volume. Modeling the hippocampus posed challenges because segmentation of this structure is difficult, and displaying its anatomy requires exposure of the deep mesial brain. In this article we outline a detailed workflow that allows construction of individualized, three-dimensional models of a normal brain and those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (Fig. 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selection of subjects Database", "text": "Subjects were drawn from the database of the Alzheimer's disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota [4] .

All T1-weighted MRI scans underwent correction for gradient non-linearity and intensity non-uniformity prior to being processed using the SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) unified segmentation and normalization algorithm [5, 6] . A custom template with six tissue classes was used for unified segmentation and normalization. The inverse warps created during normalization were used to back propagate regions of interest (ROIs) from a customized version of the automated anatomical labeling atlas into the native space of the original structural MRI [7] . The native space white matter and gray matter segmentations were combined and used as an inclusive brain tissue mask to extract the brain anatomy of interest from the preprocessed T1-weighted MRI in native space. The back propagated hippocampal ROI was then masked by the gray matter tissue segmentation to exclude voxels in the ROI that did not fall within segmented gray matter."}, {"section_title": "Manual segmentation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "File Transfer:", "text": "The auto-segmentations of the hippocampus, gray matter, and white matter were loaded as NIfTI files into 3D Slicer (https://www.slicer.org) [8] .\nThe software created Medical Reality Markup Language (MRML) and Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD) files as part of the segmentation process, which was completed by creating and exporting Standard Triangle Language (STL) files."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal segmentation assessment", "text": "Preliminary STL files of the auto-segmented hippocampus and combined gray and white matter were created and used for an initial test print.

Analysis of the digital 3D renderings Open black arrow shows extra pixels assigned to the dorsal hippocampus border in the auto-segmentation that are outside of hippocampus. Open red arrow shows the manual editing of the medial hippocampus border that included the subiculum and the segmented MRI images indicated that nodules were often due to the printing of \"stray\" aggregations of misassigned pixels in nearby grey matter structures, and ridges were due to incomplete or \"stray\" assignment along hippocampal borders (Fig. 2) . Likewise, the combined gray and white matter model included some surface irregularities, suggesting the need for further editing of the auto-segmentation."}, {"section_title": "Manual hippocampal segmentation editing", "text": "To correct for this loss of fidelity, a manual correction protocol was developed. Within 3D Slicer an individual hippocampus was displayed in three orthogonal planes with a sagittal plane along the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line, a coronal plane and an axial plane. The goal was to preserve the broad outlines of the auto-segmentation, but to improve the surface smoothness. The method used conformed to the guidelines outlined in the EADC-ADNI Harmonized Protocol for Manual Hippocampal Segmentation User Manual (HarP); however, in a deviation from the protocol, segmentation was initially performed in the sagittal plane (rather than the coronal plane) before further editing in the coronal and axial planes to check and refine the segmentation [10, 11] . Editing was done as follows:\nSeparating the amygdala from the hippocampal head A small band of white matter often demarcates the amygdala from the hippocampal head. Errors arose when auto-segmentation included pixels on the amygdala side of this band (Fig. 2) . This border was traced smoothly using the border of hippocampal grey matter with the white matter band. In doing this, portions of the alveus were likely eliminated; however, this technique resulted in satisfactory smoothing of hippocampal grey matter at the head of the hippocampus."}, {"section_title": "Smoothing the dorsal border of the hippocampal body", "text": "Frequent discontinuities arose along the dorsal margin of the auto-segmented hippocampal body (Fig. 2 ). These were often due to gaps along this border or to misassignment of areas suspected to be choroid plexus. Editing was performed initially in the sagittal plane with frequent re-evaluation in the coronal and axial planes. The fimbria was seen as an often ill-defined mixed intensity structure projecting dorsally above the medial body of the hippocampus (Fig. 3) . At one millimeter pixel resolution this structure could not be smoothly segmented and was eliminated. In this process, editing decisions were made pixel-by-pixel at one millimeter pixel resolution. Smoothness and sharp changes in intensity values were employed as criteria in decisionmaking using subjective optimization (Fig. 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Editing of the medial border", "text": "The edge of the subiculum and the lateral ventricle offers a smooth, high contrast border for segmenting.

At the resolution of 1 cubic millimeter its margins could not be smoothly segmented, and it was excluded from the manual segmentation\nDefining the rostral border of the hippocampus\nManual editing was continued to the trigone of the lateral ventricle where the hippocampus is abutted by and distinguishable from the indusium griseum. 3D renderings of the hippocampus were examined and compared to the initial auto-segmentation. Manual editing resulted in smoother renderings, predominately along the dorsal margins of the hippocampus, and more accurate division of the hippocampus from the amygdala (Fig. 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Manual editing of the cerebral cortex", "text": "Editing the cortical surface Spikes, protrusions, and various structures inconsistent with a smooth cortical surface were frequently included in the gray matter auto-segmentation.

The cloudiness of the semi-transparent material available for printing and the distortion of light caused by the curvature of the brain surface prevent meaningful visualization of the hippocampus when printed fully embedded within the rest of the gray and white matter. To address this, a cutting plane was defined parallel to the long axis of the hippocampi and used to divide the brain into dorsal and ventral sections that could be separated to reveal the hippocampus (Fig. 6 ). Another plane defined by the midline of the brain was used to split the model into left and right hemispheres, resulting in a total of four brain quadrants, with left and right hippocampus permanently affixed to the corresponding ventral quadrant."}, {"section_title": "Inserting holes for magnets", "text": "Holes were created for magnets that would hold the printed brain quadrants together but allow easy disassembly for viewing the hippocampus (Fig. 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Creating supports", "text": "Small supports were added as needed to reinforce the tip of the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and fragile areas of the cortex."}, {"section_title": "Labeling", "text": "An inconspicuous label was placed on the posterior side of the brain stem of each model.

To allow better visualization of the hippocampus within the whole brain, VeroClear, which is semi-transparent, was used for the surrounding brain tissue. The print time for a model was 15-20 h depending on brain volume."}, {"section_title": "Post-processing", "text": "The models were separated from the support material using small picks, a power washer, and a lye bath.

The anatomic position of the hippocampus and its complex anatomy are easily appreciated by viewing the opaque hippocampus through the semi-transparent media and breaking the model apart to see the hippocampus exposed within the brain. Hippocampal atrophy is evident with advancing disease and age.\nThe manually segmented models were consistently lower in volume than the auto-segmented models (confidence interval = [\u22121452-2229], p = 2.0 \u00d7 10\n), reflecting the fact that editing for smoothness removes many more pixels than it adds. The computed values of the two methods were significantly correlated (rho = .85, p = .002) (Fig. 12) . The manually segmented volumes appeared to decline more with advancing Alzheimer's disease severity, than did the auto-segmented volumes.\nEach model takes approximately 25-35 h for segmentation and CAD work.

When 3D-printed models were used during consultation for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, the patients' parents and the cardiologists both rated the usefulness of the models very highly and believed they improved communication during the consultation [12] .\nIn a double blind trial of undergraduate medical students, 3D models of cardiac anatomy resulted in higher test scores than cadaveric learning [13] . It is anticipated Fig. 7 Hippocampus STL files and 3D-printed models. Row a: Hippocampal STL files are displayed with increasing disease severity from normal to severe Alzheimer's disease moving from left to right. Row b: Final printed models corresponding to the normal hippocampus and three stages of Alzheimer's disease severity and displayed on custom printed stands. Hippocampal size declines with both age and Alzheimer's disease severity, and the models clearly demonstrate these effects. Radiologically severe model not available for photo that these brain models would also serve well as educational aids in a variety of settings including individual patient and family education, medical or neurologic training, patient advocacy or support groups, and public health policy or governmental forums. We believe that holding the models and viewing them will help patients and family members understand Alzheimer's disease as a tangible physical process and lessen the fear, mystery, and shame often associated with the diagnosis. Construction of these models entails a high investment in editing time, but once created they can be a permanent educational resource.\nLimitations of our approach are acknowledged. These models are intended to be useful for demonstration and not diagnosis. Hippocampal volumes resulting from our While it is reassuring that our hippocampal models have computed volumes that clearly decline with increasing Alzheimer's disease severity, validation would require comparison of our computed volumes with volumes of pathologically dissected specimens and reliability testing would require comparison of volumes determined by multiple operators. Manual hippocampal segmentation has been shown to be as or more reliable than auto-segmentation algorithms; however, our protocol of editing auto-segmented files for smoothness would need validation with a large number of patients and controls, and work-intensive manual segmentation is impractical on a large scale [14] . Also, our present models do not clearly display changes in cortical thickness that may represent an important pathology of Alzheimer's disease [15] . Finally, our models do not portray other important changes in Alzheimer's disease such as the distribution of amyloid and tau or altered functional activity of the cerebral cortex.\nFuture directions in the three-dimensional modeling of Alzheimer's disease will aim at addressing these limitations. Automated segmentation could be performed with impartial mathematical smoothing of atlas-based algorithms or with algorithms based on shape. Such algorithms have the potential to produce smooth models without time-consuming manual editing. A large number of representative brains could be run through the algorithm to establish age-corrected, disease-specific biomarkers that could be compared to other validated automated procedures. Models with diagnostic importance could then be produced on a patient-by-patient basis. Rigid cortical models could be developed that would allow elimination of white matter with printing, thus allowing better appreciation of cortical thinning and improved visualization of the hippocampus in the brain. We are currently planning the mapping of PiB-PET imaging, Tau-PET-imaging and FDG-PET imaging onto our current brain models to demonstrate additional biomarkers for educational purposes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The rising epidemic of Alzheimer's disease requires educational materials that will increase awareness, facilitate understanding, and stimulate action.
