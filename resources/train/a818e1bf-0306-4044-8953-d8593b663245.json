[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The relationship between exercise and subcortical gray matter volume is not well understood in the elderly population, although reports indicate that exercise may prevent cortical gray matter atrophy. To elucidate this association in the elderly, we measured subcortical gray matter volume and correlated this with volumes to exercise habits in a community-based cohort study in Japan. Methods: Subjects without mild cognitive impairment or dementia (n = 280, 35% male, mean age 73.1 \u00b1 5.9 years) were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), an exercise habit questionnaire, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Subcortical gray matter volume was compared between groups based on the presence/absence of exercise habits. The MMSE was re-administered 3 years after the baseline examination. Results: Ninety-one subjects (32.5%) reported exercise habits (exercise group), and 189 subjects (67.5%) reported no exercise habits (non-exercise group). Volumetric analysis revealed that the volumes in the exercise group were greater in the left hippocampus (p = 0.042) and bilateral nucleus accumbens (left, p = 0.047; right, p = 0.007) compared to those of the non-exercise group. Among the 195 subjects who received a follow-up MMSE examination, the normalized intra-cranial volumes of the left nucleus accumbens (p = 0.004) and right amygdala (p = 0.014)showed significant association with a decline in the follow-up MMSE score. Conclusion: Subjects with exercise habits show larger subcortical gray matter volumes than subjects without exercise habits in community-dwelling elderly subjects in Japan. Specifically, the volume of the nucleus accumbens correlates with both exercise habits and cognitive preservation."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Exercise and/or physical fitness may be protective against the development of dementia. A number of studies that examined the effects of exercise in elderly people with or without dementia have been summarized by meta-analyses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . These meta-analyses showed that aerobic exercise training is associated with modest improvements in cognitive function such as attention, processing speed, executive function and memory. Based on studies using animal models and human subjects, several hypotheses have been proposed to describe the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition; these include a reduction in oxidative stress [6] , an increase in growth factor levels (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor) [7] [8] [9] [10] , and reduced levels of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), a key pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [11] .\nIn regard to brain volume, several studies of elderly subjects revealed that exercise intervention for 6 to 12 months increased gray matter volumes in the hippocampus and the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices [7, 8, 12] .

For each subject, the subcortical gray matter volumes were divided by the intra-cranial volume (ICV) for normalization to the individual's head size.

Multiple regression analyses, including age, sex and education level as covariates, were used to examine the effects of exercise habits on the ICV-normalized subcortical gray matter volumes, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in MMSE score (\u0394MMSE) and subcortical gray matter volumes. The \u0394MMSE value was obtained by subtracting the baseline MMSE score from the follow-up MMSE score. Also, medical history or demographics variables that showed a tendency toward significance (p b 0.05) in the univariate analysis were entered as explanatory variables in the logistic regression model.

(1) Although there was no difference in the baseline MMSE score between the exercise group and the non-exercise group, the follow-up MMSE score only showed a decline in the non-exercise group. (2) At baseline, the ICV-normalized volumes of the left hippocampus and bilateral nucleus accumbens were significantly larger in the exercise group compared to the non-exercise group. (3) Both the left nucleus accumbens and the right amygdala were shown to be associated with cognitive decline.\nSimilar to previous reports [1] [2] [3] [4] , our study suggests that exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function in elderly subjects. Given that we did not obtain detailed information, such as the subjects' level of physical fitness, type, frequency, or intensity of the exercise performed, our findings regarding the effects of exercise habits on cognition may seem limited. However, the MMSE score was maintained over time and did not show a decline in the exercise group. Therefore, good exercise habits may exert a positive and meaningful effect on cognitive function despite variations in the details of the specific exercises performed.\nThe exercise group had larger subcortical gray matter volumes at baseline. There are only a few reports on the relationship between exercise and subcortical gray matter volume. Two reports have shown that physical fitness is positively correlated with subcortical gray matter volumes, specifically, the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens in elderly subjects [25] and the dorsal striatum in children [26] . Similar to previous studies, we found a relationship between good exercise habits and subcortical gray matter volumes. In particular, the bilateral volume of the nucleus accumbens was larger in the exercise group. Our results also suggest that a larger nucleus accumbens volume may prevent future cognitive decline in healthy elderly individuals.\nThe nucleus accumbens receives information from a variety of systems, such as the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, which are associated with information processing, reward value, selective attention, and flexibility [27, 28] . Recent studies have reported on the role of the nucleus accumbens in dementia and MCI. For example, cross-sectional studies showed that the MMSE score is related to the volume of the nucleus accumbens in patients with AD [29] , and that the nucleus accumbens volume is smaller in subjects with MCI than in subjects with normal cognition [30] . Furthermore, longitudinal studies showed that the nucleus accumbens is reduced in size when examined several years after the development of AD in comparison to its size prior to the onset of AD [31, 32] . The nucleus accumbens is also significantly smaller in patients with stable or progressive MCI than in healthy controls [33] . Yi et al. reported that a smaller nucleus accumbens volume is associated with an increased risk of progression from MCI to AD, as evidenced by Cox proportional hazards analysis [30] . Combined, these studies demonstrate an association between the volume of the nucleus accumbens and cognitive function or cognitive decline in patients with MCI as well as AD.\nOur present study suggests that nucleus accumbens volume may correlate with cognition in elderly subjects, even if cognitive function is normal (i.e., in the absence of dementia or MCI). The MR images were acquired cross-sectionally in this study, therefore, it is unclear whether the small brain volumes observed are indicative of brain atrophy. If it is assumed that small brain volumes are related to brain atrophy in elderly subjects, the small volume of the nucleus accumbens may indicate that atrophy of this region occurs prior to the observance of MCI.\nWe analyzed our data using a validated automated algorithm. We attempted to further increase the accuracy of our analyses by examining each MR image and excluding those with artifacts, large white matter lesions, or structural changes (e.g., micro-cerebral infarction). In general, it is difficult to determine whether a reduced nucleus accumbens is due to age or pathological changes [34] . However, this study was designed to eliminate the influence of age.\nThe study design did not, however, elucidate a causal relationship, and it remains unclear whether exercise itself protected the volume of the nucleus accumbens or if subjects with greater nucleus accumbens volume tended to maintain exercise later in life.
