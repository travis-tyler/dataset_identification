[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Traditionally, it is thought that sea level rose 3-5 m over the last 5 ka along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (Curray 1960;Shepard 1963;Nelson and Bray 1970;Frazier 1974;T\u00f6rnqvist et al. 2004;Simms et al. 2007;Milliken et al. 2008). However, some have argued for a mid-Holocene highstand around 5 ka along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (Behrens 1966a;Tanner et al. 1989;Morton et al. 2000a;Blum et al. 2001;McBride et al. 2007). Behrens (1966a) found a beach deposit about 160 km south of the USA-Mexico border dated at around 2000 14 C years at an elevation of 4 m above present sea level. However, he was never able to rule out tectonic uplift. Tanner et al. (1989) suggested two mid-Holocene highstands of about +1 m in the eastern Gulf of Mexico along the Florida Coast based on the elevation of several series of prograding beach ridges. However, more recent work does not support a mid-Holocene highstand on the basis of the elevation of freshwater and brackish-water peat and oysters in Florida (Wright et al. 2005). Morton et al. (2000a) and Blum et al. (2001) support a mid-Holocene highstand of +2 m around 5 ka in Texas on the basis of elevated beach ridges and spits, marshes, subtidal flats, and wave-cut features. However, the interpretation of these features and their relationship to paleo-sea level has been challenged by some workers (Otvos 2001(Otvos , 2004Rodriguez et al. 2004;Rodriguez and Meyer 2006;Donnelly and Giosan 2008), with Donnelly and Giosan (2008) suggesting that the elevated beach ridges represent increased storm activity rather than higher-than-present sea level. Although higher-than-present mid-Holocene highstands have been well documented in other locations, particularly within equatorial and midsouthern-latitude regions such as Queensland, Australia (Chappell 1983), Western Australia (Coshell and Rosen 1994), Kyushu, Japan (Yokoyama et al. 1996), the Cocos Islands (Woodroffe et al. 1999), French Polynesia (Pirazzoli and Montaggioni 1988), Southern Brazil (Angulo et al. 1999), and southern Thailand (Scoffin and Tissier 1998), their presence in North America north of the USA-Mexico border remains controversial. The presence of a mid-Holocene highstand has been used to argue for a major readvance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last two to four thousand years (Goodwin 1998;Morton et al. 2000a;Blum et al. 2003). However, many authors have offered glacio-hydro-isostatic explanations for mid-Holocene highstands that do not require an increase in ice volume over the last 3-5 ka (Clark et al. 1978;Mitrovica and Peltier 1991;Johnson 1993;Mitrovica and Milne 2002;Milne et al. 2005). The cause for mid-Holocene highstands in equatorial regions has been linked to two processes: ''equatorial siphoning'' (e.g., Mitrovica and Peltier 1991) and ''continental levering'' (e.g., Nakada and Lambeck 1989). Equatorial siphoning is the process by which water in equatorial regions is ''flowing'' to the collapsing forebulge created by the wasting of the Last Glacial Maximum ice sheets. Continental levering is the process by which adjacent continental areas are tilted up due to the load of water on the ocean basins and shelves. However, a mid-Holocene highstand within the Gulf of Mexico is not expected according to current glacio-isostatic models of the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Simms et al. 2007) and would require an amount of ice-volume buildup that overwhelms the depression caused by the movement of mantle material out of the Gulf of Mexico and into rebounding regions such as the Canadian Shield. A mid-Holocene highstand within the Gulf of Mexico would require a reevaluation of current glacio-hydro-isostatic models, global meltwater volumes delivered to the oceans through the Holocene, and/or our current understanding of the rheological properties of the Earth. Isolated lake basins and ponds have been used in many locations for developing sea-level curves or placing other constraints on sea level (e.g., Coshell and Rosen 1994;Zwartz et al. 1998;Long et al. 1999;Bentley et al. 2005;Compton 2007). However, to date few have applied this methodology to the sea-level history of the Gulf of Mexico. One reason for the absence of such studies could be the rapid rate of shoreline retreat experienced by many bays along the Gulf Coast (Morton and Paine 1984). Rapid rates of shoreline retreat would destroy older ponds, making this methodology of sea-level reconstruction questionable. However, Baffin Bay, Texas, is the one bay in the region not experiencing high rates of bayshore erosion with modern average retreat rates of less than 0.03 m/ yr (Gibeaut and Tremblay 2003). This is most likely due to the alignment of the bay oblique to the two prevailing wind directions and the cementing of beach rock along some of its shores (Behrens 1963). As a result of these factors, the bay has retained its dendritic shape characteristic of a flooded valley (Behrens 1963). The purpose of this paper is to revisit the mid-Holocene highstand problem within the northwestern Gulf of Mexico by examining the evolution of shallow coastal ponds on the southern margin of Baffin Bay, Texas. In addition to testing a higher-than-present mid-Holocene highstand within the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, we also provide an evolutionary model for the development of these ponds illustrating the important interaction between eolian and estuarine processes."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Location and Setting", "text": "Baffin Bay, Texas, is located along the south Texas coast approximately 50 km south of the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, and 150 km north of the USA-Mexico border (Fig. 1). The passive central Texas coast is subsiding very slowly at an average rate of 0.05 cm/yr (Paine 1993). Baffin Bay is surrounded by a large dune field, particularly along its southern and northeastern margins ( Fig. 1). Price (1958) discusses the different types of dunes present within this erg, two of which can be found in the study area: banner complexes and conical dune fields. The erg and surrounding areas are populated by hundreds of small ponds (Fig. 1). Many of the coastal ponds were formed by the flooding and subsequent closure of tributary valleys of the main valley that flooded to form Baffin Bay or by the isolation of an arm of the bay via spit formation (Behrens and Frishman 1971). In this study we focus on coastal ponds and lagoons that appear not to have formed as flooded tributary valleys."}, {"section_title": "Climate", "text": "The Baffin Bay, Texas, region is located within a semiarid climate that receives 71 cm/year of precipitation (White et al. 1989after Brown et al. 1977. Evaporation exceeds precipitation by 56 cm/year (White et al. 1989). As a result, salinities within Baffin Bay range from 40 to 80 ppt FIG. 1.-Aerial photographs of the study area and location of the cores taken in Baffin Bay (aerial photography courtesy of the Texas Natural Resources Information System, TNRIS). (Behrens 1966b). The hypersaline conditions and low fluvial input have resulted in a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate depositional system within Baffin Bay (Dalrymple 1964;Behrens and Land 1972;Alaniz and Goodwin 1974;Land et al. 1979). One of the more common carbonate components of this mixed siliciclastic system is carbonate sands-mostly shell fragments. The sands along the southern margin of Baffin Bay adjacent to the ponds of interest in this study are composed largely of these carbonate grains (Dalrymple 1964). The Texas coast is classified as a storm-dominated coast. Hurricanes strike the coast on average every 1.5 years, generally during the late summer and early fall (Hayes 1967). These storms play an important role on the sedimentology of the bays and estuaries (Snedden et al. 1988). In addition, winds play the dominant role in producing oscillating water levels inasmuch as daily astronomical tidal range is on the order of 0.1 m with monthly astronomical tidal range on the order of 0.3 m (www. tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). The predominant wind direction for the Texas coast is from the southeast, with winter storms occasionally switching the wind direction around from the northwest (Lohse 1956). Due to the strong winds and semiarid climate, eolian transport is important in the delivery of sediment to the coastal environments of south Texas (Morton et al. 2000b)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We collected eleven vibracores from seven ponds, labeled A-G from west to east, along the southern shores of Baffin Bay. The sediment floors of these ponds range in elevation between 20.8 m and +0.8 m relative to modern sea level (Table 1). Currently, three of these ponds are freshwater (B, C, and E) and four are brackish to hypersaline (A, D, F, G). All seven ponds sampled are located within 1 km of Baffin Bay (Fig. 2). These pond cores were supplemented by two additional cores from Baffin Bay proper (in Cayo del Grullo, Fig. 1) that sample a facies that is very similar to one of the facies found in the cores from the ponds. Cores were split, photographed, and described in the laboratory at Oklahoma State University. Grain size was analyzed every 15-20 cm using a CILAS 1180L laser particle-size analyzer. Samples were soaked overnight in a mild detergent solution in order to disassociate the clay-size particles. Samples were also sieved with a 63 micron mesh, and the coarse fraction was analyzed for shell material, presence of forams and ostracodes, and mineralogy of the sand-size fraction. The % carbonate was determined for the sand-size component (. 63 microns) by measuring the weight before and after treatment with a 20% solution of HCl. At least 100 grains of the remaining sand-size fraction after treatment with HCl were counted to determine whether they were lithic, quartz, or gypsum in composition. Shells and wood fragments were sent to the University of Tokyo (Matsuzaki et al. 2007;Yokoyama et al. 2007) and Beta Analytical for radiocarbon dating. Elevation transects were constructed from contemporaneous bay level using a laser level and an 8 m section of rope or tape measure. Later, the relative elevations were corrected for local tides using NOAA tide gauge records from Baffin Bay and converted to mean sea level referenced to NAVD88. Aerial photos were also examined, and all data were spatially referenced using ArcMap."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Facies", "text": "A total of six facies were identified in the cores taken in the shallow ponds. In addition, two other facies were identified in cores from nearby Baffin Bay. Facies 1.-This facies is a dark-greenish-gray (4/10Y) silt to sandy silt. It contains an abundance of organic material, including algal mats ( Fig. 3) and shell material-mostly Mulinia lateralis and Anomalocardia cuneimeris. The sand-size fraction is greater than 50% carbonate ( Fig. 4), most of which is shell fragments. Interpretation: For the upland areas south of Baffin Bay, the only source of carbonate sand is from the bay. As a result, the percentage of carbonate can be used as a proxy for marine or estuarine influence in the ponds. The large percentage of carbonate in this facies suggests a good connection with the bay. Based on this and its present location, this unit is interpreted to represent a shallow lagoon with an open connection to Baffin Bay. It is interpreted to represent a subtidal to intertidal environment. Facies 2.-This facies is a greenish-gray (5/10Y) sandy mud (F2a) or muddy sand (F2b). It contains gypsum layers and an occasional sand-filled burrow (Fig. 3). The sand-size component contains approximately 20% gypsum grains ( Fig. 4) and approximately 10% carbonate sand grains. An articulated Anomalocardia cuneimeris, a mollusk that inhabits hypersaline lagoons, as well as foraminifera, were also found in this facies. Interpretation: Similar to Facies 1, the only source of carbonate sand in this area is from Baffin Bay. Thus, this environment must have a ready connection to the bay. This unit is interpreted to represent a more landward shallow lagoon environment with an open to intermittent connection with Baffin Bay and represents a subtidal to intertidal environment. This interpretation is based on the estuarine fauna, foraminifera, and abundance of carbonate sands. Facies 3.-This facies is a dark greenish gray (4.5/5GY) sandy mudmuddy sand with higher percentages of sand (generally . 25%) than Facies 1 and 2a (Figs. 3,5). The sand-size component contains carbonate grains, usually constituting more than 5% of the . 63 micron fraction. Facies 3a is generally massive without laminations and contains carbonate sand throughout, while Facies 3b contains laminations (, 1 cm) of cleaner sand that contain carbonate grains. The finergrained material between the laminations is devoid of carbonate grains. Facies 3b often grades upward into Facies 3a. This facies also contains wood and other plant fragments. Interpretation: This unit is interpreted to represent a proximal shallow pond and/or tidal flat without an open connection with Baffin Bay. The only connection comes with storm washover. It is thought to represent an intertidal to supratidal environment. This interpretation is based on the mineralogy of the sand-size fraction of the fine-grained material in Facies F3b, which is almost exclusively quartz in composition, suggesting a source from wind-blown terrestrial locations (the nearby dune fields). The only exceptions are high tides or storms that deliver carbonate material from Baffin Bay. Facies 4.-This facies is a dark greenish gray (4.5/10Y) sandy mudmuddy sand without discrete sand layers (Fig. 6). It contains ostracodes, crab remains, and a few gastropods. In addition, a few small ,4 mm carbonate nodules are found in this facies. Carbonate grains compose less than 3% of the total sand-size fraction (Fig. 4). Foraminifera are absent. Gypsum is also absent in this facies. This unit also has a ''hackly'' appearance ( Fig. 3). Interpretation: Based on the absence of marine fauna, carbonate grains and gypsum, as well as the prevalence of quartz in the sand-size fraction, this unit is interpreted to represent a shallow pond without an open connection with Baffin Bay. It is thought to represent a supratidal environment. Due to the preservation of ostracodes and a gastropod, we feel that the decrease in carbonate material is a result of original depositional conditions and not dissolution of the carbonate after deposition. Facies 5.-This unit is a very dark gray (3/N) organic-rich clayey-sandy silt. It contains roots and crab remains (Figs. 3,6). Its lower boundary is generally gradational with Facies 6. The material from which the age was obtained was found in a burrow filled with sediments identical in character (e.g., color, grain size) to F5 and thus is interpreted to represent the age of unit F5. Interpretation: This unit is interpreted to represent a freshwater palustrine unit with no connection to Baffin Bay and lies above sea level. This interpretation is based on the absence of shell material (except in pond C), foraminifera, and carbonate and gypsum sand-size material (, 1%). In addition, this facies is found in the surface deposits of ponds C and E. Facies 6.-This unit is a mottled light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/2.5) sandy silt-sandy mud with large charred organic nodules and carbonate nodules (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Three attempts on separate samples were made to radiocarbon date the charred nodules, thinking that they were charcoal. However, in each case, we failed to recover enough organic material for AMS analysis. Upon further examination, they lacked a distinctive woody texture but appeared to represent asphalt. However, treatment with benzene and dichloromethane failed to dissolve the material. In addition, an attempt to date the remains of a gastropod failed to recover enough graphite for radiocarbon analysis. The unit also has a higher shear strength than any of the other units. Interpretation: Based on high shear strength, prevalence and size (. 5 cm) of carbonate nodules, and degraded nature of organic material, this unit is interpreted to represent underlying Pleistocene depositspossibly the Beaumont Formation. Facies 7.-This unit, composed of a tan clean to muddy sandy shell hash, was found only in the core taken from a modern spit and the beaches of Baffin Bay. Interpretation: Based on its relatively coarse grain size, the fragmented nature of the shell material, and its present location, this unit is interpreted to represent a beach or spit deposit. Facies 8.-This unit, composed of a dark gray to greenish gray (4/10Y) sandy-clayey silt (. 60% silt), was found only in the cores from Baffin Bay, with the exception of a stiff unit in the base (21.4 to 21.78 m bsl) of the core from pond A (LPR08-04; Fig. 5). The unit was further subdivided by Aryal (2007) into four subunits. This unit ranges from laminated to homogeneous and contains articulated as well as broken mollusk shells (Mulinia lateralis, Nuculana acuta, Chione cancellata, and Anomalocardia cuneimeris). Its coarse fraction (. 63 microns) contains minor amounts of quartz sand and foraminifera. Interpretation: Based on its fauna and present location in cores from Baffin Bay, this unit is interpreted to represent open-bay to upper-bay environments."}, {"section_title": "Facies Contacts", "text": "The contact between Facies 6 and the overlying facies (F5 or F3) was marked by either an irregular sharp contact or a gradational contact. The sharp contact was found where the facies succession contained F3 overlying F6 (e.g., core LPR07-01; Fig. 3) and the gradational contact was found where F5 was found overlying F6 (e.g., core KR06-03 in Fig. 3). In core LPR07-02, the contact between F5 and F6 is gradational, giving the appearance of a soil horizon (Fig. 3). In addition, this gradational contact contains preserved roots (Fig. 3). Cut surfaces within the core break into 1 cm clumps, giving its surface a ''hackly'' appearance, possibly representing a weakly developed version of the ''crumb texture'' of Retallack (1988). The clumps have a weakly developed clay coating when cut under a binocular microscope. The gradational contact between F5 and F6 is accompanied by a generally lighter color with depth, suggesting decreasing organic material with depth (e.g., core KR06-03, Fig. 3). Carbonate nodules are also found in F6 beneath F5 and within F4. Retallack (1988) suggests three keys for identifying paleosols: (1) soil horizons, (2) traces of life or root casts, and (3) soil structure. Inasmuch as the gradational contact between Facies 5 and 6 had indications of all three of these keys, we interpret this gradational contact to represent a weakly developed paleosol (or modern soil in the cases where F5 is at the surface). A similar but more weakly developed interpreted paleosol is found in a 20-cm-thick unit of F4 in core KR06-01 separating a few centimeters of F3 from the underlying F6 (Fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Elevations", "text": "Each pond is separated from Baffin Bay by a low-elevation sill at least 30-50 m wide composed of a stiff sandy clayey silt with extensive carbonate nodules or a shelly sand. A summary of the elevations of the sedimentary floors and sill heights of the ponds after correcting local water levels to mean sea level is given in Table 1. Deposits from the floor of pond E (Facies 5) are found at elevations between +1.4 and +0.7 m. Deposits from the floor of pond D (Facies 3) are found between elevations of 20.8 m and +1.0 m. Deposits like those at the bottom of pond G (Facies 1) are found at elevations ranging from 20.1 m to the depth of the pond at approximately 20.5 m, although the deepest portions of pond G were never surveyed."}, {"section_title": "Baffin Bay Cores", "text": "Two additional cores taken from nearby Baffin Bay and one of its tributary bays sample a facies very similar to Facies 1 at depths of 6.7 m (8.0 mbsl) in BB06-02 and 1.1 m in BB07-02 ( Figs. 7, 8). Both intervals contain algal mats. The algal mats consist of very fine-grained (clay or silt) laminae a few millimeters thick alternating with a 1-2 mm thick mat of green to brown organic material similar in structure to the ''algallaminated sediments'' described by Davies (1970) in the sheltered portions of Shark Bay, Australia. Radiocarbon ages obtained from the organic fraction of the algal mats yielded calibrated ages of 5560-5480 and 665-540 cal years, respectively (Table 2). In addition, another radiocarbon age obtained from an articulated mollusk located 2 cm above the algal mat in core BB07-02 yielded a 14 C age 70 years younger than that of the algal mat (Table 2). This increased our confidence that the carbon fractionation of the algal mats was similar to that of the mollusks."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pond Types", "text": "Based on the aerial photography coupled with the core tops from these seven ponds, we suggest the presence of three categories of ponds: (1) terrestrial pond, (2) coastal pond, and (3) lagoon. The terrestrial pond is represented by ponds C and E. The core tops from these ponds contain Facies 5. The coastal pond is represented by ponds A, B, D, and F. The core tops from these ponds contain Facies 3. The lagoon or the ''windtidal flat'' of Scott and Hayes (1964) is represented by pond G. The coretop of this pond contains Facies 1."}, {"section_title": "Radiocarbon Reservoir", "text": "A key element in establishing a robust chronology from the radiometric dating of mollusk shells is an understanding of the radiocarbon reservoir effect for the local estuary or coastal system. The radiocarbon reservoir for many areas along the Texas coast has been established by the 14 C dating of paired mollusk and plant material from the same horizon (e.g., Aten 1983). In order to place some constraint on the radiocarbon reservoir for these shallow ponds, we obtained an optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) age from a deposit 6 cm above a radiocarbon age. The OSL age obtained was 1710 6 110. We compared this OSL age to the calibrated radiocarbon age (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993;Reimer et al. 2004) given four different radiocarbon reservoir scenarios: (1) no J S R radiocarbon reservoir, (2) a 760 year radiocarbon reservoir (the one determined from the nearest Texas estuary-Corpus Christi Bay, 50 km to the north (Simms et al. 2007), (3) the nominal 440 year northern hemisphere marine reservoir of Calib 5.0 (Hughen et al. 2004), and (4) a mixed northern hemisphere marine and atmospheric curves (50-50) of Calib 5.0 (Reimer et al. 2004;Hughen et al. 2004). A comparison between the OSL and calibrated 14 C ages with the four different reservoir scenarios is presented in Figure 9. Taking into account that the 14 C age was obtained from a depth 6 cm below the OSL age, the reservoir scenario that best fits the available OSL age is a mixed northern hemisphere marine and atmosphere curve (Fig. 9). Although the radiocarbon reservoir may vary with time and species, this was the best available estimate. This reservoir was applied to all mollusks and algal mats. The crab pincers and wood fragments were calibrated using the standard northern hemisphere atmospheric calibration curve of Calib 5.0 (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993;Reimer et al. 2004). "}, {"section_title": "Pond Evolution", "text": "Cores from terrestrial ponds (C and E) contain only terrestrial pond or Pleistocene deposits (Facies 5 and 6; Fig. 6). Cores from coastal ponds (A, B, D, and F) contain terrestrial and/or Pleistocene deposits (Facies 5 and/or 6) overlain by coastal pond deposits (Facies 3;Figs. 5,6). A core from the lagoon (pond G) contains Pleistocene (Facies 6) at the base overlain by terrestrial pond deposits (Facies 4), coastal pond deposits (Facies 3), and lagoon deposits (Facies 2 and Facies 1; Fig. 4). The succession of facies in pond G suggests that it evolved from a terrestrial pond to a coastal pond sometime after 5570-5310 cal years BP, and subsequently to a lagoon shortly before 4610-4410 cal years BP. Similarly, Facies 5 found beneath Facies 3 in pond B suggests that its environment was similar to pond E until at least 210 years ago (core LPR07-02, Fig. 6). From the succession of facies in these seven ponds, as well as observations from aerial photos, an evolutionary model for these ponds is suggested (Fig. 10). Stage 1, represented by the terrestrial ponds C and E and Facies 5, represents a pond formed by deflation from eolian processes or as an interdune low area as described by Price (1958). Price (1958) suggests two types of dune fields in the study area. One is the ''banner complex''; inactive banner complexes are present beneath the area of ponds E, F, and G (Fig. 11). The other is a ''conical'' or dome dune field, in which pond water collects in the subtle swales between the low-relief dunes; a conical dune field is present beneath ponds A, B, C, and D (Price 1958). During this stage a paleosol and/or freshwater pond forms. During Stage 2, represented by the coastal ponds A, B, D, and F and Facies 3, the pond has intermittent connection with Baffin Bay-probably during storms or other high-water events. Gullies eroding headward through the banks of Baffin Bay provide a connection between the pond and the bay during these storm events (Fig. 12). Storm surges most likely erode the underlying freshwater pond deposits, as evidenced by the erosional surface at the base of Facies 3 in most cases (e.g., core LPR07-01; Fig. 3). By Stage 3, represented by pond G and Facies 1 and 2, the pond has an open connection with the bay via a small tidal inlet as shown by Scott and Hayes (1964). During times of inlet closure or drier climates, Facies 2 is deposited and during times of frequent exchange of waters with the bay or wetter climates similar to the present conditions, Facies 1 is deposited. Our proposed model of lagoon development is similar to that of Dix et al. (1999) and Buynevich and Fitzgerald (2003). The difference is that the establishment of the coastal lagoon was not created by a constructional phase (e.g., the development of a bar; Dix et al. 1999), but by an erosional phase. Unlike other coastal lagoons that were created by the isolation of an arm of the bay or marine environment by a welded barrier (e.g., Eckstein 1970), the marine environment here is encroaching on an otherwise terrestrial or lacustrine system."}, {"section_title": "Mid-Holocene Highstand in the Baffin Bay Region", "text": "Five observations are difficult to reconcile with a higher-than-present mid-Holocene highstand in the Baffin Bay region. A graphical summary of four of these arguments is illustrated in Figure 13. The sedimentary facies from cores in ponds A, B, C, D, E, and F provide no evidence for marine inundation or environments that were deeper (e.g., Facies 1, 2, 7, or 8) than they are presently. The only exception to this is a stiff undated estuarine deposit beneath Facies 6 (the interpreted Pleistocene) in core LPR08-04 from pond A (Fig. 6). It may represent estuarine deposits from an earlier depositional cycle or suggest an early origin to pond A similar to that described by Behrens and Frishman (1971). Regardless of its age (Pleistocene versus Holocene) or origin the elevation of the unit is 21.4 m (below present) and does not support a mid-Holocene highstand. Thus we find no evidence for sea levels above the ponds' sill heights of +0.8 m, +1.3 m, +0.9 m, +1.0 m, +1.9 m, and +0.4 m, respectively. Dates from these deposits indicate that sea level did not reach near present levels until after 3240-3440 cal years. An age date obtained from a crab pincer in Facies 4 of core KR06-01 in pond G suggests that sea-level elevations did not reach above 21.2 m until after 5660-5480 cal years BP. A coastal pond did not form at an elevation at or above 21.0 until sometime around 4610-4410 cal years. An age of 5660-5480 cal years at a depth of 21.1 m in core KR06-01 is in agreement with accumulation rates found in equivalent environments in adjacent Laguna Madre (Morton et al. 2000b). The sequence of facies in core KR06-01 over the last 5.6 ka is that of a transgressing system, not a regressive system as would be expected if sea levels were falling from a mid-Holocene highstand. The presence of a preserved paleosol in core LPR07-02 from pond B suggests a supratidal environment until at least 210 cal years BP. Thus sea levels higher than +0.4 m prior to 210 cal years BP are highly unlikely. Two additional dates were obtained from algal mats in the cores taken in Cayo del Grullo at the northwestern end of Baffin Bay (Figs. 1, 7, 8). Algal mats are generally thought to inhabit the intertidal to supratidal zone (e.g., Davies 1970), but their exact depth range depends on several factors including tidal range, seafloor slope, water clarity, the presence of grazers, and local wind-driven currents (Logan et al. 1964;Feldmann and McKenzie 1998). They have been used to constrain Holocene sea-level curves in the Bahamas (Bourrouilh- Le Jan 2007) and West Africa (Einsele et al. 1974). Algal mats in the Baffin Bay area live in water depths no deeper than 1 m, but most commonly they are found in water depths less than 30 cm (Dalrymple 1964;Behrens and Frishman 1971). Thus, they make an ideal sea-level indicator in Baffin Bay. One important factor in estimating paleo-sea level from cores in estuarine sediments is correcting for the impact of compaction (Pizzuto and Schwendt 1997;Paul and Barras 1998;Massey et al. 2006). Paul and Barras (1998) concluded that the amount of compaction above an incompressible surface is greatest around one-half the depth of the sedimentary column and becomes less with distance away from the midpoint. Estimates for the amount of compaction at the one-half depth mark range from 1 to 10% of the sedimentary thickness (Paul and Barras 1998). Based on seismic profiles, the depth to the Pleistocene beneath core BB06-02 is about 10 m below the sea floor (Aryal 2007). No seismic profiles were collected over the location of BB07-02, but based on extrapolation of the known Pleistocene surface in Cayo del Grullo it should be at a depth of about 24.0 m below the sea floor (Aryal 2007). Using the midpoint with an appropriate error of 5 6 5% and a linear approximation for the decrease in compaction with depth from the midway point, we obtain a correction factor of 0.4 6 0.4 m for the algal mat in core BB06-02, and 0.1 6 0.1 m for the algal mat in core BB07-02. Assuming that they were deposited in water no deeper than 1 m, these two algal mats place maximum sea levels at 27.6 6 1.1 m below present 5660-5480 cal years BP and 20.9 6 1.0 m 665-540 cal years BP."}, {"section_title": "Mid-Holocene Highstand in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico", "text": "Glacio-hydro-isostatic theory (Bloom 1967;Farrell and Clark 1976) would suggest that of locations along the Texas coast, Baffin Bay would be one of the most likely spots to experience a mid-Holocene highstand, for two reasons. First, the farther the distance from the northern hemisphere ice sheets the more likely an area will be located out of the collapsing forebulge region. As Baffin Bay is farther south than other areas subject to the discussion of a mid-Holocene highstand in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (e.g., east Texas; Morton et al. 2000a), it is farther removed from these ice sheets. Second, locations at the head of bays and estuaries would gain the greatest amount of uplift from the ''continental levering'' mechanism. Thus the absence of evidence for a mid-Holocene highstand along the shorelines of Baffin Bay casts doubt on its presence in other areas along the northern Gulf of Mexico. As for other explanations for anomalously high sea levels in the northern Gulf of Mexico, it is the fall in sea level following the highstand that is most difficult to explain. The elevation of sea level can be higher in places along the Gulf of Mexico due to the forebulge caused by sedimentary loading, but that uplift can provide anomalously high elevations, not a drop in sea level. To explain the subsequent fall in sea level, Morton et al. (2000a) have suggested a readvance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the evidence for this large (, 1.0 3 10 7 km 3 of ice) a readvance is, with isolated exceptions (Goodwin 1998), lacking (Anderson et al. 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Reconstructions along Semiarid and Arid Coasts", "text": "The dating of basal peat is one of the most commonly used methods for the reconstruction of past sea levels (e.g., T\u00f6rnqvist et al. 2004;Frouin et al. 2007). However, along semiarid and arid coastlines peat deposits are rare. Comparison of the sea-level indices from coastal ponds and algal mats from the Baffin Bay region with sea-level reconstructions from other places along the northern Gulf of Mexico not favoring a mid-Holocene highstand (e.g., Louisiana, T\u00f6rnqvist et al. 2004) show general agreement (Fig. 13). The two curves are not expected to be identical due to the possibility of loading in the Mississippi Delta (e.g., Blum et al. 2008) as well as glacio-and hydro-isostatic differences expected between sites more than 500 km apart. In addition, our compaction correction applied to the algal mats may be too small. However, the general agreement suggests that algal mats and coastal ponds can provide valuable sea-level data where other sea-level indices are lacking."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Ponds along the southern margins of Baffin Bay, Texas, experienced a three-stage evolution. Stage 1 is the creation of a pond formed in a depression created by eolian processes. Stage 2 is marked by the creation of a pathway by gully erosion for the exchange of waters with the open bay during storm events. Stage 3 is the open connection of the pond with Baffin Bay via a small tidal inlet. Each of these stages of pond evolution has a unique sedimentary facies. Together with age and elevation control, these facies are used to evaluate a proposed mid-Holocene highstand in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Deposits from these cores suggest that Holocene sea level did not reach above +0.4 m and did not reach above 21.0 m until sometime around 4.5 ka. Age dates obtained from algal mats and corrected for compaction in adjacent Baffin Bay suggest sea level was 27.6 6 1.1 m at 5.6 ka. Both sets of data are difficult to reconcile with a mid-Holocene highstand in the Gulf of Mexico but are in general agreement with more traditional views of sea level in the Gulf of Mexico. Algal mats and coastal ponds are two underutilized methods of reconstructing paleo-sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines."}]
