[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Federal student loan programs are a major source of financial aid for students in postsecondary education. Loans provide students lacking the financial resources to attend college with a way to invest in their futures. However, excessive borrowing can cause problems later. Therefore, it is important to identify and describe the postgraduation consequences of borrowing and to understand what levels of borrowing may cause trouble later on. This study examines the debt of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in light of their financial circumstances in 1997, approximately 4 years after they earned their degree. First, it reviews the amount they borrowed as undergraduates and describes any additional borrowing by those who had enrolled in a graduate degree program. Amounts borrowed through student loan programs, from parents, and from other private sources are all included. Next, it examines the progress that borrowers had made in repaying their student loans by 1997. Finally, the study describes their debt burden by examining the relationship between student loan payments and income and by searching for other indications of the impact of borrowing. It does this by comparing borrowers at various levels with nonborrowers in terms of their expenditures for certain major items such as rent or a mortgage, a car, and credit card purchases, and by examining how borrowing affects specific lifestyle choices such as family formation, buying a home or car, and saving. The analysis uses data collected through the 1992-93 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:1993) and the two follow-ups conducted in 1994 and 1997 (B&B:1993/1994 and B&B:1993/1997). The analysis distinguishes among three groups of undergraduate borrowers: 1) those with no further postsecondary enrollment by 1997 (53 percent of all undergraduate borrowers); 2) those who enrolled for further postsecondary education after receiving their bachelor's degree but nevertheless were in repayment in 1997 (24 percent of all undergraduate borrowers); and 3) those who enrolled for further education but were not in repayment in 1997 (23 percent of all undergraduate borrowers)."}, {"section_title": "Borrowing for Education", "text": "One-half of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients borrowed to help pay for their undergraduate education. Those who took out loans borrowed an average of $10,100. By 1997, 29 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a graduate degree or first-professional degree program. One-half of them (14 percent) had borrowed to help pay for their graduate education, and the other half had not. The amount borrowed for education varied with graduates' postbaccalaureate experience. For those with no further enrollment after the bachelor's degree, 51 percent had borrowed for undergraduate education; the average amount borrowed was $10,500.

Among undergraduate borrowers who had completed a first-professional degree by 1997, 9 out of 10 had borrowed, with an average of $63,400 borrowed in total. Undergraduate borrowing appears to have a minor discouraging effect on further enrollment in the short term. Undergraduates who borrowed $5,000 or more were slightly less likely than nonborrowers to have enrolled for further education by 1994 (16 percent versus 20 percent). This effect persisted even after controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age when they received their degree, type of institution from which they graduated, undergraduate major, and grade point average (Choy and Geis 1997). However, the early negative impact of borrowing had disappeared by 1997, when (controlling for the same factors) there was no statistically significant relationship between undergraduate borrowing and enrolling in either a graduate degree program or any other postsecondary program."}, {"section_title": "Debt Status in 1997", "text": "The debt status of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in 1997 can be summarized as follows: 46 percent did not owe any money because they had never borrowed at either the undergraduate or graduate levels; another 16 percent had borrowed at one or both levels, but no longer owed on those loans; and the remaining 39 percent still owed on education loans (figure A).

The difference between the percentages who still owed and who were in repayment represents the proportion with deferments, who were in default, or who were not required to repay loans at that time. Figure B also shows the average amounts borrowed and owed, and the average being paid on a monthly basis. The 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed as undergraduates but had not enrolled for any further education had made some progress in eliminating their debt by 1997. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had not enrolled for any additional postsecondary education by 1997, 51 percent had borrowed for their undergraduate education, and 33 percent still owed on those loans in 1997. Thus, 18 percent had paid off their education debts (or had them forgiven). Almost all of those who owed were in repayment (the difference between the 33 percent who owed and the 29 percent who were in repayment is not statistically significant). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned a master's degree by 1997, 69 percent had borrowed at one or both levels. By 1997, about 14 percent had been able to discharge their debt despite earning a second degree, and 55 percent still had outstanding loans. Thirty-nine percent were making payments, which means that about 16 percent were not being required to make payments, most likely because they had just recently completed their degree and were still in deferment. The average amount still owed by master's degree holders was substantially greater than the amount still owed by those who had not enrolled for further education ($17,200 versus $7,100). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned a first-professional degree by 1997, 91 percent had borrowed to help pay for their education, and most (80 percent) still owed on their loans. Because first-professional programs usually take at least three or four years to complete, most would have graduated very recently. Thus, a comparatively low proportion (47 percent) were in repayment in 1997. The average amount owed by this group ($66,200) was substantially higher than the average amount owed by those who had completed a master's degree ($17,200), This difference reflects higher tuition, more frequent full-time enrollment, limited time to work while enrolled, and little time after undergraduate enrollment to accumulate savings. Although it appears that the average amount owed is greater than the average amount borrowed for those who had completed a first-professional degree ($66,200 versus $63,400), the difference is not statistically significant. It is likely that the few who no longer owed had taken out relatively small loans, leaving those with high loan amounts still owing. This would have the effect of raising the average amount owed after the smaller loans were removed. Furthermore, some borrowers may have had the accrued interest on their loans added to the principal while they were enrolled and thus increased the amount owed."}, {"section_title": "Debt Burden Monthly Loan Payments as a Percentage of Income", "text": "The undergraduate borrowers with no further enrollment by 1997 were well positioned to repay their loans. Almost all (88 percent) were employed full time, and their average income in 1996 was $35,300. The median monthly debt burden (the percent of monthly income used to repay loans) for those in repayment was 5 percent. Approximately 8 out of 10 had debt burdens of less than 10 percent. To place this debt burden in context, housing lenders typically use an 8 percent rule for student loan debt. The median debt burden of those who had further enrollment but were repaying their loans was similar to the median debt burden of those with no further enrollment (6 percent). About half of undergraduate borrowers were married in 1997. The median household debt burden was 3 percent for those without further enrollment. Even among those where the total amount borrowed by both spouses was $15,000 or more, the median debt burden was 5 percent. Thus, the added income of a spouse appears to lessen the burden of student loans."}, {"section_title": "Other Indicators of Debt Burden", "text": "Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, there is no evidence that borrowing for education affects lifestyle choices such as the timing of marriage or major purchases such as a car or house. One-half (50 percent) of nonborrowers were married in 1997, as was also true for borrowers. The percentages who were married in 1997 did not differ among any of the three groups of borrowers (those with no further enrollment, those with further enrollment but in repayment, and those with further enrollment and not in repayment) or between any of these groups of borrowers and nonborrowers. Also, no differences were observed in the percentages owning a car or another vehicle in 1997: about 9 out of 10 did so regardless of borrowing or enrollment status. There was one difference regarding the purchase of a house or condominium. Those who borrowed for undergraduate education, enrolled for further education, and were not in repayment were less likely to own a house or condominium in 1997 (34 percent) than were nonborrowers or borrowers with no further enrollment (43 percent each). This finding might reflect the fact that many of those with further enrollment who were not in repayment were still enrolled in 1997. The percentages of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were saving money might also provide clues as to whether education debt causes economic hardship for undergraduate borrowers. If repaying education loans were causing serious financial stress, one might expect to see those with high debt burdens less likely to save. However, this was not the case. Among those who borrowed for their undergraduate education but did not enroll for further education, 70 percent were saving for some purpose in 1997, the same percentage as nonborrowers. A similar proportion of those who enrolled for further education and were repaying their loans in 1997 were saving (66 percent). Among those who enrolled for further education and were not repaying their loans in 1997, 60 percent were saving. This was a smaller percentage than that for borrowers who had not continued their education or for nonborrowers (70 percent each); however, some were still enrolled and therefore might not be expected to be saving."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "About one-half of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients borrowed to help pay for their undergraduate education, and about one-half of the 28 percent who went on to graduate school borrowed, either as new or continuing borrowers.

In 1998-99, 58 percent of all federal aid was awarded in the form of loans (The College Board 1999). In that same year, undergraduate and graduate students borrowed a total of $22.6 billion through the Federal Family Education Loans Program. Loans provide students lacking the financial resources to attend college with a way to invest in their futures. However, ever since the beginning of federal student loan programs, many have worried about potential negative consequences of student borrowing (Hansen 1987;Hansen and Rhodes 1988;Greiner 1996;Somers and Cofer 1998). One set of concerns has centered on fears of excessive borrowing and subsequent default, which has negative consequences for the students, their institutions, and the loan programs. Another set has focused on the possibility that the prospect of borrowing and incurring heavy debt may discourage students (especially minorities and others traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education) from enrolling or cause them to drop out before they reach their educational goals. A third set of concerns has focused on the impact of debt on students' postgraduation lives. In other words, does it prevent them from continuing their education, entering a field that is socially beneficial but not necessarily well paying (such as teaching), or marrying or buying a home or a car at approximately the same times as their peers without student loans to repay? Empirical findings have been mixed, but the consensus at a symposium on student loan debt held in December 1997 was that growing loan debts were not a problem for most borrowers at that time (Davis and Merisotis 1998). Borrowing is most likely to be a problem for students who leave postsecondary education without earning a degree (King 1998). Despite the potential negative consequences of borrowing, there is some evidence of a positive relationship between borrowing and persistence. A recent study found that students' persistence in postsecondary education appears to be negatively related to their working full time and attending part time, but positively related to borrowing (Cuccaro-Alamin and Choy 1998). It is possible that borrowing in and of itself may increase students' commitment to degree completion so they may be assured of earning an adequate salary when the time for repayment comes. Alternatively, students who are committed from the outset to completing their studies may be willing to borrow, while less committed students may choose to finance their education through work to avoid debt if they decide not to complete. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that bor-Introduction rowing reasonable sums of money as a strategy for financing education may be preferable to working long hours or enrolling part time. Therefore, it is important to identify and describe the postgraduation consequences of borrowing and to understand what levels of borrowing might cause trouble later on.\nUndergraduate borrowing by 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients took place before this large increase in borrowing. Data from NPSAS:1996 show cumulative average amounts borrowed by graduating seniors of $11,800 for those who attended public 4-year institutions and $14,100 for those who attended private, not-for-profit institutions (Berkner 1998). One can get some indication of the debt burden that more recent graduates can expect after 4 years by looking at the data presented in the tables of this report for 1992-93 graduates who borrowed amounts in this higher range. Caution must be taken in making direct comparisons, however. First, for borrowers at a given level, the incomes of the 1995-96 graduates 4 years after graduating may be higher, on average, than those of the 1992-93 graduates in 1997, which would give them greater financial resources for repaying the same size loans. Second, the increases in borrowing observed in the mid-1990s represented not only increased amounts borrowed by financially needy students but also an influx of borrowers from middle-and upper-income families, many taking out unsubsidized loans (King 1998). It is possible that parents of these students, typically in better financial circumstances than parents of previous borrowers, may intend to help the students repay the loans, thus reducing the debt burden assumed by the students themselves."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of This Study", "text": "The purpose of this study is to examine the debt of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in light of their financial circumstances in 1997, approximately 4 years after they graduated. An earlier study reported that about one-half (49 percent) of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from some source (including their families as well as through student loan programs) to help finance their undergraduate education (Choy and Geis 1997). The average total amount borrowed by those who took out loans was $10,200. Approximately one year after they graduated, 83 percent of those who had borrowed as undergraduates still owed money, an average of $9,100. Among borrowers who had started paying back their loans, their average monthly payment was $136, or about 9 percent of their April 1994 salary. Graduates with salaries less than $15,000 had the greatest average debt burden (15 percent). This study examines this same group of undergraduate borrowers in 1997. First, it reviews the amount they borrowed as undergraduates and describes any additional borrowing by those who pursued graduate degree programs.' Next, it examines the progress that borrowers had made in repaying their student loans by 1997. Finally, the study describes their debt burden by examining the relationship between student loan payments and income and by searching for other indications of a negative impact of borrowing. It does this by comparing borrowers at various levels and nonborrowers in terms of their expenditures for certain major items such as rent or a mortgage, a car, and credit card purchases, and by examining how borrowing affects specific lifestyle choices such as family formation, buying a home or car, and saving. The analysis distinguishes among three groups of undergraduate borrowers: 1) Those with no further postsecondary enrollment by 1997 (53 percent of all undergraduate borrowers).2 In 1997, most of these borrowers would have been in repayment unless they had already paid back their loans. A few may have been in default or had deferments because of unemployment, hardship, or participation in a qualified service program. Introduction 2) Those who enrolled for further postsecondary education after receiving their bachelor's degree but nevertheless were in repayment in 1997 (24 percent of all undergraduate borrowers). This group consists of those who had completed another program or left postsecondary education at least 6 months before the follow-up and were therefore required to start repaying their loans; those who were enrolled for further education at the time of the follow-up, but were attending less than half time and therefore not able to defer repayment; those required to repay loans to their families or to nonfederal lenders that did not permit deferments for enrollment; and any who were voluntarily repaying their loans to reduce their indebtedness. 3) Those who enrolled for further education but were not in repayment in 1997 (23 percent of all undergraduate borrowers). This group includes those who were enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time or who had left postsecondary education within the previous 6 months and were not yet required to start repaying their loans. It also includes any undergraduate borrowers who had managed to repay their loans (or had them forgiven) despite further postsecondary enrollment. This is a study of undergraduate borrowing and the circumstances in which the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients found themselves in 1997, which sometimes included new or continued borrowing at the graduate level. Therefore, total amounts borrowed for education for those with further enrollment are reported. However, this is not a comprehensive study of graduate borrowing, even for those who had completed a graduate degree program, because the percentages who borrowed at the graduate level and the amounts borrowed will not be typical of all graduate degree completers. The 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who completed a graduate degree program by 1997 will have been more likely than the typical graduate degree recipient to have enrolled full time and to have begun their program before having an opportunity to accumulate savings from working. Consequently, one might expect their borrowing levels to be higher than would be typical of graduate degree recipients overall."}, {"section_title": "Implication of Recent Increases in Borrowing for This Analysis", "text": "Borrowing grew dramatically after the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which raised the maximum loan limits, instituted changes in need analysis, and created unsubsidized Stafford loans for students not meeting the financial need criteria for subsidized loans.

Borrowing grew by 38 percent to $23.8 billion the following year and reached a peak of $25.0 billion in 1994-95.

One-half of graduates borrowed through student loan programs or from family or friends to help pay for their education (table 1).

This minor difference may simply indicate that those needing to borrow to finance their undergraduate education also needed to borrow to finance their graduate education. 4B&B 1993/1997 Data Analysis System, not shown in table. 5These amounts are not exactly the same as those reported in the earlier report (Choy and Geis 1997) on undergraduate debt burden (49 percent and $10,200) because missing information on undergraduate borrowing in 1994 was updated in 1997 when possible and the sample analyzed here consists of the graduates who participated in all three surveys."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "Borrowing for Education Graduate borrowing was most common among those who enrolled in first-professional programs. Eighty-three percent of these students had borrowed by 1997, compared with 42 percent of those enrolled in master's programs and 58 percent enrolled in doctoral programs. The frequency of borrowing among first-professional students may be related to the fact that they typically face the highest average tuition charges and are the most likely to enroll full time (Choy and Moskovitz 1998). Doctoral students were more likely than master's students to have borrowed (58 percent versus 42 percent). Although master's and doctoral students face similar average annual tuition charges, doctoral programs last longer and doctoral students are more likely to attend full time, thus increasing their likelihood of needing to borrow (Choy and Moskovitz 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Undergraduate Borrowing on Graduate and Other Postsecondary Enrollment", "text": "Based on the data presented in table 2, undergraduate borrowing appears to have had a minor discouraging effect on graduate degree enrollment, with undergraduate borrowers being slightly less likely than nonborrowers to have enrolled in a graduate degree program by 1997 (27 percent versus 30 percent). However, this finding does not take into account the various other factors that affect graduate degree enrollment or undergraduate borrowing. To overcome this limitation, a linear regression model was used to describe the relationship between undergraduate borrowing and graduate degree enrollment while adjusting for the covariance of independent variables.6 The dependent variable was defined as the likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program between the time they graduated and when they were interviewed in 1997. The independent variables included sex, race/ethnicity, age when they received their degree, whether they borrowed from any source for their undergraduate education, type of institution from which they graduated, undergraduate major, cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA), and parents' education. The results (shown in table 3) show no statistically significant relationship between enrollment in a graduate degree program and undergraduate borrowing after controlling for all the other characteristics shown in the table. Student characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program included earning a bachelor's degree by age 24 (rather than being older); majoring in engineering, mathematics, or science (rather than in business or an \"other\" field that excluded humanities/social sciences in addition to the fields already mentioned); achieving a GPA of at least 3.0 (rather than a lower GPA); and having at least one parent with some college attendance (rather than no education beyond high school). 6See appendix B for a detailed discussion of the technique used."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "Borrowing for Education "}, {"section_title": "2$", "text": "The earlier study of debt burden (Choy and Geis 1997), which examined the relationship between undergraduate borrowing and any further postsecondary education, showed that 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who borrowed $5,000 or more were slightly less likely than nonborrowers to enroll in further education by 1994. This was after taking into account sex, race/ethnicity, age, type of institution, major, and GPA. By 1997, however, the relationship between borrowing $5,000 or more as an undergraduate and any further postsecondary enrollment (controlling for the same other factors) no longer held once other characteristics were taken into account (table 4).7 Thus, while undergraduate borrowing in excess of $5,000 originally appeared to discourage immediate further postsecondary enrollment, the effect appears to go away over the longer term."}, {"section_title": "Borrowing at the Graduate Level", "text": "Among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who went on to enroll in a graduate degree program by 1997, about one-half (49 percent) had borrowed to help pay for their graduate education (44 percent had borrowed from nonfamily sources and 11 percent from their families) (table 5).8 Although undergraduate borrowers were more likely than nonborrowers to have borrowed at the graduate level (57 percent versus 43 percent), there were no statistically significant differences in the average amounts borrowed. The amounts borrowed at the graduate level by 1997 were substantial, averaging $26,500 over and above any amounts borrowed by undergraduates (table 5). Twenty-two percent borrowed $40,000 or more (table 6). The implications of these numbers are difficult to assess, however, because of the varying amount of time the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had spent in graduate school by 1997. Limiting consideration to those who had completed a graduate or first-professional degree by 1997, 53 percent of those who had earned a master's degree and 86 percent of those who had earned a first-professional degree had borrowed as a graduate student (table 5). The average amounts borrowed for graduate education by borrowers who had earned these degrees were $18,200 and $59,800, respectively. (Too few students had completed a doctoral degree to estimate the total amount borrowed to complete their degrees.) Reflecting the higher cost of their education and the borrowing limits imposed by the major student loan programs, students who enrolled in first-professional programs were considerably more likely than those who enrolled in master's degree programs to have borrowed from their families (19 percent versus 9 percent). (The apparent difference between first-professional and 7Parents' education was not included in table 4 in order to maintain comparability to the earlier study. 8The percentages borrowing from nonfamily and family sources sum to more than the total percentage borrowing because some borrowed from both sources.  doctoral students is not statistically significant.) The average amount borrowed by firstprofessional students who borrowed from their families was $21,400, indicating that families are a significant source of financial resources for some students. Seventy percent of those who had completed a first-professional degree by 1997 had borrowed $40,000 or more (from all sources) (table 6). One reason that first-professional degree completers had borrowed such large amounts is that, given the durations of these programs, those who had finished by 1997 must have started their first-professional education soon after Borrowing for Education completing their bachelor's degree and attended primarily full time. Thus, they would not have had much time to accumulate savings to pay for further education or to earn much while enrolled. The relative contribution of family borrowing is easiest to understand by calculating the average amounts borrowed from nonfamily and family sources including zero amounts for those who did not borrow. The average total amount borrowed by all those who enrolled in a graduate degree program (including those with zero amounts) was $13,100, of which about $12,000 was borrowed from nonfamily sources and $1,100 from family sources.9 Thus, although the average 9B&B 1993/1997 Data Analysis System, not shown in table."}, {"section_title": "-3 2", "text": "Borrowing for Education for those who borrowed from their families was $9,800 (table 5), the overall contribution of family loans to financing graduate education was relatively small."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Borrowing for Education by 1997", "text": "The following summarizes the borrowing status of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients as of 1997: 44 percent had never borrowed for education; 42 percent had borrowed only as undergraduates; 7 percent had borrowed only as graduate students; and 8 percent had borrowed at both levels (table 7). The average total amount borrowed for education by 1997 was $15,600 (this includes amounts borrowed as undergraduates or graduates by all who borrowed at either level). Among those who had completed a master's degree by 1997, 69 percent had borrowed for education: 16 percent only at the undergraduate level, 24 percent only at the graduate level, and 29 percent at both levels. Those who borrowed only at the undergraduate level may have been supported by grants or assistantships for their master's degree or worked while enrolled and did not need to borrow. Those who borrowed only at the graduate level may have received parental support as undergraduates, worked more, or attended a less expensive institution than they did as graduate students. Among those who had completed a first-professional degree by 1997, almost all (90 percent) had borrowed to help pay for their education at one or both levels: 45 percent had borrowed at the graduate level only; 41 percent had borrowed at both levels; and 4 percent had borrowed as undergraduates only. The total amount borrowed varied considerably depending on the amount of further education the bachelor's degree recipients had completed. Among those with no further enrollment after the bachelor's degree, the average amount borrowed was $10,500. In contrast, among those who had completed a master's degree, the average was $20,800, and for those who had completed a first-professional degree, it was $63,400. Among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had completed master's or firstprofessional degrees by 1997, most of their borrowing was at the graduate level. This pattern is most easily seen by computing the average total amounts borrowed including zero amounts for those who did not borrow at one of the levels. Those who had earned master's degrees by 1997 and borrowed for education at one or both levels borrowed an average of $4,700 as undergraduates, and an average of $9,700 as graduate students. Those who had earned a first-professional degree borrowed an average of $5,500 as undergraduates, and $51,600 after that.'\u00b01\u00b0B &B 1993/1997  The 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who borrowed to help pay for their undergraduate education were in various positions with respect to their undergraduate debt by 1997. As discussed earlier, 53 percent of undergraduate borrowers did not enroll for any further postsecondary education and would therefore have been required to start repaying their federal student loans by the end of 1993. This group is the easiest to study from the perspective of undergraduate debt burden, because their situation is not complicated by further enrollment and borrowing. Another 24 percent of undergraduate borrowers enrolled for further postsecondary education but nevertheless were in repayment in 1997. This group includes borrowers who had finished or left their program at least 6 months earlier or were attending less than half time (eliminating the possibility of deferment). It might also include some who were voluntarily repaying federal loans or were repaying other loans that did not allow deferments for enrollment. The amounts they owed and were repaying in 1997 also reflect borrowing at the graduate level, but analysis of this group's situation is complicated by the fact that they have spent varying amounts of time in graduate school. However, by concentrating on those who completed a degree program, some assessment of the cumulative effects of undergraduate and graduate borrowing is possible. The remaining 23 percent of undergraduate borrowers enrolled for further education but were not in repayment. This group includes those who were still enrolled (at least half time) in 1997 or who had just recently (within 6 months) ended their enrollment. Because it is impossible to know what the circumstances of this group will be when they eventually start repaying their loansfor example, how much they will have borrowed and what their incomes will beit is extremely difficult to determine the impact of borrowing on this group. Because of the varying circumstances of these groups, the following analysis of the amounts owed distinguishes between undergraduate borrowers with and without further enrollment. The analysis of the amounts being repaid subdivides the group with further enrollment into two: those in repayment and those not in repayment."}, {"section_title": "Amounts Owed and Being Repaid", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Amounts Owed", "text": "By 1997, approximately 4 years after graduating, the majority of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were free of education debt ( figure 1 and table 8).11 Some graduates (46 percent) were in this position because they had never borrowed for either undergraduate or graduate education, and another 16 percent were debt free because their student loans had been repaid or forgiven. This left 39 percent of all graduates still owing money for education. Fewer of those who had no further enrollment (33 percent) still owed.

Among those who borrowed as undergraduates but did not enroll for any further education, 84 percent owed money in 1994, dropping to 66 percent in 1997. The average amount owed in 1994 was $9,100, and in 1997, it was $7,100. Although a small proportion (3 percent) of the borrowers who did not enroll for further education still owed $20,000 or more in 1997, 41 percent owed less than $5,000. Among those who had borrowed less than $5,000, about two-thirds had discharged their education debt by 1997: 64 percent had owed money in 1994, declining to 32 percent by 1997. If they still had debt in 1997, the average amount owed was $1,700. Those who had borrowed $15,000 or more were less likely than those who had borrowed less than $5,000 to have paid off  Reflecting the larger average amounts they had borrowed, borrowers who attended private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely than those from public institutions to still owe money in 1997 (75 percent versus 61 percent). They also tended to owe more ($8,500 versus $6,100). The percentage who still owed money in 1997 did not vary with income. About two-thirds of undergraduate borrowers with 1996 incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 still owed on their education loans in 1997. While there appeared to be a difference at the extremes (below $20,000 or above $50,000), the difference was not statistically significant.\nOf those who had borrowed as undergraduates but had no further postsecondary enrollment, 57 percent were repaying their loans in 1997 (table 11). Their average monthly payment  \nThe average monthly debt burden in 1997 for those with no further enrollment was 6 percent, and the median was 5 percent (table 16). More than 80 percent had debt burdens of less than 10 percent (for 45 percent it was less than 5 percent, and for another 38 percent, 5-9 percent). Among undergraduates with no further education who were in repayment in 1997, the median debt burden decreased from 7 percent 1994 to 5 percent in 1997, but this apparent difference is not statistically significant.12 Caution is necessary in comparing debt burdens from year to year, because debt burden can be calculated only for those making payments at the time. Thus, all those who paid back their loans between 1994 and 1997 are excluded from the 1997 calculation. High debt burden can be caused by borrowing a large amount (and thus having large monthly payments), having a low income, or both. Debt burden increased with the amount borrowed. Among graduates with no further enrollment by 1997, those who borrowed less than $5,000 had a median debt burden of 3 percent in 1997, while those who borrowed $15,000 or more had a median debt burden of 7 percent (figure 3). In addition, debt burden decreased as income increased. For the same graduates, those with incomes less than $20,000 had a median debt burden of 10 percent in 1997, compared with 2 percent for those whose incomes were $50,000 or more (table 16)."}, {"section_title": "Borrowed as Undergraduates, Enrolled for Further Education", "text": "Because of the higher level of borrowing at the graduate than undergraduate level, undergraduate borrowers who had enrolled in a graduate degree program owed considerably more in 1997 than their counterparts without further enrollment ($16,400 versus $7,100) (table 9). Those who had completed a master's degree owed an average of $17,200, and those with a firstprofessional degree, a much larger average of $66,200. Although it appears that the average amount owed is greater than the average amount borrowed for those completing a firstprofessional degree ($66,200 versus $63,400) (tables 9 and 7), the difference is not statistically significant. It is likely that the few who no longer owed were those with relatively small loans, leaving those with high loan amounts still owing. This would have the effect of lowering the average loan amount for all borrowers and raising the average amount owed after the smaller loans were removed. Furthermore, some borrowers may have had the accrued interest on their loans added to the principal while they were enrolled and thus increased the amount owed.\nUndergraduate borrowers who enrolled for further education after earning their bachelor's degree and still had education debt in 1997 would normally be in repayment if they had completed or dropped out by mid-1996 or were enrolled less than half time. Those who were still enrolled in 1997 (half time or more) or had just recently graduated would likely have deferments from most student loan programs, but might vary in their obligations for repaying loans from their families. Some (if they had the necessary financial resources) might be repaying their loans even if they were not required to do so. Of those who had borrowed as undergraduates and had enrolled for additional education by 1997, 50 percent were repaying their loans (table 11). Among those in repayment, the average monthly payment was $194, which was considerably higher than the average amount being paid by those who did not enroll for further education. This reflects the fact that many undergraduate borrowers took out loans at the graduate level as well (table 7). Among those who had borrowed at both levels, the average monthly payment was $290, compared with $139 if they had borrowed only as undergraduates. Undergraduate borrowers who had completed a master's degree by 1997 were paying an average of $244 per month to cover their undergraduate and graduate borrowing. However, the average for those who had completed a professional degree was much higher $584 per month. Figure 2 illustrates the education debt status of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. It shows the percentages who borrowed, owed, and were in repayment for those with no further enrollment, those who had completed a master's degree, and those who had completed a firstprofessional degree. Not enough doctoral students had completed their degrees by 1997 for reliable estimates of the debt status of completers. The difference between the percentages who borrowed and who owed represents the proportion who had repaid their loans (or had them forgiven) by 1997. The difference between the percentages who owed and who were in repayment represents the proportion with deferments, in default, or not being required to repay loans (it is impos- Figure 2Percentages of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed for education, still owed, and were in repayment, by level of education after bachelor's degree: 1997 sible to know how many were in each category).

The typical Stafford loan calls for a 10-year repayment schedule, with a minimum monthly payment of $50, although income-sensitive and graduated repayment schedules are also options. In addition, borrowers can consolidate federal loans. Deferments can be obtained for number of reasons, such as further enrollment in postsecondary education (at least half time), participation in a qualifying service program such as the Peace Corps, or an approved medical or financial hardship. Under some circumstances, forbearance may be granted (allowing borrowers to postpone payment) or loans cancelled. Repayment schedules for loans from families or other private sources are negotiated by the parties involved and, in the case of families, may be formal or informal. No information is available on these arrangements. However, borrowers were asked to report what they were repaying for all loans. In 1997, 29 percent of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were making payments on education loans (table 10). These loans may have been assumed at either the undergraduate or graduate level or both. Another 27 percent were not making payments because they no longer owed, had a deferment because they were enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time or for some other reason, were in default, or had nonfederal loans they were not required to repay at that time.

Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned a master's degree by 1997, 69 percent had borrowed at one or both levels. By 1997, about 14 percent had been able to discharge their debt despite earning a second degree, and 55 percent still owed money. Thirty-nine percent were making payments, which means that about 16 percent were not being required to make payments, most likely because they had just recently completed their degree. The average amount owed was substantially greater than the amount for those who had not enrolled for further education ($17,200 versus $7,100). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned a first-professional degree by 1997, 91 percent had borrowed to help pay for their education, and most (80 percent) still owed money. Because most first-professional programs take at least 3 or 4 years to complete, most would have graduated very recently. Thus, a comparatively low proportion (47 percent) were in repayment in 1997. The average amount owed by this group ($66,200) was substantially higher than the average amount owed by those who had completed a master's degree ($17,200). As indicated earlier, this reflects higher tuition, more frequent full-time enrollment, limited time to work while enrolled, and little time after undergraduate enrollment to accumulate savings. Understanding the extent to which the payments just described impose a financial burden on the borrowers requires knowing something about the borrowers' financial circumstances as well as the size of their payments. For instance, a $100 monthly payment is not likely to be a major hardship for a borrower who is earning $36,000 per year (the loan payment would amount to 3 percent of the borrower's monthly gross income). In contrast, the same monthly loan payment would be a much greater burden for someone with only a part-time job paying $15,000 per year. As background to the discussion of debt burden, the section begins by describing the borrowers' income and employment status to provide an indication of their overall financial circumstances in 1997 and their capacity to meet their loan repayment obligations. The discussion is limited to borrowers who have begun repaying their loans. It focuses on those with no further enrollment because some of those with further enrollment may have been enrolled during part of 1996, making meaningful interpretation of their income data difficult. The rest of the section discusses various indicators of debt burden, the most useful of which is the size of a borrower's loan payment relative to income. Other indications of debt burden are provided by examining household loan payments relative to household income for married graduates and links between debt burden and lifestyle choices such as spending for other major items, marriage, and saving."}, {"section_title": "Income", "text": "In 1996, undergraduate borrowers with no further enrollment earned an average of $32,500 (table 12).

Average income ($33,600) was similar to average earnings, suggesting that at this stage in their careers, most of this cohort had few other sources of income.  Graduates who were 24 years or younger when they earned their degree had lower incomes in 1996, on average, than older graduates.

The average 1996 income for those who borrowed as undergraduates but had no further enrollment was higher than that for those who did enroll but nevertheless were in repayment in 1997 ($33,600 versus $29,800). This does not indicate that there were no economic returns to further enrollment, however. As indicated above, the first group may have worked more, on average, during 1996. Among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed full time in April 1997, the average annualized salary from their primary job at that time was $34,200 (table 13), whereas in April 1994 it had been $24,600.

While the calculation is easily made with the appropriate data, there is no firm consensus on what level of debt burden is acceptable and what is excessive. Various studies have suggested that 10 percent (Westat 1992), 10 to 15 percent depending on income (Hansen and Rhodes 1988), and 8 percent (Greiner 1996) are acceptable levels of debt burden. Currently, housing lenders typically use an 8 percent rule for student loan debt, based on underwriting standards that limit monthly mortgage payments (including principal, interest, insurance, and taxes) to 25 to 29 percent of the borrower's monthly gross income and total monthly debt service payments (including, for example, car and credit card payments as well as student loans) to 36 to 41 percent of monthly gross income (Scherschel 1998). If one argues that graduates should not expect to buy a home, new car, or other expensive items immediately, a monthly student loan debt burden greater than 8 percent could be considered acceptable. Nevertheless, assuming that graduates might need 25-30 percent of their income for rent, an education debt higher than 10-15 percent would probably not be considered manageable. Although specifying an acceptable level of debt burden is beyond the scope of this analysis, the current policies of the lending industry provide a context for viewing the debt burden of the borrowers studied here. Two measures of income were available to use as a base for calculating debt burden: the April 1997 salary for the primary job and the 1996 income. The April salary is useful for examining the increase in earning power during the early years in the labor force after earning a bachelor's degree. However, the 1996 income was judged to be a more appropriate base for calculating debt burden (monthly payments divided by monthly income) because it uses more information (total income versus just earnings, and 12 months of experience rather a single month). For 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients without further education, the total 1996 income divided by 12 should, in most cases, be a reasonable proxy of monthly income in 1997. For those who had just finished graduate school and may not have worked during all of 1996 (or worked only part time), this method might underestimate their monthly income, resulting in an overstatement of their debt burden. There are other reasons why the 1996 total income divided by 12 might not be an accurate denominator for calculating borrowers' debt burden, such as a major change in employment status (between full-and part-time, for example) or income (up or down) due to a job change. For this analysis, all those with debt burdens more than 50 percent were dropped. Most of those 53 dropped had very low incomes. Unless these graduates had other resources, such as savings or financial help from someone, it is likely that either their 1996 income was incorrectly reported or their financial situations had changed by April 1997. To minimize the impact of extreme values on the analysis, medians as well as averages are reported. Where debt burden for 1994 is reported, those with debt burdens of more than 50 percent were dropped as well."}, {"section_title": "Borrowed as Undergraduates, Further Enrollment, Repaying Loans", "text": "The median 1997 debt burdens of those who had no further enrollment and those who had additional enrollment but were repaying their loans were similar (5 percent and 6 percent, respectively) (table 16).

Among both those with and without any further enrollment, monthly expenditures increased with household income, and households with an education debt burden of less than 5 percent had higher expenditures than those with greater education debt burdens. Also, for both groups, the total amount owed for education did not appear to affect their current spending on other items."}, {"section_title": "5)6", "text": "Debt Burden Although the median debt burdens were similar for those with and without further education, those with further education were more likely to have a debt burden of 10-14 percent (14 percent versus 9 percent) or of 15 percent or more (14 percent versus 7 percent) (table 16)."}, {"section_title": "Household Debt Burden", "text": "Student financial aid policy must assume that the borrower will have sole responsibility for repaying the loan. In reality, however, many students either are married when they borrow or marry before their education loans are repaid, and this may affect their ability to repay them. In some cases, the burden may be lessened, and in others, increased. For some borrowers, marriage may mean additional income to help repay their education loans; for others, it may mean additional responsibilities but no additional income; and for still others, if their spouses borrowed for their own education, it may mean additional education debt, with or without additional income. Therefore, when evaluating education debt burden, it is useful to take the household perspective and take into account the payments and incomes of both spouses. The median household education debt burden for married borrowers without further enrollment was 3 percent in 1997 (table 17).13 Comparing this with the individual median debt burden of 5 percent for those without further enrollment (table 16) suggests that being married tends to lessen the burden of education loans. Seventy-two percent of married borrowers with no further education had household debt burdens of less than 5 percent, and another 22 percent had debt burdens of 5-9 percent. The pattern appeared similar for married undergraduate borrowers with additional enrollment. However, the difference between the household debt burden (4 percent) and the individual debt burden (6 percent) was not statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Expenditures for Other Items", "text": "Although complete information on the financial obligations of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients is not available, data were collected on how much they were paying per month for certain major items: mortgage or rent, auto loans, and other debt. One might expect that if undergraduate borrowers felt financially burdened by their education loan debt, they might spend less than nonborrowers. One might also expect to find both high debt burdens (that is, high monthly loan payments as a percentage of monthly income) and large amounts owed on education loans to be associated with lower spending on these items. To determine if this was the case, the amounts spent by borrowers and nonborrowers on noneducation items were compared, and these expenditures were then examined in relation to household income and household education debt. 13About half (52 percent) of those without further enrollment were married or cohabiting as married in 1997 (table 19)."}, {"section_title": "57", "text": "Debt Burden  Undergraduate borrowers with no further enrollment spent an average of about $1,000 per month for mortgage (or rent), auto loans, and other debt in 1997 (table 18). As one might expect, the amount spent was sensitive to household income, increasing from $516 for those with household incomes less than $20,000 to $1,365 for those with household incomes of $50,000 or more. As one might also expect, monthly expenditures for these major items were sensitive to debt burden. Households with an education debt burden of less than 5 percent spent more, on average, on the major noneducation items listed above ($1,162) than did households with larger education debt burdens ($906 or less). As education loan payments use up an increasing proportion of monthly income, less is available for other items. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that, as a group, undergraduate borrowers with no further enrollment were operating on tighter budgets than nonborrowers. In fact, on average, the borrowers with no further enrollment spent slightly more, not less, per month than the nonborrowers on the major items listed above ($1,007 versus $927) (table 18). Furthermore, average monthly expenditures did not vary with the average amount owed by the household. That is, the existence of outstanding loans did not seem to be sufficiently daunting to discourage current spending."}, {"section_title": "Borrowed as Undergraduates, Further Enrollment, not Repaying Loans", "text": "For this group, average monthly expenditures for the noneducational items listed above were slightly less than for those who had not continued their education ($909 versus $1,007), reflecting the fact that many were still enrolled. Other patterns were similar between the two groups, however. Average expenditures increased with household income, and the total amount owed by the household for education debt was not a factor.  As indicated in the Introduction, concern exists that heavy borrowing for education may affect lifestyle choices, such as delaying marriage or making major purchases such as buying a car or house. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, there is no evidence of such effects. One-half (50 percent) of nonborrowers were married or cohabiting as married in 1997 ( figure 4  and table 19), as was also true for borrowers. The percentages who were married or cohabiting as married in 1997 did not differ among any of the three groups of borrowers (those with no further enrollment, those with further enrollment but in repayment, and those with further enrollment and not in repayment) or between any of them and nonborrowers. Also, no differences were observed in the percentages owning a car or another vehicle in 1997: about 9 out of 10 did so regardless of borrowing or enrollment status.    Those who borrowed for undergraduate education, enrolled for further education, but were not in repayment were less likely to own a house or condo in 1997 (34 percent) than were nonborrowers or borrowers with no further enrollment (43 percent each). This finding might be expected because many of those who enrolled for further education and were not in repayment were still enrolled in 1997.  One-half of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients borrowed to help pay for their undergraduate education. Of those who enrolled in a graduate degree program by 1997 (28 percent), one-half borrowed to help pay for their graduate education, and the other half did not. Some of those who borrowed at the graduate level were borrowing for the first time, while others were adding to their undergraduate debt. The purpose of this study was to examine the debt and financial situations of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipient borrowers 4 years after they graduated to determine the extent to which their borrowing for education had created financial or other hardships."}, {"section_title": "66", "text": "As a group, 62 percent of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were debt free in 1997: 46 percent had never borrowed at either the undergraduate or graduate levels, and 16 percent had borrowed but no longer owed any money, having either repaid their loans or had them forgiven. The rest were in varied circumstances depending on how much they borrowed, how much they earned, and whether or not they had enrolled for further education. Among borrowers who had not enrolled for further education (53 percent of undergraduate borrowers), 33 percent still had debt in 1997. They owed an average of $7,100. The members of this group were generally well positioned financially to repay their loans: 88 percent were employed full time, and if employed full time, were earning an average annual salary of $35,300. Their median debt burden (monthly payments as a percentage of monthly income) was 5 percent, well below the 8 percent considered acceptable by the lending industry. Debt burden appeared a problem primarily for those with low incomes-10 percent for those with incomes less than $20,000. Being married appeared to reduce debt burden: the median household debt burden in 1997 for married graduates with no further postsecondary enrollment was 3 percent. Based on reported spending for major noneducation items such as rent or a mortgage, car payments, and other debt, there was no evidence that borrowers who had not enrolled for further education were on a tighter budget than nonborrowers or that their outstanding debt was inhibiting their current spending. Nor did education debt appear to cause delays in marrying, owning a car, buying a home, or saving. Undergraduate borrowing appears to have a minor discouraging effect on enrollment for further education in the short term, with undergraduates who borrowed $5,000 or more slightly less likely than nonborrowers to enroll within a year of graduating. However, this effect had dis-appeared by 1997, when there was no statistically significant relationship between borrowing and enrolling in either a graduate degree program or any postsecondary program when other factors affecting graduate school enrollment were taken into accountsex, race/ethnicity, age when they received their degree, type of institution they graduated from, undergraduate major, and grade point average. Because of higher levels of borrowing at the graduate than undergraduate levels, undergraduate borrowers who enrolled in a graduate degree program owed considerably more in 1997 than their counterparts without further enrollment ($16,400 versus $7,100). Those who had completed a master's degree owed an average of $17,200, and those who had completed a firstprofessional degree, $66,200. Among those who were repaying their loans, the median debt burden was 6 percent. It is difficult to conclude much about the impact of this borrowing because of the relatively short time since degree attainment and the fact that all completers did not finish at the same time."}, {"section_title": "56", "text": "This glossary describes the variables used in this report.

Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the B&B:93/97 Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the B&B:93/97 data. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors16 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B1 contains estimated standard errors that correspond to the estimates presented in table 9 and was generated by the B&B:93/97 DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute standard errors based on an assumption of simple random sampling, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account B&B's complex sample design. (See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.) 16The B&B sample is not a simple random sample, and therefore simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion.

However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns."}]
