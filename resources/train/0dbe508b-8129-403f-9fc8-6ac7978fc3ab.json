The majority of COPD is caused by environmental exposures. In developed countries, this exposure is primarily cigarette smoke; however, only a minority of all smokers develops COPD (Rennard and Vestbo 2006) . Furthermore, strong familial aggregation of COPD suggests a large role for genetic susceptibility to the detrimental eVects of smoking (Khoury et al. 1985) .\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiWed several novel COPD candidate genes, including FAM13A, HHIP, and CHRNA 3/5 (Cho et al. 2010; Pillai 2009 ). However, two pathogenetic pathways likely contribute to the development of COPD; attainment of lower than maximal lung size and function by young adulthood, and an accelerated decline in lung function over time, and it is likely that diVerent genes impart susceptibility to these processes. Although heritability of lung function decline is well-established (Gottlieb et al. 2001 ) and several candidate gene association studies have supported a genetic basis for lung function decline (Hansel et al. 2009; Hansel 2010; He et al. 2002 He et al. , 2003 He et al. , 2004 He et al. , 2006 Sandford et al. 2001; Siedlinski et al. 2009a, b; van Diemen et al. 2005 van Diemen et al. , 2011 , the genes controlling loss of lung function in smokers remain largely unknown (MolWno 2007) .\nThe NHLBI-supported Lung Health Study (LHS) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial in the US and Canada to determine whether or not a program of smoking intervention and use of an inhaled bronchodilator could slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in smokers with mild airXow limitation. The LHS has been a landmark study in understanding the longitudinal eVects of smoking on short and long-term outcomes in mild COPD. It is uniquely suited to investigate causes of lung function decline since subjects were comprehensively assessed for smoking habits and lung function at each annual visit over a 5-year period with exceptionally high follow-up rates (Kanner et al. 1999 ).

In addition, our results were compared to those of the ECLIPSE cohort which included subjects with GOLD stage II-IV COPD. In the NELSON cohort we observed nominal signiWcance for rs2030436 on chromosome 12 (p = 0.05) which did not hold its signiWcance after Bonferroni correction. No signiWcant evidence for association was observed in the CHS, FHS, BLSA or ECLIPSE cohorts.\nTissue validation for chromosome 14 locus\nStaining for FOXA1 in the airway epithelium (a) and parenchyma (b) using tissue samples from the St. Paul's' Hospital repository is shown in supplementary Fig. E1 . In the airway epithelium, nuclei in all layers of the pseudostratiWed epithelium were stained positively for FOXA1. In the parenchyma, staining was conWned to the alveolar epithelium and appeared to be associated with type II pneumocytes. There was a signiWcant relationship between the extent of staining of the airway and parenchymal epithelium (r 2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001). FOXA1 expression was higher in the epithelium and parenchyma of smokers with airways obstruction compared with smokers without airways obstruction (p < 0.001, both comparisons). There was no signiWcant eVect of FOXA1 genotype on FOXA1 protein expression (Fig. E3) . These results were not confounded by smoking status, as there was no diVerential expression by whether subjects were current or former smokers. There was no staining of alveolar macrophages.

Subjects with airways obstruction had signiWcantly decreased epithelial TMEM26 staining, and increased parenchymal TMEM26 staining, compared to those without airways obstruction (Fig. E5) . There was no eVect of genotype and no evidence of interaction between genotype and lung function. Current smokers had signiWcantly lower expression in the airway epithelium (31 % vs. 45 %, p = 0.03) but there was no eVect of current smoking on alveolar staining. Similarly, using the LTRC samples, immunohistochemical staining of lung sections for TMEM26 showed protein expression in the cytoplasm of the airway epithelium. Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed no signiWcant diVerence in staining between epithelium of subjects with COPD compared with epithelium of smokers without COPD (39.8 vs. 48.5 %, p = 0.17; Fig. 5a ). Subjects without COPD who were homozygous for the chromosome 10 risk allele (n = 3) as compared to those without the risk allele (n = 3) had increased TMEM26 staining (47 vs. 20 %, p = 0.02), but there was no statistical diVerence between genotypes in those with COPD.\nRepresentative ANK3 immunohistochemical staining of lung sections from at-risk and COPD patients from the LTRC shows predominant staining in the alveolar macrophage compartment.

A Q-Q plot of these results is presented in Fig. 2 , and the 10 most strongly associated SNPs (representing seven diVerent regions) are listed in Table 2 . Two SNPs (rs10761570 and rs7911302) on chromosome 10 and one SNP on chromosome 14 (rs177852) met a Bonferroni threshold for genome-wide signiWcance (p < 9.45 \u00a3"}, {"section_title": "\u00a18", "text": "). To reWne these two regions, we imputed SNPs in these regions of chromosomes 10 and 14 (Fig. 3 ). Observed and imputed genotypes for those two regions overall were in high (chr10) to moderate (chr14) linkage disequilibrium (LD). The most signiWcantly associated imputed SNPs (rs10761571 and rs7896712, both p = 3.7 \u00a3 10 \u00a18 ) on chromosome 10 are Xanked by the two genotyped SNPs that reached genome-wide signiWcance.

One imputed SNP (rs12147245, p = 2.1 \u00a3 10 \u00a18 ) in chromosome 14 was more signiWcantly associated with lung function decline than the genotyped SNP, and two additional, imputed SNPs were equally associated (rs177858 and rs177859, p = 9.9 \u00a3 10 \u00a17 ) (Fig. 4) . Height signiWcantly explained some variability in the absolute measurement of FEV 1 , but was not associated with lung function decline in our preliminary analyses, and the results of association of genetic markers with lung function decline were not meaningfully diVerent when height was included as a covariate in the model in sensitivity analyses (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this Wrst GWAS of lung function decline, we have identiWed two novel regions, one on chromosome 10 and one on chromosome 14, which were associated with decline in FEV 1 in a cohort of European Americans with mild COPD. The Lung Health Study is uniquely suited to investigate genetic risk to smoking-induced lung function decline as it includes over 4,000 smokers with airXow limitation who have exquisitely characterized smoking status and annual lung function over 5 years and designed with rate of lung function decline as the primary endpoint of the study. Two intergenic SNPs (rs10761570 and rs7911302) on chromosome 10 and one SNP on chromosome 14 (rs177852) met a Bonferroni threshold of genome-wide signiWcance for the outcome, rate of decline of lung function. Further support for the chromosome 10 locus was obtained by imputing additional markers, where the most signiWcantly associated imputed SNPs (rs10761571 and rs7896712) were Xanked by the two observed markers (rs10761570 and rs7911302). Immunohistochemistry performed on lung tissue from smokers demonstrated, for the Wrst time, that ANK3, TMEM26 and FOXA1 proteins, which are encoded by genes neighboring the most signiWcant SNPs in the GWAS, were expressed in the airway epithelium, lung parenchyma or alveolar macrophages, with diVerential expression in smokers with airways obstruction compared to smokers without airways obstruction. These results implicate these genes as novel biologically plausible candidate genes for lung function decline and COPD pathogenesis.\nUsing the ENCODE database (http://www.genome.gov/ 10005107), the chromosome 10q21.2 region has been determined to be a regulatory region with very speciWc binding sites for several regulatory proteins, including NFkB and STAT1, both of which have been implicated in COPD Clarke et al. 2010) . Furthermore, the most signiWcantly associated SNPs are Xanked by RHO-BTB1, CDK1 and ANK3 (upstream) and TMEM26 (downstream). Using both real-time PCR and immunohisto chemistry, we saw protein expression of ANK3, TMEM26 and FOXA1, but negligible expression of RHOBTB1 and CDK1, in human lung tissue specimens irrespective of COPD status (data not shown). Ankyrins play a key role in activities such as cell motility, activation, proliferation, contact and the maintenance of specialized membrane domains. In humans, ANK3 proteins have been identiWed in a variety of epithelial cells, bone marrow macrophages and neurons (Hoock et al. 1997; Kizhatil et al. 2007 ). We demonstrate the novel Wnding that ANK3 protein is expressed in alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, its expression was higher in alveolar macrophages from subjects with COPD compared to at-risk smokers without evidence of airways obstruction. Little is known about TMEM26 (transmembrane protein 26). It has previously been identiWed in a GWAS as being associated with blood pressure (Newton-Cheh 2009) . This is the Wrst demonstration that TMEM26 is expressed in airway epithelium and lung parenchyma, and smokers with airways obstruction had increased parenchymal, but decreased TMEM26 Fig. 5 Localization of TMEM26 and ANK3 in lungs of smokers with and without COPD. a Representative TMEM26 immunohistochemical staining of lung sections from at-risk and COPD patients shows staining in the cytoplasm of airway epithelium.

Numbers in columns indicate number of samples examined expression compared to smokers without airways obstruction. Except for subjects without COPD who were homozygous for the chromosome 10 risk allele (rs177852 (CC)) having increased TMEM26 staining compared to those without the risk allele in the LTRC samples, no associations were observed between genotype and protein expression. This may be because the susceptibility alleles do not inXuence risk by changing the level of protein expression, or because immunohistochemistry is insensitive to detect changes in the level of expression. Immunohistochemistry has utility for the detection of changes in the area fraction stained positive and but not the intensity of staining as would be the case if the same number of cells expressed more protein. In addition, we were likely underpowered to detect an association given our small sample size in the immunohistochemistry studies. Although the genetic associations observed in the current study do not implicate any of these genes directly, the location of the association signal and the novel Wnding of protein expression of ANK3 and TMEM26 in lung tissue and association with airways obstruction suggest these genes may be involved in COPD pathogenesis.\nThe chromosome 14 region also met genome-wide signiWcance for association with lung function decline. The gene encoding forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), previously termed hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-3), is in the vicinity of the most signiWcant SNPs and encodes a transcription factor previously known to be expressed in epithelial cells of the conducting airways and in type II alveolar epithelial cells (Besnard et al. 2005) . FOXA1 may regulate respiratory epithelial diVerentiation and structural maturation of the lung during development (Besnard et al. 2005) and has recently been reported to play a role in regulation of apoptotic cell death in various diseases. SpeciWcally, it has been shown to play a pro-apoptotic role during oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis in type II pneumocytes (Song et al. 2009a) . Over-expression of FOXA1 has been shown to promote apoptosis (Song et al. 2009b) , which has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to COPD and emphysema progression (Tuder et al. 2006) . We demonstrate expression of FOXA1 protein in airway epithelium and lung parenchyma. Furthermore, FOXA1 expression was inversely associated with lung function, increased expression in alveolar and airway epithelium in subjects with severe airway obstruction compared with smokers without airways obstruction. An RNA seq-based survey of a limited number of small airway brush specimens conWrmed expression of FOXA1 and ANK3 genes in the lungs of COPD patients (R.C., data not shown). Together these data support FOXA1 as a biologically plausible candidate gene for the pathogenesis of COPD.\nThere are several potential reasons for the lack of replication in general population cohorts. First, genetic factors inXuencing susceptibility to cigarette smoke might have little or no inXuence on the rate of lung function decline due to aging in general population cohorts. Accelerated lung function decline is likely to be strongly aVected by environmental exposures, particularly cigarette smoking, and therefore requires both a suYcient environmental exposure and a genetically susceptible individual. Second, in the LHS accurately accounting for the eVects of cessation and re-initiation of smoking greatly aVected an individual's lung function trajectory. For this reason, we included subjects' smoking habits in three diVerent time-varying covariates, including average number of cigarettes smoked per day over the previous year at each annual visit and a subject's smoking status for each of the two previous years to model the eVects of starting/quitting smoking. It is therefore not surprising that, in general populations not speciWcally designed to assess longitudinal changes in lung function, self-report of cigarette smoking ascertained at intervals spanning several years may not accurately reXect the intermittency of smoking exposure. Failure to incorporate eVects of intermittent smoking may lead to a considerable residual confounding by smoking exposure, and consequently, an underestimation of the importance of genetic factors. Indeed, previous results from the FHS showed estimates of heritability in lung function decline among relatives increased when the analysis was restricted to relative pairs concordant for smoking status (Gottlieb et al. 2001) . Given the comprehensive evaluation of smoking status at each annual visit in LHS, this cohort of smokers is uniquely suited to identify genetic factors underlying smoking-related lung function decline. Third, despite high correlation between pre-and post-BD spirometry, pre-BD FEV 1 may be reduced due to bronchoconstriction as well as by airway remodeling. Thus, genetic factors contributing to post-BD FEV 1 may not be identiWed in a study where the outcome is pre-BD spirometry. The ECLIPSE cohort is most similar to the LHS cohort because it involves subjects who were recruited because they had COPD and because it incorporated regular assessment of post-BD spirometry and smoking status. However, ECLIPSE includes only subjects who have moderate, severe, or very severe COPD (mean baseline FEV 1 of 48 % predicted) . The factors associated with lung function decline in the later stages of disease may be diVerent from those associated with rates of decline in early stage COPD. For instance, the rate of lung function decline may decelerate in those with more severe disease; (Celli et al. 2008) or may be modiWed by medications used to treat those with more severe disease (i.e., combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists) (Celli et al. 2008) . One notable diVerence between the studies was that bronchodilator reversibility was found to be associated with lung function decline in subjects with moderate-severe COPD in ECLIPSE but not in those with early stage COPD in LHS Anthonisen et al. 2005 ). Lack of available cohorts with mild-moderate COPD with longitudinal assessment of post-BD lung function and smoking status ascertained at annual visits was likely a key limiting factor in appropriate replication; however, despite correction for multiple testing, we cannot exclude the possibility that the signals were false-positive results of the GWAS.\nIn summary, we have identiWed two novel regions, one on chromosome 10 and one on chromosome 14, associated with decline in FEV 1 in a longitudinal cohort of smokers with COPD. These results appear to be unique to smoking individuals who have mild to moderate COPD. In addition, immunohistochemistry results conWrmed localization of proteins coded by genes in the vicinity of the most signiWcant SNPs, including TMEM26, ANK3 and FOXA1, and suggest diVerential expression in the lungs of subjects with COPD compared to non-obstructed smokers. These results implicate two novel loci likely involved in lung function decline in smokers with early COPD.
