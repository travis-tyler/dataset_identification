The 2011 report used just the second method, and it, too, relied on the ACS. 1 All four reports calculate potential gaps, i.e., occupational demand exceeding potential supply by a substantial margin, by comparing the projected openings by educational level to the number of individuals completing or exiting from postsecondary programs in the state. The supply estimates are not based on forecasts. The higher education completions are adjusted downward to reflect the fact that a percentage of completers will not enter Washington's labor market; in some cases, they have been adjusted upward to reflect the possibility that upskilling of occupations will occur over time.\nThe purpose of this report is to assess the methods used by the Washington agencies to estimate the balance between occupational demands by educational level and the potential supply of individuals who will be available to fill those demands. We offer several recommendations that we believe would improve upon the methods or data that have been used. To inform our recommendations, we have analyzed data from several sources. For the most part, these data sources have not been used by state analysts in prior studies. In some cases, however, the data sources have been used, but we employ different data restrictions.\nIn addition to the methodological suggestions based on empirical analyses of data sets, we offer some recommendations based on a critique of the prior studies.\nThe next section of the report focuses on the methods used to project job openings by education level. It provides a summary of our understanding of the methods employed in producing the 2013 report, and then presents our recommendation to forecast the demand side based on actual openings or based on new hires. The third section of the report turns to the supply side of the equation. In other words, it addresses the techniques for translating the numbers of individuals completing or exiting from their educational experiences, by instructional program, to the occupations that they may choose to enter. In shorthand, this section is about the crosswalk from the classification of instructional programs (CIP) to the standard occupational classification (SOC) system. The section summarizes our understanding of the methods used in the 2013 report, provides a description of analyses of alternative data sources, and presents potential alternative approaches. The final section of the report provides our recommendations that do not rely on data analyses."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PROJECTION OF JOB OPENINGS BY EDUCATION LEVEL", "text": "A."}, {"section_title": "Summary of 2013 Methods", "text": "As with all of the prior studies, the 2013 analysis begins with the forecasts of annual job openings by region and occupation supplied by ESD. According to documentation and our conversations with ESD, predictions from the Global Insight model are used as regressors in augmented autoregressive (AR) equations to forecast aggregated industry projections for the state, which are disaggregated to four-digit NAICS industry codes by county using Quarterly Census on Employment and Wages (QCEW) data and predictive models estimated in SAS. This disaggregation is done mostly by ratio adjustment using the latest available QCEW, subject to certain censoring rules and some regression adjustment. The county data are then aggregated to workforce development areas (WDAs).\nThe projections of openings by industry, which include both new and replacement openings, are converted to occupation projections by ratio adjustment using data from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. The ESD document suggests that a few ad hoc adjustments are made at this step due to limited industry coverage of the OES. Furthermore, the ESD document alludes to the use of \"change factors\", created by BLS, to predict changes in occupational shares for each industry over time. 2 In our conversation with ESD, we learned that these change factors are used conservatively and play a minor role in adjusting the forecasts.\nThe 2013 study distributes the annual projections of openings by detailed occupation to openings by occupation and educational level using two different occupation/education mappings: (1) the BLS-derived education levels needed to enter an occupation and (2) actual education levels possess by incumbent employees in occupations as tabulated from the American Community Survey (ACS). The report refers to the former approach as the \"entry-level\" educational level needed to fill an opening and the latter as the \"competitive\" educational level. It is worth emphasizing that the BLS \"entry-level\" method assigns a single education level to each occupation; the ACS \"competitive\" method allows multiple education levels for each occupation. The educational distributions used in the 2013 study encompass five categories: high school or less; less than one year of postsecondary education; mid-level (apprenticeship, one or more years of postsecondary education, or associate's degree); bachelor's degree; and graduate degrees. The study focuses on occupations assigned to the latter three categories.\nEach of the two methods used to distribute openings to educational levels has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantages for the BLS entry-level approach are its relative simplicity-a single educational level for an occupation-and its conceptually appropriate definition-it purports to be based on the entry requirements as observed in task analysis of actual jobs. The main disadvantages of this approach are that it doesn't reflect the range of educational levels at entry within an occupation, and it is abstract and static and not necessarily reflective of true requirements over time.\nThe main advantages of the competitive level based are that the large sample sizes in the ACS allow for the statistical identification of educational requirements for detailed occupations in subnational geographies, and the distributions are empirically derived and reflect changes over time. The main disadvantage of this approach may be referred to as incumbent worker bias. Since the distributions are derived from all workers, they include individuals who may have gained education on the job (e.g., teachers or firefighters) as well as older workers who may have entered the occupation when requirements were different than today (e.g., pharmacists or physical therapists). This bias may be positive or negative. It may be possible to reduce incumbent bias through restrictions on the data; however, this is cumbersome and ad hoc."}, {"section_title": "B. Description of Other Sources Based on Actual Openings or New Hires", "text": "After reviewing the method used in the 2013 study and analyzing several other data sets, we recommend that the state consider using an approach based on the actual openings for jobs as derived from aggregating online postings, or using an approach based on the educational levels of individuals who have begun employment spells. Alternatively, the state could employ methods based on using another survey to supplement the ACS."}, {"section_title": "Actual Openings from Job Postings", "text": "Job postings data consist of electronically posted vacancies that are collected, parsed, and systematized via computer algorithms. They can provide labor market information in real time and include changes driven by labor market conditions, unlike traditional survey data (such as the ACS) which often come with a significant time lag. Because detailed information including job title is collected, they can also provide a higher level of specificity than is typically found in survey data; for example, job postings data can distinguish demand for preschool administrators from college administrators. Importantly, they capture the conceptually appropriate definition of new jobs, avoiding incumbent worker bias. However, job postings data do not generally provide as complete job coverage as the survey data, as not all jobs are advertised electronically, and they have not been as thoroughly tested for reliability.\nTwo major sources of job postings data are Burning Glass Technologies and the Conference Board's Help Wanted Online Index (HWOL, which employs data from Wanted Technologies.) Both sources require a subscription and fees for access. In comparing these two sources with BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, the government's official statistics on job openings, we found that overall trends in volume are similar, although levels vary.\n3 HWOL, to which ESD subscribes, provides more thorough coverage of occupations than does Burning Glass. In particular, Burning Glass appears to undercount jobs in agriculture and construction relative to HWOL. 4 A critical advantage of the Burning Glass data, on the other hand, is that they provide the educational requirements of the postings-if they are presentwhile HWOL data do not.\nOf course, not all job postings specify education requirements. Across all postings in the 2010 to 2013 period, 53 percent listed such requirements, but some occupations are more likely to list them than others. In particular, occupations that cluster at both the extreme high and low ends of the education spectrum are less likely to specify necessary education in postings. For certain highly skilled occupations, such as medical doctors and lawyers, the lack of listed education requirements likely stems from an assumption that these professions almost universally require a terminal and specific degree. For many less skilled occupations, such as hairdressers and food servers, unspecified education requirements may mean that no formal education is needed (although specific training, skills, and experience might be.) 5 For the postings that do list education requirements, the algorithm used to classify them has been found fairly reliable. Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Repnikov (2014) determined that listed educational requirements were 85 percent accurate in quality control testing. This is comparable to typical national survey data (see Kane, Rouse, and Staiger 1999)."}, {"section_title": "New Hires from Current Population Survey", "text": "The Current Population Survey (CPS) is another source for education distributions across occupations. Rather than looking at incumbent workers, as in the ACS, the longitudinal nature of the CPS allows the identification of workers who have taken a new job between one month and the next. The education of these workers can then be tabulated by their new occupation.\nThis source also provides a conceptually appropriate definition of labor demand by capturing the education distribution of newly hired workers. Furthermore, the data are readily available without charge, and sample sizes become sufficient for detail at the national, 5-digit SOC level when data are aggregated over time. However, longitudinally linking the same individuals over time is somewhat complicated, and unlike postings data, sample sizes are too small for identifying state-level education distributions. Additionally, occupational coding 3 JOLTS data provide openings by industry but not by occupation. 4 In turn, HWOL undercounts these jobs relative to Washington's (recently discontinued) ESDadministered occupational vacancy survey.\n5 For the 6-digit SOC occupations for which we have postings data, we have regressed the share of postings not specifying education requirements on the shares specifying different education levels, where these latter shares are conditional on postings that did specify education requirements. There is a strong positive association between the share requiring high school degree or less and the probability of not specifying education requirements. There was no association at the mid-level or graduate-degree level, and there was a strong negative relationship at the bachelor's-degree level.\nerror-which exists in any survey-is exacerbated when looking at job changes.

Designed to capture detailed reporting of income from multiple sources, it also provides much greater detail on education than the CPS or ACS. It is the only representative data source that allows empirical separation, by occupation, of the \"some college, no degree\" category into those who have certificates and those who do not. Work by Carnevale et al. (2012) and Jacobson (2011) demonstrates how certain certificates can provide a substantial earnings return relative to those with college credits but no credential (especially true for certificates in skilled trades, such as welding and vehicle repair.) Moreover, it contains information on field of study for the highest credential earned, whether the credential is a certificate, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or graduate degree. This may help refine the CIP-SOC crosswalks for additional occupations.\nOn the other hand, there are compelling reasons for the SIPP to serve as a supplemental rather than primary source for determining education distributions of occupations. Like the ACS, it captures incumbent workers rather than new hires, but it lacks the tremendous sample size and generally does not provide sufficient precision for detailed occupations. Furthermore, new waves of households are sampled infrequently relative to other sources, so rapidly occurring changes in education requirements will be missed."}, {"section_title": "b. ACS with restricted age ranges", "text": "As noted above, a drawback of using all workers in the ACS is incumbency bias, in which workers who have acquired additional education on the job or entered an occupation in the past under different educational pathways cannot be separated from workers taking jobs recently. A simple and straightforward (if ad hoc) modification is tabulating educational distributions for a subset of workers, such as those between the ages of 25 and 34. Workers in this age range are less likely to suffer from incumbency bias and more likely to capture relatively recent hires. While we readily acknowledge that not all new hires fall into this age range, including those completing new educational training as well as more experienced job changers, the age restriction may serve as a reasonable proxy for employment demand that balances simplicity with accuracy. This assumption may not hold as well for occupations that almost universally require extensive experience for entry, such as management occupations. In order to evaluate the validity of age-based proxies, we can use the CPS to identify the age distributions of newly hired workers by detailed occupations or broader occupational groups. Such a data-driven approach can serve to refine the appropriate age restriction to use in the ACS. This would trade simplicity for better accuracy."}, {"section_title": "c. O*Net", "text": "O*Net is the successor to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and provides hundreds of characteristics-including required education-for detailed occupations. These characteristics are drawn from surveys and interviews of either incumbent workers or human resource experts. While the O*Net database is the only non-empirical source we review (besides the BLS measure), it does allow for a range of educational requirements for each occupation based on what the interviewed individuals thought was the necessary preparation to be hired into that occupation."}, {"section_title": "C. Analysis of Sources", "text": "For each of these sources, we have tabulated the education distribution of workers for each SOC occupation at the 4-, 5-, and 6-digit levels. The education distribution we use has eight categories: less than high school, high school diploma or equivalent, some college but no credential, certificate, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and professional or doctorate degree. (These easily can be collapsed to match the 2013 report's five categories.) These distributions are found in the supplementary spreadsheet OCC_edreq_master.xlsx.\nOur initial goal is to determine empirically the similarity of the occupation-specific education distributions across the different sources. A simple and transparent approach is to examine modal education for each occupation. We illustrate this approach in Table 1 using the BLS distribution as a reference. The table shows how many detailed occupations, within broader occupation groups, have modal education across sources that match the BLS level. The four sources used in the comparison include O*Net, ACS (as used in the 2013 report), CPS new hires, and Burning Glass job postings.\nGenerally speaking, modal education across occupations and sources does not match the BLS distribution especially well. For the ACS, CPS, and Burning Glass, roughly 60 percent of occupations have the same modal education as BLS, whereas O*Net agrees slightly more at approximately 70 percent. 6 However, some occupational groups match better than others.\nManagement, business, and production occupations consistently match at a 75 percent or higher rate across sources; scientist, sales, and transportation occupations consistently match at a roughly 50 percent or below rate; and healthcare support, protective service, food preparation, and office/administrative occupations match highly in some sources and poorly in others.\nThese differences may stem from incumbency bias (particularly in the ACS), but they may also reflect real (conceptually-consistent) differences in education requirements across sources. To examine this possibility, we develop a more systematic-if more complicatedmethod of comparing educational distributions across sources. Specifically, we construct an index of dissimilarity that can be used to compare any pair of sources (including additional restrictions on a given source) across all SOC occupations. The formula for this index is given in Appendix 1. Our index of dissimilarity has two important features. First, it captures ordinal differences in education distributions. For example, if sources disagree only over the relative shares of workers with high school diplomas and those with some college but no credential, their dissimilarity will be smaller than if they disagreed over the relative shares with high school diplomas and with bachelor's degrees. Second, as the magnitude of a disagreement increases, its effect on dissimilarity increases more than proportionately. From a quick view of the table, it should be immediately apparent that the BLS source is an outlier, significantly disagreeing from every other source. This is a direct consequence of that source allowing only a single education level for each occupation. Sources that permit a broader distribution are more similar to one another. Unsurprisingly, versions of the same source (such as different restrictions of the ACS or Burning Glass postings) are also more similar to each other than to other sources. Finally, sources that are meant to capture the same concept of worker (incumbents: ACS and SIPP; new workers: BG and CPS) are more similar to each other, as well.\nThe Burning Glass index values are of roughly the same order as O*Net values. While these are higher than the incumbent workers in the ACS or SIPP, or even the more appropriate new worker concept in the CPS, the BG distributions generally exist for more detailed occupations than the other sources and can be calculated at the state level. In the next section, we illustrate how alternative sources can change the supply-demand gaps for select occupations and occupation groups. Finally, we have also tabulated the 6-digit SOC occupations that exhibit the greatest dissimilarity in educational requirements across data sources. These occupations, along with their average dissimilarity across sources and the source pairs that have the largest index values, are shown in Appendix Table 1 near the end of the document. There is little consistent pattern among these occupations: they include managerial and professional positions (SOCs 11 and 13) as well as artistic and athletic occupations (SOC 27) and other service and manufacturing jobs.\nHowever, the BLS education requirements are almost always in a source pair with the greatest dissimilarity."}, {"section_title": "D.

Table 3 compares demand (and resulting gaps) across the different sources of the education distribution for aerospace engineers. For this occupation, the ACS and CPS measures agree fairly closely, despite the different definition of worker. This may be due to experienced workers changing jobs laterally rather than entering the profession and may not hold for other occupations. The Burning Glass numbers are more similar to the BLS measure except they allow separation of demand above the baccalaureate level.\nThe bottom panel provides no roll-up adjustment to a minimum bachelor's degree; that is, it takes the educational distribution as given.

Recommended Approaches", "text": "We have also tabulated the age distribution of new hires using the CPS. Table 5 shows these distributions for 2-digit SOC groups. In general, more skilled occupations have an older distribution of workers entering them than less skilled occupations. If the joint agencies wish to continue using incumbent workers from the ACS in obtaining education distributions, a simple refinement to mitigate incumbency bias is to condition the ACS analysis sample on the interquartile range of the ages of new workers as shown below. This refinement is likely to matter most for management and food preparation occupations, whose age distributions are substantially older and younger, respectively, than other occupation groups.\nWe further caution against the use of the BLS typical education entry path to assign education to occupational openings. Although it is simple to use, the mapping does not appear to be especially reliable and does not reflect the multiplicity of educational demand for many occupations. In our comparison of sources, the BLS measure was consistently dissimilar to every other source. For some occupations, such as community health workers (SOC 21-1094), social and human service assistants (SOC 21-1093), and occupational safety technicians (SOC 29-9012), using the BLS measure instead of more reliable measures could lead to understated or missed supply gaps, as the BLS education level is substantially lower than other sources. For other occupations, such as heavy truck drivers (SOC 53-3032) and telecommunications equipment installers (SOC 49-2022) , the BLS measure may overstate a shortage, as it posits a higher education level than other sources. (At broader levels, BLS tends to understate education in the 21, 27, 29 and 41 2-digit SOC groups, especially, and overstate it in the 49 and 53 2-digit SOC groups.)\nAlthough the relatively small sample sizes of the SIPP preclude its use as the primary source for education distributions for occupations, it still may be highly relevant in identifying occupations that have a high concentration of certificates within the \"some college, no degree\" category. The SIPP-calculated certificate share for more populated occupations (or all occupational groups) could then be applied to the ACS by ratio adjustment. We acknowledge this level of detail may not be necessary for Skills Gap reports.

It also allows consistency with the gap analysis for bachelor's and graduate-level occupations. While it would be ideal to use one single data source to construct empirical cross-tabulations of occupation and field of study, this may not be feasible or practical due to issues of coverage and sample size.

On the other hand, the empirical crosswalk attributes more density to business, management, and sales occupations among professional (health, legal) graduates; this density generally comes from administrative, education, and human service occupations, leaving relatively similar the density in the respective professional occupation. Also of note is that the NSCG has far fewer math and computer science graduates going into computer science occupations than does the CIP-SOC matching method. The math graduates are more likely to be in education occupations, the computer science graduates are more likely to be in business occupations, and both are more likely to be in engineering occupations.

While there is a 2012 follow-up, this is unlikely to be a sufficiently long time-horizon for these students to have earned graduate degrees and entered the workforce. 20 The sample size in the NSCG is sufficient to create a more detailed crosswalk at the 2-digit CIP by 2-digit SOC level.

However, the gap in computer science occupations will increase further.\nThe NSCG can also be used to construct a bachelor's-level crosswalk, but we do not recommend this approach because the ACS has even larger sample sizes, permitting Washington-specific tabulations, and is updated annually. For the mid-level crosswalk, we recommend that empirical tabulations from the SIPP be used to assign fields of study to occupational groups. For the bachelor's-level crosswalk, we recommend that the ACS continue to be used to construct such mappings. For the graduate-level crosswalk, we recommend that the CIP-SOC match method be replaced with empirical tabulations from the NSCG."}, {"section_title": "IV. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Statistical Uncertainty and Forecast Error", "text": "The current report methodology does not provide the reader with any indication that demand projections and supply-demand gaps are calculated with statistical error. In our estimation, the largest source of statistical error stems from the employment demand projections, with a smaller role on the supply side from incomplete correction for growth in supply and labor force entry adjustments. While it is beyond the scope of this report to propose a system for implementation of confidence intervals or other measures of statistical uncertainty, we do recommend a few simple steps that suggest to the reader that supply-demand gaps are estimates and have bounded precision.\n(1) Round supply and demand figures in each relevant cell to the nearest hundred for aggregate categories. Providing unit-level numbers provides a false sense of precision.\n(2) Take a three-year average of completion data. While this will mask rapidly changing trends it will guard against errant fluctuations in a single year in smaller fields."}, {"section_title": "B. In-migrants (and Out-migrants)", "text": "Projections in the current (and past) reports mention but explicitly do not account for both international and interstate domestic migration. The State of Washington has lately exhibited net in-migration, both domestically from other states and internationally. It is likely that many of these moves are job-driven or at least job-related. Standard economic theory posits that inmigration will respond (through wages) to excess demand for certain occupations. While we recognize that the state is concerned with whether it can self-supply the skills and education to meet employer demand, we note that the labor market for certain occupations (and among certain employers), especially higher-skilled ones, is national and even international. Even if Washington were to increase the supply of graduates with training for these occupations, it is not clear that this supply would fully displace workers hired from outside the state. Similarly, if Washington were to decrease the supply of graduates for which there is a perceived surplus, it is not clear these workers would find other employment within the state, as it might manifest through reduced out-migration. While more fully addressing the question of how to treat migrants in calculations of supply-demand gaps is beyond the scope of this report, we believe that the agencies should consider briefly mentioning in future reports that migration often serves to partially mitigate supply-demand imbalances, either for a shortage (in-migration) or a surplus (out-migration)."}, {"section_title": "C. Licenses and Other Supply Adjustments", "text": "State licensure restrictions affect potential supply for many occupations besides nursing (see http://www.dol.wa.gov/listoflicenses.html.) While nursing is an in-demand occupation receiving particular focus, other licensed occupations may meet this criterion as well without receiving licensure-based supply adjustments. Colorado, for example, applies licensure-based supply estimates for K-12 teachers, as bachelor's degrees earned in education are even less likely to lead to teaching jobs than nursing baccalaureates are to nursing jobs. (See Colorado Department of Education [2014] and http://benschmidt.org/jobs/.) Besides health occupations, almost all of which require licensure regardless of education level, other in-demand jobs where licensure may affect supply include (at the mid-level): electricians, plumbers, and certain mechanics; (at the bachelor's degree level): accountants, teachers, and most engineers; and (at the graduate level): lawyers and social workers. In each of these cases, the joint agencies may wish in the future to request licensure data to adjust supply in a manner similar to that used for registered nurses.\nFurthermore, a substantial share of students earning mid-level credentials has already entered the labor force. As documented in previous reports, the median age of students completing mid-level credentials is approximately 30. While some of these students may be using their new credentials to take new jobs, many of them may instead use them to advance in their current position. If this latter phenomenon is widespread, the effective supply of new midlevel completers may be overestimated.\nAn analysis of anonymized Washington unemployment insurance files merged with 2011\u22122012 completion records from the SBCTC and PVS (which constitute the majority of granters of mid-level credentials) show that only 52 percent of completers are employed in new industries in the four quarters after completing their credential, relative to when they began their program (or in the quarter before they finished for longer programs). This share also varies somewhat by field of study, ranging from 29 percent in education programs to 63 percent for mechanical repair programs. Changing industry of employment is only a crude proxy for taking a new job, but these results indicate a substantial share of mid-level completers may be upgrading their skills with their current employer and not filling new openings.\nWe recommend that the joint agencies consider adjusting supply of mid-level completers-especially for in-demand occupations-to account for the share that continues on with their current employer. Program files that provide the algorithm for calculating these shares by educational program are available on request."}, {"section_title": "D. Annual forecasts from ESD", "text": "The joint report on \"A Skilled and Educated Workforce\" compares the current supply of potential workers, which is based on credentials produced in state, with long-term projected openings on an annualized basis. The original RFP asked for the most efficient way to convert the measure of mean annual job openings over a 5-year or 10-year span into the projected job openings in a calendar year. In our conversations with ESD analysts, we learned that job projections are produced using a monthly time-series for specified time horizons at 2, 5 and 10 years out. The projections at each horizon require significant balancing and validation checks that preclude the simple provision of the estimates from intermediate horizons. Nonetheless, the 2-year-out projection that ESD currently produces could be incorporated into a procedure for the joint report to annualize projected job openings. Specifically, an exponential growth model could be fit for each occupation based on these three data points (2, 5, and 10 years out); the additional data point beyond that needed to define the growth parameter allows for a goodness-of-fit criterion for the growth model, and occupations meeting a certain threshold could be amenable for annualized estimates. While it may not be (budgetarily) feasible, we believe it would also be helpful for ESD to construct forecasts at the 1-year horizon in addition to the other horizons in order to improve the validation of the growth models. Such validation could also be used to generate predication-based confidence intervals, should the joint agencies believe these would add value."}, {"section_title": "E. Vacancy Surveys", "text": "Currently, WTECB conducts a biennial employer needs and practices survey (subject to budgetary approval). In addition, ESD until recently conducted a semiannual job vacancy and hiring survey. The latter was intended to collect information on job vacancies, recent hires, and expected future vacancies by occupation and industry, firm size, educational demand, experience required, and geography. It, however, has been discontinued for budgetary reasons. The former survey is intended to provide context to how employers go through the hiring process and the difficulties they perceive. Because these surveys are closely thematically related and even overlap directly on a few questions, we believe there may be scope to combine them to reduce costs and respondent burdens. We recommend ESD and WTECB communicate with each other in an attempt to optimize a single survey design for the interests of both agencies. For example, while the ESD vacancy survey directly asked education requirements for current openings by occupation, it did not ask the education of newly hired workers. Adding this element (or a similar one asking whether the new hire met the educational requirements advertised) could be useful in determining employer difficulty in hiring and how they respond. The two agencies, perhaps in cooperation with WSAC and SBCTC, could then propose a unified survey for legislative and budgetary approval that describes how the survey would benefit the several agencies. As such, a survey has the potential to meet the legislatively mandated requirements of multiple state agencies, there may be greater political will to allow its implementation."}, {"section_title": "V.

Weighting each occupation by its share of the total workforce, , prioritizes similarity among larger occupations. 21 This version of the index is:\nOur index of dissimilarity has two important features. First, it captures ordinal differences in education distributions. For example, if sources disagree only over the relative shares of workers with high school diplomas and those with some college but no credential, their dissimilarity will be smaller than if they disagreed over the relative shares with high school diplomas and with bachelor's degrees. Second, as the magnitude of a disagreement increases, its effect on dissimilarity increases more than proportionately.\nIf sources match exactly for all occupations, = 0. The maximum possible value for is 1, which occurs if all occupations have polar opposite education distributions. For ease in interpretation, we multiply D by 100 in this report. Table 2 .
