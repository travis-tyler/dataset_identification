These data were derived from the analysis of multiple dates of remotely sensed Landsat imagery [22] and were obtained from the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) for 1996, 2001, and 2006 [38]. The details of C-CAP data can be found in the NOAA website [39]. Because the classification algorithms and schema were not identical for these data, we followed a three-steps procedure to standardize the data for our analysis. We classified the data into land use types that are related to invasive species studies/models. Beginning with the C-CAP data, we reclassified the previous LULC classes into 12 classes, including built-up area, urban grassland, pasture (including pasture land and wild grassland), cropland, shrub land (including scrub and shrub land), deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, water body, emergent wetland, woody wetland, and barren land ( Table 1).

Once all reclassifications and adjustments based on the NLCD 1992-2001 Retrofit Land Cover Change Product were performed, we used the 2006 map to disallow transitions from built-up areas to vegetated classes (a conversion that is unlikely, possibly due to LULC misclassification [41]).

A landscape transition probability matrix can be calculated by analyzing two LULC maps from different dates. Two transition matrices for the period of 1996-2001 and 2001-2006 were calculated by using the LULC maps of 1996, 2001 and 2006 (Tables 2 and 3). These matrices have the information of probability of conversion from each class to those of other classes. The transition matrix of 1996-2001 (Table 2) was used for predicting the LULC in 2006. This prediction was used for model validation. Because the State's COPD (2013-2018) was published by its Office of Policy and Management and was used as one of the variables in the model, we decided to predict LULC in 2018. Therefore, the transition matrix of 2001-2006 (Table 3) was used for predicting the future LULC in 2018. Because the projected time period (2006-2018) was not a multiple of the calibration period, three transition matrices were generated by a power rule. The values at each cell in the transition probability matrices were then fed into a quadratic regression. Therefore, there is a separate regression for each cell. The unknown transition probabilities were then interpolated by using the regression [61,62]. We ultimately implemented the MLP_MC model within the Land Change Modeler available in IDRISI Selva software [60] to analyze and predict LULC changes in Connecticut.  To avoid oscillating weight changes, the momentum factor was defined. Therefore, the calculated weight changes would not always be the same. A high momentum parameter can also help to increase the convergence speed of the system. However, setting the momentum parameter too high can create a risk of overshooting the minimum of change values, which can cause the system to become unstable. The rate parameters that control the size of weights and bias were set by using a training algorithm. The learning rate and momentum of the training algorithm were set based on trials and experiences. Both values have a range between 0 and 1. These factors can be set dynamically during runtime. In the present study, the momentum factor for the MLP_MC model was set to 0.5 and a dynamic learning rate was used. The outputs of MLP (values between 0 and 1) were used to express the potential of change. MLP neural network analysis was used to determine the weights of the transitions that would be included in the matrix of Markov chain transition probabilities for future prediction [63]."}, {"section_title": "Investigation on How Short-Term Land Use Changes May Affect Landscape Scale Japanese Barberry Invasion Probability", "text": "We focused on an abundant invasive shrub in Connecticut to investigate the effects of land use change on probability of presence. The projections were based on the previously published models of Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry) [64], a perennial shrub native to East Asia that was introduced as an ornamental species to the northeast in 1875 [1]. The model, constructed in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and focused on New England (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), was based on georeferenced presence and absence observations and local-scale habitat data collected from 2003-2009 as part of the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England project [65], native range presence and absence data [66], regional climate from the WorldClim database (average 1950-2000) [67], and landscape-scale LULC (2006) [22,64]. We used the best fit model for Japanese barberry in Ibanez et al. [35], which included five climate variables, six LULC variables, and two habitat variables (percent canopy coverage and presence of the most suitable local habitat, deciduous forest) (Table 4). Since predictions were made at a 5-min scale (see below), we set the canopy closure variable to 37 (representing the regional average) and the local habitat (deciduous forest) variable to 1 (representing assumed availability of a suitable local habitat patch within each 5 1\u02c651 grid cell) following Ibanez et al. [35]. We made predictions using the parameters in Table 4 for 2006 and 2018 independently, and using observed LULC data in 2006 and our LULC model predictions for 2018. The original model was a logistic regression, so we converted the output of the prediction for each grid cell to a probability using the equation P (presence) = 1/(1 + exp(X\u03b2)), where X is the matrix of covariates (i.e., one observation of each covariate in Table 4 for each grid cell) and \u03b2 is the vector of parameter estimates. We estimated changes in the predicted probability of presence of Japanese barberry as the difference P (presence) in 2018\u00b4P (presence) in 2006. The changes in presence probability were driven by changes in the landscape-scale summaries of LULC, but not climate, since we assumed climate to remain relatively unchanged on a near-term, 12-year timescale. The models used regional and landscape variables at a 5-min scale, so we summarized our 2006 and 2018 LULC data to that scale, as percentages of each 5-min grid cell covered by each LULC category using the Geospatial Modeling Environment [68]. The models also simplified the LULC classes, so we have reclassified our maps to the same scheme. We combined built-up area, urban grassland and barren land into developed area, deciduous forest and mixed forest into deciduous & mixed forest, and emergent wetland and woody wetland into wetland. We are able to leverage a sophisticated model for invasive species distributions in this way, and compare the model predictions-the probability of presence of Japanese barberry-for 2006 and 2018.

There is a notable increasing trend for built-up area and agriculture classes, whereas a decreasing trend can be observed for forest classes ( Table 5). According to Table 6, the net deciduous forest loss for the period of 1996-2001 is 2289 ha. Drummond and Loveland [26] indicated that the largest contribution to forest expansion was the forest gain from grassland and shrub during the 1973-2000 period in the eastern United States. The situation, however, is different in Connecticut. A large portion of the deciduous forest loss was due to the transition of deciduous forest to shrub, which was 1242 ha, equivalent to 54.26% of the total deciduous forest loss. Shrub's gain was also the result of the transition from evergreen forest to shrub (5.89%). The reader will recall that the \"succession\" process occurs when cleared areas transit naturally from grassland to shrub and then to forests. The gain of forest from scrub/shrub is small relative to its loss to other LULC classes, and it is possible that some deforested areas were classified into shrub. After a longer period, the areas will go through enough succession to become forest again. The transition of shrub to forest should be observed in the next period ( Table 7). The transition from deciduous forest to agriculture land (including cropland and pasture) was the second largest change, which was 527 ha, equivalent to 23.02% of the total deciduous forest loss. The third was the conversion of deciduous forest into built-up area, that is 229 ha and equivalent to 10% of the total deciduous loss. The shrub class increased by 1262 ha in total for this period, and the pasture class increased by 331 ha in total, which was mostly from deciduous forest. In some places, however, pasture was converted into built-up area (38 ha), cropland (36 ha) and urban grassland (31 ha). Alig et al. [69] and Tyrrell et al. [28] indicated that some pasture lands were relinquished to reforestation and frequently to development in the Northeastern United States, following the decline of the dairy industry. The situation was similar in Connecticut, but pasture lands were more likely to be converted into built-up area and cropland instead of forest. Cropland increased by 169 ha in total, which was mostly from deciduous forest. In some places, however, cropland was converted into barren land (22 ha) and built-up area (7 ha). For the period 2001-2006, the net deciduous forest loss was 2505 ha. Most of the deciduous forest was lost to built-up area, which was 1206 ha, equivalent to 48.14% of the total deciduous loss. The transition of deciduous forest to agriculture land (including cropland and Pasture) was the second largest in area at 783 ha or equivalent to 31.26% of the total deciduous loss. Third was the conversion into urban grassland, accounting for 13.25% of the total deciduous loss. The built-up area increased by 1547 ha in total for this period, and most of the gain (77.76%) resulted from the conversion of deciduous forest. The urban grassland class increased by 408 ha, also gaining from deciduous forest. It was observed that urban and agricultural expansions were the main driving forces for the changes in forest because of increased population, residential development and proximity to rapidly developing area during this period. The pasture class increased by 601 ha, mostly from deciduous forest, evergreen forest and mixed forest. In some places, however, pasture was converted into shrub (71 ha), cropland (41 ha) and built-up area (33 ha). Similar to the LULC changes in the previous period, the loss of pasture land was related to the change in dairy production.

It can help us understand how much a factor can influence LULC change. Normally, CVCs of about 0.15 or higher are considered important [70]. Although some factors' overall CVCs are slightly less than 0.15, the factors may still have relatively high values for specific LULC classes. For example, the overall CVC of elevation is 0.132, but CVCs of elevation with deciduous forest, urban grassland, built-up area, and water body are 0.306, 0.179, 0.170, and 0.156, respectively. This means that elevation has a relatively stronger relationship with the spread of deciduous forest. CVCs of slope with water, deciduous forest, and woody wetlands are 0.336, 0.307, and 0.158, respectively. Thus, slope appears to be a good predictor of water bodies and wetlands, because they are generally located in flat and lower areas. The results also indicate that slope has a similar influence on deciduous forest, as does elevation. Because of the small variation in topography and socioeconomic complexity, however, elevation and slope do not have large overall CVCs [71,72]. The DTR variable shows a good association with built-up area and deciduous forest, with CVCs of 0.483 and 0.356, respectively. Hence, it is one of the major drivers for forest change, because the development of new settlements tends to occur near existing settlements. CVCs of the DTC variable with cropland, pastures, and deciduous forest are 0.290, 0.176, and 0.142, respectively; and the CVCs of the DTP variable with pastures, deciduous forest, and built-up area are 0.501, 0.176, and 0.164, respectively. Both factors are useful in explaining the conversion of deciduous forest into agriculture. The CVC value of DTW with deciduous forest is 0.174, which indicates that the proximity to water has a relationship with forest change. CVCs of DTD with built-up area and urban grassland are 0.294 and 0.285, respectively, meaning that urban sprawl has a strong relationship with deforestation. The CVC of DTM with evergreen forest is 0.155. Similarly, the CVC of DTE with mixed forest is 0.154. Those two factors can partly explain the conversion between mixed forest and evergreen forest. CVCs of DTB with built-up area, deciduous forest, and urban grassland are 0.430, 0.380 and 0.266, respectively. Apparently, the DTB plays an important role in LULC change in Connecticut, such as reduction in forest areas and increased new settlement areas. Not surprisingly, deforestation is stronger at places closer to an existing built-up area. And the areas closer to existing built-up areas have higher probabilities of conversion to built-up areas. CVC values of population with deciduous forest, urban grassland, and built-up area are 0.209, 0.205 and 0.197, respectively. These results indicate that population pressure should be an important driving force to the increase of the built-up area and conversion of forest to other land use classes."}, {"section_title": "Model Validation", "text": "A predicted map for model validation was created for the year 2006 using the transition probability matrix estimated from the 1996 and 2001 LULC maps.

A three-way cross-tabulation between the real 2001 map, the real 2006 map, and the predicted 2006 map was conducted for the validation.

Then, comparing the actual change locations with the predicted change locations can find out where the prediction errors are located.

IDRISI Selva [73] provides a Validation Module, which can measure the agreement between two categorical maps. Cohen's kappa coefficient is a commonly used index, which measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative (categorical) items. Kappa is always less than or equal to 1. A value of 1 means perfect agreement. Pontius [74,75] suggested, however, that the standard Kappa coefficient cannot provide enough information because it does not have ability to distinguish the quantification error with the location error [74,75]. In order to solve this problem, two more kappa statistics are provided: Kappa for no information (Kno), and Kappa for grid-cell level location (Klocation). The Kno statistic is an improved general statistic over the traditional Kappa Index of Agreement (Kstandard), as it penalizes large quantity errors and rewards correct location classifications. Klocation indicates how well the grid cells are located on the landscape. In order to calculate those Kappa statistics, the real 2006 LULC map and the predicted 2006 LULC map were used as the reference map and the comparison map, respectively.

The results in Table 9 indicate that the MLP_MC model has a very high capability to predict future LULC changes.

Since urbanization can increase local temperature (e.g., the urban heat island effect), human activities, and damage to the natural environment, it is possible to see a shift in species composition between urban and rural Figure 11. Predicted probability of presence of Japanese barberry for year 2018.\nChanges in LULC will influence forest distribution in the study area. Since urbanization can increase local temperature (e.g., the urban heat island effect), human activities, and damage to the natural environment, it is possible to see a shift in species composition between urban and rural areas. Human activities in urban areas also change the characteristics of soils. For example, soils in urban areas have higher concentrations of heavy metals and organic matter than in rural areas. For some species, this kind of change could reduce habitat suitability. Moreover, forests adjacent to residential areas tend to have a higher number of invasive species compared to those surrounded by industrial lands. In the Northeast, dairy production was dominated by small dairies, which disappeared rapidly because of increasing mechanization and industry competition [76]. Therefore, decreasing dairy production led to pasture's natural conversion to shrub. Cropland increased by 217 ha in total, mostly converted from deciduous forest and pasture. Rapidly increasing population brought the pressure to existing agriculture land by replacing forest. Forest utilization, such as timber harvesting, extraction of non-timber products, construction of logging and transport roads and facilities for logging camps, and conversion of natural forest to plantations, may have direct and indirect negative impacts on forest biodiversity by promoting the invasion of alien species. Some studies have shown that forest fragmentation may accelerate the spread of invasive species [32,36]. Simply, a high proportion of evergreen forest in a landscape tends to deter invasive plants [20,64]. But the portion of evergreen forest area is relatively low in Connecticut; and based on our prediction, some evergreen forest is expected to be lost (272 ha) by 2018. Therefore, to stem the spread of invasive plants, it would make sense for policy makers to take actions to preserve evergreen forest in the region. Moreover, road systems provide essential access to forests for timber extraction. A good road system is an important requirement for sustainable forest management. But without quality design and maintenance, roads are often the cause of a variety of environmental problems associated with forest harvesting operations [77]. In some situations, roads may also initiate or accelerate the invasion of non-native species that ultimately displace native species. Additionally, the increased level of human activities in previously inaccessible areas (activities that are facilitated by roads) can cause environmental problems, including the possible introduction of alien species [78]. Mosher et al. [18] indicated that the greatest incidence of invasion is in post-agricultural settings, e.g., fields that are currently abandoned or have reverted to forest. Our study shows that portions of the pasture land and cropland were converted to urban grassland during 1996 to 2006 in Connecticut, which might increase the current and future richness of invasive species."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, LULC change in Connecticut from 1996 to 2006 was analyzed and LULC change from 2006 to 2018 was predicted using the MLP_MC model. In addition, the effect of LULC change on the invasion risk of an abundant invasive shrub, Japanese barberry, was studied. The results show that the total area of forests, especially deciduous forest, has been decreasing. That decrease is primarily caused by urban development and other human activity in the study area. We also found that forest areas near built-up areas and agriculture lands appear to be more vulnerable to conversion. These predicted LULC changes translated into subtle changes in the invasion risk by the invasive shrub Japanese barberry. While the magnitude of change in Japanese barberry risk was low over this relatively short time-scale, it could be compounded by longer-term changes in LULC and changes in climate. Future work should focus on these interacting global change factors and the generalization of their effects on invasive plants in the region and beyond. In summary, this study provides reliable LULC data, which is useful for the study of invasive species in the Connecticut region. The information is also useful for early detection and in the future refinement of conservation policy aimed at reducing the spread of invasive species. Our findings suggest that forest conversion should be controlled and managed in service of invasive species control. In addition, our research indicates that the MLP_MC model can predict future LULC with a reasonable accuracy. Nevertheless, it is important to note that predicting the actual location of LULC change is challenging. Explanatory variables about locations are usually not sufficient and important social economical drivers vary with time. Future work will consider dealing with these limitations."}]
