[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We produced a relative sea-level (RSL) reconstruction from Connecticut (USA) spanning the last \u223c2200 yrs that is free from the influence of sediment compaction. The reconstruction used a suite of vertically-and laterally-ordered sediment samples \u22642 cm above bedrock that were collected by excavating a trench along an evenly-sloped bedrock surface. Paleomarsh elevation was reconstructed using a regional-scale transfer function trained on the modern distribution of foraminifera on Long Island Sound salt marshes and supported by bulk-sediment \u03b4 13 C measurements. The history of sediment accumulation was estimated using an age-elevation model constrained by radiocarbon dates and recognition of pollution horizons of known age. The RSL reconstruction was combined with regional tide-gauge measurements spanning the last \u223c150 yrs before being quantitatively analyzed using an errorin-variables integrated Gaussian process model to identify sea-level trends with formal and appropriate treatment of uncertainty and the temporal distribution of data. RSL rise was stable (\u223c1 mm/yr) from \u223c200 BCE to \u223c1000 CE, slowed to a minimum rate of rise (0.41 mm/yr) at \u223c1400 CE, and then accelerated continuously to reach a current rate of 3.2 mm/yr, which is the fastest, century-scale rate of the last 2200 yrs. Change point analysis identified that modern rates of rise in Connecticut began at 1850-1886 CE. This timing is synchronous with changes recorded at other sites on the U.S. Atlantic coast and is likely the local expression of a global sea-level change. Earlier sea-level trends show coherence north of Cape Hatteras that are contrasted with southern sites. This pattern may represent centennialscale variability in the position and/or strength of the Gulf Stream. Comparison of the new record to three existing and reanalyzed RSL reconstructions from the same site developed using sediment cores indicates that compaction is unlikely to significantly distort RSL reconstructions produced from shallow (\u223c2-3 m thick) sequences of salt-marsh peat."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "quently, sequences of high salt-marsh peat are valuable archives from which RSL is reconstructed using proxies for tidal elevation (termed sea-level indicators) and a dated history of sediment accumulation. Foraminifera and plants are sea-level indicators because their distribution on modern salt marshes reflects the varied preferences and tolerances of species to inundation, which is primarily a function of tidal elevation (e.g. Scott and Medioli, 1978) . Sequences of salt-marsh sediment are usually recovered as a single core that is processed to provide vertically-ordered samples for reconstructing the tidal elevation at which each sample was originally deposited (termed paleomarsh elevation, PME). A limitation of this approach is that thickening of the sequence as sediment accumulates may cause compaction of underlying material and post-depositional lowering of samples, resulting in an overestimation of the amount and rate of RSL rise (Bloom, 1964; Brain et al., 2012) . RSL can also be reconstructed from discrete basal samples that minimize the influence of compaction, but do not provide a continuous record of Common Era RSL change (e.g. Redfield and Rubin, 1962) . In Connecticut (and similar regions) it is possible to produce a continuous and basal RSL reconstruction using salt-marsh sediment that accumulated on top of incompressible bedrock or glacial erratics. Ice retreat from the modern Connecticut coast by \u223c18,000 yrs before present (Balco et al., 2009) exposed bedrock that was later transgressed by salt-marshes because Common Era RSL rose due to ongoing glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA; e.g. Engelhart et al., 2011) . The salt-marsh sediment deposited in contact with bedrock did not experience postdepositional lowering and preserves a compaction-free history of RSL change (Donnelly et al., 2004; Nydick et al., 1995) .\nWe reconstruct RSL change during the last \u223c2200 yrs in Connecticut from salt-marsh sediment in direct contact with bedrock to answer two questions: (i) did persistent sea-level trends occur in Connecticut during the Common Era? and (ii) does sediment compaction materially alter patterns of RSL change reconstructed from cores of salt-marsh sediment? Samples from the sedimentbedrock contact were recovered by excavating a trench along the downward slope of a granite outcrop. Foraminifera and bulk sediment \u03b4 13 C values were used as sea-level indicators and sediment accumulation was dated using radiocarbon and regional pollution markers. The resulting RSL record was combined with instrumental measurements to identify positive and negative Common Era sea-level trends in Connecticut. Comparison with other RSL reconstructions from East River Marsh (Nydick et al., 1995) indicates that stratigraphies with intercalated peats are susceptible to compaction, but this compaction does not materially distort reconstructed RSL trends."}, {"section_title": "Study site", "text": "East River Marsh (Fig. 1) is typical of salt marshes in the northeastern United States (e.g. van de Plassche, 1991) .

This laterally-narrow floral zone exists between mean tide level (MTL) and mean high water (MHW). The high salt-marsh platform is found between MHW and mean higher high water (MHHW). It is vegetated by a mixed meadow of the C 4 plants Spartina patens, Distichlis spicata, and Spartina alterniflora (short form) and comprises most of the salt marsh by area. The transition between salt-marsh and freshwater ecosystems occurs between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT).

We selected a location where the bedrock sloped evenly at \u223c30 \u2022 to a depth of \u223c2.4 m below the modern marsh surface (Fig. 2a) . Assuming that GIA caused \u223c1.0 mm/yr of Common Era RSL rise in southern Connecticut (e.g. Donnelly et al., 2004; Engelhart et al., 2009; Peltier, 1996) , we anticipated that the selected location would provide a continuous sequence of compaction-free sediment spanning the entire Common Era. A trench was excavated to expose the bedrock-sediment contact (Fig. 2) . The basal sediment was segmented at slight changes in bedrock slope and recovered as a series of adjacent blocks. Sample elevations were measured by leveling the four corners of each block in contact with bedrock to a temporary benchmark, the elevation of which was established (relative to NAVD88) by real time kinematic satellite navigation. Each block was wrapped in plastic, labeled to preserve its original orientation, and refrigerated. The blocks were subsequently cut into 1-cm thick basal samples representing 1-cm increments of elevation (Fig. 2b ). This approach created a suite of vertically-and laterally-ordered sediment samples that were deposited \u22642 cm above the bedrock surface. The position of each sampled is expressed in a two-dimensional (depth and distance) co-ordinate system where the top of the trench (1.01 m above MTL) is the origin. Sample positions discussed in the text and presented on figures use this reference frame. All subsequent analyses (radiocarbon and pollution dating, foraminiferal counts, and \u03b4 13 C measurements) were performed on this set of samples that we consider to be free from the effects of sediment compaction.

At East River Marsh we sampled two parallel transects (Fig. 1c) that included highest-marsh environments where the shallow, amorphous sediment overlying bedrock is analogous to the basal sediment that accumulated in the trench. Similar highest salt-marsh sediments and environments were also sampled at other sites. We combined the new dataset of modern foraminifera with those summarized by Wright et al.

The highest occurrence of foraminifera (Wright et al., 2011) was not used as a SWLI datum because at some sites foraminifera were present in all surface samples meaning that their highest occurrence was not captured. The WA-inv transfer function was applied to the trench samples from which foraminifera were enumerated to reconstruct PME. A sample-specific (\u223c1\u03c3 ) uncertainty (Juggins and Birks, 2012) was calculated for each PME estimate by bootstrapping (n = 1000). Transfer function output was in SWLI units and converted to MTL using the modern tidal prism at East River Marsh. The ecological plausibility of PME reconstructions was judged by measuring the dissimilarity between trench samples and their closest analogue in the modern training set using the Bray-Curtis distance metric. If the distance exceeded the 20th percentile of distance calculated among all pairings of In the field, the trench profile was segmented into blocks (A-C) at changes in bedrock slope.

After separation from the sediment matrix, 15 radiocarbon samples were cleaned under a microscope to remove in-growing younger roots and older adhered sediment, oven dried (45 \u2022 C), and submitted to National Ocean Science Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (NOSAMS) facility for dating. All samples underwent standard acid-base-acid pretreatment at NOSAMS.\nRecognition of pollution horizons of known age from trends in concentrations of copper, lead, mercury, 137 Cs, and ratios of stable lead isotopes ( 206 Pb: 207 Pb) established the timing of recent sediment deposition, because the utility of radiocarbon for material younger than \u223c350 yrs is hindered by a plateau in the calibration curve. Copper, lead, and 206 Pb: 207 Pb trends and their stratigraphic position were matched to features of historic production and consumption, which were assumed to approximate the timing and relative magnitude of atmospheric emissions and deposition (Gobeil et al., 2013; Kemp et al., 2012a; Lima et al., 2005) . Trends in mercury concentration were matched to those reported at nearby sites in cores of independently dated salt-marsh sediment (e.g. Varekamp et al., 2003) . Peak 137 Cs activity was assigned an age of 1963 CE reflecting the peak in above ground testing of nuclear weapons. Elemental concentrations and Pb isotopes were measured using the methods and instruments described in Vane et al. (2011) and Kemp et al. (2012a) . Mercury measurements were made on a Milestone DMA-80 direct mercury analyzer at Yale University. Activity of 137 Cs was measured by gamma spectroscopy at Yale University using standard methods. All age estimates were assimilated into a single age-elevation model using Bchron, which produces posterior estimates of sample age using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, each of which is equi-probable Parnell et al., 2008) . The resulting suite of chronologies is summarized by Bchron to estimate sample ages with a 95% uncertainty interval. Radiocarbon ages were specified as having a thickness of 2 cm to recognize that plant macrofossils grow slightly below the surface on which contemporary foraminifera lived. This approach acknowledges uncertainty in contrast to adjusting the depths of radiocarbon dates by a fixed amount. Chrono horizons established from 137 Cs and pollution markers were treated as having uniform probability distributions.\nFifteen radiocarbon dates demonstrate that the trench spans the interval since \u223c200 BCE (Table 1 ). The uppermost part of the core was dated by identifying pollution chronohorizons that were related to historic events such as above-ground testing of nuclear weapons and trends in national and regional (Upper Mississippi Valley) industrial production (Fig. 4) . We assumed that industrial emissions were transported to East River Marsh by prevailing wind patterns and deposited on the salt-marsh surface within a few years and without further isotopic fractionation (e.g. Gobeil et al., 2013) . Trends rather than absolute values were the basis for recognizing chronohorizons because emissions rates per unit of production changed through time. The accuracy of this approach in eastern North America was demonstrated in studies that validated chronologies established from pollution markers against independent age constraints such as 210 Pb in salt-marsh sediment (Gobeil et al., 2013; Kemp et al., 2012a) and varved lake sediments (Lima et al., 2005) . Discrepancies among sample ages estimated from different pollution markers (Fig. 4) may arise due to local-scale variability in the trends and timing of pollution or from chemical mobility in the sediment profile. Bchron produces probabilistic age estimates and negates the need to choose among conflicting pollution markers by identifying chronologies that are more and less likely to be accurate rather than discarding outliers. The Bchron age-elevation model estimated the age of each trench sample with an average 95% credible interval of approximately \u00b150 yrs (Fig. 5 ).\nIn the upper part of the core, this credible interval overlaps with the individual uncertainties of 12 of the 14 pollution markers."}, {"section_title": "Relative sea-level trends", "text": "RSL was reconstructed by subtracting PME from measured sample elevation, where both quantities were expressed relative to MTL. When combined with age estimates from the age-elevation model, the RSL reconstruction is characterized by data points that are unevenly distributed through time and have a unique combination of vertical and temporal uncertainty. The RSL reconstruction was combined with a regional tide-gauge record from Long Island Sound. Annual tide-gauge measurements from The Battery, Willets Point, Port Jefferson, Bridgeport, New London, Montauk, and Newport ( Fig. 1a) were averaged to produce a single instrumental RSL record with a vertical uncertainty estimated by calculating the annual standard deviation across six of the tide gauges for 1950-2013 CE (the Port Jefferson gauge ceased recording in 1990 CE and therefore was not included in this estimate of uncertainty). The average of these annual standard deviations was 0.011 m and an uncertainty of \u00b10.022 m was applied to each annual data point along with an age uncertainty of \u00b10.5 yrs.\nQuantitative RSL trends with formal uncertainties were estimated by applying an error-in-variables integrated Gaussian process (EIV-IGP) model to the combined RSL dataset of proxy reconstructions and tide-gauge measurements. The EIV component (Dey et al., 2000) accounts for error in the explanatory variable (sample age), which is assumed to be fixed and known in standard regression. Since sample ages are uncertain, the EIV approach is appropriate and necessary. The Gaussian denotes samples more depleted than \u221222h that are typical of salt-marsh environments above MHHW in mid-Atlantic and New England salt marshes, Right area denotes samples less depleted than \u221218.9h that are typical of salt-marsh environments below MHHW in mid-Atlantic and New England salt marshes. The dashed vertical line at \u221224.5h is the reported value for bulk sediment sample from a salt-marsh to upland transition in the Great Marshes of Massachusetts (Middleburg et al., 1997). process component (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005 ) is a practical approach to modeling non-linear time series data such as RSL reconstructions. We model the rate of sea-level change (i.e. the first derivative) and subsequently integrate it to form an integrated Gaussian process (IGP; Holsclaw et al., 2013) , which aims to match RSL. The Gaussian process has a prior distribution specified by a mean function (here set to a constant) and a covariance function that determines the smoothness of the reconstructions. In this Bayesian model, the posterior rate and covariance function are learnt from the data. The IGP component is embedded within the EIV framework to account for age uncertainties, vertical uncertainties, and the covariance that is introduced by removing a rate of GIA. The model does not account for uncertainty in the rate of GIA, which must be specified as an input.\nThe covariance function of the Gaussian process prior placed on the rate of sea-level is structured such that the correlation between two individual data points depends on the time difference between them rather than their absolute position in time. For example, it assumes that the magnitude of the change in rate between two data points at 1880 CE and 1890 CE will be approximately the same as two data points at 1980 CE and 1990 CE. Whilst the integrated process (representing sea level itself) can display more complex behavior, previous work showed that this global smoothness assumption is robust to mis-specification , especially once we account for the uncertainties in both age and elevation. This approach captures the continuous and dynamic evolution of RSL change with full consideration of many sources of uncertainty. Modeled uncertainties are smaller than those of the original reconstruction because the EIV-IGP model exploits the probability distribution (vertical and temporal) within a single data point and the relationship among temporally-ordered data points to produce probabilistic estimates of sea level and the rate of sealevel change at any point in time. We also used change point analysis to provide a best estimate of when modern rates of sealevel rise began following the approach described in Kemp et al. (2013a) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trench stratigraphy, foraminifera, and \u03b4", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C", "text": "The excavated trench was \u223c8 m long and reached a maximum depth of \u223c2.4 m. The basal sediment (approximately 3-20 cm thick) in contact with bedrock was uniformly a black, amorphous organic unit with angular, sand-sized grains eroded from the underlying granite and sparse plant macrofossils (Fig. 2) . This unit is analogous to surface sediment from the margin between highest salt-marsh environments and bedrock islands at East River Marsh, including the upper reaches of the sampled trench. The overlying sediment exposed in the trench included salt-marsh peat with abundant, in-situ remains of Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, as well as a grey, peaty-mud unit.\nForaminifera were enumerated from 121 evenly-spaced trench samples to reconstruct PME (Fig. 3a) . From 242 cm to 178 cm below the trench top, the most common species of foraminifera were Trochammina inflata and Siphotrochammina lobata (average 45% of individuals). From 176 cm to 31 cm, Jadammina macrescens was the most abundant species (average 65% of individuals). The uppermost 30 cm was characterized by increased abundances of Haplophragmoides spp. (average 34% of individuals) with Trochammina inflata and Siphotrochammina lobata (average 41% of individuals). Between 108 cm and 124 cm foraminifera were sparse (<5 individuals) or absent. Intervals of low test abundance could be the result of test dissolution or low concentrations of tests as a consequence of low reproduction rates, high sedimentation rates, or patchy distributions.\nTo identify samples lacking a modern analogue, dissimilarity between populations of foraminifera preserved in trench samples and their modern counterparts was measured using the BrayCurtis metric (Fig. 3b) . The closest modern analogues for trench samples were drawn from six different sites, which likely reflects sub-regional spatial variability in the composition of high-marsh assemblages as observed on modern salt marshes in Connecti- cut and elsewhere (e.g. Kemp et al., 2013b; Wright et al., 2011) . The distance between nine trench samples and their closest modern analogue exceeded the 20th percentile of dissimilarity measured among all pairings of modern samples and these samples were excluded from further analysis. Eight of the excluded samples (36-66 cm) were characterized by high abundances of Jadammina macrescens (>68%) and the presence of Miliammina petila (4-21%; average 14%). The modern training set includes samples with comparable abundances of Jadammina macrescens (up to 100%) and Miliammina petila (up to 10%, excluding a single sample of 63% from East River Marsh). However, the maximum abundance of Jadammina macrescens in modern samples containing at least 1% Miliammina petila was 34%. The unusual co-occurrence of these two species caused the trench samples to lack a modern analogue.\nApplication of the WA-inv transfer function to the remaining 112 samples produced PME reconstructions with sample-specific uncertainties that ranged from \u00b10.158 m to \u00b10.165 m, equivalent to approximately \u00b110% of great diurnal range at East River Marsh (Fig. 3c) . These results show that the samples were deposited between MHHW and HAT at the leading edge of a RSL transgression and are supported by bulk sediment \u03b4 13 C values of \u221225.1h to \u221218.9h indicating significant input from C 3 vegetation (Fig. 3d) . Along the U.S. mid-Atlantic and northeastern coasts, these \u03b4 13 C values coupled with the presence of agglutinated foraminifera demonstrate that the samples formed at or above MHHW, but below HAT or the highest occurrence of foraminifera (Johnson et al., 2007; Kemp et al., 2013a; Middleburg et al., 1997) . The samples where foraminifera were sparse or absent probably formed in an environment between MHW and HAT (Engelhart et al., 2011; van de Plassche, 1991) as evidenced by \u03b4 13 C values between those typical of C 3 and C 4 plants (coupled with sediment texture that is the same throughout the basal section of the trench). Measured \u03b4 13 C values were not used to constrain PME reconstructions because most samples had values between those of C 3 and C 4 vegetation. When salt-marsh sediment is sampled with a core, the location of the PME reconstruction is static and the change from highest salt-marsh peat to high salt-marsh peat that occurs because of RSL rise happens only once.

RSL change during the last \u223c1500 yrs at East River Marsh and West River Marsh was reconstructed by Nydick et al. (1995) using three cores of high saltmarsh sediment (GA, GD, and GK; Fig. 1 ). Each core was dated using five radiocarbon ages and by identifying the onset of anthropogenic pollution (1877 CE \u00b115 yrs) from down-core copper and zinc concentrations. We investigated the influence of compaction on sequences of salt-marsh sediment by comparing the compaction-free RSL reconstruction from the trench to those generated from cores. We assumed that any differences among the four RSL reconstructions were principally the result of sediment compaction because other local factors such as tidal-range change should be consistent among records in such close proximity to one another. To ensure that all the reconstructions could be meaningfully compared, we reanalyzed cores GA, GD, and GK by applying our Long Island Sound transfer function to the reported assemblages of foraminifera and developing a Bchron age-depth model using the reported radiocarbon ages and position of the pollution Fig. 7 . Reanalysis of the three cores (GD, GK, and GA, distinguished by color) used by Nydick et al. (1995) to reconstruct relative sea level at East River Marsh and West River Marsh.

This reanalysis generated a relative sea level (RSL) reconstruction for each core (lower row of panels) that followed a similar approach to the reconstruction from the East River trench to allow direct and fair comparison among records. The reconstructions from each core were analyzed by the error-in-variables integrated Gaussian process (EIV-IGP) model. The trench reconstruction is also represented by results from the EIV-IGP model. marker as input. We estimated core-top elevations using the transfer function reconstruction for the surface sample in each core. This reanalysis generated three RSL reconstructions to compare with the trench reconstruction (Fig. 7) .\nThe RSL reconstruction from the trench lies within the uncertainty of the GK record indicating a lack of detectable compaction. In contrast, the trench reconstruction is above (and outside of) the uncertainty bounds of the GA reconstruction prior to \u223c1300 CE and is higher than the RSL reconstruction from GD prior to \u223c1200 CE. Cores GA and GD include units of salt-marsh peat that are intercalated by grey, clayey peat (Fig. 7) . Empirical data (e.g. Bloom, 1964) and modeling studies (Brain et al., 2012) show that intercalated peat is susceptible to compaction. In contrast, continuous sequences of high salt-marsh peat (such as those used elsewhere along the U.S. Atlantic coast; Fig. 8 ) undergo little compaction (Brain et al., 2015) . The pattern of increasing difference with depth and age between RSL reconstructed from the trench and cores GA and GD is suggestive of post-depositional lowering of the core samples and indicates that sediment compaction may distort RSL reconstructions generated from stratigraphies that include intercalated salt-marsh peats. This distortion is greatest (0.42 m) at \u223c830 CE in core GA, but with consideration of uncertainties in the EIV-IGP models it could range from 0.13 m to 0.72 m. However, there is no detectable compaction in core GK despite it being a longer-duration record produced from a sedimentary sequence that also includes intercalated peat. It is likely that the accuracy of the lowest radiocarbon date in core GA rather than compaction is the primary reason for the difference to the trench reconstruction. These comparisons suggest that compaction did not materially distort the reconstructions and that single cores of salt-marsh sediment can be representative of the principal RSL trends that occurred at a site if placed in, and supported by, an appropriate stratigraphic and chronological framework."}, {"section_title": "Sea-level change on the U.S. Atlantic coast", "text": "During most of the Common Era, spatially-variable GIA was the primary driver of RSL change along the U.S. Atlantic coast.

Predictions from Earth-ice models (e.g. Peltier, 1996) and RSL reconstructions (e.g. Engelhart et al., 2009) show that the rate of Common Era and ongoing GIA varies systematically with distance from the former center of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The ICE6G-CVM5a model ) predicts a current GIA-driven RSL rise of \u223c1.0 mm/yr at East River Marsh. Similarly, at Barn Island, Connecticut (Fig. 1a) , a compaction-free RSL reconstruction spanning the period \u223c1300-1850 CE estimated the background rate of Common Era RSL rise to be 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr (Donnelly et al., 2004) .\nUnder the assumption that RSL change over this period was driven . Each reconstruction was analyzed using the Errors-In-Variables Integrated Gaussian Process (EIV-IGP) model to ensure fair comparison among records. Left-side panels are sea-level reconstructions after removing an estimated rate of glacio-isostatic adjustment (listed in panel title). Labeled arrows indicate the timing of the primary change in the rate of sea-level estimated using change point regression by applying the same model to all data sets. Right-side panels show estimated rates of sea-level change after detrending. Scales are standardized within each column of panels for comparability among records.\nexclusively by GIA and any other process(es) causing vertical land motion (such as dynamic topography; e.g. Rowley et al., 2013) , this rate is an estimate of the ongoing contribution of land-level change to reconstructed RSL change during the Common Era. To compare RSL reconstructions from different sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast and to identify climate-driven sea-level trends during the Common Era, we removed 0.9 mm/yr from the new Connecticut RSL reconstruction and used the EIV-IGP model to account for the covariance of age and vertical uncertainties introduced by this adjustment . We assumed a constant rate of GIA over the 2200 yr duration of the reconstruction because this period is short relative to the adjustment time of the solid Earth to deglaciation. This analysis shows positive and negative departures from stable sea level (Fig. 8a ). There was a slight sea-level rise of \u223c0.18 mm/yr at approximately 600-1000 CE. The rate of sea-level change fell to a minimum of \u22120.42 mm/yr at \u223c1400 CE (\u22120.22 to \u22120.62 mm/yr; 95% credible interval). The rate of sea-level rise then accelerated continuously until reaching the current rate of 2.38 mm/yr (2.16-2.62 mm/yr; 95% credible interval), which is the fastest, century-scale rate in the past 2200 yrs. The compactionfree sea-level trend reconstructed at East River Marsh shows broad agreement with reconstructions from other sites in Connecticut including Hammock River Marsh (Thomas and Varekamp, 1991; van de Plassche et al., 1998; Varekamp et al., 1992) .\nTo compare the new detrended sea-level reconstruction from Connecticut with others from elsewhere along the U.S. Atlantic coast, we applied the EIV-IGP and change-point models to existing records from New Jersey (Kemp et al., 2013a) , North Carolina (Kemp et al., 2011) , and Florida (Kemp et al., 2014) . Change-point analysis shows a sharp and synchronous increase in the rate of sea-level rise that began in the 19th century with a common timing of 1865-1873 CE among the four records (Fig. 8) . The global tide-gauge compilation of White (2006, 2011) covers the period since 1870 CE and they noted that the acceleration of global sea-level rise commenced in the 19th century, with a secondary rate increase at \u223c1930 CE. This is supported by a recent reanalysis of the Church and White (2011) dataset, which shows global sea-level rise in excess of GIA at 1880 CE (>1 mm/yr) and a continuous acceleration to reach \u223c2 mm/yr at 2010 CE . Similarly, Hay et al. (2015) demonstrated that the rate global mean sea-level was positive and increased throughout the 20th century. These findings indicate that sea-level rise on the U.S. Atlantic coast and globally began prior to \u223c1880 CE.\nThe tide-gauge compilation of Jevrejeva et al. (2008) extends to 1700 CE, but prior to 1850 CE is based (out of necessity) only on records from Amsterdam, Liverpool, and Stockholm and therefore may not be representative of global trends. However, application of the change-point model to this record identified two intervals when the rate of sea-level rise increased (Fig. 9) . The primary change occurred at 1827-1860 CE and there was a secondary increase at 1924 -1943 CE. If the Jevrejeva et al. (2008 compilation is taken to represent global sea-level trends, then the difference in timing between the tide-gauge record (1827-1860 CE) and sealevel reconstructions (1865-1873 CE) suggests a short lag time between the onset of global sea-level rise and its detection in saltmarsh sediments along the U.S. Atlantic coast (Fig. 9) . We contend that sea-level rise on the U.S. Atlantic coast accelerated in the late 19th century in response to global mean sea-level change. The reconstructions record the local to regional-scale expression of this global change caused by increased ocean mass and volume (Church et al., 2013) . Departures from the global mean in the amount and rate of sea-level change may occur even after correction for GIA because of the static equilibrium (fingerprint) effect of ice melt (e.g. Hay et al., 2014; Mitrovica et al., 2001 ) and simultaneous contributions from regional-scale processes such as ocean dynamics. The 19th century onset of accelerated sea-level rise contradicts the IPCC AR5, which concluded with high confidence that \"rates of sea level rise exceeded the late Holocene background rate after about 1900\" (Masson-Delmonte et al., 2013) .\nTwo salt-marsh reconstructions from the United Kingdom did not definitively detect this acceleration Long et al., 2014) . This apparent absence is puzzling for two reasons. Firstly, it is present in the Jevrejeva et al. (2008) tide-gauge compilation which relies entirely on instrumental records from northern Europe (including the United Kingdom) prior to 1850 CE (Fig. 9) .\nSecondly, analysis of long tide-gauge records from the United Kingdom shows that 20th century rates of sea-level rise (e.g. Woodworth et al., 2009 ) exceeded long-term, GIA-driven regional trends (e.g. Shennan and Horton, 2002) , indicating that the rate of sea-level rise increased (e.g. Shennan and Woodworth, 1992) . A muted regional response to global mean sea-level change in the eastern North Atlantic and/or an exaggerated response to global mean sea-level change in the western North Atlantic could cause sea-level trends to differ across the Atlantic Ocean and for all proxy reconstructions to be accurate recorders of regional trends. In the United Kingdom, the average 20th century difference between GIAdriven background rates and those measured by tide-gauges was 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr (Woodworth et al., 2009) . In comparison, estimates of global mean sea-level rise include 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr during the 20th century (Church and White, 2011 ) and 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr for 1901-1990 CE (Hay et al., 2015) . The difference was \u223c1.9 mm/yr in Connecticut, New Jersey, and North Carolina and \u223c1.5 mm/yr in Florida (Fig. 8) . Sea-level rise in the United Kingdom was similar to global estimates and we propose that large reconstruction uncertainties (approximately \u00b10.4 m in Scotland and \u00b10.3 m in the Isle of Wight record), and/or the insensitivity of minerogenic European salt marshes to accelerated sea-level change compared to their organogenic equivalents in North America prevented reliable detection of this feature of Common Era sea-level rise.\nPrior to \u223c1800 CE, Common Era sea-level reconstructions support the conclusion of IPCC AR5 that \"centennial-scale global mean sea-level variations did not exceed 25 cm over the past few millennia\" (Masson-Delmonte et al., 2013) . On millennial timescales, reconstructed trends are sensitive to the GIA correction applied, but the timing and direction (positive or negative) of centennial-scale departures from this long term trend are robust (Fig. 8) . In Connecticut, there was a sea-level rise at \u223c600-1000 CE with a maximum mean rate of 0.23 mm/yr and a sea level fall at \u223c1200-1700 CE (maximum mean rate of \u22120.42 mm/yr). In New Jersey, there was a positive departure at \u223c300-900 CE and a negative departure at \u223c1100-1700 CE. The slight difference in timings between records could reflect the distribution of radiocarbon dates used to constrain the age-depth models. Similar patterns of change occurred in North Carolina, but they are asynchronous with those in New Jersey and Connecticut because the rise occurs at \u223c1000-1400 CE, although there is some overlap in the timing of the fall, which occurs at \u223c1500-1800 CE. There is no meaningful deviation from zero sea-level change in Florida until the onset of modern rates of rise. This pattern suggests that local-to regional-scale processes were the primary drivers of sea-level change along the U.S. Atlantic coast prior to the 19th century.\nSediment compaction could cause variability among reconstructions because the records from outside of Connecticut were developed from cores of high salt-marsh peat that varied in thickness from \u223c1.2 m in Florida to \u223c4.0 m in New Jersey. However, the coherence between New Jersey (most susceptible to compaction) and Connecticut (compaction-free) indicates that sediment compaction was not the primary cause of reconstructed spatial sea-level variability. Similarly, a geotechnical model estimated that sediment compaction contributed <0.03 m to the 1.4 m reconstructed RSL rise since \u223c1000 CE in North Carolina (Brain et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is necessary to seek an alternative mechanism to explain the spatial differences among reconstructions.\nOn the U.S. Atlantic coast, the contrast in sea-level trends north and south of Cape Hatteras on instrumental (Ezer et al., 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Yin and Goddard, 2013) and Common Era timescales (Kemp et al., 2014) were partially attributed to changes in the strength and/or position of the Gulf Stream. The reconstruction from Connecticut supports this interpretation because of its coherence with New Jersey and their shared dissimilarity to Florida prior to the 19th century. Proxy evidence from the Florida Strait indicates a \u223c3 Sv reduction in Gulf Stream strength during the Little Ice Age (at \u223c1350-1750 CE; Lund et al., 2006) , which modeling studies suggest would cause a 1.5-6 cm sea-level rise north of Cape Hatteras (e.g. Kienert and Rahmstorf, 2012) . This ocean dynamic effect could potentially offset sea-level fall from negative changes in ocean mass and volume caused by cooling temperatures. Climate reconstructions indicate that global temperature cooled from a peak of approximately +0.1 \u2022 C at \u223c950 CE to a minimum of \u22120.6 \u2022 C at \u223c1700 CE compared to the 1850-2006 CE average (Mann et al., 2008) , although the timing and magnitude of cooling varied among continents with notable cold periods in North America centered on \u223c1650 CE and \u223c1850 CE (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013). As temperatures cooled the rate of RSL rise in Connecticut and New Jersey fell below the rate of GIA at \u223c1100-1700 CE indicating that other processes were causing a sea-level fall. As temperatures rose after \u223c1700 CE, RSL rise in Connecticut and New Jersey once again exceeded GIA. This pattern and magnitude of Little Ice Age sea-level change likely resulted from the combined and simultaneous effects of cooling temperature (globally and in North America) and a weakening Gulf Stream. Further research (including additional sea-level records) is needed to distinguish and quantify the driving mechanisms of regional sea-level change prior to the 19th century."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We produced a compaction-free Common Era RSL reconstruction using salt-marsh sediment that accumulated directly on top of bedrock at East River Marsh, Connecticut. This sediment was exposed by excavating a trench and sampled to produce a suite of laterally and vertically ordered samples that preserve a record of salt-marsh ecosystems transgressing the evenly sloped bedrock outcrop in response to RSL rise. Paleomarsh elevation was reconstructed with a transfer function trained on a regional-scale dataset of modern foraminifera and supported by bulk-sediment measurements of \u03b4 13 C. A Bchron age-elevation model was constructed from radiocarbon dates and pollution markers of known age. The resulting \u223c2200 yr RSL reconstruction was combined with regional tide-gauge measurements and analyzed using an error-invariables integrated Gaussian process model to quantify persistent Common Era sea-level trends with full consideration of uncertainty and the temporal distribution of data. After removing an estimated rate of glacio-isostatic adjustment, the compaction-free sea-level reconstruction shows a rise of \u223c0.18 mm/yr at \u223c600-1000 CE and a minimum rate of change (\u22120.42 mm/yr) at \u223c1400 CE. The current rate of rise (2.38 mm/yr) is the fastest century-scale rise of the last 2200 yrs and began at 1850-1886 CE, likely in response to global sea-level change. Prior to 1800 CE sea-level trends in Connecticut were similar to those in New Jersey, but dissimilar to those in Florida suggesting that regional-scale processes (specifically ocean dynamics) were the primary driver of sea-level change.\nComparison with existing and reanalyzed RSL reconstructions at East River Marsh indicates that sediment compaction is not a major driver of RSL trends reconstructed using cores of salt-marsh sediment."}]
