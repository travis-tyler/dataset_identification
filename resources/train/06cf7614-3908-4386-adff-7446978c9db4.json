The authors hypothesized that 6-week global cortical amyloid burden, determined by 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography, would be greater in those patients manifesting cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks postoperatively. Methods: Amyloid deposition was evaluated in cardiac surgical patients at 6 weeks (n = 40) and 1 yr (n = 12); neurocognitive function was assessed at baseline (n = 40), 6 weeks (n = 37), 1 yr (n = 13), and 3 yr (n = 9). The association of 6-week amyloid deposition with cognitive dysfunction was assessed by multivariable regression, accounting for age, years of education, and baseline cognition. Differences between the surgical cohort with cognitive deficit and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts (normal and early/late mild cognitive impairment) was assessed, adjusting for age, education, and apolipoprotein E4 genotype.\nThe authors found that 6-week abnormal global cortical amyloid deposition was not associated with cognitive dysfunction (13 of 37, 35%) at 6 weeks postoperatively (median standard uptake value ratio [interquartile range]: cognitive dysfunction 0.92 [0.89 to 1.07] vs. 0.98 [0.93 to 1.05]; P = 0.455). In post hoc analyses, global cortical amyloid was also not associated with cognitive dysfunction at 1 or 3 yr postoperatively. Amyloid deposition at 6 weeks in the surgical cohort was not different from that in normal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative subjects, but increased over 1 yr in many areas at a rate greater than in controls. Conclusions: In this study, postoperative cognitive dysfunction was not associated with 6-week cortical amyloid deposition.

Because cardiac surgery generally takes place in older adults, the possibility exists that cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery represents a form of mild cognitive impairment, which also affects older adults. Mild cognitive impairment has been suggested to be a transitional phase between normal aging and dementia and a precursor to Alzheimer disease. 4 Both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease involve the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid in the central nervous system.

Factors of each subject in our cohort were computed for all time points using the same scoring coefficients, so that the cognitive domain structure remained consistent and comparable over time. Factor analysis suggested a five-factor solution, which accounts for 80% of the variability in the original test scores, and represents five cognitive domains: (1) structured verbal memory (i.e., the ability to recall from a list); (2) unstructured verbal memory (i.e., the ability to remember from a narrative); (3) visual memory; (4) executive function; and (5) attention and concentration. Two outcome measures were calculated to represent postoperative cognitive dysfunction: (1) continuous outcome-the change in cognitive score calculated by subtracting the baseline cognitive index (the five-domain mean) from the follow-up cognitive index (a change score of 0 indicates no change from baseline, while a negative score indicates cognitive decline, and a positive score indicates cognitive improvement); and (2) binary outcome (cognitive deficit), defined as a decline of greater than 1 SD in at least one domain.\nThe relationship between 6-week global cortical amyloid burden (standard uptake value ratio 1.1 or greater) and cognition at 6 weeks after surgery was prespecified as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the relationship between regional amyloid burden and cognition at 6 weeks postoperatively, and the relationship between global amyloid burden and cognition at 1 yr.

There were no significant correlations of global cortical amyloid deposition at 6 weeks with baseline, 6-week, 1-yr, or 3-yr cognitive scores or change scores. In multivariable regression analyses, we found no significant association between 6-week abnormal global cortical amyloid burden and cognitive change scores (\u03b2, 0.09; model R 2 , 0.12) or with the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.07 to 3.43; model R 2 , 0.09) when controlling for age, years of education, and baseline cognition. There were also no significant associations of 6-week amyloid burden with cognitive outcomes at 1 or 3 yr after surgery. Regional Amyloid Deposition and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction. In post hoc analyses we found that the frequency of abnormal amyloid deposition (standard uptake value ratio greater than or equal to 1.1) in the hippocampus was significantly different between patients with and without postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks postoperatively, although this difference was no longer significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (P = 0.041, false discovery rate = 0.429; table 3). Patients who had abnormal 6-week amyloid in the hippocampus showed significantly greater decline in the structured verbal memory domain ; P = 0.047, false discovery rate = 0.561).

Abnormal Amyloid Deposition and Cognitive Deficit in Apolipoprotein E4 Carriers. Apolipoprotein E genotype was available for 37 patients in our cohort. Eight patients were found to be apolipoprotein E4 carriers (seven heterozygous, one homozygous), and 29 were noncarriers. Of the eight apolipoprotein E4 carriers, seven had complete 6-week cognitive testing data; of the 29 noncarriers, 27 had complete 6-week cognitive testing data. Of the seven apolipoprotein E4 carriers with complete 6-week cognitive testing, four (57%) demonstrated cognitive deficit at 6 weeks. This was not statistically different from the deficit rate in the non-apolipoprotein E4 carriers (7 of 27, 26%; P = 0.178). Apolipoprotein E4 genotype was, however, significantly associated with worse baseline cognitive score (mean [SD], -0.631 [0.382] vs. 0.001 [0.555] in noncarriers; P = 0.005), but there was no difference at 6 weeks or in the change score from baseline to 6 weeks between apolipoprotein E4 carriers and noncarriers. Global and regional standard uptake value ratios in apolipoprotein E4 carriers versus noncarriers are shown in Supplemental Digital Content 6 (http://links.lww. com/ALN/B621). An analysis of covariance model, incorporating the ADNI cohort, revealed a significant association of global cortical amyloid deposition at 6 weeks with apolipoprotein E4 genotype (P < 0.001) and age (P = 0.001), and that the surgical cohort with cognitive deficit at 6 weeks had smaller global cortical amyloid deposition at 6 weeks than the late mild cognitive impairment subjects (P = 0.001) in the ADNI cohort, but not the normal (P = 0.68) or early mild cognitive impairment patients (P = 0.07).\nWhen evaluating regional standard uptake value ratio greater than or equal to 1.1 in apolipoprotein E4 carriers, \nAlzheimer disease than the presence/quantity of \u03b2-amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. 37 Finally, Badgaiya et al. previously showed significant decreases in memory-related regional cerebral blood flow within the hippocampus and parahippocampus after cardiac surgery, 38 which may indicate regions of the brain that are more vulnerable to ischemic blood-brain barrier dysfunction and consequent cerebral deposition of circulating amyloid after cardiac surgery. 29 We also observed that amyloid deposition significantly increased from 6 weeks to 1 yr after surgery in many regions of the brain and that this rate of increase was greater than that reported elsewhere. In a study by Palmqvist et al., 39 the mean global standard uptake value ratio change/year in nondemented subjects with normal positron emission tomography scans was 0.0024 (95% CI, 0.0010 to 0.0039), while that for subjects with abnormal CSF and scan results was 0.011 (95% CI, 0.0083 to 0.013). Similarly, in the longitudinal ADNI cohort, the mean standard uptake value ratio change in 154 control subjects with a normal baseline scan was 0.0027 (0.0100), but was 0.0160 (0.0161) in 61 controls with abnormal baseline scans (Susan Landau, Ph.D., Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California; email communication, October 2017). In comparison, the mean (SD) global cortical standard uptake value ratio change in our surgical patients was 0.02 (0.02), nearly tenfold than seen in scan-negative nonsurgical patients, and just slightly higher than that in scanpositive nonsurgical patients. When we removed patients with abnormal 6-week amyloid deposition (N = 2) from our analyses, the rate of change in our surgical cohort remained higher at 0.014 (0.018). Percent standard uptake value ratio change, which discounts variation in reference regions, may be more informative; in the Palmqvist et al. study, 39 the percent global standard uptake value ratio change/year was 0.35% (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.56%), compared to 1.9 \u00b1 2.0% in our surgical cohort. However, our study sample is limited, and changes over the course of a year are small. This trajectory of amyloid at 1 yr after surgery raises the question of how surgery and/or anesthesia may impact cerebral amyloid deposition and longer-term cognitive outcomes. Several in vitro and animal studies have established a link between anesthetic agents and enhanced \u03b2-amyloid formation, aggregation, and \u03b2-amyloid-induced cytotoxicity. 5, 6 Human studies have demonstrated that low preoperative ratios of \u03b2-amyloid/\u03c4 proteins in the CSF are associated with postoperative delirium and cognitive decline, although this is thought to predict a predisposition to cognitive dysfunction due to preclinical Alzheimer disease, rather than a direct anesthetic effect. 40 Surgery may also have an independent effect on the risk of Alzheimer development in the postoperative setting. 41 Tang et al. 7 and Berger et al. 8 both demonstrated a CSF change in the ratio of \u03b2-amyloid/\u03c4 proteins in patients undergoing surgery consistent with that seen in Alzheimer and correlated with perioperative neuroinflammatory mediator release. The association of perioperative inflammatory changes and Alzheimer-like cognitive decline may be particularly relevant in the highly inflammatory milieu of cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery with CPB has been shown to produce an intense cerebral inflammatory response in conjunction with Alzheimer-like changes in CSF \u03b2 amyloid.\n42 Vascular dysfunction and inflammation, both hallmarks of cardiac surgery, have also been associated with amyloid deposition. 43 Thus, one concern has been whether cardiac surgery itself could increase the rate of amyloid deposition as a consequence of blood-brain barrier disruption. 28 Our finding that some patients experienced cognitive decline over time, while others improved also merits further study and correlation with observed changes in the trajectory of global and regional cortical amyloid deposition. Cognitive improvement over time after surgery is certainly a recognized phenomenon and can been seen either globally or in select cognitive domains. 44 However, no mechanistic explanation has yet been uncovered as to why some patients improve while others continue to decline/recover more slowly.\nIt is important to interpret our findings in the context of our sample size limitations. Without any previous studies on amyloid burden in surgical patients, our initial sample size estimation was based on the hypothesis that patients with postoperative cognitive dysfunction would have amyloid deposition to individuals with mild cognitive impairment. For our primary outcome, comparison of the binary variables of abnormal amyloid deposition and postoperative cognitive dysfunction demonstrated a proportion difference of 0.106; we are only powered to detect a proportion difference of 0.5, thus we cannot conclusively exclude an association between 6-week abnormal amyloid deposition and a clinically meaningful decline in cognitive function after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, we estimate that we have 80% power to detect a mean standard uptake value ratio difference of 0.16 between patients with and without postoperative cognitive at 6 weeks postoperatively; thus, our detected standard uptake value ratio difference of 0.06 falls below this threshold. Based on these data, we estimate that 117 patients would be needed to achieve 80% power in a future study (Supplemental Digital Content 7, http://links.lww.com/ALN/B622).\nThe lack of baseline imaging and longer-term (more than 3 yr) follow-up are further limitations of our study. While the existing literature indicates a longer time course for change in amyloid, 17 we cannot say with certainty that surgery does not produce changes in amyloid deposition in the immediate postoperative period. Future studies should include a baseline assessment of brain amyloid before surgery as well as longer duration of follow-up. Based on the existing literature in mild cognitive impairment subjects, the time course of clinically significant \u03b2-amyloid deposition needed to produce cognitive decline may be significantly longer.\n45,46 Finally, we are limited by the relatively younger and male-dominated nature of our surgical cohort. Older age has been shown to increase the risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction 47 and Alzheimer disease, and multiple studies have indicated that females have a higher prevalence Klinger et al.\nCerebral Amyloid and Cognition after Surgery and incidence of Alzheimer disease 48 and mild cognitive impairment progression over time than men.\n49 Future studies should include an older surgical group that more closely matches the ADNI mild cognitive impairment cohort.\nIn conclusion, this study employed amyloid imaging using 18 F-florbetapir to investigate 6-week and evolving brain amyloid burden in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. We observed that postoperative cognitive dysfunction was not associated with 6-week global cortical amyloid deposition, but the rate of amyloid deposition after surgery was greater than what has been reported in normal elderly subjects. The findings from this study support further investigation of: (1) the relationship between hippocampal amyloid deposition and early postoperative cognitive dysfunction; and (2) the significance of amyloid deposition increases within 1 yr of cardiac surgery."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We did not find an association between 6-week global cortical amyloid burden and cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks after cardiac surgery. Cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery remains a significant problem without a clear etiology. Given that cardiac surgery predominantly takes place in the aged, the possibility exists that the cognitive decline seen in some patients is similar to mild cognitive impairment, which in many will eventually progress to Alzheimer disease. Both diseases are believed to involve the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and \u03c4 proteins in the brain. While the role of \u03b2-amyloid oligomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease remains controversial, 26 there is evidence that \u03b2-amyloid can lead to synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits in animals. 27 CPB is known to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, 28 and bloodbrain barrier dysfunction is associated with increased entry of amyloid into the brain. 29 Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration is accelerated by neuroinflammation, 30 raising the possibility that perioperative inflammation could stimulate/accelerate \u03b2-amyloid-mediated neurologic degeneration, which could contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Finally, cardiac surgical patients share many of the risk factors for Alzheimer disease, 31 and there is a known intersection between Alzheimer and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease. 32 While there is no evidence that cardiovascular disease severity directly affects amyloid burden, 33 it is plausible that some component of postoperative cognitive dysfunction may be related to cardiovascular risk factors that accelerate the progression toward Alzheimer-type cognitive decline. To investigate the relationship between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and \u03b2-amyloid protein deposition in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we utilized the novel positron emission tomography tracer, 18 F-florbetapir, which binds with high affinity to \u03b2-amyloid fibrils and has been shown to differentiate cerebral \u03b2-amyloid deposition between both cognitively normal and deficient subjects. 34 With regard to our primary outcome, we did not find a significant association between 6-week global cortical amyloid burden and cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks. Six-week amyloid burden was also not associated with cognitive dysfunction at 1 or 3 yr postoperatively, although our sample size at these time points was very small.\nIn post hoc analyses of regional amyloid deposition, we found an increased proportion of patients with cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks with abnormal 6-week amyloid deposition in the hippocampus, which was associated with a verbal memory deficit. While these results were not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons, the unadjusted findings may point to regions that deserve closer scrutiny in future studies. The hippocampus is an intriguing region because it plays an important role in the acquisition and storage of episodic memories 35 -those related to unique personal experiences-and has been linked with postsurgical cognitive changes in animals. 36 Hippocampal synapse loss occurs early in Alzheimer and, to a greater extent than in other brain regions, in advanced Alzheimer. Furthermore, hippocampal damage correlates better with cognitive impairment in "}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Abhinay Joshi, M.S., from Avid Radiopharmaceuticals for assistance with image analytics in a blinded fashion.
