[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In its original form, the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease holds that fibrillar deposits of amyloid are an early, driving force in pathological events leading ultimately to neuronal death. Early clinicopathologic investigations highlighted a number of inconsistencies leading to an updated hypothesis in which amyloid plaques give way to amyloid oligomers as the driving force in pathogenesis. Rather than focusing on the inconsistencies, amyloid imaging studies have tended to highlight the overlap between regions that show early amyloid plaque signal on positron emission tomography and that also happen to be affected early in Alzheimer's disease. Recent imaging studies investigating the regional dependency between metabolism and amyloid plaque deposition have arrived at conflicting results, with some showing regional associations and other not.\nWe extracted multimodal neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging database for 227 healthy controls and 434 subjects with mild cognitive impairment. We analyzed regional patterns of amyloid deposition, regional glucose metabolism and regional atrophy using florbetapir ( 18 F) positron emission tomography, 18 F-fuordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Specifically, we derived gray matter density and standardized uptake value ratios for both positron emission tomography tracers in 404 functionally defined regions of interest.\nWe examined the relation between regional glucose metabolism and amyloid plaques using linear models. For each region of interest, correcting for regional gray matter density, age, education and disease status, we tested the association of regional glucose metabolism with (i) cortex-wide florbetapir uptake, (ii) regional (i.e., in the same region of interest) florbetapir uptake and (iii) regional florbetapir uptake while correcting in addition for cortex-wide florbetapir uptake. P-values for each setting were Bonferroni corrected for 404 tests.\nRegions showing significant hypometabolism with increasing cortex-wide amyloid burden were classic Alzheimer's disease-related regions: the medial and lateral parietal cortices.\nThe associations between regional amyloid burden and regional metabolism were more heterogeneous: there were significant hypometabolic effects in posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parietal regions but also significant positive associations in bilateral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. However, after correcting for global amyloid burden, very few of the negative associations remained and the number of positive associations increased.\nGiven the wide-spread distribution of amyloid plaques, if the canonical cascade hypothesis were true, we would expect wide-spread, cortical hypometabolism. Instead, cortical hypometabolism appears to be linked to global amyloid burden. Thus we conclude that regional fibrillar amyloid deposition has little to no association with regional hypometabolism. "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, in its original, unmodified form, posits that the protein amyloid-\u03b2 is the starting point for a series of pathogenic changes that lead from neuronal dysfunction and synapse loss to cell death (Hardy and Allsop, 1991; Hardy and Higgins, 1992) . Particular weight is given, in the unmodified version of the hypothesis, to the large fibrillar aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2 known as amyloid plaques. The link between amyloid-\u03b2, in some form, and Alzheimer's disease is unassailable. Disease-causing mutations in the three genes that lead to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease have been shown to promote the formation of the putatively neurotoxic form of amyloid-\u03b2, a peptide of 42 amino acids (Suzuki et al., 1994; Scheuner et al., 1996; Gomez-Isla et al., 1999) .\nWhile amyloid-\u03b2 is, irrefutably, an initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, the remainder of the amyloid cascade hypothesis is much less firmly established. Amyloid plaques are, along with tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, one of the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (Braak and Braak, 1991) . They are large, abundant, and easily seen with basic microscopy stains and, as such, were initially assumed to have a key role in the pathogenic cascade (Hardy and Higgins, 1992) . From the earliest days of clinicopathologic investigations, however, a number of glaring inconsistencies arose. Chief among these is the oft-replicated finding that there is little association between where amyloid plaques are found at autopsy and which brain regions were dysfunctional in the patient's clinical course (Price et al., 1991; Arriagada et al., 1992; Giannakopoulos et al., 1997; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002) . This discordance is most obvious in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These medial temporal lobe structures, crucial to episodic memory function, are the first to fail clinically and the first to develop neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Amyloid plaque deposition, however, does not occur in these regions until relatively late in the course (Price et al., 1991; Arriagada et al., 1992; Giannakopoulos et al., 1997) . Conversely, other regions, like the medial prefrontal cortex, typically show abundant amyloid plaque pathology at autopsy despite being relatively functionally spared clinically (Price et al., 1991; Arriagada et al., 1992; Giannakopoulos et al., 1997) . As the field wrestled with these inconsistencies, evidence began to accrue suggesting that A\u03b2 was still the key driver but that its pathogenic properties were related to smaller soluble aggregates of the peptide referred to as oligomers (Lambert et al., 1998; Hartley et al., 1999) .\nThese findings have allowed for an updated, reconciled version of the amyloid cascade hypothesis in which amyloid plaques give way to amyloid oligomers as the driving force in pathogenesis (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002) .\nThe advent of amyloid PET imaging should have reinforced this update to the hypothesis. The correlation between plaque quantity and distribution as measured with PET and plaque quantity and distribution at autopsy is extraordinarily high (Ikonomovic et al., 2008; Hatsuta et al., 2015) . Unsurprisingly, therefore, imaging studies of Alzheimer's began to show many of the same patterns that the neuropathology literature had been documenting for the last several decades. After age 70, roughly 25% of healthy older controls without cognitive complaints or deficits on testing harbor a large burden of amyloid plaques on PET imaging (Rowe et al., 2010; Chetelat et al., 2013; Jack et al., 2014) . The medial prefrontal cortex is among the first regions to show high signal on amyloid PET scans in healthy older controls despite remaining clinically unaffected even late into the course of Alzheimer's disease (Jack et al., 2008) . Conversely, even late into the course of Alzheimer's disease cognitive symptoms, the medial temporal lobes tend to show little to no increased signal on amyloid PET (Jack et al., 2008) . Despite its role in re-introducing these decades-old arguments against the primacy of plaques in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, amyloid PET imaging has, oddly, seemed to have the opposite effect on the field. Rather than focusing on the inconsistencies, studies have tended to highlight the overlap between regions that show early amyloid plaque signal on PET and that happen to be affected early in Alzheimer's disease (Buckner et al., 2005; Sperling et al., 2009; Koch et al., 2014) . The PCC and the IPC are most commonly cited in this regard. The PCC and IPC form the posterior aspect of the brain's DMN, a set of functionally connected regions-that also includes the medial prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe structures-that relates to memory function and appears to be targeted early by Alzheimer's disease pathology (Raichle et al., 2001; Greicius et al., 2003; Greicius et al., 2004; Shirer et al., 2012) . One highly cited early study in this vein pointed out the qualitative similarity between a resting-state fMRI map of the DMN, a map of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease patients, and a map of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease patients (Buckner et al., 2005) . This led to the oversimplified interpretation that amyloid plaque deposition occurs in the DMN and results in the dysfunction of this network. No attention was given to the findings, evident from the images, that Alzheimer's disease patients typically have normal metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex despite having abundant amyloid deposition. Similarly, while the medial temporal lobe is a key component of the DMN and its metabolism is already reduced in the earliest clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid map in this study (as in most subsequent amyloid PET studies)\nshows no uptake in the hippocampus (Buckner et al., 2005; Kemppainen et al., 2006; Edison et al., 2007; Jack et al., 2008) , though with rare exceptions (Frisoni et al., 2009; Sepulcre et al., 2013) .\nA few multimodal imaging studies using FDG PET and amyloid PET approached the question of whether local amyloid plaque deposition is correlated with local levels of glucose metabolism. These studies produced conflicting results with some showing an association between local amyloid plaque deposition and glucose hypometabolism in some brain regions (Engler et al., 2006; Edison et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2014) and others showing the absence of any correlation (Li et al., 2008; Rabinovici et al., 2010; Furst et al., 2012) . Further work showed that the dependency may be more complex and relationship between plaques and metabolism may change depending on disease stages (Cohen et al., 2009) or brain regions (La Joie et al., 2012) . Discrepancies in the findings may originate from the different subject populations that were studied. For instance, Lowe et al. (2014) studied only healthy controls, while Furst et al. (2012) focused on AD subjects. A second source for the discrepancies may be the limited sample sizes of most studies: with the exception of Lowe et al. (2014) , previous studies comprised fewer than 100 subjects and the specific regional analysis within a single disease group did typically not exceed two dozen subjects (Engler et al., 2006; Edison et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008; Cohen et al., 2009; La Joie et al., 2012) . Moreover, many studies relied on a plain correlation analysis between the regional tracer intensities without correcting for cofounders such as age, sex, education and extent of amyloid pathology.\nHere we investigated the relationship between regional amyloid plaque deposition and regional glucose hypometabolism, using a large dataset comprising hundreds of subjects (healthy controls and patients with MCI) obtained from the ADNI (Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative) database who were imaged with both amyloid PET ( 18 F-florbetapir PET) and FDG PET."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nWe extracted T1 weighted structural scans, as well as florbetapir and FDG PET scans for n = 661 subjects from the ADNI database. The subjects were either healthy older controls (n = 227) or patients with MCI (n = 434), covering both, early and late MCI. The FDG PET scan and the structural T1 weighted scan were acquired at most 60 days before or after the subjects' first florbetapir PET scan. The closest diagnosis within 90 days of the florbetapir PET scan served as the current diagnosis. Further, CSF A\u03b2 values obtained within 90 days of amyloid imaging were available for 544 subjects.

Thus, for this analysis, we used a cortex-wide parcellation based on functional connectivity during rest rather than a structure-based parcellation such as the AAL (automated anatomical labeling) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) . More precisely, the regions of interest are based on a set of 90 functional ROIs derived from resting state fMRI covering 14 major networks (Shirer et al., 2012) . In order to further subdivide these ROIs and extend the atlas to whole-brain coverage, we first divided the brain into 91 regions: 90 from the Shirer atlas and the rest of the gray matter voxels were treated as a single region. We then divided each region into round(nN/p) parcels using Ward clustering (Michel et al., 2012) , where n is the number of gray matter voxels in the given region, p is the total number of gray matter voxels in the brain, and N is the user-defined number of parcels, set to 500 in accordance to the literature (Van Essen and Ugurbil, 2012). To constrain the parcels to be spatially-contiguous, only Pearson's correlations between fMRI time courses of spatially-adjacent voxels were considered during Ward clustering. The resting-state fMRI data used to estimate the Pearson's correlations between voxels were obtained from a publicly available source comprising 21 subjects and 7 min scan time with a TR of 2000 ms (Landman et al., 2011) .\nThis original set of 499 functionally defined ROIs was modified to fit the specifics of this analysis. First, we applied a strict gray matter mask (mean gray matter of 0.4 or more in the study sample) to the ROIs in order to reduce the influence of white matter on the average PET intensities in the ROIs, which is a challenge when working with florbetapir PET. Second, we excluded cerebellar ROIs (n = 59) and ROIs smaller than six voxels (2mm isotropic; n = 36).\nThis resulted in a final set of 404 ROIs in MNI space covering the cortical gray matter ( Figure   1a ). Further ROIs were a joint pons-vermis ROI (for FDG PET normalization), a whole cerebellum ROI (for florbetapir PET normalization) and a whole cortex gray matter ROI.

The DARTEL algorithm in SPM8 was used to normalize the images to MNI 152 space (Ashburner, 2007) . In order to accelerate processing, a randomly selected subset of 100 images was used to create the DARTEL template. The resulting warping for each subject's T1 image was applied to the gray matter segmented images; images were modulated following the spatial normalization. Further, images were smoothed using an 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Finally, average gray matter density was computed for each of the 404 functional ROIs and the whole cortex gray matter.\nThe resulting values were divided by the subjects' ICV for normalization.\nThe PET images, which were acquired from the ADNI database, were smoothed to 8mm resolution and the florbetapir and FDG PET images were coregistered for each subject. Due to technical challenges in normalizing florbetapir PET images to MNI space (Saint-Aubert et al., 2014) , we analyzed all PET data in subject space: SPM's MNI PET template was spatially normalized to each subject's FDG PET image using the Normalise algorithm in SPM8 (Ashburner et al., 1997) . The resulting warping was applied to all ROIs. Next, we extracted the average FDG and florbetapir tracer uptake for each of the functional 404 ROIs and the whole cortex gray matter ROI.

We used the continuous CSF A\u03b2 value as replacement for cortex-wide florbetapir SUVR. Due to the strong association between APOE-\u03b54 carrier status and changes in A\u03b2 in the CSF and in the cortex, we did not correct for APOE-\u03b54 carrier status in the linear model."}, {"section_title": "Association Between Regional Amyloid Burden and Regional Glucose Metabolism", "text": "The effect of regional amyloid on regional glucose metabolism was tested with the same linear regression setup as for global amyloid but instead using the florbetapir SUVR of the same ROI.\nAs before, we are not correcting the model for APOE-\u03b54 carrier status. The P-values for this regional amyloid burden coefficient were Bonferroni corrected for 404 tests. Technically, we are assessing the significance of the semi-partial correlation between regional FDG SUVR and regional florbetapir SUVR.\nAnalyzing these data ROI by ROI is technically valid and in fact often done in related work (Cohen et al., 2009; La Joie et al., 2012; Lowe et al., 2014) . However, this local approach treats ROIs independently from each other and disregards the high correlations between local levels of amyloid and global level of amyloid burden. Thus, in order to test for the local specificity of the association we conducted two additional computations: a) estimating the linear regression as above, but correcting in addition for global amyloid burden by adding the cortexwide florbetapir SUVR as an additional predictor (and, alternatively, CSF A\u03b2 or the indicator variable for CSF A\u03b2 \u2264 192 pg/ml) and b) conducting a permutation test examining the association strength to non-local amyloid burden (see details below)."}, {"section_title": "Permutation Test", "text": "We define local linear regression as the linear regression models used above where we test for the regional association between glucose metabolism in ROI i and the regional amyloid plaque deposition in the same ROI i. Conversely, we define non-local linear regression as models where we test for the association between glucose metabolism in ROI i and the amyloid plaque deposition in a different ROI j \u2260 i. In this permutation test we compared the association strength (t-score) of the local linear regression with the association strength from all non-local linear regressions. In particular, we computed how many non-local models showed a stronger association between glucose metabolism and amyloid plaques than the local model. In this onesided permutation test the direction of the effect (sign of the t-value) in the local model determined whether stronger meant \"more positive\" or \"more negative\". In order to minimize possible confounding effects of neighboring regions (i.e., regions adjacent to the local ROI), all\nROIs adjacent to the examined ROI were excluded from the permutation test. That is, if the examined ROI had five neighbors, we were comparing it to the association strength in the 398 (= 403-5) remaining ROIs. In addition, the number of regions imposed a lower bound on the Pvalue, i.e., P-values could not get lower than 1/404 (\u22480.0025). Given this limitation, P-values were not corrected for multiple testing. Small P-values indicate local specificity of the association since only few non-local ROIs show an equal or stronger association.

We computed mean and standard deviation of the global florbetapir SUVR in these subjects and used these values to compute a Z-score for global amyloid burden in all subjects. We considered a Z-score of 1.65 or more to be an indication of a positive amyloid scan. This cutoff corresponds to a P-value of 0.05 in a one-sided test. In our study sample, this Z-score translates into a cortex-wide florbetapir SUVR threshold of 1.263. Rabinovici et al. (2010) reported a disappearance of regional associations once the study group was restricted to subjects with the same diagnosis.

Of particular interest were ROIs that are linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology (ROI DX , ROI amyloid , and ROI CSF ) along with ROIs belonging to the default mode network (DMN; Figure S4 ), which is known to be primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease (Greicius et al., 2004; Seeley et al., 2009) . Using linear regression, we found a significant association between the two PET modalities in 141 ROIs.\nHalf of these were negative relationships (n = 71; the higher the amyloid PET SUVR the lower the glucose metabolism) and the other half were positive (n = 70; the higher the amyloid PET SUVR the higher the glucose metabolism; Figure 3a) . Negative associations were mainly found in the PCC/precuneus and the bilateral occipital gyri, while positive association were located in the bilateral hippocampi, entorhinal cortices, the thalamus, paracingulate gyrus and the supplementary motor cortex. The negatively associated ROIs largely overlap with ROI DX (10 of 29), ROI amyloid (20 of 26) and ROI CSF (27 of 46) ( Table 2 ).\nRegional florbetapir SUVR was highly correlated with cortex-wide florbetapir SUVR:\n349 ROIs (86.4%) showed a Pearson's r \u2265 0.7 (P < 8.14e\u221299; Figure S5 ).

With increasing global amyloid burden the number of ROIs with negative association between regional amyloid plaque deposition and metabolism decreases ( Figure 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our analysis confirmed previously reported differences in imaging biomarkers between healthy controls and MCI subjects. The availability of both PET modalities in all subjects allowed us to analyze the regional association of amyloid plaque burden and glucose metabolism. At first glance, our analysis appeared to largely confirm the qualitative similarity between a map of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease patients and a map of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease patients. However, only a minority of ROIs followed the prediction of the amyloid hypothesis in its original form, where increase in amyloid plaques are linked to reductions in glucose metabolism. If the unmodified amyloid hypothesis held true, given the widespread increase of amyloid plaques in MCI subjects, there should have been a widespread decrease in glucose metabolism. Further, glucose metabolism in one of the prime regions of amyloid deposition, the prefrontal cortex, showed no significant association with regional levels of amyloid. The hippocampus, on the other hand, showed hypometabolism without significant enrichment of amyloid plaques. If these data support a regional association between amyloid plaque burden and metabolism, it is for the somewhat heretical inversion of the amyloid hypothesis. That is, regional amyloid plaque deposition is protective, possibly by pulling the more toxic amyloid oligomers out of circulation and binding them up in inert plaques, or via other mechanisms (Cuajungco et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2004; Wolfe and Cyr, 2011) . A similar pattern has been observed in APP/PS1 mouse models: older transgenic mice showed increased FDG uptake in the hippocampus and other cortical regions when compared to age-matched controls. Follow-up experiments showed that these glucose uptake increases were located in the proximity of plaques rather than in amyloid-free tissue (Poisnel et al., 2012) . However, given the resolution of PET and the applied smoothing, we cannot rule out that positive association in ventral areas and subcortical areas are the result of co-registration artifacts. Our additional analyses, which were aimed at elucidating the local specificity of the association, suggest that the pattern of hypometabolism is mainly dependent on the cortex-wide increase in amyloid burden and not due to regional deposits of fibrillar amyloid plaques.\nThe question of whether local deposits of fibrillar amyloid have a bearing on local glucose metabolism has been met with conflicting results. Until now, few studies have directly compared the regional association between these two modalities side-by-side in the same subjects, with some work reporting a regional association of amyloid plaques and hypometabolism (Engler et al., 2006; Edison et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2014) and other work reporting no significant association (Li et al., 2008; Rabinovici et al., 2010; Furst et al., 2012) . These discrepancies may, in part, originate from the fact that most studies examined a low number of subjects and had thus reduced power to detect an association. An additional key factor is the subject group studied. Rabinovici et al. (2010) noted that the initially significant regional association disappeared once healthy subjects were removed from the analysis, which further highlights the necessity to control for global amyloid levels in the regional analysis. In addition, most previous studies focused the regional analysis on a small set of brain regions such as the precuneus that are typically affected in Alzheimer's disease. Given the high correlation of local amyloid burden with global amyloid burden, picking a select set of ROIs runs the risk of accentuating the spurious effect of local amyloid on local metabolism when it is in fact linked to disease progression (as indicated by global amyloid burden). Further, our sliding window analysis showed that a pre-selection of amyloid positive subjects reduced the likelihood of observing negative associations between the two modalities. In fact, the negative associations were most pronounced in subject groups that were mainly amyloid negative, i.e., at the beginning of the disease spectrum, and therefore in line with the findings by Lowe et al. (2014) who studied older cognitively normal subjects exhibiting a wide range of global amyloid burden. Further, the lack of significant ROIs in subjects with substantial amyloid tracer retention can be regarded as further evidence for neurodegeneration being independent from A\u03b2 pathology in advanced stages of the disease (Hyman, 2011) .\nClearly, amyloid imaging is a valuable clinical tool. Like levels of amyloid-\u03b2 in the CSF, a longstanding biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, global amyloid plaque burden is a useful marker for disease onset and progression (Okello et al., 2009; Villemagne et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2014) . Like many others, our study showed that subjects with a positive amyloid scan were more likely to show dysfunction (hypometabolism here) in Alzheimer's disease-related regions (Greicius et al., 2004; Sorg et al., 2007; Seeley et al., 2009) . However, according to our results there appears to be no added clinical or research value in studying the regional distribution of amyloid plaques. This confirms early clinicopathologic investigations (Price et al., 1991; Arriagada et al., 1992; Giannakopoulos et al., 1997) and recent imaging studies (Rabinovici et al., 2008; Lehmann et al., 2013; Laforce et al., 2014) , all of which found no link between the regional pattern of amyloid plaques and the dysfunctional brain regions in the patient's clinical course. Tau imaging (Villemagne and Okamura, 2014) may be more suitable to provide clinically relevant regional information. One criticism our interpretation is likely to encounter is that there may be a time lag between regional amyloid plaque deposition and a given region later becoming dysfunctional (Forster et al., 2012) . This would probably hold up for regions like the PCC but would not explain regions like the medial prefrontal cortex (early plaques like the PCC but much later metabolism changes) or the hippocampus (early hypometabolism, late plaques).\nIn conclusion, given the wide-spread distribution of amyloid plaques, if the canonical cascade hypothesis were true, we would expect wide-spread, cortical hypometabolism and cortex-wide negative associations between amyloid plaques and metabolism. Instead, cortical hypometabolism appears to be mainly linked to global amyloid burden. Global amyloid plaque burden is an important biomarker of Alzheimer's disease risk. Regional amyloid plaque deposition, however, has little to no association with regional hypometabolism.
