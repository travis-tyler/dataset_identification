Since AD pathology begins to develop w20 years before cognitive decline (preclinical AD) [2, 3] , it is possible that trial participants were too far along in the disease process for such therapies to impact cognition. Therefore, individuals at earlier stages, including the asymptomatic and preclinical stage (defined by biomarkers), are now receiving intense focus for secondary prevention trials aimed at preserving normal cognitive function. Understanding the patterns of biomarker(s) change over time, both in asymptomatic and early symptomatic stages, is critical for defining where individuals fall along the pathologic disease cascade.\nCross-sectional studies indicate that b amyloid (Ab)related biomarkers become abnormal first, followed by markers of tau-related neuronal injury, both during the preclinical period [4] . Elevated injury markers in the presence of amyloid-positivity then become a strong predictor of subsequent cognitive decline [5] . Interestingly, while regional brain atrophy then ensues, with abnormality increasing with symptomatic progression [6] , a recent, albeit small, study of individuals (n 5 37) from families at risk for developing autosomaldominant AD reported longitudinal decreases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neuronal injury markers including total tau (tTau), phospho-tau181 (pTau181), and visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) in symptomatic mutation carriers [7] , suggesting a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes and/ or a decrease in the number of viable neurons contributing to the pools of these markers in this later stage of the disease. Regardless of the mechanism, if confirmed in an independent cohort of persons developing late onset AD, such a pattern will likely have an impact on interpretation of biomarker outcomes in clinical trials that is dependent on the disease stage. To this end, the present study evaluated the patterns of within-person longitudinal change in a variety of standard (tTau and pTau181) and novel (VILIP-1, neurogranin [Ng] , and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 ) CSF neuronal injury biomarker levels in individuals spanning the full range of AD, including normal, preclinical AD, MCI due to AD, and symptomatic AD, and a comparison of these changes with regional brain atrophy and cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study design", "text": "CSF Ab42, tTau, and pTau181 demographic, imaging, and cognitive data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http:// adniloni.usc.edu).

In contrast, elevations in tTau, but not the other injury markers, were observed at earlier stages (amyloid-positive MCI and CN groups). Importantly, these findings replicate similar longitudinal patterns (for tTau, pTau, and VILIP-1) reported in a small cohort of individuals with autosomal-dominant AD [7] , thus supporting a commonality in neuropathologic processes in sporadic and genetic forms of the disease. Interestingly, reductions in Ab42 were observed in the CN2 group, potentially indicating amyloid deposition in the very earliest stage of disease; other studies have shown that levels of CSF Ab42 begin to decrease before amyloid being detectable by positron emission tomography and before changes in CSF tau(s) [20, 21] . The findings are also similar to the first published study on longitudinal (up to 2 years) Ab42, tTau, and pTau in ADNI, which showed longitudinal changes in pTau after changes in Ab42 [20] . Knowledge of such within-person patterns of change has important implications for clinical trials in MCI and early stage AD in terms of the use of biomarker concentrations as pathologic endpoints in determining treatment efficacy for neuronal integrity and is being studied concurrently in related groups such as individuals with Down Syndrome [22] . Furthermore, the combination of CSF biomarkers and other modalities may be of use, even in the preclinical stages of disease, as significant changes in ADAS 13 were seen in the CN1 group.\nWhile all the injury markers decreased over time in the AD1 group, the reduction in Ng was especially robust. Ng is a calmodulin-binding postsynaptic neuronal protein [23, 24] thought to be involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation [25] . Levels are reduced in AD brain [26, 27] and elevated in AD CSF [12, 28] , with high levels predictive of progression from MCI to AD dementia [18, [29] [30] [31] . Because elevations in CSF Ng are associated with brain atrophy [18, 31] and reduced brain glucose uptake [31] , it is considered a marker of synaptic dysfunction/loss.\nAlthough less is known about SNAP-25 (a presynaptic t-SNARE molecule that plays a crucial role in calciumdependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles) in AD, like Ng, levels are reduced in brain [32] and elevated in CSF [33] compared with controls. Although both synaptic markers were decreasing longitudinally in the AD1 group, Ng was dropping at more than twice the rate as SNAP-25 (annual decreases of 6.9% vs. 2.5%, respectively) and the other markers (1.8% tTau, 3.9% pTau, and 3.4% VILIP). Interestingly, Ab42 was also significantly decreasing annually by 5% in the early AD1 group but less so in the other groups. Although levels of Ab42 are known to drop early in the disease and then plateau as amyloid continues to accumulate [3] , 63% (10/16) of individuals in the current AD group were at very early symptomatic stages (CDR 0.5). Baseline levels of YKL-40, an astrocyte-derived protein with presumed neuroinflammatory properties [34] , also increased with clinical severity as reported previously [35] , but we observed a high level of within-group variability in longitudinal patterns. It is likely that YKL-40 reflects neuroinflammatory components not specifically due to AD. Interestingly, levels appeared to increase with age in the AD1 group ( Supplementary Fig. 1) as has also been observed in CN middle-aged individuals [14] . Further studies regarding the role of YKL-40 in neurodegenerative diseases are warranted [36, 37] .\nDespite the fact that there were strong positive correlations among levels of the various injury markers, consistent with previous reports [18, 38] , discordance in patterns of longitudinal change over time for tTau was observed in the amyloid-positive MCI group (robust increases in tTau but no statistical change in the other markers, including pTau). CSF tTau levels are known increase in response to acute neuronal death as occurs in response to stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [39] , thus suggesting a robust phase of neuronal death and/or alterations in the normal metabolism of tau at the very early (MCI) symptomatic stage of AD, the time during which the first signs of cognitive impairment are evident. The reason(s) for a lack of within-person increase in these other injury markers remains unclear but may have something to do with the relatively short follow-up time in the current cohort (mean 4.0 6 1.61 years) and/or the lack of information regarding how long a given individual had been in their designated clinical group at the time of baseline LP (i.e., where in the natural progression of the disease), or could conceivably be influenced by the older age of the ADNI cohort (mean baseline age of w75 years for all groups), as some CSF biomarkers do appear to be age related [14] . Alternatively, such discordance may indicate that these markers reflect different processes associated with synaptic dysfunction and/or neuronal injury [38] . A full understanding of biomarker trajectories will require serial samples being collected from an independent and larger cohort over a long period of time as individuals progress from one disease stage to the next.\nThe biological reason(s) for reductions in CSF injury markers over time in early AD is unclear. In fact, very little is known about the normal metabolism of these markers that would lead to their appearance in the CSF in both normal and pathological settings. Although it is conceivable that such reductions reflect a dilution of CSF analytes that would come with increasing ventricular volume associated with overall brain atrophy, reductions were still observed after controlling for ventricular volume (see Supplementary Text) . It is possible that longitudinal reductions from an elevated baseline during early AD reflect a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes with symptomatic disease progression and/or neuronal death, leading to a smaller number of neurons that remain and contribute to the pool in CSF. Unlike structural MRI and amyloid (and tau) positron emission tomography imaging measures that reflect cumulative change over the course of the disease, CSF measures reflect a snapshot in time, thus measuring different things. Indeed, HP and EC atrophy continued over the course of the disease even in the face of decreasing levels of injury markers in the CSF. It is therefore not unexpected that there exists some discordance when defining biomarker positivity (and notably for neuronal injury), as a function of imaging versus CSF [40] . This issue is important to consider when selecting biomarker modalities (CSF and/or imaging) for use in screening and/or outcome measures in clinical trials.\nThis study is not without limitations. The cohort with longitudinal CSF samples available for analysis was relatively small which, when divided into five groups, may limit statistical power to detect longitudinal changes, especially in the preclinical and early symptomatic AD groups, as well as influence the large variability seen when modeling longitudinal slopes. The distribution of males and females was also skewed in this cohort, with roughly 62% of participants being male. Although serial LP follow-up was longer than that in some previous longitudinal ADNI CSF studies [41, 42] , it was still relatively short (3-5 years). Also, despite the groups being dichotomized as amyloid-positive versus -negative to ascer-tain plaque status in the clinical groups, there was considerable overlap in clinical and biomarker patterns between individuals, especially in the MCI and AD groups. Finally, due to the small numbers of individuals in the clinical/biomarker groups and the unique biological traits captured by the different biomarkers that may contribute independently to the overall disease process, statistical models were not adjusted rigorously for multiple comparisons. However, this approach could potentially result in inflated type I errors, so interpretation should be made with caution."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The present results underscore the importance of evaluation of true longitudinal, serial measures of CSF biomarkers from individuals as they progress through the normal course of the disease as opposed to the more traditional approach of inferring longitudinal change by comparing cross-sectional data from groups of individuals at different disease stages. Indeed, concentrations of each of the markers have been reported to be elevated in AD compared with MCI and CN controls [35] . While we also observed such elevations in baseline levels of these injury markers among the different clinical/amyloid groups, the within-person patterns of change over time were different. For clinical trial purposes, given the stage-specific differences in the direction of true longitudinal change in these biomarkers, a \"positive\" biomarker outcome would be different depending on the characteristics of the trial cohort. For example, a slowing of the course of neuronal injury may be indicated by a slowing of the rate of increase in CSF tau in individuals who are early in the disease process (MCI), but perhaps a stabilization or even a slowing or reversal of the downward trajectory later in the disease (mild AD), potentially reflected as a longitudinal increase or as no decrease in this marker. Such possibilities warrant consideration in clinical trial design.
