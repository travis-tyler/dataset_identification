[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Genetic and environmental factors both contribute to cognitive test performance. A substantial increase in average intelligence test results in the second half of the previous century within one generation is unlikely to be explained by genetic changes. One possible explanation for the strong malleability of cognitive performance measure is that environmental factors modify gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic factors may help to understand the recent observations of an association between dopamine-dependent encoding of reward prediction errors and cognitive capacity, which was modulated by adverse life events. The possible manifestation of malleable biomarkers contributing to variance in cognitive test performance, and thus possibly contributing to the \"missing heritability\" between estimates from twin studies and variance explained by genetic markers, is still unclear. Here we show in 1475 healthy adolescents from the IMaging and GENetics (IMAGEN) sample that general IQ (gIQ) is associated with (1) polygenic scores for intelligence, (2) epigenetic modification of DRD2 gene, (3) gray matter density in striatum, and (4) functional striatal activation elicited by temporarily surprising reward-predicting cues. Comparing the relative importance for the prediction of gIQ in an overlapping subsample, our results demonstrate neurobiological correlates of the malleability of gIQ and point to equal importance of genetic variance, epigenetic modification of DRD2 receptor gene, as well as functional striatal activation, known to influence dopamine neurotransmission. Peripheral epigenetic markers are in need of confirmation in the central nervous system and should be tested in longitudinal settings specifically assessing individual and environmental factors that modify epigenetic structure."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Genetic variance is known to explain a substantial part of variability in cognitive capacity [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The largest available study describes that polygenic scores (i.e., those common genetic variants that are most strongly associated with test performance in previous studies) explain up to 4.8% 4 of the variance of general intelligence quotient IQ (gIQ). A more recent larger but not yet peer reviewed study, shows up to 5.4% of variance explained 5 . On the other hand, environmental factors have a significant impact on general cognitive capacity, as indicated by the strong rise in average IQ performance following the decades after World War II 6, 7 . According to Flynn et al. 7 the change ranged from 5 to 25 IQ points (eg. 0.3 to 1.7 standard deviation (SD)) within one generation. This change appears to be too strong to be explained by genetic changes.\nWhile various environmental factors (e.g. changes in the educational system, overall stress experience, nutrition, etc.) might contribute to this socalled Flynn effect, those factors should act via changes in neurobiological systems relevant for cognition. Possible neurobiological factors that mediate this effect and link genotype with complex traits like cognition are (1) epigenetic markers including methylation count, (2) cortical architecture of the brain evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (3) the functioning of the brain explored in vivo with functional MRI (fMRI). Those malleable markers might as well contribute to the \"missing heritability\" that is present between variance explained by accumulating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 4.8% based on polygenic scoring 5 ), estimates of genomic similarities between individuals (~20% SNP heritability 5 ), and based on heritability estimates from twin studies (50-70% 2,3 ). Here we aim to explore individual variance in gIQ that can be accounted for by neurobiological markers of cognitive performance and describe the interplay of mechanisms, including epigenetic variance that may contribute to individual malleability in cognitive capacity. Several lines of evidence suggest that gIQ is associated with the architecture of the brain measured as cortical volume and thickness 8 explaining up to 16% of the variance in right insula. Beyond cortical findings, the architecture 9 and volume of subcortical structures have been associated with cognitive capacity explaining between 2.4% in striatum 10 and up to 4.2% in caudate volume 11 . The importance of subcortical structures is further underpinned by the finding that training in reasoning alters resting state connectivity between subcortical and cortical brain areas, including striatum, parietal, and prefrontal areas 12 . This is highly plausible given the relevance of cortico-striatal networks implicated in executive function and goal-directed behavior [13] [14] [15] . In line with this, dopamine synthesis capacity in the ventral striatum has been associated with frontal cortical and striatal functional activation during goal-directed vs. habitual decision-making as well as IQ 16, 17 , in accordance with the well-known role of dopamine in cognition and decision-making [18] [19] [20] . A readily available proxy for dopaminergic neurotransmission is the well-known reward anticipation signal that can be measured with fMRI 21, 22 . Dopaminergic neurotransmission is partly heritable, but also substantially modulated by environmental factors [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . An emerging field that could potentially link the abovementioned environmental factors and dopaminergic neurotransmission is epigenetic modulation, which can help to explain individual malleability. Finding possible links between epigenetic changes, reward signaling, and cognitive capacity in adolescents might contribute further evidence for long-lasting neurobiological correlates of environmental effects, including stress exposure, as already observed in rodents (for a review see Meaney et al. 28 ).\nThe aforementioned candidate markers for neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive capacity have been assessed before 29 , however, their relative importance has not been tested in a cumulative fashion. Moreover, the interplay between genetic variance and possible neurobiological underpinnings of individual difference in cognitive capacity, including epigenetic markers is not known in detail. Data from the IMaging and GENetics (IMA-GEN) consortium, offer a well-characterized sample to study these topics. With experts from a variety of fields, we aimed at contributing a broader insight into that research question.\nTherefore, we measured associations between cognitive capacity (gIQ) and polygenic scores, epigenetic markers of the dopaminergic system, gray matter density in striatum, and striatal activation during reward processing, in a large sample of healthy adolescents, and we quantified their relative contribution to interindividual differences in IQ. We addressed the following research questions:\n1. Do two different polygenic scores, which have previously been associated with cognitive capacity 4, 30 , replicate in our sample? 2. Are there epigenetic markers (i.e., methylation count) of the dopaminergic system that show associations with gIQ? 3. Can we replicate previous findings 9-11 of a correlation between gray matter density in bilateral striatum and gIQ? 4. Can the previously observed association between functional activation of the ventral striatum (BOLDsignal) and IQ 17, 31 be replicated in a large sample of adolescents? In a subset of individuals for whom we have complete data, we evaluated the relative contribution of each of the aforementioned predictors for gIQ, assessed possible interactions of genetic variance with our other predictors, and performed model comparison for combinations of predictors."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We used a sample of 1475 adolescents (mean age = 14.43 years; SD = 0.45, 765 female participants) from the large multicenter imaging and genetics study (IMA-GEN 32 ) with available data from neuropsychological assessment, functional imaging, and genetic data. The study is intended to investigate the genetic and neurobiological basis of individual variability in psychological traits, and their relation to the development of frequent neuropsychiatric disorders.

An abundant body of work on cognitive capacity and neurobiological correlates is based on a general factor derived from principal component analysis (PCA) 29 . On the other hand there is considerable criticism of constructing general factors 33 regarding cognitive test performance and the authors have voiced similar concerns elsewhere 34 . PCA gains general information at the expense of specific information associated with the Wechsler's intelligence scale (WISC) IV subscales. Calculating a general factor based on PCA (for a review see Deary et al. 29 ) does not necessarily invalidate the nature of the original scales; instead, dimensionality reduction allows for capturing variance that is common to a variety of subscales. In this study, we therefore performed PCA in order to derive a measure of general cognitive ability from WISC IV subtests, comprising matrix reasoning, block design, digitspan backward and forward, similarities, and vocabulary 35 . The first principal component (gIQ) explained a large proportion of the variance (variance explained = 0.49) and was used for further analyses as a marker for gIQ (see Table 1 in the supplement). For a more fine-grained view we explored WISC IV subscales associations with biological markers calculating a correlation matrix in an overlapping subsample (see supplementary Table 7 )."}, {"section_title": "Genetics", "text": "For building a polygenic score, we obtained summary statistics from two large genome-wide association studies: Benyamin et al. 30 report associations with childhood intelligence 30 on 17 989 individuals and 1 380 159 SNPs; Sniekers et al. 4 provide a meta-analysis and report associations of common variants with intelligence in a maximum of 78 308 adults and children and included 10 499 625 SNPs.\nWe performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning and \"clumped\" the summary statistics, discarding variants within 500 kb of, and in r 2 \u2265 0.1 with, another (more significant) marker.

We plotted a correlation matrix for all candidate markers in order to explore associations between methylation count in each CG site.

For imaging parameters, we used split-half cross-validation on two subsets. A significance level of p = 0.05 was chosen.\nFor explorative analysis of gIQ and whole-brain associations with BOLD-signal during reward anticipation, we computed linear regression models at each voxel, using ordinary least squares. Due to spatial auto-correlation we used whole-brain family-wise error correction (p = 0.05) applying random field theory as implemented in statistical parametric mapping software (SPM 8) in n = 1475 subjects.\nFor our best predictors, we estimated variance explained and obtained 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals from 1000 randomly drawn samples to evaluate reliability of our results.\nFor further analysis, we choose to partial out variance from variables of no interest by calculating separate regression models of our nuisance variables on our predictors. For the polygenic scores we regressed out variance accounted for by age, gender, and principal component from our prior PCA. For epigenetic markers, we accounted for age, gender, site, first two principle components of estimated cell count, and wave information. For structural MRI, we regressed out variance from age, gender, site, and total brain volume. For fMRI, we accounted for age, gender, and site. To explore possible interrelatedness between residuals of our variables, we calculated a correlation matrix.\nWe calculated one multiple linear regression model on residuals of our predictors in an overlapping subsample of 755 subjects with gIQ as independent variable and BOLDsignal, gray matter density, polygenic score, and epigenetic candidate marker as predictors. In order to estimate the effect size, we calculated standardized parameter estimates (beta) in a multiple regression model, which assumes standardized predictors and dependent variables (variance equals one). The standardized parameter estimate (beta) indicates how many SDs gIQ will change, per SD change in the predictor variable.

Using a polygenic score previously associated with cognitive capacity in children 30 and a novel score 4 tested in children and adults, we were able to replicate significant associations with gIQ, with the score based on 78 308 adults 4 performing better than the one based on a sample of 17 989 children 30 . The striking difference between heritability estimates derived from twin and adoption studies (around 50-70% 2,3 ) and variance explained by common genetic polymorphisms (around 5% 5 ) for many traits has been labeled \"the case of the missing heritability\". For example, regarding the partially heritable and polygenic human trait \"body height\", polygenic scores account for 10% of the variance 47 , much below the high heritability estimates derived from monozygotic twin studies (heritability estimates around 85% 3 ). So the discrepancy between variance explained by polygenic risk scores and twin studies may simply be due to the fact that polygenic risk scores only include common genetic polymorphisms and do not assess effects of rare gene variants. On the other hand, if epigenetic variation is transmitted to the offspring, as has been shown for some stress-related epigenetic effects 28 , a more or less substantial part of the presumably genetic background regarding IQ test results may indeed be due to epigenetic factors (and hence environmental effects including social exclusion or discrimination stress).\nSearching for neurobiological markers associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission in light of studies linking this system to cognitive capacity 11, 17, 18 we found significant associations between methylation of DRD2 gene (cg26132809) and gIQ. Epigenetic control of gene expression is modulated by environmental factors such as stress exposure to the individual or in some cases parental generation 48 . Stress exposure and further environmental factors also strongly modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission, with relations to epigenetic modification unexplored. In line with previous findings 11 we found gIQ to be related to gray matter density in striatum. These observations suggest a striatal contribution to the malleability of cognitive capacity 49 .\nThe association between ventral striatal activation and gIQ was found to be robust using split-half cross-validation as well as estimation of bootstrapped confidence intervals. In the MID task, temporarily unpredicted presentation of reward-associated stimuli elicit functional activation of the ventral striatum (BOLD-signal), which was previously associated with dopamine release measured indirectly by displacement of radio ligands of dopamine D2 receptors in this brain area 21 . Unlike in studies directly quantifying the size of the reward prediction error using computational modeling 31,50 , in the MID task, the size of the temporal error in the prediction of reward-anticipatory cues cannot be individually computed.

Calculating a regression model in a subsample of 755 subjects with fully available data for all predictors we found polygenic score of Sniekers et al. 4 , epigenetic markers of the DRD2 gene and the ventral striatal BOLDsignal were significantly associated with gIQ with a similar effect size. In combined assessment in this subsample, gray matter density in striatum did not show a significant effect. Exploring the interrelatedness of our candidate markers, we found no significant association, thus pointing to rather independent sources of variance for gIQ. The abovementioned polygenic scores (Sniekers et al. and Benyamin et al.) did not show a significant interaction effect with our candidate markers (epigenetics, gray matter and striatal activation) in our sample. In order to formally describe and compare possible models that predict gIQ, comparison of all possible combinations of our predictors resulted in a model comprising BOLDsignal during reward anticipation in the ventral striatum, methylation count in the DRD2 gene and the polygenic score. Altogether, the winning model points to a rather independent contribution of variance of dopaminergic neurotransmission to variance in gIQ on the one hand and genetic differences on the other hand.\nLimitations of our study include the sample size, which is rather large for neuroimaging studies but exceedingly small for explorative genetic and epigenetic studies. This is reflected in rather large CIs when applying bootstrap procedures in epigenetic markers. Furthermore, our sample size is too small for the detection of epigenomewide markers. Therefore, the DNA methylation score was limited to CG sites in selected dopaminergic genes, with only a single CG site emerging as significant. It is highly likely that a more comprehensive DNA methylation analysis would have identified more epigenetic loci, which are associated with IQ score. Despite the relatively small sample size, we were able to replicate effects of polygenic score on gIQ derived from large samples 4, 30 . Further limitations include that our epigenetic markers are assessed in peripheral blood. They may not reflect variance in brain tissue and have to be validated in studies with methods directly accessing tissue in the central nervous system 51 . The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow any statement concerning causality. Further studies with a longitudinal design in possible quasi experimental settings are warranted.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that both functional activation of the reward system, epigenetic control of dopaminergic neurotransmission, and genetic markers contribute to gIQ. Of note, the effect sizes studied are small but in the same range as previous studies (2.4% 10 in previous structural imaging studies and up to 4.8% 4 for previous polygenic scores). Eventually, it is fundamental for the understanding of cognitive capacity that we find variable neurobiological correlates of gIQ. Variance of methylation count in our epigenetic candidate marker and individual differences in ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation seem to be independent predictors and do not show a relation with genetic correlates. Observing an association between epigenetic markers and neural signatures of gIQ should encourage further studies exploring mechanisms that mediate genetic and environmental effects on the neurobiological correlates of cognitive functions."}]
