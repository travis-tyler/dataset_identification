Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCSK9 was elevated in frontal cortices of AD subjects compared to controls, both at the mRNA and protein levels. LDLR protein levels were unchanged in AD frontal cortices, despite and upregulation at the mRNA level. To verify if PCSK9 dysregulation was observable before the onset of AD, we measured its expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 104 \"at-risk\" subjects and contrasted it with known apolipoproteins levels and specific AD biomarkers using ELISAs. Positive correlations were found between CSF PCSK9 and apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ or CLU), apolipoprotein B (APOB), phospho Tau (pTau) and total Tau. To investigate if PCSK9 levels were driven by genetic variants, we conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study using bioinformatic tools and found two PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220254 August 22, 2019 1 / 18 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nshowed neuroprotection for LOAD associated with the T allele of rs2269657 in SREBF2 gene [17] , coding for a transcription factor involved in the regulation of HMGCR [18] , LDLR [19] and PCSK9 [20] . At the molecular level, pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the brain by statins markedly reduced the production of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in wild type mouse and guinea pigs whereas, inhibitors of cholesterol esterification (storage), markedly increase A\u03b2 synthesis [21] [22] [23] . More interestingly, chronic administration of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (statins) in transgenic mice over expressing the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) significantly reduces A\u03b2 production and the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain during aging [24] .\nEpidemiological studies have shown clear associations between high cholesterol levels in midlife and LOAD risk [25] [26] [27] whereas cholesterol lowering drugs have been shown to have a protective effect against the development of dementia in retrospective [28] [29] [30] and prospective studies [31, 32] . However, randomized control trials in symptomatic LOAD subjects found no cognitive benefit of statin treatments [33, 34] . The most recent prospective epidemiological studies in which statins were stratified as water or lipid soluble report significant protection in users of the latter category [31, 32] ; consistent with improved brain barrier penetration.\nThese observations prompted us to examine more closely the neurobiology of PCSK9 in autopsied normal and diseased LOAD brains as well as, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aged cognitively normal but \"at-risk\" subjects with a parental history of LOAD. The main objective of this study was to determine if PCSK9, a very potent modulator of cholesterol metabolism seldom associated with cognitive dysfunction, plays a significant role in the presymptomatic phase of the disease when the pathophysiological markers of LOAD unfolds and, later, when cognitive symptoms emerge."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant samples", "text": "Participants from three different cohorts with available samples are described in Table 1 .

For CSF APOJ levels, the correlation with PCSK9 was significant only in APOE4-subjects (p = 4.7E-05, Fig 3B) . Although APOB is not produced in the central nervous system, small amounts can be detected in the CSF [43, 44] using sensitive ELISA or Luminex assays, as observed in Fig 3C. Not only do APOB levels correlated well with those of PCSK9 (APOE4-p = 1.2E-03, APOE4+ p = 1.2E-03, Fig 3C) , but stratification by APOE4 genotype reveals marked increases of APOB in APOE4+ carriers when compared to non-carriers (p = 1.3E-14, data from Fig 3C) . These results indicated that in pre-symptomatic individuals which underwent lumbar punctures on average 15 years before their parent's LOAD onset, APOE4 carriers appears to exhibit a compromised blood-brain barrier that facilitate the penetration of small amount of peripheral APOB (presumably from LDL) into the brain. Here, although APOE4 genotype stratification did not affect APOE's own protein concentrations in the CSF (p = 0.43, data from Fig 3A) , the presence of the APOE4 allele certainly influenced the metabolism of other cholesterol-related proteins, as seen in Fig 3B.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "PCSK9 is a serine protease first described to target hepatic LDLR and to mediate its degradation [45] . Gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations lead to increased levels of serum LDL cholesterol and loss-of-function mutations prevent the degradation of the hepatic LDLR, resulting in a higher clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol [46] . PCSK9 is expressed in the brain [47] and is detectable in the CSF of healthy subjects without the typical diurnal pattern of plasma PCSK9 [48] . In neurons, PCSK9 has been shown to degrade LDLR [49] as well as other APOE-binding receptors such as the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the LDL receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) and the APOE receptor type 2 (APOER2); these receptors mediate the Genetic associations with CSF PCSK9 levels, Alzheimer's disease risk and specific biomarkers.

It is thus conceivable that altered PCSK9 activity in the CNS may contribute to the reported deterioration of brain cholesterol homeostasis observed in LOAD and indirectly, to lipoprotein dysfunction and AD pathophysiology.\nSeveral \"loss-of-function\" and \"gain-of-function\" mutations have been described in the PCSK9 gene [51] . \"Loss-of-function\" mutations, for example PCSK9 R46L (rs11591147), were associated with lower circulating LDL-cholesterol levels through increased LDLR levels, resulting in a lower prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease [52] . A recent analysis of PCSK9 R46L and InsLEU mutation frequency distribution in a large cohort of autopsy-confirmed and clinical control and LOAD cases from Eastern Canada failed to show protection in carriers of the loss-of-function mutations [53] . Furthermore, Mendelian randomisation using the PCSK9 R46L (rs11591147) variant did not find any obvious association with impaired cognitive performance or functional status in 5777 elderly participants enrolled in PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) [54] .\nIn autopsy-confirmed human brains, we report here a significant increase in cortical PCSK9 gene expression and protein levels in LOAD when compared to age-matched control subjects (Fig 1A and 1C) . In the cerebellum, a brain region with minimal pathology, PCSK9 gene expression and protein levels are not altered in the AD brains (Fig 1B and 1D) . Considering the severity of the pathology at the end-stage of the disease, the increased levels are consistent with previous reports of increased PCSK9 expression in response to neuronal injury such as serum withdrawal-mediated apoptosis where PCSK9 is markedly upregulated [55] and, in response to transient ischemic stroke in adult mice [9] .\nIn the LOAD brain, the LDLR gene expression is up-regulated in the cortical areas but not in the cerebellum (Fig 2A and 2B) ; presumably in response to neuronal damage and the ensuing compensatory response believed to facilitate synaptic remodelling [56, 57] . In contrast, LDLR protein levels remains unchanged (Fig 2C and 2D) , presumably in response to the concomitant induction of PCSK9 in the region; promoting local LDLR degradation.\nIn the CSF of \"at-risk\" cognitively normal individuals, CSF PCSK9 protein levels correlate strongly with those of APOE (Fig 3A) . The observation is consistent with the notion that PCSK9-mediated reduction of LDLR (and other APOE receptors) attenuates the internalisation of APOE-and APOJ-containing lipoprotein particles, thus leading to increased concentrations in the extracellular space. Of note, the correlation between PCSK9 and APOE protein levels was found to be independent of APOE4 genotype in pre-symptomatic individuals.\nInterestingly, when CSF PCSK9 levels are contrasted with those of APOJ, a significant correlation was observed only in APOE4-carriers (Fig 3B) . In the CSF, APOJ is normally found in lipid particles that may or not contain APOE [58] . It facilitates lipoprotein endocytosis by binding specifically to LDL receptor related protein 2 (LRP2) [59] ; a lipoprotein receptor whose catabolism is not modulated by PCSK9 [60] . It is thus conceivable that only APOE4-lipoprotein particles containing APOJ are affected by the action of PCSK9 toward LDLR, in a dose-dependent manner. Even if lipoproteins containing APOE3 and APOE4 bind LDLR with the same affinity [61, 62] , APOE3 was shown to participate in stronger protein-protein interactions in the HDL particle surface compared to APOE4 [63] .\nAPOE4 genotype is a well-known risk factor for LOAD but its role in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease is less clear. Here we show that APOE4 carriers display higher levels of CSF APOB compared with APOE4 non-carriers ( Fig 3C) and both genotypes show statistically significant correlations between CSF PCSK9 and APOB levels. APOB is normally found in periphery as part of the LDL particles and, it is not synthesized in the central nervous system [64] . Its elimination through LDLR binding in the CNS and its subsequent internalisation could likely be modulated by PCSK9 in a manner similar to HDL particles present in the CSF.\nIn a recent paper, Courtemanche et al showed that CSF PCSK9 was elevated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases compared to controls [65] . When all groups were analysed together, they saw significant positive correlations between CSF PCSK9 and pTau as well as with A\u03b242. As pTau levels are known to rise in AD patients and, at the opposite, A\u03b242 levels are lowered in AD patients, these results are a priori contradictive. Our results show that CSF PCSK9 correlate positively with both, pTau and Tau, while no correlation was found with A\u03b242 in pre-symptomatic \"at-risk\" subject (Fig 4) .\nIn vitro, PCSK9 overexpression was shown to result in the reduction of endogenous BACE1 levels, also known as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, with a decrease of both immature and mature forms [11] . In contrast, the down-regulation of PCSK9 by siRNA completely normalized the levels of BACE1 [11] . In addition, Pcsk9 knockout mice showed higher levels of BACE1 and A\u00df in the neocortex [11] . However, more recent independent in vivo work reported a lack of effect of PCSK9 overexpression, or deletion (knockout), on the levels of BACE1 in the mouse brain, with a concomitant lack of effect also on A\u00df levels [12] . The authors concluded that PCSK9 has no effect on BACE1 enzyme in vivo.\nIn terms of gene regulation, both PCSK9 [20] and BACE1 [66] were shown to be upregulated by SREBF2 via sterol-regulatory element in their respective promoter. In rats fed a high fat diet, the observed reduction of free cholesterol was suggested to activate SREBF2 and BACE1 [66] . Similarly, apoE (-/-) mice fed a high fat diet showed increased in Pcsk9 and Bace1 expression levels [67] . It is therefore possible that PCSK9 effect on BACE1 depends on cholesterol levels and SREBF2 activation.\nInterestingly, a compound isolated from a Chinese herb was shown to decrease PCSK9 mRNA and protein levels [68] while reducing A\u03b2 levels [69] . After a 3-month treatment with this alkaloid named berberine, a 29% reduction of serum cholesterol, 35% reduction of triglyceride and 25% reduction of LDL-c were achieved in hypercholesterolemic participants [70] . Since berberine can cross the blood-brain barrier [71] and has other neuroprotective properties, it was suggested to be an agent to combat AD [72] . These findings support a neuroprotective effect of PCSK9-lowering therapies, strengthening the lack of association with impaired cognition [73] .\nOur results suggest that PCSK9 is definitively involved with Tau pathology in the earlier (pre-symptomatic) stage of the disease and may eventually modulate the amyloid pathway via BACE1 as disease pathology expand. This will be examined in future studies as many of our asymptomatic subjects are bound to convert into mild cognitively impaired, and eventually in LOAD over time.\nAlthough we could not find any beneficial protective effect of \"loss of function\" PCSK9 R46L and InsLEU mutations in our recent case-control study [53] , it prompted us to further examine the variants distribution in the PCSK9 gene: leading to the identification of two interesting SNPs, namely rs4927193 and rs499718, located in PCSK9 intron 2 and 3 respectively. These variants were found to strongly associate with CSF PCSK9 levels in the CSF of our asymptomatic subjects. The association between rs4927193 C allele and AD risk in females from the QFP cohort (p<0.001, O.R. 1.46) is suggestive of a gender-specific risk allele in this population. Replication was achieved in the ADNI cohort (OR 1.806; p = 0.053) female subgroup: the association was not found in males from the either QFP or ADNI cohorts. Interestingly, a similar gender-specific difference was observed when stratifying CSF pTau and Tau values by PCSK9 rs4927193 polymorphism (Fig 5C) . In contrast to circulating PCSK9 levels which are generally higher in females compared to males, particularly after the age of 50 [74, 75] , such an effect is not observed in the CSF of PREVENT-AD participants (PCSK9 mean CSF levels \u00b1 SEM in females: 3.35 \u00b1 0.13 ng/ml and males: 3.43 \u00b1 0.21 ng/ml).\nThe female specificity of the PCSK9 variant which associates with AD risk is certainly not unique, particularly in genes directly involved in lipid metabolism. APOE (extracellular cholesterol transport), ABCA1 (intracellular cholesterol transport) and HMGCR (cholesterol synthesis) all exhibit female-specificity for their AD risk/protection associations [16, 76, 77] .\nOur results support current knowledge on the functions of PCSK9 in the central nervous system and its possible involvement in AD pathophysiology. Even though a direct mechanistic link between PCSK9 levels and total Tau and phospho-Tau has not been established, the strong positive correlations that exist between those CSF biomarkers in \"at-risk\" subjects may indicate a subclinical interaction that might increase the risk of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "PCSK9 appears to play an active role in the pathophysiology of LOAD both in the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease.
