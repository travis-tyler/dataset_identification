[{"section_title": "0", "text": "ften during operations and maintenance ( O&M) dredging of navigation channels, beneficial use strategies are \u2022 employed to keep sediments in the littoral system rather than dispose of them offshore. As part of regional sediment management, nearshore placement has become an increasingly utilized method for beneficial use of dredged material from inlets and channels. Generally, the nearshore placement option is chosen when dredged material is incompatible with native beach sediment, and cannot be placed as a beach nourishment. It is important to note that there are still restrictions on the compatibility of sediment used for nearshore placements; however, the regulations are generally less stringent. In some cases, nearshore placements are chosen because they are less costly than beach nourishments and cause fewer environmental concerns, such as impacts to sea turtle and shore bird nesting (Brutsche et al. 2014). Nearshore placements can protect the shoreline due to wave dissipation through breaking over the placement. Nearshore berms are a specific type of nearshore placement wherein the placement is a designed bar-like feature or mound, rather than discrete small mounds placed within a design template. Active nearshore berms mobilize within days to weeks following placement of the material, while stable berms remain in the placement site for years, possibly serving as a fish habitat (Hands and Allison 1991 to have a clearer understanding of what happens to the sediment once it is placed, as well as adjacent shoreline response to placement. Stakeholders and regulatory agencies often ask the questions \"once placed, will the sediment move and where will the sediment go?\" Generally, O&M navigation dredging projects do not have the funding or time required to run a full robust numerical model to provide answers to these questions. To that end, researchers at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) funded by the Coastal Inlets Research Program (CIRP) and Regional Sediment Management (RSM) Program created the Sediment Mobility Tool (SMT) as a scoping-level tool to estimate frequency of sediment mobility and general transport direction of sediment placed in the nearshore. The SMT is designed to assist in making informed decisions based on readily available data. To date, the tool has been applied to several U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USA CE) nearshore placement projects, and it continues to be applied to more projects for validation. During the summer of2015, sediment was dredged from the St. Augustine Inlet ebb and flood shoals, as well as the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, and placed in the nearshore at Vilano Beach, Florida, by   Researchers from ERDC teamed with engineers from the USACE Jacksonville District, dredge operators from the Wilmington District, and members of the Vilano Beach Homeowners' Association to study the placement. A total of 115,000 cubic meters (cu. m.) of dredged sediment were placed in the nearshore ( ~ 3 m water depth) along two separate shore parallel 300 m stretches. Two different nearshore berm designs were constructed: a linear bar-like feature and a mound feature with sediment concentrated in the center of the placement area and tapering towards the ends. The purpose of this study was to determine whether berm shape had an __._ Wave Period impact on berm evolution and adjacent shoreline response, as well as to validate tools used in nearshore placement design through field measurements. STUDY AREA Vilano Beach is located along the northeast coast of Florida, just north of St. Augustine Inlet in St. Johns County (Figure 1). The study area is typical of a barrier-inlet system that consists oflittorally derived, reworked, riverine siliciclastic sediments with varying amounts of bioclastic locally derived material (Legault et al. 2012). Carbonate shell hash and quartz make up a majority of the sand fraction, whose median grain size is approximately 0.33 mm. The beach generally has a large dune with elevation up to +6 m NAVD88 and berm crest elevation approximately +1-2 m NAVD88. The berm crest gives way to a relatively steep foreshore slope. Beach cusps are generally present along the shoreline. A dynamic bar is present at approximately -3 m NAVD88. Wave energy in the area is typically highest during the winter, with mean significant wave height of approximately 1 m and mean peak wave period of 7 sec ( Figure  2) (Legault et al. 2012). Tidal range is on the order of 1.4 m. The area generally experiences a dominant north to south longshore sediment transport in the winter months, with seasonal reversals during the relatively quiescent summer months. St. Augustine Inlet is located just to the south of Vilano Beach. The inlet is stabilized with jetties and regularly dredged (approximately every 3-5 years) to maintain the navigation channel. Sediment dredged from the channel is generally placed in the nearshore of Vilano Beach. The inlet and nearshore placement area are indicated in Figure 1."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Construction methods", "text": "The use of the USACE Wilmington District dredge Murden provided a unique opportunity to have greater flexibility with nearshore berm design and construction. The permit for the nearshore placement spans 900 m. Two different berm shapes were constructed in 300 m sections with a 300 m spacing between them (Figure 3). The two berm sections were purposefully placed along stretches of beach where houses are located to provide protection on the leeward sides of the berms. The hopper was \"light-loaded\" (i.e. was not completely filled with material) in order to allow the dredge to reach shallower depths, and place the material as close to the shoreline as possible. The dredge placed material in approximately 3 m of water, which ranged from 90-150 m from the shoreline. Each berm consisted of approximately 57,000 cu. m. of material, totaling 115,000 cu. m. Figure 3 shows the design the dredge was asked to follow, as well as the actual drop points during placement. The northern berm was a linear shape, while the southern berm a mound shape tapering off at the ends of the placement section. The dredge placed material starting in the north moving to the south, alternating placement lines to create the final designs."}, {"section_title": "Field monitoring methods", "text": "To illustrate berm evolution, three topographic-bathymetric surveys were completed. Dry beach surveys were conducted using Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems (RTK GPS). A nearshore survey was conducted using a single beam echo sounder that connected the dry beach surveys to a multibeam survey in the offshore. A pre-construction survey was conducted in July 2015, and a post-construction survey was completed in September 2015. The final survey was performed in December 2015. Surveys were analyzed to determine whether or not the dry beach gained sediment due to the presence of the nearshore berms. Dry beach changes were determined by calculating changes in the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) contour (approximately +0.6 m NAVD88). The Radar Inlet Observing System (RIOS) was also deployed and used to assess berm evolution between survey periods. RIOS utilizes X-band radar to measure wave conditions -breaking, speed, period and angle -from which depths on shoals and channels are determined (McNinch et al. 2012). Wave speed dissipation, obtained from time series of radar spikes generated by the roughened surface waves, is used to calculate water depths. Wave orbital velocities (radial components) are also explicitly measured and used to determine wave height and surface currents. RIOS calculates water depth based on the linear wave dispersion relationship. The tool is not fully intended to replace traditional bathymetric surveys, however, it allows for continuous, real-time assessment of positions of inlet channels and shoals. Camera arrays were deployed with permission from and coordination with homeowners along the beach. Two arrays were set up, one at each berm location, to provide a 180-degree visual of the coastline during the project period. Several of the cameras used Wi-Fi to email the pictures for real-time visual observations of the shoreline and dredging operations. Figure 4 shows two of the images from the camera arrays, including nearshore sediment placement by the dredge Murden (Figure 4a) and waves breaking over the newly placed material due to the shallower depth (Figure 4b)."}, {"section_title": "Modeling methods", "text": "Two different numerical models were used to predict and illustrate the evolu- The 900-m project area was divided into three, 300 m sections.

The Coastal Modeling System (CMS) is an integrated 2D numerical modeling system for simulating waves, currents, water level, sediment transport, and morphology change at coastal inlets and entrances (Lin et al. 2008;Reed et al. 2011). There are two models within the CMS, Wave and Flow, that can be steered to provide a full quantification of waves, currents, and sediment transport for the area. The CMS model was run using tides, waves, and wind during the same time frame as the surveys. Water surface elevation data from NOAA tide gauge #8720218 (30\u00b0 23.9' N, 81\u00b0 25.7' W) at Mayport, Florida (NOAA 2017, https://tidesonline.noaa.gov!), were used for the CMS modeling efforts, and wind and wave forcing were obtained from NDBC buoys SAUFl (29\u00b051.4' N, 81\u00b015.9' W) and #41010 (28\u00b054.2' N, 78\u00b027.8' W)), respectively (NDBC 2017, www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) . Hydrodynamic and wind data were gathered from 15 September to 16 December, 2015 (the post-construction survey to the final survey) for the modeling effort. Surveys collected in the field were used provide updated bathymetric data to a previously validated grid for the project area (Legault  The Sediment Mobility Tool (SMT) was run using waves extracted from the CMS model at the nearshore placement site (Figure 2). SMT is a scoping level tool designed to estimate the frequency of sediment mobility and general transport direction of sediment placed in the nearshore. The SMT calculates the frequency of sediment mobility and sediment migration direction using linear and nonlinear wave theories, and empirically derived relationships (McFall et al. 2016). In order to determine frequency of mobility, linear wave theory is used to calculate bed shear stress, and non-linear wave theory is used to calculate near-bottom velocity. For each of the waves in the given study period, the \" the frequency specific sediment grain sizes are mobilized is determined using the critical threshold for motion initiation. The mean mobility score is the averaged difference between the measured bed shear stress or near-bed velocity normalized by the critical threshold. The score provides an understanding of how much the average bed shear stress or near-bed velocity exceeds the critical threshold. On and offshore migration of the nearshore berm is predicted based on Larson and Kraus ( 1992) which showed that reasonable estimation of the offshore bar migration could be determined using the dimensionless Dean number: where is the offshore wave height, is the sediment fall speed, and is the wave period. Dean Number, D, values greater than 7 .2 were found to induce erosive, offshore bar migration and values less than 7.2 resulted in accretionary, onshore bar migration. Finally, the tool creates a wave rose to predict general longshore sediment transport direction. More details of the SMT can be found in McFall et al. (2016)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The following section discusses the results of the modeling efforts, including both the Coastal Modeling System and Sediment Mobility Tool. The analysis of the field monitoring data is also presented and discussed."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Modeling System", "text": "Results from the CMS model provide an improved qualitative understanding of the hydrodynamic conditions in the nearshore and sediment transport of the berms. Additionally, the results were compared to the results of the SMT. Figure 5 shows the bathymetry of the project area in September 2015 as compared to December 2015. In September 2015, the two berms are distinct features in the bathymetric contours. By December 2015, the two shapes are no longer distinct, and material appears to have moved in the alongshore direction, as indicated by the widening of the shallow contours. Contours in the offshore direction have not gained sediment between the two survey periods. From these two images, the sediment appears to have migrated onshore and diffused in the alongshore direction. In addition to illustrating bathymetric changes, the model provided insight into the changes in the hydrodynamic conditions in the area due to the presence of the nearshore berms. Figure 6a shows the changes in wave height as waves propagate onshore. The figure shows a relatively energetic wave condition for the study area to more clearly illustrate changes in the wave conditions due to the presence of the nearshore berms. The contours show wave height, and the arrows show relative height and direction. The perturbation in the nearshore caused waves to break further offshore, along the crest of the berms rather than at the shoreline. This caused the strongest longshore currents along the crest of the nearshore berms ( Figure 6b) rather than at the shoreline."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Mobility Tool", "text": "Results from the SMT were used to predict how often the nearshore placement material would mobilize, as well as transport direction. The following section describes the SMT predictions for the Vilano Beach nearshore placement area. Figure 7a shows the histogram of maximum bed shear stresses using the wave conditions extracted from the CMS model. The legend shows the median grain size, critical shear stress, frequency of sediment mobility, f M' and mean mobility score. The frequency of mobility applies to the specified median grain size diameter, and in this case sediment mobility ranges from 93% to 98% with smaller grain size diameter sediments being mobilized more frequently. For the project grain size of 0.33 mm, the tool calculated that sediment would mobilize 92.8% of the time. Additionally, the relatively high mean mobility score indicates that the nearshore berms will be active. Figure 7b shows a histogram of the near-bottom velocity as a function of the number of waves in each shear stress bin. The critical velocities per median grain size are shown with dashed lines. The frequency of mobility ranged from 99% to 100% depending on the grain size. For the project grain size of0.33 mm, the tool calculated that sediment would be mobilized by 99.6% of the waves. Similar to the linear wave theory, the high mean mobility score indicates the nearshore berms will be active. The increased sediment mobility using the nonlinear stream function wave theory compared to linear wave theory is observed between the histograms in Figure 7, and is likely due to the nonlinear stream function theory accounting for the wave asymmetry at this shallow placement site."}, {"section_title": "Frequency of sediment mobility", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sediment mobility direction", "text": "The sediment fall speed is dependent on the grain size diameter and is calculated with the equations derived by Hallermeier (1981). The Dean Number is calculated for each wave record and the calculated sediment migration results are shown in Table 1. The finer sands are generally transported offshore, while the coarser sands are transported towards shore. For the project grain size of 0.33 mm, the tool calculated that 100% of the waves would cause sediment to migrate onshore. The wave rose in Figure 8 shows the axis of wave dominated transport to account for the longshore sediment transport.

To summarize, the SMT calculated that the nearshore berms would be active, and sediment would be frequently mobilized using both the linear and nonlinear wave theories. The tool also calculated that the material would migrate onshore by using the Dean Number, and have a southerly longshore sediment transport component using the resultant vector as 79% offshore 94% onshore 100% onshore 100% onshore 100% onshore the dominant axis of wave direction. The SMT agrees well with the CMS model prediction that sediment would mobilize and generally move onshore. Figure 9 illustrates changes in the MHHW contour line between the July 2015 pre-construction survey and December 2015 final post-construction survey. From the graph, two salients appear to have formed on the leeward side of each of the berms. The northern salient is wider, with a shorter peak, extending seaward less than 4 m over the entire study period. The southern salient is narrower, with a much larger peak, extending seaward nearly 10 m. The differences in salient shape may be due to the two different berm designs, the northern berm being a linear shape, while the southern berm a mounded shape. Based on the surveys, it is unclear as to whether the sediment gain on the leeward side of the berms is due to sediment transport from the berm to the beach or due to wave breaking further offshore causing the natural longshore sediment transport to accrete on the lee side of the berms ."}, {"section_title": "Nearshore berm evolution", "text": "The RIOS was deployed prior to placement of the sediment in the nearshore and remained for several months postplacement to qualitatively assess changes in the nearshore berms between surveys ( Figure 10). By the end of August 2015 (Figure lOa), both berms were clearly present in the RIOS scans, with both exhibiting distinct shapes in the nearshore. One month later (Figure lOb ), the berm shapes became less distinct, and a gain of sediment was identified in the nearshore of the section of the project area between the berms. The shallower depths at that location as well as on the leeward side of the berms indicates both alongshore and onshore movement of the berms. By Oc-July to December Shoreline Change 10 1----------  Distance from Northern Line (m) 2015. Through time, the berm sediments appear to diffuse in the longshore and migrate onshore as is evidenced by the increase intensity in the RIOS results on the leeward side of the berms as well as in the gap between the two berms. tober 2015 (Figure lOc), the two distinct berm shapes are nearly gone, and there was a gain in sediment in the nearshore indicated by the shallower depths. Finally, by December 2015 ( Figure IOd), the sediment from the two berms has completely dispersed, and they are no longer marked by two distinct features. The diffusion in the alongshore may have been caused by the southward longshore current seen in the CMS model and predicted by the wave rose generated in the SMT showing waves predominantly out of the northeast. Overall, the evolution of the berms captured by the RIOS indicates that the material moved onshore and alongshore, consistent with the results of the SMT. CONCLUSIONS Sediment dredged from the St. Augustine Inlet ebb and flood shoals and the Intracoastal Waterway was placed in the nearshore of Vilano Beach, Florida during the summer of 2015 in two different berm shapes in the placement area. The Sediment Mobility Tool (SMT) was run to estimate the frequency at which sediment placed in the nearshore would be mobilized, and the general transport direction. The SMT calculated that sediment would mobilize frequently, and migrate onshore with a southerly longshore sediment transport component. The Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was run to help validate the SMT and to illustrate changes in the hydrodynamic conditions of the project area due to the placement of the nearshore berms, with surveys and the Radar Inlet Observing System (RIOS) monitoring bathymetric changes in the project area. The CMS model and RIOS bathymetric data showed that the placement material migrated onshore and diffused alongshore during the study period, which is consistent with the SMT results. Additionally, a camera array provided additional visual information on dredging operations and qualitative changes to the beach and nearshore. Based on the camera arrays and the surveys, the CMS model correctly predicted that the presence of the berms caused waves to break further offshore, likely causing the salients that formed along the shoreline. Thus, the SMT accurately calculated the berms would be active and migrate onshore with a southerly longshore transport direction, which was confirmed with field measurements."}]
