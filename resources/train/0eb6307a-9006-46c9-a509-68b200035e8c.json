However, a proportion of cases show discrepancies between the results of the two biomarker modalities which may reflect inter-individual differences in A\u2424 metabolism. The CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio seems to be a more accurate biomarker of clinical AD than CSF A\u2424 42 alone. Objective: We tested whether CSF A\u2424 42 alone or the A\u2424 42/40 ratio corresponds better with amyloid PET status and analyzed the distribution of cases with discordant CSF-PET results. Methods: CSF obtained from a mixed cohort (n = 200) of cognitively normal and abnormal research participants who had undergone amyloid PET within 12 months (n = 150 PET-negative, n = 50 PET-positive according to a previously published cut-off) was assayed for A\u2424 42 and A\u2424 40 using two recently developed immunoassays. Optimal CSF cut-offs for amyloid positivity were calculated, and concordance was tested by comparison of the areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and McNemar's test for paired proportions. \n814\nResults: CSF A\u2424 42/40 corresponded better than A\u2424 42 with PET results, with a larger proportion of concordant cases (89.4% versus 74.9%, respectively, p < 0.0001) and a larger AUC (0.936 versus 0.814, respectively, p < 0.0001) associated with the ratio. For both CSF biomarkers, the percentage of CSF-abnormal/PET-normal cases was larger than that of CSF-normal/PETabnormal cases. Conclusion: The CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio is superior to A\u2424 42 alone as a marker of amyloid-positivity by PET. We hypothesize that this increase in performance reflects the ratio compensating for general between-individual variations in CSF total A\u2424."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Reduced concentrations of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) 1-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with increased retention of A\u2424 tracers in the brain via positron emission tomography (PET) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and both are considered the earliest biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, several published studies show that results of the two measures are discordant in a proportion of individuals in the cohorts evaluated to date, most notably as CSF A\u2424 42 abnormal/amyloid PET-normal (reviewed in [11] ). Such discordance may reflect assay methodological variability and/or imprecision, or these biomarker modalities may reflect partly different pathophysiologic events [12] .\nResults from several groups demonstrate that normalization of the CSF A\u2424 42 concentration to the level of total A\u2424 peptides (or the most abundant isoform, A\u2424 1-40 [A\u2424 40 ]) in the CSF by means of an A\u2424 42/40 ratio improves the accuracy of clinical AD diagnosis [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] by \"controlling for\" inter-individual differences in overall levels of CSF A\u2424. This led us to hypothesize that the CSF concentration of A\u2424 42 depends not only on the pathophysiological status of a given individual, hence suggesting the presence or absence of AD pathology, but also on the total amount of A\u2424 peptides in the CSF, i.e., the total production of A\u2424 in the brain. At least two additional arguments, derived from experience regarding preanalytical sample handling and data interpretation, further support the application of the A\u2424 42/40 ratio for AD diagnostic purposes: (a) A\u2424 42/40 is less prone to the error of misinterpretation when inappropriate test tubes to collect CSF are used [18] (likely due to the similar amount of absorption of both A\u2424 species); and (b) in two studies that applied the A\u2424 42/40 ratio measured with the same ELISA assays to predict AD in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects [15] or in early symptomatic AD [19] , virtually identical A\u2424 42/40 cut-offs were obtained despite differences in absolute A\u2424 42 concentrations.\nConsidering these data, we hypothesized that the CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio might reflect amyloid PET status (positive versus negative) better than the A\u2424 42 concentration alone. To test this hypothesis, we used dichotomized PET results to calculate the optimal cut-offs for A\u2424 42 concentrations and A\u2424 42/40 ratios measured with two novel, recently validated ELISAs [14] , and then compared the concordance of each of the two CSF biomarkers with the results of the amyloid PET. We also compared the distribution of the discordant results, i.e., the percentage of cases with pathologic CSF findings and normal PET results versus the percentage with normal CSF and pathologic PET results. We proposed that the results from these analyses might provide insight into the possible mechanism(s) for the observed known discordance between amyloid imaging and levels of CSF A\u2424 42 and, thus, may be informative for pathologic disease staging."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Washington University Human Research Protection Office, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Lewczuk et al. / Correlation between A\u03b2-PET and A\u03b2 42/40 Ratio", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The main finding in this study is significantly better concordance of the CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio, compared to CSF A\u2424 42 alone, with cortical A\u2424 deposition as measured by [ 11 C] PiB PET. This finding is consistent with our [14] and others' [16, 17] reports of better diagnostic accuracy of the A\u2424 42/40 ratio compared to A\u2424 42 in early AD, as well as with CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration, Tau and pTau181 [13] . We hypothesize that the concentration of A\u2424 42 in the CSF depends not only on the physiological amyloid status of a given individual (presence or absence of amyloid pathology) but also on the total amount of A\u2424 peptides that are present. By normalizing to the concentration of A\u2424 40 , the most abundant A\u2424 species in the CSF, the ratio removes the potential confound of differences in overall A\u2424 concentration and provides a better index of underlying amyloid-related pathology. Two experimental observations further support the application of the A\u2424 42/40 ratio for AD diagnostics: (a) A\u2424 42/40 is less prone to the error of misinterpretation when non-polypropylene test tubes (as are often found in standard clinical LP trays) are used to collect CSF [18] likely due to the fact that both A\u2424 isoforms seem to absorb to the tube surface to a similar extent; and (b) two studies using a different set of ELISAs (produced by a currently non-existing vendor and based on N-terminally non-specific antibodies) that have applied the A\u2424 42/40 ratio to predict AD in MCI subjects [15] and discriminate early symptomatic AD from controls [19] reported almost identical A\u2424 42/40 cut-offs (0.095 and 0.098, respectively), whereas the corresponding cut-offs for A\u2424 42 alone differed by more than 15% (640 pg/mL and 550 pg/mL, respectively).\nThe analyses of CSF A\u2424 isoforms in the current study were performed with two novel assays that were validated recently by our group and approved for human in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use in Europe [14] . The assays exhibit very good analytical performance, both apply the same protocol for sample dilution, incubation, and washing steps, and require only a small volume (25 L) of CSF for both biomarkers measured in duplicate. Interestingly, we observed small but significantly (p = 0.047) elevated levels of CSF A\u2424 40 in the PiB+ group compared to the PiBgroup. This is consistent with similarly slight, but significant, increases observed in the MCI/AD group compared to controls when measured with the same assay [14] . Also, in a recent study by Dorey et al. [33] investigating the performance of these markers for correspondence with clinical diagnosis, CSF A\u2424 40 concentrations were higher in AD than non-AD patients, and inclusion of CSF A\u2424 40 as an A\u2424 42/40 ratio corrected 76.2% of misinterpreted cases in AD patients with normal CSF A\u2424 42 concentrations and 94.7% of cases when A\u2424 40 was used alone. When we adjusted for the A\u2424 42/40 ratio, but not for A\u2424 42 alone, the A\u2424 40 concentration became insignificant as a predictor of amyloid PET status in the logistic regression models, whereas both A\u2424 42 and the A\u2424 42/40 ratio remained highly significant as predictors of amyloid PET after adjustment for A\u2424 40 , age, APOE 4 carriage, and sex. After adjustment for other covariates, older age remained a significant predictor of cortical amyloid-PET positivity, consistent with age being the strongest risk factor for AD. Odds ratio of A\u2424 42 -PET versus A\u2424 42/40 -PET discordant cases, resulting from McNemar test, indicates that the odds to falsely predict the PET outcome is five-fold lower with the A\u2424 42/40 ratio compared to A\u2424 42 alone.\nBoth biomarker modalities (CSF analysis and amyloid PET) have their practical advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost (actual and reimbursable), perceived invasiveness, and availability in clinical as well as research settings [34] , and our results do not endorse one or the other as a \"gold standard\" for amyloid biomarker positivity. From a scientific point of view, the discordance between CSF A\u2424 42 and amyloid PET (typically observed as false positives, i.e., abnormal/low CSF A\u2424 42 in the absence of amyloid-PET positivity) has been hypothesized to be due to possible methodological variability/limitations in the CSF assays, differences in the temporal trajectories of processes identified by the two biomarker modalities (e.g., CSF levels of soluble A\u2424 42 becoming abnormal prior to aggregated A\u2424 42 [amyloid] becoming detectable by PET), and/or inter-individual differences in overall levels of A\u2424 peptides [9, 12] . These possible scenarios are not mutually exclusive. Our use of well-performing assays that utilize the same dilution factor for both A\u2424 42 and A\u2424 40 minimizes methodological variability as a source of discordance between CSF A\u2424 42 and amyloid PET results and increases the confidence of the ratio as being an accurate measure of the proportion of each of these species in CSF. In so doing, the increase in concordance that we observe for the A\u2424 42/40 ratio suggests much of the \"false positives\" as defined by CSF A\u2424 42 is due to lower overall levels of A\u2424 in these individuals, whereas the \"false negatives\" can be attributed in large part to higher overall CSF A\u2424 levels. Indeed, the negative predictive value of the A\u2424 42/40 ratio in this study (98%) approached 100%, thus supporting its use for ruling out the presence of underlying amyloid pathology. While use of the ratio also significantly increased the positive predictive value for cortical amyloid PET positivity, 9% of individuals in this cohort were still classified as amyloid-positive by CSF A\u2424 42/40 but amyloid-negative by PET (false negative), consistent with CSF A\u2424 42 levels dropping prior to cortical amyloid being detectable by PiB PET. That all but one participant in this discordant group (whether CSF abnormality was defined by A\u2424 42 alone or the A\u2424 42/40 ratio) were cognitively normal is consistent with findings from a recent study in which low CSF A\u2424 42 but normal amyloid PET was much more frequent in cognitively normal individuals and early MCI cases than in the late MCI stage or AD dementia [12] . Longitudinal CSF and amyloid PET biomarker evaluation will be required to test whether levels of CSF A\u2424 42 indeed become abnormal (drop) before amyloid-positivity is detected with PET as has been suggested by a recent study by Vlassenko and colleagues [30] . That study, however, did not assess CSF A\u2424 40 so comparison of the two CSF measures was not possible. Results of a recent study by Palmqvist et al. also suggest that decreases in CSF A\u2424 42 precede alterations in amyloid PET [35] . Interestingly, another recent study using different ELISAs also reported better correspondence of the A\u2424 42/40 ratio with A\u2424 PET, however, with a higher proportion of A\u2424-/PET+ individuals compared to the present study [36] . This discrepancy is likely due to the differences in the cohorts (higher numbers of cognitively normal individuals expected to be in the preclinical period in the current cohort) and/or different methodological issues. Another study reported no significant differences in concordances between A\u2424 42/40 and A\u2424 42 with amyloid PET, although the AUC for A\u2424 42/40 was slightly larger than that for A\u2424 42 alone [37] . This lack of significance might be attributed to the lower statistical power (a much smaller cohort, n = 38) and/or the use of different ELISAs and PET tracer ( 18 F-flutemetamol) in that study. Similarly, another smaller study concluded that the A\u2424 42/40 ratio had a \"large\" effect size (defined as Cohen's f 2 = 0.35), compared to a \"medium\" effect size (defined as Cohen's f 2 = 0.15), for A\u2424 42 , in predicting concurrent PiB burden [38] . Aggregation of soluble A\u2424 into diffuse, non-fibrillar plaques that are not identifiable by amyloid PET imaging may also contribute to the \"false negative\" discordant cases [39] . If confirmed, a finding of CSF alterations preceding those in PET would support the CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio (and perhaps even A\u2424 42 alone, albeit with less accuracy) as the earliest detectable marker of \u2424-amyloidosis.\nOur study is not without limitations. Although amyloid PET in this study is considered to be the reference to define the presence of amyloid, positivity was defined according to dichotomous, researchbased thresholds in a defined set of cortical regions. Also, since samples were specifically selected to over-represent possible CSF/PET discordance (by evaluating 25% PET-positive and 75% PET-negative cases), the cohort does not reflect the general distribution of amyloid PET positivity in the general population. Furthermore, because of this strategy, the cohort was significantly skewed toward cognitively normal individuals (88% cognitively normal, 12% cognitively abnormal). Additional study is needed in larger cohorts comprised of greater numbers of cognitively abnormal individuals, as well as those clinically diagnosed with non-AD dementias in order to better evaluate the CSF/PET concordance in non-AD populations. Finally, we performed statistical analyses of concordance after calculating optimal cut-off values for both CSF biomarkers. As this was designed to be a biomarker concordance study, independent of clinical status, the diagnostic value of any of the biomarkers and modalities studied here remains to be evaluated.\nIn summary, the CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio performs better, compared to CSF A\u2424 42 alone, in identifying individuals with versus without underlying cortical amyloid as defined by PiB PET. The ratio outperforms the single A\u2424 42 measure in all metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy. Of special note is its better concordance in individuals classified as amyloid-negative by PET, suggesting that the higher discordance between CSF A\u2424 42 alone and amyloid PET-positivity may reflect overall lower levels of A\u2424 42 in some individuals as opposed to its aggregation into plaques (or oligomeric forms that are likely not detected with the current assays [40] . The CSF A\u2424 42/40 ratio may, therefore, be useful as a proxy for amyloid status in AD clinical trials and eventually in clinical care settings."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This study was supported by IBL International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany, and grants P50 AG05681, P01 AG03991 and P01 AG026276 from the National Institute on Aging/National Institute of Health (NIA/NIH) (JC Morris, PI).
