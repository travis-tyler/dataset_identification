[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. The Gompertz state-space (GSS) model is a stochastic model for analyzing time series 1 observations of population abundances. The GSS model combines density dependence, 2 environmental process noise, and observation error toward estimating quantities of interest in 3 biological monitoring and population viability analysis. However, existing methods for 4 estimating the model parameters apply only to population data with equal time intervals between 5 observations. In the present paper, we extend the GSS model to data with unequal time intervals, 6\nby embedding it within a state-space version of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a continuous-7 time model of an equilibrating stochastic system. Maximum likelihood and restricted maximum 8 likelihood calculations for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck state-space model involve only numerical 9 maximization of an explicit multivariate normal likelihood, and so the extension allows for easy 10 bootstrapping, yielding confidence intervals for model parameters, statistical hypothesis testing 11 of density dependence, and selection among submodels using information criteria. Ecologists 12 and managers previously drawn to models lacking density dependence or observation error 13 because such models accommodated unequal time intervals (for example, due to missing data) 14 now have an alternative analysis framework incorporating density dependence, process noise and 15 observation error. 16"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 1", "text": "Gaps in time series observations of population abundances pose challenges for analysis. 2\nVarious statistical models for ecological time series data, especially models incorporating 3 realistic population dynamics, require observations spaced at equal time intervals. However, 4 ecological sampling involves constraints of time, personnel, and budgets that do not always live 5 up to the designs and requirements of statistical models. As well, various ecological systems 6 such as aquatic or microbial systems (Kirchman 2012) have intrinsically continuous-time 7 dynamics and are sometimes sampled at unequal time intervals. Ordinarily equal time intervals 8 will be stretched and shrunk into unequal intervals in systems in which time is measured in 9 degree days (Metcalf and Luckmann 1994) . The data that do exist in studies with missing data or 10 unequal time intervals are potentially informative, and precluding such data from analysis could 11 affect conclusions regarding the biological resources in question. The monitoring and 12 management of biological populations would benefit from having better models for analyzing 13 time series data with unequal time intervals. 14 Dennis et al. Although the GSS model can accomodate missing observations from otherwise equally spaced 20 time series, the GSS model does not allow observations collected at unequal, non-integer time 21 intervals and hence is not suitable for ecological situations in which time is considered to be real-22"}, {"section_title": "valued. 23", "text": "Various state space population models of greater complexity can handle unequally spaced 1 data (de Valpine and Hastings 2002 , de Valpine 2002 , 2004 , Clark and Bj\u00f8rnstad 2004 , Ionides 2 et al. 2006 , Lele et al. 2007 , Ponciano et al. 2009 ) .

Adapting such models to other data sets with other 8 configurations of missing observations would require reprogramming the calculations for each 9 new case. 10 A special case of the GSS model is a density independent state space model. The 11 exponential growth state space (EGSS) model was introduced by Holmes (2001) , and parameter 12 estimation was studied by Lindley (2003) and Staples et al. (2004) . By contrast to the GSS 13 model, the EGSS model has been generalized to apply to unequal, real-valued time intervals 14 (Staudenmayer and Buonaccorsi 2006, Humbert et al. 2009). 15 This paper extends the full, density dependent GSS model to unequal, real-valued 16 time intervals. The method used employs a stochastic version of the continuous-time, 17 deterministic Gompertz growth model as the underlying model of population growth (process 18 model). The stochastic version is a continuous-time diffusion process representing type density dependent growth perturbed by environmental noise. Transforming the process 20 model to the logarithmic scale produces the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a well-studied 21 diffusion process. Finally, adding an observation error component produces a state-space version 22 of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. The state space model has discrete-time statistical properties 23 identical to those of a GSS model, but has a likelihood function that can be written for time 1\nseries observations recorded at arbitrary real-valued time intervals. The likelihood makes 2 accessible a variety of statistical inferences based on parametric bootstrapping. Four example 3 data sets serve to illustrate statistical inferences with the model. Procedures for calculating 4 confidence intervals for model parameters and for conducting bootstrap tests of density 5 dependence are described in the online Appendix to this paper, and R programs for all statistical 6 inferences are provided (Supplementary Material online) . 7"}, {"section_title": "POPULATION MODEL 8", "text": "Deterministic Gompertz model 9\nThe Gompertz curve (after Gompertz 1825) originally was an actuarial model of 10 mortality, but since the 1920s biologists have been using the curve as a deterministic model of 11 biological growth, variously to describe the growth of tumors, individuals, or populations 12 (Winsor 1932) .

Eqs. 6 and 12 together constitute the OUSS model. The underlying actual 8 population log-abundance is unobserved. 9\nThe observations (estimates or indexes of log-population 10 abundance) recorded at times need not be equally spaced. The observations 11 under the OUSS model have a joint multivariate normal distribution, but the distribution takes 12 two different forms, non-stationary and stationary, depending on the situation being modeled. If 13 the population abundances have commenced far from equilibrium, the observations have the 14 non-stationary distribution in which the mean of each is 15 , \n6 and the covariance of the process at two different times and is given by 7 .\n(18) 8\nIn either the stationary or non-stationary case the joint distribution of the observations is similar 9\nto that of the underlying OU process, except that the quantity is added to the variance of each 10\n. Two different methods for fitting the model to data (Statistical Methods, below) arise from 11 whether or not the population has become stationary. 12\nThe OUSS model can be regarded as a continuous time version of the GSS model.

Using the 13 multivariate normal distribution, the model can be fitted to data with maximum likelihood (ML) 14 estimation.

Examples of such situations might occur when monitoring the translocation of a 12 species by release of a few individuals into the wild, the colonization of a new area by an 13 invading species, the increase of an agricultural pest through a growing season starting from low 14 density, the recovery of a species after a catastrophic decline, or the growth of microbial 15 populations in experimental laboratory cultures (Ponciano et al. 2005) . The initial population 16 log-abundance usually becomes an additional unknown parameter in the nonstationary model, 17 unless its value is known without sampling error (such as might be the case for a species 18 translocation or a laboratory inoculation). 19 ML estimation is available for the nonstationary case, but REML estimation is not 20 available.

Plankton sampling schedules in aquatic systems, for instance, might not adhere to 21 rigidly equal intervals. In insect ecology, degree days are routinely used as a time scale, and the 22 application of a degree-day transformation to sampling times with equal intervals invariably 23 produces unequal intervals on the new scale. In such cases, the unequal intervals cannot be 1 handled merely by dropping observations from the multivariate normal log-likelihood function.
