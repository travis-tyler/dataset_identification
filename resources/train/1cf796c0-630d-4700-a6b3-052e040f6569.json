[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Taiwan has noticed relative disadvantages in rural areas and offered more scholarship opportunities for aboriginal and low-income students. Moreover, the Educational Priority Area program was implemented in 1996 to invest additional funds in rural schools. Although the average mathematics ability of Taiwanese students ranks high in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the cost-benefit outcome of government funding in rural areas is inadequate. This paper, therefore, tries to explain low student achievement in rural areas with the multilevel modeling (HLM). Data were gathered from 5,581 Taiwanese students in 236 junior high schools using stratified random sampling. Of the data, 2,358 students from 112 rural area schools and 3,223 students from 124 non-rural area schools were sampled. The results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between resources and investments, and shifts focus from comparisons of the influence of families and schools preexisting conditions to discussions of improvement strategies on mathematics performance. Both families and schools are limited by their resources, but the findings presented in this study suggest that families and schools can improve student achievement with appropriate investments."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "disadvantages in these areas result in the isolation of rural locations from other areas (Webster and Fisher 2000) . Young (1998) discovered that school location was the main factor affecting student achievement levels, especially math scores. With samples from Western Australia, Young determined that location could explain 37.6 % variance between schools and argued that students in rural areas demonstrated low socioeconomic status (SES) and student achievement. Furthermore, students in rural areas had higher dropout rates and were taught by less qualified teachers (Mitchem et al. 2006; Roscigno and Crowley 2001) . Scholars found low student achievement especially noteworthy because students' scores not only demonstrated the quality of their education, they also had a decisive effect on student income in the future (Lee and Barro 2001). According to 2006 math scores from PISA, low grades for rural students may be a problem in countries other than Australia and the United States as well.\nAlthough the average mathematics ability of Taiwanese students ranked high in PISA 2006, Taiwan may face even greater problems with low scores for rural students than other areas. Table 1 shows that rural (village) students in Taiwan have substantially lower math scores than their counterparts in small and large cities. These students also show higher variance than other students in Taiwan and even other countries, suggesting large score differences among rural students. Numerous researchers are concerned with low student achievement in rural areas and have attempted to develop approaches for improving student scores. Behrman et al. (1997) indicated that school inputs, such as school equipment and infrastructures, had little influence on student achievement in rural Pakistan. Instead, teacher quality and student exposure to teachers were more essential to improving achievement. They further recommended that investment in schools should focus on teacher quality rather than school facilities. Webster and Fisher (2000) study provided similar results. They used the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) database to investigate resource availability in rural and urban Australian schools and discovered that school resources had no influence on math and science scores. However, Daley et al. (2005) found that both physical and teacher qualities were positively correlated with arithmetic scores in rural Kenya.\nResearchers studying rural student achievement tend to use \"school input,\" \"school resources,\" and \"school quality\" to represent school conditions. However, these studies fail to integrate categories that can be improved with those that cannot, and, consequently, fail to provide rural schools and students with useful strategies for improvement. For example, Behrman et al. (1997) determined that the cognitive achievement of teachers in mathematics, the educational attainment of teachers, and experience were proxy variables for teacher quality, but it is difficult to improve these variables. Daley et al. (2005) showed a similar problem. In their paper, Daley et al. (2005) provided only one indicator (teacher organization of classrooms) of four that could actually be improved. In addition, most researchers focus on indirect"}]
