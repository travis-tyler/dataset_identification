[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We have developed a novel medical image processing technology for objective, accurate, and non-invasive diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease using standard clinical brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and basic clinical cognitive assessment. The technology is a robust, highly accurate, fully automated, high-throughput, cloud-based platform, which operates in a fully integrated and controlled environment. In diagnosis mode, our technology performs with 91% balanced accuracy on blind testing to diagnose the current neurocognitive status, and in prognosis mode or early detection at mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage with 88% balanced accuracy on blind testing to predict progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within 5 years. Such prognostic capability is currently non-existent, even in specialty clinics and hospitals, a major factor in Alzheimer's clinical trial failures. The algorithm's diagnostic certainty precisely mirrors the diagnostic confidence of an expert cognitive neurologist for both MCI (Spearman's Rho = 1) and AD (Rho = 1). In addition to widespread clinical applications, this novel technology can enable correct patient selection and therapeutic effect monitoring in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease, the crucial elements to finding a cure."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Dementia is the largest and most expensive healthcare challenge of our generation and likely the next. Fifty million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60%-80% of which is due to Alzheimer's disease. The global cost of dementia care has already reached a trillion dollars [1] and is projected to double by 2030 as the baby boomer generation is aging [2] . As families, governments and private insurance providers are heavily burdened by the increasing cost of dementia care, scientists and clinicians remain uncertain about the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and how to detect early, prevent, slow down, or stop it. Figure 1 depicts the course of Alzheimer's disease with emphasis on the lack of an early detection method."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.", "text": "Stages of Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia. Early detection of Alzheimer's pathology in PS and MCI stages is missing in clinical practice and clinical trials today. Note that MCI may also be caused by brain diseases other than Alzheimer's.\nInitially promising drug candidates keep failing one after another in large clinical trials [3] . The reasons for these failures are shown in Figure 2 [4] . These include the lack of accurate and objective methods to 1) identify who should be selected for clinical trials, those who definitely have Alzheimer's disease; 2) identify those at earlier stages of the disease who can potentially benefit from promising therapeutics; 3) stratify different sub-types of Alzheimer's disease based on localization of pathology in the brain and to match each trial population with the drug with the most appropriate mechanism of action, and 4) monitor drug effect during clinical trials by measures that are agnostic to the cause of the disease and reflect the "}, {"section_title": "Early detection of Alzheimer's pathology:", "text": "Non-existent today objective health of brain tissue in alignment with expected biological and clinical gain in cognition and disease modification."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.", "text": "Reasons why Alzheimer's drug trials keep failing [4] .\nCognitive testing and medical history taking that are currently routinely used in clinics and hospitals reveal a lot of information about the current cognitive status of the brain and therefore are used as the basis for the clinician's assessment. However, they remain inaccurate and unreliable about the prognosis or future cognitive status of the patient. Even for evaluation and diagnosis at the time of the patient's visit, there is a great amount of subjectivity both in cognitive assessment and in the clinician's judgement [5] .\nBy the time there is a significant amyloid-beta plaque burden in the brain, amyloid-targeting PET (Positron Emission Tomography) tracers can reveal and quantify the plaque burden in vivo [6] [7] [8] . Amyloid-beta, although a classic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, is a non-specific biomarker which can accumulate in normal aging and in other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases as well. Whether or not detecting amyloid plaque burden by PET will affect the clinical outcome remains to be seen in future studies [9] . Amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease seems to be irreversible, even after the amyloid plaques are completely wiped out with anti-amyloid therapeutics, raising doubts on the anti-amyloid treatment approach. Amyloid PET is an expensive imaging modality which is not readily available in hospitals around the world. Repeated Amyloid PET scanning subjects the individual to cumulatively significant amounts of X-Ray radiation during the CT (computed tomography) portion of the scan, in addition to the radiation coming from the injected radioactive tracer, F18-labeled anti-Amyloid antibody.\nAlzheimer's disease is generally considered as an amyloid-induced tauopathy [10] . By the time there is significant neurofibrillary tangle burden in the brain, tau-targeting PET tracers can reveal and quantify the tau load in vivo [6, 7] . Whether or not abnormal tau protein is the right biomarker to target and whether removing tau pathology would modify the course of Alzheimer's disease remains to be seen in future clinical trials. Tau PET, like amyloid PET is an expensive imaging modality which is not readily available in hospitals around the world. Similar to amyloid PET imaging, repeated tau PET scanning exposes the individual to cumulatively significant amounts of X-Ray radiation during the CT portion of the scan, in addition to the radiation coming from the injected radioactive tracer, F18-labeled anti-Tau antibody.\nLoss of gray matter mass in later stages of neurodegeneration can be revealed by FDG (Fluoro-Deoxy Glucose) PET scan, which reflects reduced glucose metabolism in the affected brain regions. The pattern of hypometabolism on FDG PET scan is used clinically for differential diagnosis of the etiology of dementia [6, 7] . Given that glucose metabolism is not specific to any brain disease, whether or not the gray matter metabolic rate can be used as a biomarker to monitor anti-Alzheimer treatment effect has not yet been established. Although in common clinical practice for four decades, predominantly for oncologic applications, FDG PET remains an expensive imaging modality, with availability limited mostly to industrial or developed countries. Repeated FDG PET scanning subjects the individual to cumulatively significant amounts of X-Ray radiation during the CT portion of the scan, in addition to the radiation coming from the injected radioactive tracer, F18-labeled glucose.\nAmyloid and tau protein measurements in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used as surrogates for amyloid and tau presence in the brain. Obtaining a CSF sample requires an invasive procedure called a lumbar puncture, which is costly and very inconvenient for the patient. Repetitive CSF sampling is impractical in both clinical and research settings.\nUnlike PET imaging and CSF sampling, MRI has the advantage of being safe (no radiation or contrast agent injection), non-invasive, information-rich, and relatively inexpensive, at about 1/4 of the cost of PET. MRI can reveal detailed information about the brain tissue at millimeter scale, as is routinely evaluated by the clinical radiologist. It is the standard modality in clinical neuroimaging and MRI scanners are widely available throughout the world [11] .\nThe development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease has been very active in the past decade [8, 12] . This has been made possible by the joint effort of the scientific community and funding agencies to: 1) collect, curate and publicly release longitudinal databases focused on Alzheimer's disease e.g. ADNI, OASIS, and AIBL, which include multiple data collection methods and modalities including cognitive tests, genetics, MRI, and PET, and 2) democratize machine learning techniques through standardization of training and evaluation and facilitated access to cutting-edge algorithms.\nThe earliest results of studying Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging data started to emerge in 2005 and the accuracy and robustness of the techniques kept increasing as larger datasets were made available and more advanced techniques were developed and employed. In the clinically useful and relevant context of predicting progression from MCI to AD (prognosis or early detection at MCI stage), performance accuracy has been reported to range between 65% to 80% with serious questions raised around the generalizability and applicability of such methods in the actual clinical setting [8] . Combining different modalities such as MRI, PET, and CSF biomarkers can be inconvenient and costly for patients as they have to go through several tests in order to get a reliable diagnosis and prognosis. Another important issue around ML/ AI algorithms is that they are mostly trained on data that is collected in a well-controlled research setting. This limits the performance accuracy and application of such trained algorithms on blind samples coming from a variety of external sources, representing the real-world situation."}, {"section_title": "BrainSee, Darmiyan's novel technology", "text": "Our team at Darmiyan, Inc. has developed a novel, ML-powered, proprietary technology, BrainSee, [13] that has incorporated the following modules in a fully automated, integrated, and controlled environment:\n1.

The major roadblock in finding a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is the lack of an accurate, reliable, and objective method for early detection of the disease and for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease even when detected. By the time people are clinically diagnosed today, it is too late to intervene effectively as the damage to the brain tissue has progressed too far to be reversed. All disease-modifying clinical trials have failed to date. Each trial costs the pharmaceutical industry on average $5.7 Billion for drug development and testing [14] . A doctor's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease determines the course of a patient's clinical management and potential decision for enrollment in a clinical trial. Patients and their families discuss care and life planning based on the diagnostic information provided to them by the clinician. When the clinician is uncertain, patients and their families remain uncertain and worried [1, 2, 15] . Even the most widely accepted guidelines in the medical community leave the clinician with great uncertainty in their subjective assessment of MCI and AD [16] .\nClinical uncertainty is not limited to differentiating MCI from dementia diagnosis [15] [16] [17] . Even with a fairly certain clinical diagnosis of MCI, predicting the future course (prognosis) of the underlying abnormality in terms of progression, stability, or reversal, remains uncertain [15] . In medical practice, such prognostic uncertainty creates additional worries and anxieties in the patient and their families. It also makes it difficult for the clinician to decide confidently on an appropriate treatment. In clinical trials, prognostic uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to recruit the appropriate patients to power the study properly and demonstrate statistically significant difference between the treatment arm and placebo arm.\nOur novel solution, BrainSee, provides objective, accurate and non-invasive early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease for clinics and clinical trials. It removes subjectivity and uncertainty from clinical assessments of MCI and AD and enables correct patient selection in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (Figure 4 ). BrainSee is a fully automated, cloud-based platform, which operates in a fully integrated and validated environment, a critical feature lacking in most other medical image processing technologies. It performs with high accuracy (~90%) and is designed for robust, high-throughput analysis of images from different sources. It operates in diagnosis and prognosis modes:\nIn diagnosis mode, BrainSee provides an accurate diagnosis of the cognitive state at the time of clinical evaluation. It takes age, sex, years of education and standard cognitive test scores (MMSE & CDR) as input data and generates a probability score for each cognitive state (CN, MCI, and AD), as well as a diagnostic decision. These output scores have the following applications:\n1. For clinical use: As novel biomarkers for monitoring the brain health status, MCI severity and AD diagnosis certainty 2. For clinical trials: AD probability score can be used as a novel \"disease modification\" biomarker for therapeutic effect monitoring 3. For research use: To provide diagnostic labeling consistency and reliability across different sites and multiple data sources\nIn prognosis mode, BrainSee provides accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease years before confirmation is possible in clinics. It takes the same input data as the diagnosis mode, plus the addition of standard brain MRI, which is already a standard, well-established imaging modality and integrated in the clinical workflow around the world. BrainSee prognosis generates the probability score for progression to dementia versus stable cognitive impairment. This output score has the following applications:\n1. For clinical use: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease at the MCI stage 2. For clinical trials: A novel \"disease modification\" biomarker for therapeutic effect monitoring 3. For research use: Standard framework to test various other research hypotheses With these unique, novel features, BrainSee can solve the limitations in clinical practice and clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease.
