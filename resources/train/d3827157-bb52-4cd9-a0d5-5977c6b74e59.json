[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: to describe gender differences in levels of, and longitudinal changes in, habitual physical activity among older people. Design: longitudinal study. Participants: sub-groups of survivors (with sample sizes dependent on the availability of complete datasets, ranging from 303-344) assessed on three occasions : 1985, 1989 and 1993 in Nottingham, UK. All were 65 years and over in 1985. Methods: descriptive presentation (median and range values) of quantitative longitudinal data by gender across five activity categories assessed in a recall-based questionnaire. Main outcome measures: participation in walking, shopping, indoor, outdoor and leisure activities. Results: while levels of indoor and outdoor activities were marked by decline for both sexes, gender differentials were maintained over the 8 years of the study, with women showing higher levels of activity participation indoors and men showing higher levels of activity participation outdoors. In levels of walking/shopping activity, however, there was evidence of gender differentials reducing over time. Conclusions: within these cohorts of older people traditional gender roles continue to exert a strong influence on levels and types of habitual physical activity well into later life. In some areas of activity, however, temporal changes provide some evidence of gender convergence consistent with late-life transitions in marital status and dependency."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Interest in the questionnaire assessment of physical activity in later life has increased steadily in recent years, with attention focusing on the contribution of physical activity to physical health [1] , mortality [2] and psychological health [3, 4] . While it is clear from these reports that questionnaire-assessed activity levels can provide an important health index, it is also clear that gender differences in reported activity levels introduce complex issues of interpretation.\nIn earlier reports from the Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing (NLSAA), for example, gender was found to influence not only the overall level of habitual activity, but also its structure and the strength of relationships between activity and psychological wellbeing [5] [6] [7] [8] . At least part of the explanation for these findings may lie in the expression of genderspecific roles, and the differential 'meaning' of genderspecific physical activities. Housework, for example, may equate with a given physiological energy cost across sexes, but it may also support important components of identity and self-esteem among women but not among men. A similar situation may apply to outdoor activities for men.\nFactor analytic studies of NLSAA data from 1985 and 1989 [6, 8] provided some evidence of differential meanings' in the activity factor loadings for men and women. Levels of indoor activity, for example, correlated with leisure activities among men, but appeared unrelated to leisure activities among women. The observation of gender-specific roles in questionnaire assessed physical activity patterns is not unique to the NLSAA. Similar gender influences have been reported in other studies [9, 10] where divisions of domestic labour typical of younger people (e.g. housework performed predominantly by women; outdoor house maintenance performed predominantly by men) persist into older age. Longitudinal analyses of activity participation, though rare, also show clear gender differentials in trajectories. Results from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Gender and longitudinal changes in physical activities [11] , for example, clearly show age-related declines in leisure participation, particularly amongst women.\nHowever, while many studies have reported gender differences in levels of habitual activity, relatively few have commented on the meanings of individual activities for men and women. In order to identify those areas of habitual physical activity where a greater appreciation of 'meanings' would enhance interpretation and inference, this paper describes gender differences (and the longitudinal stability of such differences) in customary physical activity levels across three survey waves of the NLSAA: 1985, 1989 and 1993."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The full methodology for the NLSAA is described elsewhere [12] . Briefly, the NLSAA is an 8-year survey of activity, health and well-being conducted within a representative sample of people originally aged 65 and over. At sampling, those aged 75 years or older were intentionally over-represented in order to admit sufficient numbers for subsequent longitudinal analyses. Accordingly, while the ratio of 'old' (65-74 years) to 'very old' (75+ years) people in the 1985 British population was approximately 1.62:1, a baseline ratio of 1:1 was the target for this study (see [12] ). In the present analyses, where these two age groupings are considered separately, they are referred to as 'older' and 'younger' respectively.\nThe baseline survey for the NLSAA was conducted between May and September 1985 (Tl: baseline), during which time 1042 people, randomly sampled from general practitioners' lists, were interviewed in their own homes (a response rate of 80%). Follow-up surveys were conducted at four yearly intervals in 1989 (T2) and 1993 (T3), with re-interview rates of 88% (n = 690) and 73% (n -410) respectively obtained among survivors."}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire assessment", "text": "At each survey wave, levels of customary physical activity likely to promote muscle strength, joint flexibility or stamina were assessed using detailed activity inventories administered by trained interviewers. Operational criteria used for the selection of activities are reported elsewhere [12] . Activities were divided into five mutually exclusive functional categories: outdoor productive activities (e.g. gardening, house and car maintenance); indoor productive activities (e.g. housework, decorating, indoor maintenance); walking (purposeful walking outside the house or garden); shopping (i.e. continuous ambulatory behaviour associated with shopping); and leisure activities (e.g. cycling, swimming-walking was included as a leisure activity only if it was described as such). Where appropriate, these activities were further divided into heavy, moderate and light activities, according to the presumed demands of a given task."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "The current analyses examine changes in customary physical activity in sub-samples of survivors (i.e. those interviewed at all three survey waves, and for whom full activity datasets were available for any given activity category). These sub-samples were derived from 410 respondents interviewed at T3, and ranged in size from 303 to 344. Analyses focused on changes in walking and shopping activities (quantified as min per typical day) and indoor, outdoor and leisure activities (quantified as hours per week). Distributions were clearly skewed for each of these activity categories [see 13], with high levels of non-participation within each. Few respondents, however, reported non-participation across all categories. In order to minimize the number of 0 scores, therefore, shopping and walking, and leisure and outdoor productive activities were combined. For the three resulting activity categories (shopping/walking; outdoor/leisure; indoor) group values were expressed as medians and absolute ranges.\nFrom earlier analyses of the baseline data [7] two particular activities showed pronounced gender differences in levels of participation: housework (highest among women) and gardening (highest among men). In a final analysis, gender differentials in 8-year changes in the intensity of participation (from light, through moderate to heavy) was assessed in these activities.\nStatistical comparisons between 1985 (Tl), 1989 (T2) and 1993 (T3) values were made using Friedman's analysis of variance. All data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (Release 6.0) [14] . Table 1 shows the median levels of participation in the three activity categories for the sub-groups at Tl (1985) . Men participated more than women in outdoor/leisure activities. For shopping/walking activity the picture is more complex. Younger men participated most (median = 60 min/day), with younger women also participating highly (median = 51 min/ day). Older women participated least (median = 19 min/day). Figure 1 shows the changes for shopping/walking activity for older and younger men and older and younger women. For all groups shopping/walking activity did not decline between 1985 and 1989. Between 1989 and 1993 participation in shopping/ walking activity declined, although it is interesting to note that levels of this activity remain relatively high (median = 20 min/day). The only exception is for older women, whose median participation fell to 0 in 1993-Friedman two-way Anovas show non-significant Table 2 shows the median participation in gardening and housework activities. In both cases a downward shift from heavy to moderate and light gardening and housework respectively is demonstrated. For gardening, the trend is from heavy to light between 1985 and 1993 for younger men and women. Older women's I! median participation falls to 0 for all gardening in 1993-Older men's participation in gardening is mainly moderate in 1993. The trend for median participation in housework for younger men and both groups of women is from heavy to both moderate and light. Curiously, older men continue to participate in heavy housework at T3."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Clearly, the samples examined here are elite and, to an unknown extent, unrepresentative of sub-groups of the general elderly population. In addition, missing data, due mainly to cognitive impairment (n = 27) and being housebound (n = 52), further reduced the activity information available from the 410 respondents interviewed in 1993-The relatively small cellsizes for the older (75+ group in 1985) also suggests caution in interpretation. Nevertheless, given the Gender and longitudinal changes in physical activities demographic representativeness of the Tl (1985) sample (see [12] ), and given also that the present data accord, in many ways, with previously reported observations, it is likely that the gender patterns described here reflect a more generalized underlying dynamic.\nOver the 8 years of the study, gender differences are most clearly present for indoor and outdoor/leisure activities, consistent with traditional gender roles [9] . High levels of participation were found among women for indoor productive activity (mainly housework), while moderately high levels of participation in outdoor/leisure activities (principally gardening, house and car maintenance) are found for men. Large decreases in participation for younger men in outdoor/ leisure activities contrast with the smaller decreases in participation for women. These decreases are significant for all groups except the older men. Similarly, large decreases in indoor productive activity for women contrast with much smaller decreases in these activities for men.\nThe absence of clear and pronounced gender differences in shopping/walking activity is particularly interesting, and may reflect a tendency towards gender convergence in these activities as suggested recently in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [15] . In the present data such convergence may be influenced by the increase in shopping as a leisure activity for both men and women [16] , and the possibility that shopping may be continuing to lose its association with 'women's work', particularly with the growth of 'do-it-yourself' shopping. A third possibility is that the continued use of out-of-town shopping centres, combined with relatively low levels of driving licence ownership among elderly women in Britain [17] may increasingly include men in food and other shopping activities. Moderate   150  160  120  250  120  98  308  200  135  265  125  105   Light   120  180  100  230  90  118  210  270  180  240  270  210 Nevertheless, despite the evidence both here, and elsewhere [15] of the emergence of greater flexibility in gender roles in later life, the persistence of gender divisions in some customary physical activities is striking. These gender-divided activities show greatest declines where participation was highest. Major sources of change might plausibly include declining health, bereavement and widowhood, and adaptive moves into specialized, but less spacious accommodation. On the other hand the data clearly show that older people are still actively participating in a wide variety of activities, some of which remain strongly genderrelated.\nFinally, the data clearly show that over time the intensity of participation in both indoor and outdoor/ leisure activities shifts from heavier, through moderate to lighter participation for both men and women. For gardening, the shift is in general from heavy to light participation for women, and from heavy to moderate or light for men. Similarly for housework, the trend is from heavy to light participation, with the exception of older men. It appears that, while men and women are still participating in housework and gardening, they are doing much less heavy work. Again, these changes may be multifactorial in origin, with reduced physical ability, the provision of professional helpers, improved material wellbeing, and adaptive migration into smaller or gardenless properties all playing a part.\nTo conclude, gender divisions in customary physical activity in later life appear to remain stable for most activities, with the exception of shopping/walking activities. Women's participation in indoor productive activity remains high, despite declining markedly. Similarly for men, outdoor/leisure activities remains quite high, again despite marked declines. Shopping/ walking activity is marked by its lack of a clear gender division."}]
