Also, scores on a farm safety quiz were found to be higher (less knowledge) among farmers who reported more injuries. Items in the safety quiz frequently missed by farmers included falls as a source of injury (29.2%), children being commonly injured on farms (19%), the cause of farmers'lung disease (46.9%), and animals as a cause of injury on farms (12.9%)."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T his is the second part of a two-part series exploring older farmers' work habits, health status, and agriculture-related injuries in a random sample of Illinois farmers aged 55 and older.

Further, during the past few years, farming has been consistently ranked by the National Institute for Occupa- tional Safety and Health (NIOSH; 2004 as one of the most dangerous U.S. occupations along with mining, construction, and logging. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005) , fatalities among agricultural workers increased 23% between 2004 and 2005. Despite these impressive statistics, current estimates may be incorrect because injuries on family farms are often underreported and untreated by professional caregivers (Murphy, 1992; Wright, 1993) . Accurate incidence of agricultural accidents and injuries is further complicated by the way other industries (e.g., mining) carefully monitor and record employee injuries; farming is not monitored in this way."}, {"section_title": "ABOUT THE AUTHORS", "text": "Farmers are generally self-insured with health insurance policies that require large deductibles. Consequently, they seek treatment from health care professionals only if they are having difficulty completing job tasks. This hesitance to pursue care further complicates accurate documentation of injuries and illnesses.\nAlthough the percentage of older farmers in the overall agricultural work force is not known, it is significant that other occupational groups do not typically engage workers older than 65 years in physically strenuous jobs with long hours. Furthermore, the portrait of the American farm has transitioned radically since the mid-1950s. Beginning with the Census of Agriculture in 1992, the only age category that increased significantly during that period was farmers aged 70 years and older (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1997) . The National Safety Council (NSC; 1998) found that workers aged 55 years and older account for nearly half of all farming deaths. In Illinois"}, {"section_title": "Applying Research to Practice", "text": "Occupational health nurses can apply the Haddon model (Haddon, 1980) when working with farmers. Host characteristics (e.g., age, health status, stress, and workload) should be considered when assessing risk of occupational injury. Occupational health nurses can reduce risk of accidents by treating disease and aiding farmers in managing their stress level and altering their workload. Other host factors, such as work duties, might be adjusted for older farmers to reduce risk of injury. For example, occupational health nurses might counsel older farmers taking medications for hypertension to avoid climbing silos because of the risk of syncope or blood pressure fluctuations, thereby reducing the risk of falling. Agent factors might also be modifiable. For example, using rollover protection structures and seatbelts with tractors can significantly reduce the risk of serious injury or death; ergonomic modifications might also be implemented. Environmental factors, including time of the year, temperature, and noise, should be considered as part of a safety assessment for older farmers. Occupational health nurses offering health risk appraisals should consider adding unique farming risks to these assessments.\nin 1999, farmers aged 55 years and older accounted for 57% of farming deaths; of those deaths, 85% of farmers were aged 65 years and older (University of Illinois, Urbana, 2001). Of 28 farming deaths in 2005, 16 farmers (57%) were also aged 65 years and older (University of Illinois, Urbana, 2005) . These are sobering workplace statistics."}, {"section_title": "Scope of the Problem Related to Farm Injuries", "text": "In Illinois in 2005, 12 older farmers' deaths accounted for 43% of all Illinois farming deaths (University of Illinois, Urbana, 2005) . In the Illinois report, farmers aged 65 years and older accounted for the largest number of deaths, consistent with other reports (Myers & Hard, 1995; NSC, 1999; Voaklander, Hartling, Pickett, Dimich-Ward, & Brison, 1999) . These statistics show the predominance of fatalities among farmers aged 55 years and older. It is disturbing that many of these accidents are occurring in an age group that is typically associated with decreasing work requirements or retirement. Myers and Hard (1995) , in a study of 6,727 farmers who died between 1980 and 1989, reported that males aged 65 years and older had the higher death rate during farm work activities (60.5 deaths per 100,000 workers), compared to males aged 10 to 24 years (20.6 deaths per 100,000 workers). In Illinois, most farming fatalities dur-ing the past two decades (1986 to 2005) occurred among farmers aged 45 years and older (66%), and 34% occurred among farmers aged 65 years and older (University of Illinois, Urbana, 2005) .\nStress, particularly financial stress, has been determined to increase risk of injuries among farmers, including older farmers. Debt and financial stress were found to be contributors to farm injuries in a study of older Colorado farmers (Xiang, Stallones, & Chiu, 1999) . Economic conditions, weather, lack of resources, multiple tasks, workload, and farm hazards were found to be stressors in focus group studies of farmers (Kidd, Scharf, & Veazie, 1996) . Increased awareness of stress among farmers may lead to a safer environment (Scharf, Veazie, & Kidd, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Tractor Rollovers and Run Overs", "text": "Tractor rollovers and run overs are major contributors to death and morbidity on American farms (Murphy, 1992; Myers et al., 1998; NSC, 1998) . As reported by the NSC (1998), 37% of U.S. farming deaths were caused by tractor rollovers and run overs. The NSC reported the distribution of tractor-related deaths as 51% rollover, 26% run over, 4% power-take-off (i.e., a drive shaft that is run by a tractor to provide power for another piece of equipment), and 19% other causes. In the United States between 1985 and 1997, an estimated 4,858 tractor-related deaths occurred annually on farms.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 1995) projected that 40% of all farm injuries could be prevented by rollover protection structures (RapS) and seatbelts. Myers and Pana-Cryan (2000) analyzed the benefits of using RaPS and seatbelts when tractors could be retrofitted with these safety measures and, when retrofitting was not possible, replacing unsafe tractors. They estimated that up to 82% of fatal injuries could be prevented with these safety measures. Their study highlights the importance of safety knowledge and use of safety measures to reduce injuries and deaths related to tractors."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Model for Injury Prevention: Haddon Model", "text": "The Haddon model (Haddon, Suchman, & Klein, 1964) was used as the framework for this study. Haddon, an engineer, physician, and epidemiologist, developed this seminal model to scientifically evaluate injury as a disease. The premise of the model is that injury is not accidental; rather, injury is similar to disease. The model, described as environmental rather than behavioral, consists of an epidemiological component (host, agent, and environment) along with three time phases of injury: pre-event, event, and post-event. In each of these three phases, a host interacts with five forms of physical energy (mechanical, chemical, radiation, electrical, or thermal) , and an agent causes the host to interact with the environment. The agent can be either animate or inanimate. Rather than focusing on behavior, which can be difficult or impractical to change, this model provides a mechanism to alter the environment to prevent the injury from occurring (Sidebar; Waller, 1987) . Table 1 presents a schematic that applies the Haddon model to an older farmer involved in a fatal rollover accident. An older farmer is responsible for mowing deep ditches along his roadway. The pre-event is the host (older farmer) mowing. The injury involves the farmer's interactions with the agent (tractor without RaPS) and the energy dispersal from the rollover. The post-event is the older farmer's death from crushing injuries as a result of the rollover. Finally, in the context of the Haddon model, the intervention, application of RaPS and seatbelts, is the prevention method. If the rollover still occurred, RaPS and seatbelts would significantly alter the post-event injury."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sampling", "text": "A random sample of 40 I farmers aged 55 to 70 years was provided by the Illinois Farm Bureau (lFB).\nThe response rate was 43% (n = 173).

Six additional respondents returned the survey but refused to participate, leaving 154 farmers. Of these, 67 were not actively working on a farm at the time the survey was completed.

The questionnaire included specific items about the number of injuries during the past 12 months, number of times injured specifically while doing farm work, trips to the hospital due to injuries, visits to a primary caregiver due to injuries, and days of work missed due to a farm work injury.

The mean number of injuries reported by each respondent was 0.58 (SD =1.54 injuries). Most injuries occurred during farm maintenance activities (n =30) and animal handling (n =10).\nFrequency of injury was variable. Although 76.7% of farmers reported no injuries, 23.3% reported one or more injuries (Table 3) . Nine farmers reported one injury, two farmers reported two injuries, two farmers reported three injuries, and two farmers reported four injuries. One farmer reported as many as 10 injuries in I year. This farmer's report of 10 injuries was not excluded from the study analysis as an outlier because this particular farmer was in the age range (older than 65 years) most at risk for farm fatality.\nAlthough farmers did not describe all injuries, the types of injuries described included back injury from lifting equipment, being kicked by dairy cows, cuts to hands when working with machinery, tom right arm muscle, being pinched, scratched, and bruised, and bilateral shoulder fractures. One farmer reported that he had not been injured during the past 12 months, but he had lost his right leg in a com picker in the fall of 1958.

A Pearson product moment correlation was computed showing no significant correlation between age and total injuries.\nType of Farm Activity. Simple frequencies revealed that 42% of the farmers had animal handling responsibilities. Ten of these farmers reported injuries as a result of animal handling. An independent sample t test was used to determine the relationship between farmers with animal handling responsibilities and injuries, revealing no significant differences in injury rate for these farmers (p > .05). Other studies have shown that certain types of farm activities, such as those related to caring for dairy cows or cattle, have an increased risk of injury (Nordstrom et aI., 1995; Xiang et aI., 1999) . Although no significant relationship was found between farm activities and injury, this may have been due to the small sample size.\nHours Worked per Week.

An independent No. of 55 to 59 60 to 64~65 Injuries (n = 34) (n =27) (n =25) Total sample 1 test was computed with the dependent variable, number of injuries reported, and the grouping variable, number of hours worked (less than or greater than 40 hours per week).

The relationship between financial stress and injury was significant (p = .027) among farmers aged 55 to 59 years, when farmers were stratified into three groups (aged 55 to 59 years, 60 to 64 years, and 65 years and older). Farmers aged 55 to 59 years reported more stress and more injuries than farmers in the other age groups."}, {"section_title": "Effect of Injury Prevention Training and Knowledge", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "About Injuries on Injury Rate", "text": "Only 18.5% of the respondents reported attending at least one safety training session during the past 5 years. Of those attending training sessions, most attended only one session. One respondent attended 18 training sessions and was excluded from data analysis as an outlier. A pattern of attendance at safety trainings by age is displayed in Table 4 . A correlation was computed with safety classes and age and revealed marginally significant results [R (78) = .213, p = .058]. Although this approached significance, the study method limited interpretation of a temporal relationship between safety classes and age because farmers may have experienced an injury and subsequently attended safety classes.\nThe 10 items on the knowledge survey were scored as correct or incorrect. Each farmer responding to the questions was given a total correct score out of the possible 10 points. The scores ranged from 2 to 10, with most respondents (77.1%) scoring at least 7 correct (M = 7.56, SD =2.032).\nFarm safety knowledge was evaluated in two ways: using the mean score of 7 as a cutoff between high and low knowledge; and using the SD of 2.03 with groupings of I to 5 correct, 6 to 9 correct, and 10 correct. First, given the mean score was 7.59 and the median was 7.5, a clear cutoff in score frequency at 7 was made. Therefore, a score of 7 was used as the breakpoint for the division of scores. Respondents scoring 7 and above were defined as having a high degree of knowledge. Those scoring below 7 were defined as having a low degree of knowledge. Given this, an independent sample 1 test was used with a high or low knowledge score, total numbers of injuries reported, and total number of farm injuries reported. For this sample, farmers with a high degree of knowledge had a higher injury rate than those with a lower level of knowledge. It may be that sustaining injuries made farmers more aware of safety hazards or that farmers with more safety training were able to recognize injuries. Additionally, four items in the survey were more frequently missed by respondents: falls as a source of injury (29.2%), children being commonly injured on farms (19%), the cause of farmers' lung disease (46.9%), and animals causing injury on farms (12.9%)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Although this study had a small number of respondents, these older Illinois farmers experienced several injuries on the farm. However, not all farmers identified injuries the same way, evidenced by farmers who responded on the survey that daily injuries were \"not really injuries.\" This variance implies that farmers may not define injuries in the same way as others (i.e., health care providers or researchers). This variance suggests that these data may not identify actual numbers of farm injuries. Other researchers have found similar results (Murphy, 1992; Wright, 1993) , but methodological limitations and small sample size in the current study restrict injury definition interpretation and application of results. Further study may be warranted to assess how farmers define \"farm injury.\" Further, a relationship was found, despite the small sample, between financial stress and injury experience among farmers aged 55 to 59 years. This is the median age range for injuries on the farm (NSC, 1999) and the group reporting the most injuries in this study (n = 19). Finally, the farm safety knowledge survey revealed that despite the emphasis in the media on the risk of falls, the risk and etiology of farmers' lung disease, the risk of the farm environment to children, and the risk of animals causing injury, many farmers were unable to correctly identify these factors as risks in their work."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH NURSES", "text": "This study has several implications for occupational health nurses who interact with farmers. Farmers are clearly at risk of injury and death as they complete their work tasks. This risk increases for farmers who hold another job outside of farm work for insurance benefits and additional income. These individuals work long hours and likely experience stress; stress in this sample was accompanied by a personal history of injury. These findings imply that occupational health nurses should inquire not only about farmers' stress levels, but also about how they handle stress and feel stress affects farm work. Occupational health nurses should assist farmers in managing stress. Further, in taking an injury history, occupational health nurses should consider that farmers may not define or describe an injury in the same way as other occupational groups.\nOccupational health nurses can use the Haddon model to identify host characteristics, such as stress, when assessing older farmers for risk of injury. Occupational health nurses may also increase host knowledge of farm activities through education and advisement to heighten awareness of the risk of falls and injury from farm animals and equipment.\nFinally, occupational health nurses can provide education about documented risks associated with farming (e.g., mechanical and animal vectors in injury, environmental risks, dust and other factors in farmers' lung disease, and the risks to children in the farm environment). These risks should be included in health risk appraisals in the workplace. Further research investigating the concept of farm injury may facilitate consistent definitions and measurement in this older occupational group."}]
