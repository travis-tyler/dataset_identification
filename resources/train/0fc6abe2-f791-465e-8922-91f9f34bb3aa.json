[{"section_title": "", "text": "MRI can be used to predict development of age-related cognitive disorders Driscoll et al., 2009; Fischl et al., 2002) , and elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have reduced volume or thickness of the cerebral cortex and a range of subcortical structures (de Leon et al., 2006; Fennema-Notestine et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2008) . MR findings also show consistent cortical and subcortical atrophy in healthy elderly Raz et al., 2005; Resnick, Pham, Kraut, Zonderman, & Davatzikos, 2003) . A possible problem in all studies of healthy aging is that even well-screened samples of healthy persons may include participants with preclinical cognitive disorders. overcame this problem by using cognitive follow-up data obtained 6 years after MR scanning. In the group of cognitively stable elderly, age did not correlate with cortical or hippocampal volume. The authors suggest that amount of cortical gray matter atrophy in healthy aging may be overestimated in previous studies, and that gray matter atrophy in hippocampus, parahippocampal, and frontal brain areas to a lesser extent is associated with the aging process.\nWe find this conclusion surprising. Cross-sectional studies have shown that changes in cortical thickness and volume follow a mainly linear trajectory throughout the adult life span (Allen, Bruss, Brown, & Damasio, 2005; Walhovd et al., 2009 ). If preclinical age-related cognitive disorders are causing a substantial part of the age correlations, we would expect a reduction of brain volumes in the latter part of the life span only. We believe that the study by is well conducted and important, but we think that more evidence is needed to support their conclusion. First, the sample was small, with 28 and 30 participants in two groups. Second, as acknowledged by the authors, only cross-sectional data were presented.\nIn the present report, we present two sets of analyses. First, we reanalyzed data from several previously published cross-sectional MR studies of aging (Espeseth et al., 2006; Fotenos, Snyder, Girton, Morris, & Buckner, 2005; Raz et al., 2005; Walhovd et al., 2005 Walhovd et al., , 2009 Westlye et al., 2009) , yielding a total sample of 1,037. As the prevalence of age-related cognitive disorders increases with higher age, the proportion of preclinical cognitive disorders will likely increase with the age of the sample if the cognitive screening has not been sufficiently thorough, as implied by . Thus, by restricting the upper limit of the age span, we expected less contamination by preclinical cognitive disorders. If Burgmans, van Boxtel, Vuurman, et al. are correct in their conclusion, one should find that the correlations between age and brain structure will decrease and eventually vanish as the upper limit of the age span is lowered.\nSecond, we have recently shown substantial longitudinal cortical reductions over only 1 year in healthy elderly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample . The ADNI database presently contains extensive cognitive follow-up data for 2 years. Here, we reanalyzed 1-year longitudinal MR data from normal controls from ADNI, excluding all participants showing any signs of cognitive decline 2 years after the first scanning."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional Analysis", "text": "Sample.

All scans were obtained from 1.5 T magnets from two different manufacturers (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; General Electric [GE], Milwaukee, WI) and from five different models (Siemens Avanto, Symphony, Sonata, Vision; GE Signa).

The procedure is described in detail elsewhere (Dale, Fischl, & Sereno, 1999; Dale & Sereno, 1993) and in online supplemental material 3."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Analysis", "text": "Sample. The longitudinal raw data were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI; Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco; for more information, see http://www.adniinfo.org). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations. ADNI eligibility criteria are described at http://www.adni-info.org/index.php?option \u03ed com_content&task \u03ed view&id \u03ed 9&Itemid \u03ed 43. Briefly, participants were 55-90 years of age, had an informant able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning, and spoke either English or Spanish. All participants were willing and able to undergo test procedures, including neuroimaging, and agreed to longitudinal follow-up. Users of specific psychoactive medications were excluded. General inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows for normal subjects: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; Morris, 1993) of zero, nondepressed, non-MCI, and nondemented. In addition, CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) was calculated as a measure of clinical functioning (does not need to be zero). The subject pool was further restricted to those subjects for whom adequate processed and quality checked MR data were available by February 2009. One hundred eighteen healthy elderly had been tested at Visits 1 (baseline), 3 (1 year), and 5 (2 years), and had MR of sufficient quality. MR change was measured from Visit 1 to Visit 3 (1-year change). To be included in the analyses, CDR-SD and MMSE needed to remain identical or improve over 2 years. In addition, raw scores on each of the following seven neuropsychological tests had to remain at 90% of initial score or higher: Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) learning (hits -false alarms), AVLT 30min delayed recall (hits -false alarms; Rey, 1941) , digit span (sum of forward and backward), clock copying (Goodglass & Kaplan, 1983) , digit symbol substitution test (Wechsler, 1981) , and logical memory test immediate recall and logical memory test delayed recall (Wechsler, 1987) . This means, for instance, that a participant who scored 10 points on the AVLT delayed recall test at baseline and 8 points after 2 years would be excluded, whereas a participant who scored 9 points after 2 years could be included. After applying these very stringent exclusion criteria, 21 participants were included in the longitudinal analyses (mean age at baseline \u03ed 76.8 years, range \u03ed 63.0 -90.2 years; 6 women and 15 men).\nMR acquisition and analysis. All scans used for the present analyses were from 1.5 T scanners. Data were collected across a variety of scanners with protocols individualized for each scanner, as defined at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/ index.shtml. Raw DICOM MRI scans (including two T1-weighted volumes per case) were downloaded from the public ADNI site (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/index.shtml) and processed as described elsewhere . A recently developed procedure for measuring longitudinal change was used ) based on nonlinear registration of images and linear elasticity (see online supplemental material 3). The method enables very precise registration involving large or subtle deformations, even at small spatial scales with low boundary contrast. The procedure produces an estimate of the percentage cortical volume loss at each vertex and within each region of interest (ROI). The method has been validated in model studies of complex spherical-shell geometries with low contrast and noise, where a prescribed volume change is numerically estimated to accuracies of within 0.5% . It is beyond the scope of the present article to compare the sensitivity of this method with the manual tracings used by ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "Intracellular volume was regressed out from all volume measures before they were entered into statistical analyses. In the cross-sectional data, age was correlated with each of the ROIs in the age ranges 18 -95, 18 -80, 18 -70, and 18 -60 years, and the changes in the Pearson correlation coefficient were inspected. Hippocampal volume was not included as an ROI in the crosssectional analyses because this structure is known to follow a highly nonlinear trajectory over the adult life span, and the present correlation approach would then be inappropriate. For the rest of the ROIs, degree of nonlinearity was tested by multiple regressions with brain volume as dependent and age and square of age as simultaneous predictors. One-sample t tests were used for the longitudinal data to test whether significant atrophy was seen over 1 year (from Visit 1 to Visit 3)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional Results", "text": "Cross-sectional age correlations are presented in Table 1 .

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of are interesting because they indicate that MR can be used to identify differences between groups with no versus very mild or incipient cognitive disorders. This confirms the potential value of MR morphometry in detecting and monitoring age-related cognitive conditions. However, we do not find adequate support for the authors' conclusion that substantial cortical gray matter changes may not be associated with the healthy aging process, and that age-related atrophy thus typically has been overestimated in previous studies, which generally lack follow-up data on cognitive function. We believe that two lines of evidence speak against this interpretation.\nFirst, because cognitive disorders are increasingly common with older age, it is reasonable to assume that the prevalence of incipient cognitive problems will be higher among participants in their 80s than participants in their 70s. Still, previous research has tended to report that cortical gray matter atrophy follows a largely linear pattern during the adult life span (Allen et al., 2005; Walhovd et al., 2009 ). This would be a surprising finding if preclinical cognitive disorders explained a substantial proportion of the atrophy among the elderly. In the present report, we analyzed data from more than 1,000 participants, drawn from previously published cross-sectional studies of healthy aging (Espeseth et al., 2006; Fotenos et al., 2005; Raz et al., 2005; Walhovd et al., 2009; Westlye et al., 2009) . For all cortical ROIs except the parahippocampal gyrus, the age correlations remained relatively stable when the upper age limit was systematically lowered. For all ROIs except one, the relationships between age and volume were best described as linear or as following a Ushaped curve. We believe this indicates that the effects were not caused by inclusion of participants with preclinical cognitive disorders.\nThe samples included in the analyses were all well screened at baseline, but no follow-up cognitive data had been used to exclude possible participants with declining cognitive functions. The samples are representative of MR studies of healthy aging, indicating that the previously reported age differences in brain morphometry to a lesser degree can be attributed to incipient cognitive disorders. If the screening procedures in these samples had been insufficient to exclude preclinical conditions, the proportion of participants with declining cognitive function would obviously be too low to affect the age relationships notably. One possible exception from this pattern was parahippocampal cortex, where the correlation coefficients steadily were reduced as the sample became younger. The medial temporal lobe is often found to be vulnerable to early manifestations of MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD; Dickerson et al., 2008; Du et al., 2007) , even though entorhinal cortex is often found to be affected earlier in the disease than parahippocampal cortex. As AD is the most common cause of cognitive decline among the elderly, it is possible that an increasing fraction of the participants included may have incipient AD among the oldest participants, and that this affected the age correlation seen here. Fotenos, Mintun, Snyder, Morris, and Buckner (2008) showed that nondemented elderly with higher socioeconomic status had smaller brain volumes and higher rates of longitudinal brain atrophy than elderly with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, participants with higher socioeconomic status and normal neuropsychological functioning may still have incipient AD, but this is impossible to detect without follow-up data. Although it is highly speculative, this may contribute to the observed age differences in parahippocampal cortex. To allow detection of age effects in parahippocampal cortex in healthy elderly without incipient cognitive disorders, it may be necessary to employ a more sensitive design than the usual cross-sectional studies, that is, longitudinal investigations.\nSecond, reported cross-sectional results, implying that the findings pertain to age-related differences, not atrophy per se. As the authors acknowledge, longitudinal data are needed to confirm their conclusions. To address this issue, we analyzed longitudinal data from the ADNI. For these data sets, cognitive follow-up data were available for 2 years only, not 6 years after scanning as in Burgmans et al. Still, we applied very strict exclusion criteria, ensuring no decline in CDR-SB or MMSE scores, and no more than 10% decline on any of seven other neuropsychological tests over 2 years. This led to inclusion of less than 18% of the initial sample of participants classified as normal elderly at baseline. Rates of atrophy were calculated over only 1 year, and cognitive data were available for 1 year after the last scan. Thus, even though it would be beneficial to have cognitive follow-up data for longer time periods, we believe it is very unlikely that any of these 21 participants had incipient cognitive disorders. Still, in all the ROIs tested, significant atrophy over 1 year was found, on the order of 0.31% to 0.98%. Both hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes declined significantly. Thus, even in a group of superstable elderly, significant longitudinal atrophy was observed over as short a time interval as 1 year. The magnitude of atrophy may seem small, but over a decade, the median ROI would show more than 5.4% decline, and hippocampus would shrink about 10.8%. If such changes are happening throughout large parts of the adult life span, the percentage reduction will be substantial. Further studies are needed to better disentangle the implications of such atrophy for clinical neuroscience. In a recent study, we found that cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid and tau proteins, both of which are sensitive to AD, were related to brain atrophy also in healthy elderly (Fjell et al., in press ), but that the pattern of brain changes did not resemble that seen in AD . We need more knowledge about which factors mediate brain atrophy in healthy elderly and what consequences the changes may have for cognitive function. An interesting hypothesis is also that high-functioning persons may show less age-related brain decline because cognitive activity may increase cortical thickness (Draganski et al., 2006) . Experimental manipulations are needed to address this issue.\nIn conclusion, we believe that evidence from both cross-sectional and longitudinal data indicates that reduction in brain volumes is a part of the normal aging process, and not necessarily related to pathological processes underlying cognitive decline. The differences between the present results and findings of may be explained by limited power due to small sample size in combination with a crosssectional design. Longitudinal designs have much higher sensitivity than cross-sectional designs. Combined with small sample size, the study may not have had sufficient statistical power to detect changes in healthy aging, but only age-related differences associated with pathology or rapid cognitive decline. Much more power and longitudinal data are needed to \"prove the null hypothesis\" that there are no age-related brain changes in healthy aging."}]
