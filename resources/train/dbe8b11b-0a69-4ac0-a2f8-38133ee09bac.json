This may be particularly the case for rural individuals, who experience disproportionate health problems and outcomes relative to urban counterparts. 3, 4 To provide preliminary evidence toward this hypothesis, we conducted a novel qualitative analysis of rural women's health care access prior to PPACA implementation using focus group data and PPACA content.\ndoes not consider the experiences of those who may not regularly access regular health care for chronic health conditions or routine preventive care.\nResearch on rural health care access since PPACA implementation is limited, but preliminary studies suggest ongoing access challenges in both health care availability and eligibility in rural settings. Regarding availability, one PPACA mechanism is the establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which are groups of health care providers and health care agencies that voluntarily work together to provide coordinated care to Medicare patients-particularly those with chronic illness-for the purpose of improving quality of care (e.g., avoiding service duplication, preventing medical errors), reducing health care spending, and improving population health. 20, 21 The ACOs can contribute to availability by improving timely access to primary and specialty care via improved coordination of care; 22 however, early research suggests that rural clinics are less likely to be part of ACOs. 23 Regarding eligibility, post-PPACA implementation data indicate rural counties have 32% fewer insurance issuers and 20% fewer plans as compared with urban counties, and available insurance plan premiums for rural populations tend to be more expensive. 24 Such differences may underlie disparities in coverage, wherein residents of large metropolitan areas are more likely than residents of non-metropolitan and rural areas to be enrolled in the health insurance marketplaces created through the PPACA. 25, 26 However, additional research is needed to understand the impacts of the PPACA on rural health care access.\nThe current study addresses these issues via an analysis of constituent voices and policy. We first identify health care access issues described by women living in a rural community prior to PPACA implementation. Second, we report elements of the PPACA that would have addressed such barriers to assess the extent to which rural populations' experiences were represented in law. Finally, we discuss potential gaps in the PPACA that may contribute to persistent access to care barriers in rural populations. We hypothesized that the PPACA would be insufficient to address all of the barriers to accessing health care as perceived by the rural women in our study population."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data. The current study accessed two data sources: 1) transcripts from focus groups that were conducted with rural women in the southernmost seven counties of Illinois prior to PPACA implementation and 2) PPACA text.\nFocus group setting and data. This research describes the analysis of focus groups that were one component of a comprehensive community health assessment focused on women's health in the rural, southernmost seven (S7) counties of Illinois. In 2011, the estimated S7 population was 65,073 over approximately 2,000 square miles. 27 The estimated poverty rate across the S7 counties was 18.7% compared with 13.1% in Illinois overall. According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, in 2010, 81% of S7 residents reported having health care coverage of any type compared with 86% in Illinois overall. 28 Additionally, 18% of residents reported foregoing health care in the previous 12 months due to cost compared with 13% in Illinois. According to the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, which classify counties as metropolitan or non-metropolitan by degree of urbanization based on population size and proxim-ity to an urban area, six of the S7 counties were considered nonmetropolitan. 29 The University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board approved the research.\nFocus groups with rural, S7 women were conducted to help identify, understand, and prioritize community health needs from the perspectives of women. A full description of focus group recruitment and implementation is described elsewhere. 30 Briefly, in February and March 2011, researchers and community partners collaborated to conduct 14 focus groups (n = 110 participants) with community women from across the S7 counties (Table 1) . Participants were recruited using flyers in community locations, announcements in community and church newsletters, and newspaper advertisements, with the goal of recruiting a broad range of women with regard to age, race, community of residence, and socioeconomic status. Focus groups were held in community locations such as health centers and churches. Focus groups were conducted by trained facilitators who used an eight-question, semi-structured focus group guide to elicit perspectives on multiple topics. The questions pertaining to this analysis included \"What does health mean to you?\" \"What do you think are important characteristics or features of a healthy community?\" \"What do you think are the most significant health needs or health problems in your community?\" and \"Does everyone in your community have access to health care services that they need? If not, which groups do not have access and why?\"\nPPACA text. The certified full text of the PPACA was downloaded from the Internet. 1 The primary objective of accessing this document was for the current study, wherein (14.5) solutions from the PPACA would be compared with constituents' perspectives represented in the focus group data. Data analysis. Our data analysis approach relied on a method of content analysis in which the voices of research participants were integrated with policy analysis, with the aim of understanding the context in which policy change occurs and to understand policy implementation in consideration of pre-existing constituent needs. 31 To accomplish this goal, we adapted a previously developed codebook, 32 and used it to both code and analyze the focus groups and PPACA text. The codebook was developed by two researchers (LC, KZ) using inductive content analysis to identify and examine patterns and themes in the data. We next adapted our codebook using a largely deductive approach focused on the four health care access domains of availability, eligibility, amenability, and compatibility. 5, 33 For this analysis, our foci concerned identification of 1) issues that were specific to or highly prevalent within rural settings from the focus group data based on the health care access domains; and 2) solutions within PPACA text that could be used to resolve these issues. We used ATLAS.ti, version 7 qualitative data analysis software (Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to achieve this goal. First, two authors (KZ, LC) independently analyzed the focus group data to identify representative text pertaining to the four health care access domains. The researchers met multiple times to share notes, identify relevant emergent patterns, and discuss interpretations, including areas of disagreement, and to reach consensus. Specifically, they examined health care access and health care insurance access, the role of the environment (i.e., physical, economic), and demographic factors (i.e., age, marital status, socioeconomic status, gender). They concluded with a list of unmet health care access needs and contributing factors identified by rural participants. Second, two authors (KZ, EP) independently analyzed the PPACA document, guided by this list. Text was coded if information concerned a policy solution related to at least one topic on the list. These authors met regularly to review coding strategies, maintain inter-rater reliability, share notes, and discuss interpretations, including areas of disagreement, and to reach consensus. Once coding was complete, the author team as a whole met to discuss and synthesize emergent patterns across data sources."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Emergent themes largely focused on two health care access domains of availability and eligibility. Participants typically discussed amenability in conjunction with availability (i.e., expressing a willingness to use services if they were available). Thus, we do not describe amenability as a separate category. Compatibility was not a common theme in the focus group data. We describe the results of pre-PPACA health care access needs of rural participants according to these two domains, followed by the components of the PPACA that address these needs, and finally specific needs that may persist for rural populations in the era of PPACA implementation.\nAvailability in rural settings: \"We just don't have much like you have in the larger cities.\" Rural voices pre-PPACA. Similar to previous research cited above, major availability issues in rural settings were reported and largely discussed as an insufficient number of health care providers-particularly specialty providers-and a lack of health care systems that are reachable by individuals given their geographic proximity. Indeed, some respondents noted the need to travel significant distances, use mass transit, or even crossing state lines to obtain health care: The lack of nearby health care providers and the need to travel to health care appointments contributes to the associated costs of accessing care, such as the need for a vehicle and money to purchase gasoline:\nI think a lot of it's money. They don't have the money where they don't buy [their medications], or they don't have money to put gas in the car so they don't go to their tests . . . (Pope/Hardin County Group A)\n. . . that all works back to gas prices, if people can't come for their appointment . . . if they can't pay for gas to get to their appointments. (Massac County Group A) Others were concerned not only about availability to health care providers, but specifically their ability to access consistent, high-quality care across large geographic areas with small populations, as emphasized by these participants:\nI think a good healthy community would have a good support system . . . good local health care where you don't have to drive 30 miles to find someone that you trust. Or that, you know, is gonna be there next week. Or there's the same face when you walk in the door as it was the last time you went there, it's not somebody new every other time. (Pulaski County Group B)\nWell, it's a low, dispersed population . . . There's not enough people here to attract a specialist. They wouldn't be able to make enough money. . . . I wonder if they' d, like, be able to come once a month, or once a week or something like that, if that would do any good? (Pope/Hardin County Group C)\nOthers highlighted how geography not only disconnected patients from health care systems, but also resulted in a geographically separated and fragmented health care system, as exemplified by these remarks:\nWe need better emergency facilities . . . I was cut, and I had to wait a while before I could get an ambulance to take me to where I could get sewed up. (Alexander County Group C) Participant 1: There are not enough doctors in this rural area, you know. Participant 2: You're gonna be waiting . . . If your doctor says you need to go see this specialist, then I'm gonna warn you, it's gonna be six to eight weeks and up to six months depending on his list. (Johnson County Group A) PPACA solutions. The PPACA uses multiple mechanisms to address health care provider shortages and ensure high quality care providers in rural and medically underserved areas. First, to support existing health care systems and providers, temporary bonus payments were authorized for primary care providers and surgeons in medically underserved areas (Sec. 5501), and temporary adjustments were authorized for low-discharge hospitals in rural areas (Sec. 3125). Second, funding was allocated for state workforce development grants (Sec. 5102); loan programs for providers to work in medically underserved areas, including rural (e.g., 5203, 5205); and health care workforce training with the goal of increasing the number of health professionals who serve in rural areas (e.g., Sec. 10501). Finally, there are strategies that may increase inter-organizational coordination of care for rural populations, including ensuring exchange plans have adequate provider networks (Sec. 1311), and grant funding to support community-based collaborative care networks designed to provide coordinated care to low-income populations (Sec. 10333).\nPersistent issues. Little in the PPACA discusses expansion of consistent, high-quality, specialty care services in rural and medically underserved areas. Additionally, the PPACA does not discuss resources to enable the significant travel and transportation that is necessary to access health care in rural setting. Finally, while the PPACA supports programs to train a health care workforce for rural settings, retention of rural providers that are recruited to these areas is not discussed.\nEligibility in rural settings: \"Falling through the cracks.\" Rural voices pre-PPACA. Eligibility issues in rural settings largely manifested as a complex interplay of concentrated poverty and sparse, geographically dispersed resources. For example, many participants emphasized the lack of job opportunities with health care coverage. They further noted that resources are often allocated to larger, more populated areas of the state and are not available for un-and underinsured individuals in rural settings:\nThere are people that have . . . low-paying jobs that don't have any insurance . . . I know somebody that needs her gall bladder out . . . She's working all her job will allow. And her job is one that only allows you to work part time so that they won't have to pay any benefits . . . It's a sociologic problem as well as a medical problem, and I don't know how to solve it. I worry and I'm frustrated about it. And I have to wonder, why do they have to be insured to get health care? (Massac County Group B) . . . the state of Illinois does not stop in Carbondale . . . When you have monies, you know, coming in from the government or whatever, and it looks like it just stops at Carbondale . . . You got the rest of the state here, you know, come on down . . . Because there are people that are in need here. (Alexander County Group A) Such barriers to traditional strategies to obtain health care coverage resulted in considering non-traditional methods to obtain coverage through governmental assistance programs, as illustrated by these participants:\nAnd then to help my health, I need money for my health care. Because it seems to me, you can't-unless you have a child, you can't get help with your health care. You can't get a medical card. They want me to file disability. I don't want to file for disability. I want get better, and I want to work. We've got people in here that can't afford to buy . . . medicine, and also the food."}, {"section_title": "(Union County Group B)", "text": "Participants also acknowledged the persistent challenges that extant, often chronically under-resourced organizations may face, particularly if they have to rely on grant funding. The volatile nature of relying on government and grant funding to support health care services was viewed as problematic, as the services may go away when the budgets are cut or grants end. This is exemplified by participants who discussed the services at Rural Health, a local clinic that offers services to all regardless of ability to pay, followed by a mental health facility and the local health department: Well, funds were cut for like the health department, so people that were going there, where do they go now? (Pope/Hardin County Group C) Some participants also discussed the passage of the PPACA, including their lack of trust that health care access would improve in their communities as a result of the legislation.\nI was for single payer, Medicare for everyone . . . I see people every day that have terrible health problems-that have no resources and no way to get them. (Massac County Group B) It takes everything that you have to pay for health care. That's why I don't understand why they [opponents of the PPACA] fought against the government control of health care. Because most of the physicians and the insurance companies are getting the bulk of the money, and that's the reason why health care is going up so much. Because it's out of control, and somebody do need to control it. I wish they would control it. Not in a bad way, but in a good way for people . . . the majority of the people. Now, the rich people can afford it. They can get any kind of health care that they want to. And the ones that's in government, they can get that government health care. But what about us? (Alexander County Group A) PPACA solutions. There are a number of solutions within the PPACA to increase eligibility for individual U.S. citizens, including mandating coverage for all citizens and legal residents of the U.S. (Sec. 1501) ; requiring insurers to accept everyone (Sec. 1201); enabling the uninsured to obtain health insurance through state-based health insurance exchanges (Sec. 1311); and for those with incomes between 100-400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), offering health insurance on a sliding-fee scale based on income (Sec. 1401). Additionally, states have the option to expand Medicaid for those with incomes up to 133% (FPL) for children, pregnant women, and non-disabled adults both with and without dependent children. This expansion may ameliorate adverse consequences of using non-traditional methods to obtain such coverage. The PPACA further allows states to create a basic health plan for low-income, uninsured individuals at 133-200% FPL who do not qualify for Medicaid (Sec. 1331).\nThe PPACA also provides several potential policy solutions to increase communities' economic resources and capacity. Related to the adverse effects of sparse economic opportunities for health care coverage, the PPACA seeks to expand employer-based health insurance availability by incentivizing health insurance coverage for small businesses (\u226425 employees) through tax credits (Sec. 1421) and enabling small businesses with up to 100 employees the ability to purchase insurance through state Exchanges (Sec. 1311). With regard to increasing the capacity of under-resourced organizations, the PPACA offers some interesting pilot and demonstration grant opportunities that may help to support low-volume providers in rural communities (e.g., Sec. 3123, Sec. 3126, and Sec. 4101).\nPersistent issues. Simultaneously, several eligibility barriers may persist. First, through the PPACA, the primary means by which individuals and families are expected to obtain insurance is through employers-a major issue, as described above, in rural settings. While the PPACA seeks to set limits on out-of-pocket costs for those with incomes up to 400% FPL (Sec. 1401), little text is devoted to ensuring out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductibles, copayments) are affordable and manageable for low-income individuals. In addition, PPACA solutions to capacity building at the community level are comparable to those pre-PPACA (i.e., temporary grant funding that requires sufficient infrastructure to be competitive)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we have integrated an analysis of focus groups with a sample of rural women and the text of the PPACA to identify the ways in which the PPACA proposes to address identified health care access challenges in rural populations. Based on our sample population-an example of a racially diverse and largely low-income women in the rural Midwestern U.S.-our study indicates that, while availability and eligibility may have been foci in the PPACA, as a function of geography, economic factors, and small population size, rural populations may continue to face barriers to accessing consistent, quality, local health care.\nHaving a sufficient health care workforce is associated with better health outcomes and reduced mortality. 34 The PPACA proposes to increase availability by expanding the health care workforce, largely through recruitment and training of primary care providers; however, initiatives to retain providers in rural settings are lacking in the PPACA. Currently, health care providers are less likely to be recruited or retained in rural settings. 6, 35, 36 Specifically, few training programs for medical providers take place in rural settings, 37 early-career providers may be dissuaded from practicing in settings where they do not wish to raise a family, 6, 36, 38 and rural providers may be more likely to leave their practices due to dissatisfaction with their careers. 39 These challenges suggest that provider recruitment and retention efforts must extend beyond the health care environment through community-integrated efforts to support a rural health care workforce. 40 Because of the PPACA's focus on increasing primary care providers, barriers to specialty care access may also persist. The dearth of specialists may especially affect disadvantaged rural populations such as the elderly, chronically ill, and disabled individuals if they have difficulty accessing care. 41, 42 The PPACA's components-such as ACOs-are designed to improve coordination of care; however, due to lack of providers, ACOs development may lag in rural settings. 23 Health care access and coordination of care may be further strained by rural hospital closures, as 47 rural hospitals closed between 2010 and 2014, largely due to lack of financial sustainability and decreasing patient populations. 43 To mitigate these challenges, future programming and policy should promote creative solutions to improve availability of providers. These may include facilitating partnerships between rural providers and larger health care systems to create ACOs, in an effort to improve coordination of care and access to specialty care providers. 44 Other solutions include establishing mobile specialty provider programs, where rural health care sites that cannot support a full-time specialty provider collaborate with a visiting physician to provide space for specialty-care practice on a regular basis, 46 and implementing care through telehealth, where various technologies (e.g., phone, video, electronic transmission of diagnostic images) are used to provide health care, health information, or health education from a distance. 47 The PPACA expands eligibility to acquire health insurance, largely through optional state-based Medicaid expansion, incentivizing employer-based health insurance, and the establishment of state-based exchanges. However, as of July 2016, 19 states had not expanded Medicaid. 48 Evidence suggests lack of expansion may disproportionally affect rural populations. 49 Specifically, in 2014, when 24 states had not yet expanded Medicaid, nearly two-thirds of uninsured rural residents resided in these non-expansion states. As it was pre-PPACA, employment remains a primary means by which non-elderly U.S. residents obtain health care. 50 Thus, among rural residents, who are less likely to obtain employer-based health insurance for employment reasons including employer size, lower wages, and higher rates self-employment, 13 coverage gaps may persist. Once the mandate for employer-based coverage is in full effect, further research is needed to understand whether employer-based coverage has increased in rural areas.\nTo meet the needs of those not covered by employer-based insurance, the PPACA implementation has allowed states to have autonomy over Medicaid expansion and health insurance exchange opportunities that allow individuals to purchase health insurance, with a choice of coverage levels and price points. For participating states, the PPACA provides cost assistance for those with incomes between 100% and 400% of the FPL 1 -constituting approximately half of rural Americans compared with 43% of urban Americans. 49 However, rural residents who must purchase insurance through the exchanges still face challenges. Early data show that at a population level as rurality increases, health insurance exchange enrollment decreases; 26 however, reasons for these differences are still be explored. One explanation is the \"coverage gap\" in rural states that did not participate in Medicaid expansion. 49 These states are more likely to be rural, and low-income residents are unable to obtain cost assistance to purchase health insurance. Additionally, 2016 data indicate that rural residents enrolled in health insurance exchanges have fewer marketplace options and they experience higher premiums than urban residents. 51 State-specific variation in PPACA implementation, as well as variations in state and local economies will likely contribute to uneven access to health care, with significant barriers among those who experience challenges in both availability and eligibility, such as low-income rural populations. Additional research is needed to understand how individual, community, and state-level factors together affect PPACA enrollment levels.\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, while the focus groups were conducted after the PPACA had been passed, they occurred prior to the implementation of most components of the PPACA. They were also conducted as part of a larger community health assessment, and access to health care was just one area explored in the focus groups. Thus, the focus groups did not ask participants about specific components of the PPACA, nor did perspectives of participants capture post-PPACA impressions of health care access. The study would have been improved with further probing around participants' access to health care concerns, and by collecting personal health insurance status data from participants. While we do not have permission to conduct follow-up with the participants in this study, this research would also be enhanced with a follow-up study with women from the same rural community. Additionally, the focus groups were conducted with women in rural, southernmost Illinois who volunteered to attend the focus groups. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to all S7 women, or to other rural populations in the U.S., including Tribal and undocumented populations. Rural men may also have unique perspectives regarding health care access that may not be included in the data.\nThis study of rural women's perspectives on health care access highlights geographic availability and affordability as major barriers to accessing health care, which may be only partially addressed by elements of the PPACA, however further research is needed to understand and address access to health care comprehensively and equitably in rural populations. Specifically, follow-up research is needed to understand whether rural women's perceptions of access have changed as a result of the PPACA, and which barriers to care persist. Additionally, the amenability domain was only discussed in relation to eligibility, but with the PPACA, insurance purchased through the exchanges offers an option for which everyone is eligible. Thus, further research is needed to assess whether persistent barriers affect willingness to purchase insurance through the exchange. Similarly, compatibility domain was not an emergent theme in our focus groups; further research should explore the extent to which compatibility is relevant for rural women's access to care. Further research is also needed to examine how primary, specialty, and allied health care availability in rural settings has changed since the implementation of the PPACA, including promising strategies demonstrating recruitment and retention success; and whether specific components of the PPACA targeting rural populations have been effective in increasing access to care."}]
