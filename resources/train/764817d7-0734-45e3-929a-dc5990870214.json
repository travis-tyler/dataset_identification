In the 30% of surveys returned in usable forms, a majority of irrigators indicated that salinity was a problem but less than 30% indicated a willingness to change irrigation systems. Two main reasons were given for the general unwillingness to adopt more technically efficient irrigation systems. The first was simply the cost of investing in new irrigation systems relative to the perceived improvements in yield or expanded crop selections. The second was somewhat more unexpected: impending retirement. Nearly 35% of all respondents indicated an intention either to exit or, more typically, retire from agriculture within the next five years, and that their unwillingness to invest stemmed from their expected departure from farming.\nAnd these results exist within a demographic environment that is not positive for future investment: a consistently aged farming population. According to the 2007 USDA Census of Agriculture, the average age of a farmer in the United States was 54.9 at the time the CSU survey was conducted, while the average age of farmers in Colorado and Kansas (the area most affected by salinity problems in the Arkansas River basin) were 54.8 and 55.7, respectively. The corresponding figures from the 2002 Census of Agriculture for the United States, for Colorado and for Kansas were 55.3, 54.5 and 56. Given the relative ages of US farmers, the potential for retirement to affect investment decisions will be a consistent issue and the role of retirement in on-farm investment decisions will become quite critical. Building on the previously mentioned survey results, this research examines how the potential for retirement in the near term affects the decision to invest in durable, water-conserving technology. It extends existing irrigation technology adoption choice models to reflect that the decision to adopt a water-conserving technology is not only a function of the lifespan of the irrigation system, but also of the expected lifespan of the operator. This paper evaluates both the extent and magnitude the intention to retire has on investment in less water-intensive irrigation systems, and discusses the potential implications for regional water quality of reduced investment rates associated with retirement."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Why and how irrigators choose an irrigation system is well-established in the economics literature, and typically reduces to a function of water price and quality (see Caswell and Zilberman, 1985; Lichtenberg, 1989; Negri and Brooks, 1990; Dinar and Yaron, 1990; Dinar and Zilberman, 1991; Shrestha and Gopalakrishnan, 1993; Green et al., 1996; Green and Sunding, 1997; Schuck and Green, 2001; . By reducing the amount of water which is applied but not effectively transmitted to a crop\"s root zone for consumption, more technically efficient irrigation systems (such as low-pressure sprinkler or drip systems) can increase water consumption while simultaneously reducing water applications. This allows irrigators to meet the consumptive requirements of their crops while using less water overall, an action that both reduces water application costs and frequently corresponds to moderate yield improvements (Dinar and Zilberman, 1991) .\nAdditionally, by reducing the runoff of unconsumed water, improved irrigation systems can also reduce salinization that increases other production costs and reduces crop yield (Wichelns, 1991) . Taken together, the cost reducing and yield improving effects of improved irrigation technology can improve on-farm profits and should promote adoption. However, while these general improvements should promote adoption, not all farms may be able to adopt more technically efficient systems. Specifically, not all farms are physically compatible with all irrigation systems, and farm specific variations in land attributes, cropping patterns, and water costs may make it difficult if not impossible for all farms to upgrade their irrigation systems due to characteristics or attributes unique to each farm (Green et al., 1996; Green and Sunding, 1997; Schuck and Green, 2001) ."}, {"section_title": "Irrigation Technology Adoption Model", "text": "The bio-physical limits of plants mean crop water demands tend to be fundamentally inelastic (Nieswiadomy, 1988; Ogg and Gollehon, 1989) . Water-stressing can be a potentially effective option for dealing with agricultural water management problems. , The fundamental inelasticity of water demand means large scale changes in water use typically must occur at the extensive margin through scale and technology choices rather than the intensive margin through application rates. Changing irrigation systems, then becomes changing the entire production system of a farm.\nUnfortunately, irrigation systems represent a significant investment for most farms. Replacement of major capital assets typically occurs when the expected returns of the capital (including any salvage costs) is sufficiently greater than the decision not to replace. (Perrin, 1972) .The ability to adopt new capital must always be physically compatible with the enterprise (Perrin and Winkelman, 1976) . The standard approach to analyzing the irrigation adoption decision was first put forward by Caswell and Zilberman (1986) and essentially reduces the adoption decision to a multinomial choice across systems of varying profitability. This decision is typically conditioned on higher water costs (either in terms of direct monetary costs or nonmonetary costs related to scarcity and quality) but the hurdle rates for adoption tend to be very pronounced (Carey and Zilberman, 2002) . As a result, adoption of a more technically efficient irrigation system is often stimulated by major external events such as a drought . However, shocks can also arise due to choices made by the irrigator, such as the simultaneous decision to retire.\nThis model extends the basic irrigation technology adoption problem first put forward by Caswell and Zilberman (1986) to include an endogenous and simultaneous production shock, specifically the decision to retire from farming. The discussion begins by identifying the profits received by the irrigator. Assume that irrigators profit maximize and are constrained to quasiconcave production technologies. , where the following definitions apply: -\u03c0 j : the profits to an irrigator under the j-th irrigation system -p: a vector of output prices -w: a vector of input prices \u03b8: a vector of farm specific attributes \u03c9: a vector of irrigator specific characteristics Together, these give the farm-level profit function:\nThe profit-maximizing irrigator will choose the j-th irrigation system over the competing k-th irrigation system if expected profits of the j-th system are greater than the expected profits under the k-th system, or:\nThis implicitly assumes that the investment time horizon for each irrigation system is comparable to the other, so relative differences in the lifespan of each system do not dominate the adoption decision. However, if irrigators shorten their time horizon due to an expected retirement such that the management horizon is less than the full lifespan of an irrigation system, the adoption decision will hinge upon the expected stream of profits over the abbreviated time. Consequently, when retirement is an option, modeling the decision to adopt must integrate the endogenous decision to retire as well. Retiring operators may not invest in long-run capital improvements or may simply not invest at all.\nThe decision to retire is best viewed in a simple random utility framework (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985) . Assuming that the indirect utility function with retirement is V R (r,M;\u03c9) and the indirect utility function without retirement is V NR (r,M;\u03c9) where r is a vector of consumption goods prices, M is income (either pre-or post-retirement, respectively), and \u03c9 is as previously defined, then the decision to retire will occur if:\n(3) assuming that irrigators maximize their expected utility.\nGiven the underlying assumption of utility maximization, the retirement decision suggested in (3) can be transformed into an empirically estimable discrete choice model (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985) . Unfortunately, modeling equation (3) in this manner implies that the irrigation technology adoption decisions in (2) may be jointly determined with and conditioned upon the outcome of (3). Fortunately, a discrete choice model can also handle this if the irrigation technology choice model is assumed to be jointly distributed with the retirement decision (Greene, 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Analysis", "text": "The irrigators\" technology adoption decision suggested by equations 2) and 3) can be modeled with the outcome of the model describing the irrigators\" retirement decision from equation 3) included as an explanatory variable. This captures the endogeneity stemming from the retirement decision and allows differentiation between the irrigation technology adoption decision with and without the potential for irrigators\" retirement. However, this requires the simultaneous estimate of the retirement decision, which implies a two-equation system with jointly determined and jointly distributed error terms. Fortunately, this can be accomplished (under certain conditions on the variance/covariance matrix) using two individual limited dependent variable models equations (Greene, 2008) .\nGiven this potential endogeneity problem, two separate equations are estimated here. The first examines whether or not irrigators are planning on upgrading an existing irrigation system (regardless of type) within the next five years, while the second examines if the irrigators plan to retire during that same time frame. 2 Both choices are simple binary choices with the first conditioned upon the characteristics of the farm such as acreage, crop selection, water supply, water quality, and other relevant physical data unique to the farm. The second focuses primarily on characteristics unique to the irrigator, such as education, off-farm employment, age, gender, debt loads, and similar demographic items that are specific to the irrigator and not unique to the farm in a physical sense.\nAdoption and diffusion of less water intensive irrigation systems (such as low pressure sprinklers or drip) are quite low in Arkansas River Basin (Frasier et al., 1999) . Over 80% of all irrigators in the region use some type of gravity irrigation system and run-off rates from irrigation can range as high as 60-70% of water applications. In an effort to identify why adoption rates for more technically efficient irrigation systems are so low in the basin, researchers at Colorado State University surveyed irrigators in the region to identify potential barriers to adoption. This survey, commencing via mail in December 2005 and concluding in April 2006, contacted all 723 active records for irrigated farms in the Arkansas River Basin (consisting of Bent, Prowers, Otero, Crowley, and Pueblo counties) in the Colorado Agricultural Statistics Service database. Survey respondents were asked to identify their current cropping patterns, irrigation systems, and water supplies, and their perception of the effects of salinity on their farm and its production. Additionally, survey respondents were asked to identify any potential changes they might make in either their irrigation systems or cropping patterns in the next five years in response to the salinity problem in the basin.\nFollowing Salant and Dillman (1994) , a single reminder letter was mailed to survey recipients one week following the initial mailout and the overall response rate to the survey was approximately 30% with 222 surveys returned. Survey respondents identified current cropping patterns, irrigation systems, and water supplies, as well as their perception of the effects of salinity on their farm and its production. The basic survey data is summarized below in Table 1 . Two items related to water supply reliability are included in the table and worth specific noting. The first is a measure of overall supply stability, specifically how many years out of the last 10 years irrigators received a full allocation of water from their regional suppliers. The average was nearly 6, and most respondents indicated that despite a very severe drought in the region in 2002 their supplies were relatively stable. 2005 was also a relatively dry year, yet the respondents received nearly 60% of their allotments. Irrigated operations accounted for over 90% of the entire sample. 3 Among these irrigated operations, there was also relatively little variation in water source, with well over 50% (and in some counties, over 80%) of water supplies coming from mutual-share ditch companies. Similarly, crop selection also showed little variation, with the two dominant crops in the region (corn and alfalfa) accounting for slightly over 20% of all acreage and 65% of all acreage, respectively. 7 Additionally, survey respondents were asked to identify any potential changes they might make in either their irrigation systems or cropping patterns in the next five years in response to the salinity problem in the basin. Over 60% of the respondents indicated that salinity severely affected their crop growth, with over half of the respondents indicating that they perceived a 25% yield loss due to salinity. Most indicated that they were not planning any major changes in production methods due to salinity either in terms of cropping patterns or irrigation technology choice, with less than 40% indicating any sort of planned change. Of potential changes, improvements in irrigation technology were the most common with over 20% of the respondents indicating the intention to change systems. Lastly, the survey contained four sections that asked questions about the farm\"s basic operations, perceived salinity problems, responses to salinity problems, and socio-economic characteristics. Most critically for this analysis, the section on responses to saline water supply included a question on whether or not the irrigator intended to upgrade from an existing irrigation system over the next 5 years, and two additional questions related to the retirement issue. The first question targeted those respondents who indicated that they did not intend to upgrade their irrigation systems specifically because they intended to leave farming in the next five years, while the second was included in the socioeconomic section and simply asked if the respondent intended to retire in the next five years. The previously mentioned endogeneity issue arises from the part of the survey specifically identifying if the irrigators were retiring in lieu of adopting a less water intensive irrigation system."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Two important demographic variables are also considered. First, proportion of income derived from agriculture is expected to be important in terms of the decision to retire and may factor into the decision to invest. On average, respondents indicated that approximately 40% held off-farm employment while on-farm income accounted for less than 45% of all income. Much of the residual income appeared to come from spouses and various forms of government transfer payments. Finally, education often plays an important role in technology adoption decisions. The level of education was represented as an integer value as follows: high school = 1; some college = 2; vocational/technical degree = 3; bachelor\"s degree = 4; and graduate/professional degree = 5."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Estimation of the joint decision to retire and/or to adopt new irrigation technology in response to salinity was executed in LIMDEP as two binomial logit equations with one regression describing the decision to update technology and the other representing the decision to retire, with the former a function of the latter. As a result, the two decisions can be modeled as singleequations with no loss in statistical efficiency because it implies the variance-covariance matrix between the two regressions is upper triangular, i.e., the decision to change technology depends upon the decision to retire, but not vice versa (Greene, 2008) .\nThe coefficients, t-values, and relevant measures of goodness of fit for each decision are reported in Tables 2 and 3 . Following a test down procedure, the two decisions were reduced to two distinctively different sets of explanatory variables. To start, the decision to retire was conditioned almost entirely upon demographic issues and financial issues, specifically: the age of the farmer (in years), whether or not the farmer had a college education (binary), the gross sales of the farm (in dollars), the size of the household (in people), whether or not the farm had off-farm income (binary), and whether or not the farm had a perceived salinity problem (binary). As indicated by the Likelihood Ratio Test, McFadden\"s R-Squared and percentage of correct predictions, the overall performed relatively well. More specifically, the slope coefficient for the age of the farmer was statistically significant at a 1% level and suggested a positive marginal effect on the probability of retiring. i.e., older farmers are more likely to retire. Of equal interest, the dummy variable for on-farm salinity issues also had a statistically significant coefficient, albeit at a more marginal 10% level. This also had a positive marginal effect, suggesting that salinity increases the likelihood of retirement. Both of these relationships are demonstrated in Figure 1 . As can be seen in the figure, the probability of retirement rises relative to age both with and without an on-farm salinity problem. However, the additional positive effect of an on-farm salinity problem is to lead the probability of exiting farming to rise over 50% at approximately 65 years of age while farmers without a salinity problem reach this threshold nearly eight years later. Consequently, it appears that one of the main effects of salinity is to accelerate the rate at which farmers exit the industry. The consequences of this effect can be seen in the second model, the model to adopt upgraded irrigation technology. Unlike the decision to exit agriculture, the decision to upgrade irrigation technology was more a function of the physical characteristics of the farm. Specifically, the decision to upgrade irrigation technology was a function of the following: whether or not the farm had a perceived salinity problem (binary); the fraction of the farm\"s water entitlements delivered in 2005 (expressed as a percentage); the reliability of the farm\"s water entitlements (expressed as the number of years over the previous ten in which the farm received a full allotment of water); the square of water supply reliability to assess non-linearities in water supply; whether or not the farmer intended to exit farming over the next five years (binary, and the dependent variable for the previous model); and the number of planted irrigated acres in 2005. As with the previous model, the overall model performed well based on the Likelihood Ratio test, the McFadden\"s R-Squared, and the percentage of correct predictions; the Likelihood Ratio test indicates overall model significance at the 1% level. Additionally, the coefficients on all of these variables were statistically significant at least at a 10% level, with the supply, reliability, exiting farming, and acreage levels all significant at the 5% level. In terms of the marginal effects, supply reliability is negatively correlated with upgrading irrigation technology, suggesting that irrigators with relatively more stable water supplies are the least likely to upgrade their systems. If a relatively less reliable water supply is perceived as a cost, this result is consistent with previous irrigation technology adoption models. What are of greater interest, however, are the effects of retirement and salinity. Retirement appears to reduce the likelihood of adopting an upgraded irrigation system, while salinity increases the probability of adoption. The critical issue, then, is which of these two effects prevails. The relative magnitude of the retirement effects compared to the salinity effects can be seen in Figure 2 . As the figure indicates, irrigators who do not intend to retire are markedly more likely to adopt upgraded irrigation systems. Impending retirement virtually undoes the effects of salinity to the point that the probability of upgrading irrigation systems for individuals who neither have salinity problems nor intend to leave are virtually indistinguishable from individuals who are leaving and have salinity problems. This has significant implications for the potential to promote adoption of relatively more efficient irrigation systems as the US agricultural population continues to rise.\nOver all observations for which separate ACRE state benchmarks would have existed for dryland and irrigated acres had ACRE existed over the 1974-2008 crop years, ACRE state revenue payments were 7.6% larger with separate dryland and irrigated revenue benchmarks than with a single benchmark ( Figure 1 ). acres. This expectation was confirmed. ACRE revenue payments occurred 8.6 percentage points more often for dryland acres than for irrigated acres (Figure 3 ). On the other hand, because irrigated yields are higher, per acre payments are expected to be higher for irrigated acres when payments occur. This expectation also was confirmed. Payment per acre was 38% higher for irrigated acres when payments occurred (Figure 3) .\nAn initial static analysis was performed without simulation using 2011 costs, average yields and the average monthly price for the period 2006-2010. Net returns were highest for NTWW and were $8.35/acre larger than BWW (Table 2) . Total costs were lower for NTWW and gross returns were higher. Under this initial analysis that used average yields and prices, lower glyphosate prices will further increase the NTWW system net return advantage over the BWW system. On the other hand, the glyphosate price would need to rise to $44.28 per gallon or higher for BWW to have equivalent or higher net returns than NTWW. According to USDA (2010), this has happened six times in the last 10 years, though recent prices have been significantly lower. The simulated net returns analysis reported in Table 3 shows that NTWW had slightly higher net returns than BWW and a lower standard deviation and coefficient of variation. When the price series from 2001-2005 was used to calculate the average net returns, they were negative ( Table  3 ). In that case, the BWW system was less negative than the other systems. In the future, some of the wheat straw left on the soil surface in a no-tillage system may have value as a biomass feedstock for alternative energy production. Nelson et al. (2010) estimated that wheat straw harvest would average 0.30 tons/acre in this region. This residue removal level is the largest harvest that would allow the rate of soil erosion from both rainfall and wind to be less than the NRCS-prescribed tolerable soil loss limit, T, and the level of soil organic matter to be unchanged or positive. Further, additional carbon sequestered in the soil with no-tillage may have value if carbon markets for agricultural offsets develop in the future."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In regions affected by saline water soils, water supplies, and runoff, adoption of more technically efficient irrigation systems are frequently promoted as a means of reducing both the consequences and scope of salinity. However, in the course of surveying irrigators in the severely saline Arkansas River basin of Colorado, irrigators indicated that impending retirement was a major reason for not upgrading from gravity irrigation systems to relatively more efficient sprinklers. Through models of both the decision to retire and to adopt more technically efficient irrigation systems as a function of both on-farm salinity and the retirement decision, it appears that while saline water supplies do encourage adoption of more technically efficient irrigation systems, the corresponding effects of retirement on irrigation technology are negative and largely undo the effects of saline water supplies. Furthermore, saline water supplies also correspond to retiring from agriculture nearly 8 years earlier than in the absence of salinity. Given the rising average age of farmers in the United States, this implies that the age threshold where farmers are no longer willing to adopt improved irrigation will be achieved sooner and represents a significant barrier to reducing the effects of salinity in the Arkansas River Basin.\nWhat remains to be seen, however, is whether or not the transition from one generation of farmers to the next has positive or negative effects on both adoption rates and salinity controls. The present model simply identifies both that salinity hastens retirement and that retirement is a barrier to adoption. But the long term implications for adoption of less water intensive irrigation systems is unclear. Specifically, if saline water supplies accelerate generational transfers through retirement and younger generations are more willing to adopt \"better\" irrigation systems, rising retirement rates may actually improve water quality in the long run. However, within the context of the current results it is not possible to assess the specific intentions of the irrigators so while it can be said that the intention to retire exerts a significant and negative effect on irrigation technology adoption and that the effects of the decision to retire are largely countervailing to the positive adoption effects of saline water supplies, the cross-generational effects of this transfer require additional research.\nCrop feedstock projections in this analysis included consideration of product-product competition within agro-climatically distinct subregions of Washington State. Furthermore, projections of 2008 and 2010 crop acreages included a rare comparison against ex post reported acreages, with reasonable results for most crops.\nThe results of this study indicate the infeasibility of sustaining a large-scale biofuel industry in Washington based on locally produced oilseeds, sugar beets, and grain corn given short run and medium run expected prices and technology. Our conclusions regarding the infeasibility of agricultural crops as feedstock are supported in part by a study in the neighboring state of Oregon (Graf and Koehler, 2000) . The projected breakeven prices for Washington farmers to profitably produce these crops exceed current and projected prices. Large ethanol and biodiesel processors in the state import nearly all of their virgin crop feedstocks.\nThis sobering assessment of one western state\"s projected shortfall in producing its own crop feedstocks for biofuels has important implications for state-level policymakers and agricultural research directors. In an earlier multi-faceted report to the Washington Legislature (Yoder et al., 2009) , the crop feedstock projections received the most critical attention from reviewers. Some politicians, biofuel entrepreneurs, and even agricultural scientists possess strong optimistic beliefs about the state\"s potential for self sufficiency in crop feedstocks, despite long standing comparative agronomic and economic advantages by other high value crops.\nThe NTWW system generally has higher net returns and less risk than BWW. However, the differences are small, indicating that relatively small incentives to use NT rather than burning may be useful. The BWW and NTWW systems have greater net returns than RTWW. Therefore, in situations where weed problems develop in continuous no-till wheat, the system that burns wheat residue is a better alternative than reduced tillage. Although NTWW looks economically superior to the BWW system, factors including tradition, higher glyphosate costs, and lower commodity prices than currently exist may also contribute to wheat stubble being burned.\nThe results of this study suggest that minor policy changes that increase the transaction costs for burning crop residue may be all that are needed to reduce crop residue burning. The risk premium that would need to be paid to encourage NTWW instead of BWW is $3.16/acre at its largest under the 2006 through 2010 wheat price series and highest glyphosate price scenario. Possible additional polices include requiring an approved burning plan, charging for a burn permit, and notification of intent to burn, providing a subsidy to use no-tillage, or requiring the land manager to get approval for burning based upon predictions of smoke impact on air quality with an environmental smoke model, each of which would increase the relative cost of burning and make NTWW more economically viable.

Clay Francis and Carl Zulauf 1,2 Introduction", "text": "The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill) provides farm commodity program participants with the choice of a traditional suite of fixed direct payment, marketing loan, and price counter-cyclical programs or a new Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program suite. The ACRE suite consists of (1) 80 percent of the traditional program\"s direct payments, (2) marketing loans at 70 percent of the traditional program\"s loan rate, (3) and a new state revenue program. In a departure from the traditional farm programs, the ACRE state revenue program explicitly contains a differentiation by production practice. Specifically, separate ACRE state revenue benchmarks are established for dryland and irrigated acres if total acres planted to a crop in a state are at least 25% dryland and 25% irrigated.\nThis article presents an analysis of the impact of the dryland-irrigated provision upon the cost and flow of payments by the ACRE state revenue program. Specifically, a historic, counterfactual analysis is conducted using data for the 1969-2008 crop years. Crops included in the analysis are barley, corn, upland cotton, peanuts, oats, rice, grain sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. One of the simulated ACRE programs contained the dryland-irrigated provision in the 2008 Farm Bill. The other simulated ACRE program had a single state revenue benchmark, and thus made no distinction between dryland and irrigated acres. No other difference existed between the simulated ACRE programs.\nThe ACRE provisions in the 2008 Farm Bill that are germane to this analysis are discussed in the next section. Discussions of the analytical procedures and results follow. The paper ends with a summary and conclusion section."}, {"section_title": "Overview of ACRE State Revenue Program", "text": "The 2008 Farm Bill gives farmers and landowners a choice between the traditional farm program suite and an ACRE farm program suite (U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA)). Twenty two crops are eligible for election into ACRE, including barley, corn, upland cotton, peanuts, oats, rice, grain sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. The unit of election is a farm as recorded at FSA. As long as an FSA farm is not in ACRE, election of ACRE remains open. Once ACRE is elected, the FSA farm is enrolled through the 2012 crop.\nAn ACRE state revenue payment occurs if a state\"s actual revenue per planted acre is less than the state\"s revenue benchmark, where, for state k, crop s, and crop year t:\n( The ACRE state revenue benchmark cannot increase more than 10 percent from the prior year\"s level (called a cap) nor decrease more than 10 percent from the prior year\"s level (called a cup). The 10 percent cap and cup, along with the use of historical moving averages, means that the ACRE state revenue benchmark may adjust more slowly than changes in market revenue. However, no floor exists on the revenue benchmark.\nPlanted acres equal the conventional definition for most eligible crops, but, for barley, corn, oats, grain sorghum, and wheat; FSA defined planted acres as harvested acres plus acres reported as failed acres to FSA. Failed acres are acres intended for harvest but not harvested. ACRE revenue payments can be received on only 83.3% of planted acres.\nDue to a lack of data at the individual farm level, this analysis does not include the individual farm provisions of the ACRE program. These provisions include (1) an FSA farm eligibility condition in which an FSA farm\"s actual revenue for a crop must be less than the farm\"s benchmark revenue for the crop, (2) customization of the state revenue payment to the FSA farm by the ratio of farm yield to state yield, (3) a restriction that an FSA farm cannot receive ACRE revenue payments on more acres than the FSA farm\"s total base acres, and (4) a limit on the amount of ACRE revenue payments a farm entity can receive. For additional discussion of the individual farm provisions as well as other provisions of the ACRE program, see Zulauf, Dicks, and Vitale, Zulauf and Orden, and Zulauf, Schnitkey, and Langemeier."}, {"section_title": "Data and Analytical Methods", "text": "A historical counter-factual analysis was conducted. Specifically, the ACRE state revenue program was assumed to have existed over the 1974 through 2008 crop years with all planted acres enrolled in the ACRE program.\nState level production and planted acre data as well as U.S. crop year average price data were obtained from USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Because of the need to construct the five-year Olympic moving average of yield, data collection started with the 1969 crop year. Information was not available for all states for all of the 1969-2008 crop years, especially by dryland and irrigated production practice. Footnote c of Table 1 contains a list of the states and years for which separate information was available by dryland and irrigated production practice.\nData on failed acres were obtained by personal communication with USDA, FSA. This data began with the 1995 crop. For earlier years, failed acres for a state and crop were estimated by using the average share of planted acres that were failed acres from 1995 through 2008. We also estimated a regression equation in which failed acres for a state were estimated as a function of the difference between a state\"s planted and harvested acres. Most of the regression equations were statistically insignificant and explanatory power was generally low even when the equation was statistically significant.\nGiven the available data, 550 crop-state-year combinations would have qualified for separate dryland and irrigated ACRE revenue benchmarks if the ACRE state revenue program had existed over the 1974-2008 crop years (Table 1) . For each of these 550 crop-state-year observations, 25% of the acres planted to the crop in the state for the year were in dryland production and 25% were in irrigated production.\nThe number of observations in which an ACRE state revenue payment occurred ranged from four for the peanut irrigated ACRE revenue benchmark to 40 for the upland cotton dryland ACRE revenue benchmark ( Table 1 ). The relatively small number of observed payments by crop raises questions about the statistical power of the analysis at the individual crop level. Hence, the discussion of results in the next section is in terms of all crops combined.\nNot including the farm related provisions noted in the previous section means that estimated ACRE state revenue payments are high. However, the focus of this article is on the comparative performance of the ACRE program with and without the dryland-irrigated provision. It is not clear that including the farm level provisions would alter the comparative relationships, but the possibility does exist. .

American states and communities have also welcomed the potential for economic growth from biofuel plants. In response to these concerns, Washington and other states have enacted laws and regulations designed to promote biofuel development (U.S. Dept. of Energy, 2009 ).\nCorn and sugar beets are among the potential ethanol feedstocks in Washington; however, Washington accounted for only 0.15% of the nation\"s grain corn (NASS, 2008 acres per year for these three census years (NASS, 1997 (NASS, , 2002 (NASS, , 2007 . The relatively high 2002 oilseed acreage represented only 0.25% of Washington\"s cropland. Washington produces virtually no soybeans, the nation\"s largest biodiesel feedstock. gasoline consumption. Again, sugar producers might outbid ethanol producers for sugar beets. Current Washington grain corn and historical sugar beet production could supply less than two 40-million-gallon-per-year (MGY) plants each if the entire production was diverted to this purpose. Only 0.02% of the feedstock requirements of a 40 MGY biodiesel plant could be met by current in-state canola production. Undoubtedly, a different set of relative prices would be necessary to encourage production of biofuel crops to meet the state's fuel needs. The objective of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of producing biofuel crop feedstocks within Washington State assuming infrastructure and biofuel production capacity were developed. We project profitable acreages of Washington\"s crop feedstocks for 2008 in the short run and for the midpoint of a 2009-2011 medium term period using subregion linear programming models. The analysis uses subregion data on production possibilities, costs, crop prices, policies and available technology. The 2008 projections, based on spring forecasted or contract prices, are compared to actual crop acreages for that year. The 2010 projections, based on moving average price projections available in 2008, are compared to 2010 planted acreage reports. Although all projections were made in mid-2008, reporting was delayed for over two years to assess their ex post accuracy. The delayed ex post validation is rare in the empirical literature.\nMost studies regarding ethanol and biodiesel production have focused on agribusiness and rural development considerations rather than on the feasibility of in-state feedstock production (e.g., Franken and Parcell, 2003; Kenkel and Holcomb, 2006; Parcell and Westhoff, 2006; Lambert et al., 2008; Susanto, Rosson and Hudson, 2008) . Some previous state-level studies have estimated the stand-alone profitability of crop feedstocks. Many utilized enterprise budgeting to calculate the revenues, costs, and profits associated with the production of a particular crop such as oilseeds in Oregon\"s Willamette Valley (Jaeger and Siegel, 2008) and in Maine (Sexton, 2003) . Stebbins (2008) uses this approach and found that farm-scale cultivation of oilseeds in Vermont was feasible. A major limitation of single-crop analyses is that they do not allow for product-product competition for land and other resources. Important exceptions are the studies by De La Torre Ugarte et al. (2003) and Walsh et al. (2007) that allowed for product-product competition in 305 independent regional linear programming models for the central and eastern U.S. These results were utilized in their national demand, regional supply, and aggregate income model. Walsh et al. (2007) projected relatively optimistic cellulosic and food crop feedstock supplies to meet year 2025 transportation fuels, food, feed and export demands with some increased crop prices. While such long term national projections are valuable, they are strongly dependent on embodied assumptions on biofuel conversion technologies and cellulosic feedstock supply functions over long time periods. Financial stress in the biofuel industry during 2008-2009 including excess capacity, bankruptcies, and plant closures challenges optimistic long run projections in the absence of technological breakthroughs, more generous subsidies, or markedly different relative prices (Young, 2009 ).\nThis study allows for product-product competition in response to changing economic incentives. The ex post robustness of crop feedstock projections is tested by comparing them with subsequent published acreage data.\nWheat producers\" options for managing wheat stubble in central Kansas after harvest include using a no-till system that leaves the residue in place, tilling the ground to incorporate some or all residue into the soil, and/or burning the stubble. According to Shroyer, Hargrove and Al-Khatib (2006) , wheat producers burn stubble fields before fall planting in order to remove residue for easier planting, while at the same time providing control of some disease organisms and weed species. Burning of wheat stubble also has some disadvantages. These include long-run reduction in soil organic matter, loss of nutrients, hardening of the seedbed and reduced water infiltration capacity. These disadvantages are issues that the farm manager must weigh in the decision to burn or not.\nOne disadvantage from society\"s point of view that is receiving increased attention is air quality concerns due to smoke from rangeland and cropland burning. (KDHE, 2008) . Oklahoma is in the process of developing a smoke management plan (Blocksome, 2011) .\nCropland comprises 27.5% of the land area burned in Kansas while rangeland is 71.7% according to a study conducted by Sonoma Technology (2004) . The cropland burned consists of 76.1% wheat acreage, 13.6% is in hay production and the remaining acreage spread among other crops. This report also indicated that Kansas burned 5,205,313 acres of private rangeland and crop residue while Iowa burned 2,247 acres, Missouri 290,978 acres, Nebraska 215,526 acres, Oklahoma 2,303,359 acres, and Texas 3,798,581 acres.\nHeavy rangeland burning occurs primarily in eastern Kansas in the Flint Hills region, where as much as 80% of the total acreage of rangeland is burned in several counties. Crop residue burning in continuous wheat is primarily an issue in central Kansas (KDHE, 2008) . Recent information regarding the amount of wheat stubble burning is not available. The EPA (1992) reported that 600,000 acres of agricultural crop residue were burned annually in Kansas, with the primary crop being wheat.\nThe current smoke management plan is voluntary and focuses on counties that traditionally burn significant areas of rangeland or pasture. Burning of materials such as land-clearing debris, crop residues, construction debris, firefighter training burns, and yard waste is prohibited during the month of April in 16 Kansas counties in the Flint Hills region (KDHE, 2010) . Pasture burning is allowed. However, landowners are encouraged to use a website to obtain information from an environmental model to avoid burning on days when the model shows smoke is likely to impact urban areas. KDHE will address crop residue burning and will work with the agricultural community to reduce the acreage of croplands burned each year and to develop alternatives to burning (KDHE, 2008) .\nThe goal of this analysis is to examine distributions of net returns to land and management to determine which tillage system or burning of winter wheat stubble is preferred under various cost scenarios and levels of risk aversion. There currently is no restriction or penalty for burning crop residue other than the prohibition in the month of April. Wheat stubble would not typically be burned in April, as the wheat is still growing, but would generally be burned soon after wheat harvest in the summer. Crop residue burning may be more restricted in the future. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will weigh the air quality concerns against the agronomic justifications in deciding whether to limit cropland burning in the future (Shroyer, Hargrove and Al-Khatib, 2006) . Although there is potential for future restrictions on burning wheat stubble other than in the month of April, there are currently none. Therefore, we focus on the manager\"s production risk using net returns of burning or not burning wheat stubble. The following systems were examined in the analysis; burn continuous wheat -BWW, reduced-till continuous wheat -RTWW, and no-till continuous wheat -NTWW."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Standard profit-maximizing risk-adjusted linear programming (LP) models are used to project crop acreages, diesel and nitrogen use and breakeven prices for biofuel feedstock crops. LP is a common approach for examining the feasibility of alternative production possibilities in a partial equilibrium framework (e.g., Taylor, Adams and Miller, 1992; Jaeger, 2004; Keplinger and Hauck, 2006) . We provide projections for five production regions in Washington (four dryland and one irrigated) and two time horizons (short and medium run). The models calculate profit maximizing crop choice and input use subject to prevailing technology, price expectations, quantity and quality of land and other resources, agro-climatic conditions, and policy constraints.\nSome assumptions underlying the feedstock projection model merit highlighting. First, the subregional models includes activities for all major crops and land use activities, including fallow and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as appropriate. Total regional cropland acreage is constrained at 2007 levels, with the exception of moving land to or from CRP. Second, farmers in these regions have demonstrated that they can shift cropping patterns with relatively minor adjustments in their current machinery and labor supplies given opportunities for custom hiring; hence, these resources are not constraining. Third, the projections assume that crops grown in the dryland regions, including spring wheat, winter wheat, barley, grain legumes (peas, lentils, and garbanzos), and canola, are grown in agronomically sound rotations. Canola, which dominates oilseed production in eastern Washington, represents all oilseeds in the projections. Past canola technology successes, such as Roundup Ready\u00a9 canola and greater research funding for canola, are likely to sustain its dominance. Fourth, the profitability of producing a given rotation or crop is measured by total returns over total cost. Reporting results as net returns over total costs conforms to results in typical Cooperative Extension budgets for the region. Also, given the common machinery complements for the candidate crops, analysis generally showed the same relative results for returns over variable costs and returns over total costs.\nFor most crops, growers in the irrigated regions do not need to adhere to specific crop rotations due to access to irrigation. For example, while potato frequency is limited by phytosanitary requirements, wheat, grain corn, sweet corn, alfalfa and other crops can serve as rotation crops with potatoes. However, some crop choices in the irrigated region are dictated by processing plant contracts, i.e., potatoes, sweet corn, asparagus. Farmers in areas with junior water rights are also limited in terms of water availability during dry years, which affects crop choice. To reflect this complexity, we model acreages over the large set of choices within 10-year historical crop-specific upper and lower acreage bounds."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Four eastern Washington dryland farming subregions were classified according to their annual average precipitation: high, 17-22 inches/year; medium, 15-17 inches/year; low, 12-15 inches/year; and arid, 7-12 inches/year. A fifth region included Washington\"s irrigated farmland.\nA sixth region comprising the 19 counties entirely or partially west of the Cascade Mountains was not modeled because its current and past production of crop biofuel feedstocks has been miniscule (NASS, 2008) .\nEnterprise budgets of various crops grown in Washington State subregions were used to specify production functions incorporated in the LP projections (Yoder et al., 2010) . Input prices are specified at early 2008 levels for the short-run and are adjusted for the medium-run.\nFor the short-run, we use the 2008 spring contract crop prices for autumn harvest in all regions. These were $7.28/bu for grain corn (which was a high contract price spike at time of analysis), $38/ton for sugar beets, and $21.10/cwt for canola (including 20% risk discount). Exceptions to the pricing assumptions occur for land retained in the CRP, or planted to a crop with which most growers have no experience. These land uses receive adjustments for risk. Economic theory specifies that risk averse farmers will discount profit or price expectations for crops or land uses they perceive as more risky than average, or equivalently add a bonus to expectations for crops or land uses they see as less risky than average (Anderson, Dillon and Hardaker, 1977; Kurkalova et al., 2006) . Because new crops generally present farmers and scientists with a risky learning curve, expected canola price is discounted by 20% as a conservative estimate to account for added yield risk and risk aversion of crop producers. 2 In comparison, Kurkalova et al. (2006) estimated risk premiums for wheat and other crops for conservation versus conventional tillage which were 30% to 32% of expected returns. Because CRP rents are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and have zero risk , they receive a conservative 20% price bonus.\nFor the medium-run scenario (2009) (2010) (2011) , all assumptions and data sources remain the same as those outlined for the short run, except for crop prices and production costs. We use the average of 2006, 2007 and 2008 prices as a forward projection of crop prices. These were $5.18/bu for grain corn, $38.5/ton for sugar beets, and $12.45/cwt for canola. Canola and CRP retain the same percentage risk adjustments as in the short run. The retreat of crop prices to a 3-year moving average in the medium run after the exceptionally high 2008 prices reflects historical cyclical patterns. As an example, farm gate mid-November 2008 prices for soft white wheat in eastern Washington had dropped to $5/bu from the $15/bu spike in January 2008. We also assume that all production costs, except diesel and nitrogen, will increase 7% by the 2010 medium-run midpoint compared to 2008 levels, and diesel and nitrogen will increase by 20.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Given limitations of the short-run comparative statics nature of LP results, the analysis does not consider wider variations in crop and input prices.\nProjected acres from LP results are compared with reported acres from USDA-NASS data published in 2008 and 2010, unless otherwise specified. Reported canola, orchards and vineyards and summer fallow are from 2007 Ag. Census as these are not annually reported in NASS. Sugar beets and canola, as minor crops in WA, are no longer annually reported by NASS. The reported sugar beet acreage is from 2008. Edible legumes in the following tables consist of dry grain legumes, dry edible Pinto beans, and green peas.\nCRP acreages were based on active and expiring CRP acres in Washington subregions between (USDA-FSA, 2008 . Historic acreages of dryland and irrigated regions are from NASS (1997, 2002, 2007) . Orchard, barley, and other historic acreages are from NASS (1997, 2002, 2007, 2008) . Table 2 presents 2008 projections of profitable feedstock crop acreage, and fuel and fertilizer usage for each of the five modeled production regions. Note that the projected production of a biofuel feedstock does not mean that the crop will be processed into biofuels since the output will be distributed among competing uses. Breakeven prices required for feedstock crops to be produced in a region are also reported."}, {"section_title": "Results of Crop Feedstock Projections", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Short-run Projection and Validation", "text": "3 \nHigh ( In dryland eastern Washington, as expected, no typically irrigated crop feedstocks (i.e., grain corn and sugar beets) were projected in 2008 (Table 2) . Of greater importance, no canola production was projected in the short run for these zones. Small canola acreages at recent levels can be expected to continue to meet rotational needs, special contracts, or agro-climatic niches. On the whole, however, canola rotations did not compete with the dominant rotations of winter wheat-spring grain-spring legumes (or fallow) in the two higher precipitation regions or with winter wheat-fallow in the two lower precipitation regions. Indeed, the breakeven prices to make spring canola profitable in the high and medium precipitation regions were $33.68/cwt and $146.31/cwt, respectively. These compare to a risk discounted 2008 spring contract price of $21.10/cwt.\nNo canola is projected in 2008 for the irrigated zone, but the oilseed was somewhat more competitive there. The breakeven price fell short of the risk discounted contract price by only $3.45/cwt ($24.55-$21.10). The low irrigated canola projections square with field reports. One canola grower reports that the number of 160-acre irrigation circles of canola in the Columbia Basin dropped from 25 in 2007 to only 7 in (J. Schibel, personal communication, 2008 . The observed reluctance of farmers to grow canola, despite record prices, would seem to justify the risk discounts previously noted. More importantly, record high prices for traditional crops in this region (alfalfa, wheat, corn) discouraged production of alternative crops (Painter and Young, 2008) . Similarly, no sugar beet acres were projected for the irrigated zone in 2008. The breakeven price of sugar beets was $43.32/ton, about $5 more than its projected price. On the other hand, growers were projected to continue producing high-value crops such as potatoes, sweet corn, high quality alfalfa hay, apples and wine grapes (Yoder et al., 2010) . Table 2 also shows a projected 105,000 acres of irrigated grain corn in 2008. This compares to 90,000 reported acres in 2008 (Table 3) . The model over-projected grain corn acreage due to the short-lived high spring contract corn price used in the analysis. Our projection for wheat is 14% less than the 2008 reported acres (Table 3) . This projection was affected by the unprecedented variability of soft white prices, ranging from $15.12/bu to $4.30/bu during the 2008 calendar year (Union Elevator, 2009). A unique historical acreage constraint for barley, where agronomic considerations often outweigh profit maximization, contributed to the 77% over-projection for this crop. In general, however, the match between projected and actual acreages for most crops in Table 2 is considered reasonable given the variability of 2008 crop prices.\nPotential Feedstock Availability: Medium-run (2009 Medium-run ( -2011 Projections Table 4 presents projections for the midpoint of the 2009-2011 medium run. Again, canola and sugar beets fail to compete profitably with other Washington crops. Due to the projected cyclical downturn in crop prices in the medium run, breakeven prices for canola and sugar beets exceed projected market prices by a greater margin than in the short run. Again, the price shortfall for canola is smallest in the irrigated region with a breakeven of $27/cwt compared to a risk adjusted expected price of $12.45/cwt. The sugar beet breakeven price of $47.14/ton exceeds the projected price of $38.5/ton. A deteriorating profit outlook reduces projected grain corn production from 105,000 acres in 2008 to only 55,000 acres in the medium run (Table 2 and Table 4 ). No sugar beets were projected for 2010, as in 2008. \nHigh ( (Tables 3 and 5 ). The growth in forecast errors over only two years suggests caution regarding longer forecasts.\nOf most interest to this study is the accuracy of projections for biofuel feedstock crops. As previously discussed from Table 4 , zero production of both canola and sugar beets was again projected for 2010. This projection is reinforced by the fact that NASS no longer reports annual acreage of these two crops in Washington due to low plantings. On the other hand, the model under-projected Washington\"s grain corn acreage in 2010 by 73%. The discrepancy between the actual and projected corn acreage in the medium run was due to shifting price relationships not captured in our model. With falling crop prices and increasing costs in the medium run model, the deteriorating profit outlook reduced the projected grain corn production from 105,000 acres in 2008 to only 55,000 acres in the medium run. As a small corn producer with volatile production history, percentage errors in Washington\"s corn acreage are magnified. Because Washington\"s grain corn is primarily directed to livestock feed, this discrepancy is unlikely to have a large impact on supplies of in-state ethanol feedstocks.

For the reduced tillage system (RTWW), weeds were controlled using a combination of disk, chisel, roller harrow, field cultivator, sweep treader and mulch treader. Herbicides were applied, if needed, in October/November or in April. In the BWW system, the stubble was burned soon after harvest in a manner similar to that used by growers of continuous wheat in the region. Stubble was ignited on the downwind side of each plot, forcing the burn front to move upwind across the plot when wind and moisture conditions were conducive for producing high burn temperatures and thorough combustion of stubble and weed seeds on the soil surface. Remaining weeds were controlled with some of the same tillage operations used in the RTWW system during the summer and fall as needed. A single fall or spring application of herbicide was used in the BWW system, as needed for additional weed control. In the no-till system (NTWW), weed control was accomplished solely with herbicides, which were applied three or four times per year. Costs were calculated using the average annual frequency of the field operations used during the experiment.\nAll field operation costs, with the exception of burning costs, were 2011 projected custom rates for Kansas (Dhuyvetter, 2011) . The cost of burning an acre of wheat stubble was initially set at $7.00/acre, near the midpoint of the range reported by Gee and Biermacher (2007) for rangeland burning of $3.98/acre for a large burn of 833 acres and $9.87/acre for a smaller burn of 172 acres.\nNitrogen and phosphorus sources and rates were the same in each system. Fertilizer costs are for 107 lbs of N from urea before planting in the fall and 72 lbs of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) at planting.\nGlyphosate is the predominant herbicide used in the no-tillage system. It comprises 60% of the total cost of all chemicals used in the NTWW system. The initial analysis used a price of $25.65 per gallon with 4.5 lbs of active ingredient per gallon, the average price reported by USDA (2010) for spring of 2010. Glyphosate prices have been quite variable over the last ten years, ranging from $25.65 to $50.06/gallon in the last 10 years for April prices (USDA, 2010) . This variability was considered in further analysis of yield, output price, and glyphosate cost variability."}, {"section_title": "Simulated Net Returns", "text": "Simulation and Econometrics to Analyze Risk (SIMETAR \u00a9 ) developed by Richardson, Schumann and Feldman (2004) was used to simulate yield, output price and glyphosate cost distributions and calculate distributions of net returns to land and management with 2011 costs. Net return distributions were constructed using equation 1.\nwhere NR ik = net return to land & management ($/acre) for observation i for crop production system k, i = observation, i = 1 to 1000, k = crop production system k, k = 1-3, Y ik = simulated yield (bu/acre) for observation i for crop production system k, EP i = simulated price ($/bu) for observation i, C k = preharvest production costs ($/acre) in production system k, excluding glyphosate, G ik = simulated glyphosate cost ($/acre) for observation i in production system k, and HC ik = harvest cost ($/acre) for yield observation i in production system k.\nCrop yields, wheat prices and glyphosate costs are stochastic, while all other costs are predetermined. Observations from a simulated correlated multivariate empirical yield distribution derived from actual historical yields was multiplied by observations from a simulated empirical wheat price distribution derived from actual historical prices to calculate gross returns for each production system. Simulated empirical glyphosate costs, other current-year production costs, and harvest costs were then subtracted from gross returns to obtain the net return.\nThe yield, price and glyphosate cost distributions were generated in the following manner: a cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) using the 10 years of yield data with the probability ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 was formed by ordering the data and assigning a cumulative probability for each observation. Ten years of annual average glyphosate prices were used for the glyphosate cost distribution. The same process was repeated using monthly prices from January 2006 through December 2010. This 60-month empirical price data was used to capture the variability and the general increase in wheat prices after 2005. Irwin and Good (2011) contend that there has been a structural shift upward in prices beginning in 2007.\nA monthly price series beginning in 2006 was used because monthly wheat prices in southcentral Kansas for 2006 were higher in every corresponding month than for the years 2001 through 2005 with the exception of January 2004 and 2005. Further, in 8 of the 12 months of 2006, the monthly prices were $1.00/bu. or higher than those in 2005. The analysis was also performed using a 2001 to 2005 monthly wheat price distribution. A summary of the price distribution characteristics is reported in Table 1 . Wheat prices were not allowed to fall below the 2011 commodity program loan rate. Commodity program payments were not considered because they do not impact the manager\"s production method decision.\nThe following explains the SIMETAR procedure used to generate the yield distributions. The empirical distribution shape is specified by the historical data used because too few observations exist to estimate parameters for another distribution (e.g., normal distribution). A cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) using the 10 years of yield data with probability ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 is constructed by ordering the data and assigning a cumulative probability for each observation (data point). Each observation is assumed to have an equal probability of occurring, so the additional probability for each sequential observation is equivalent. A simulated distribution of 1000 observations is generated by drawing 1000 values from a uniform standard deviate ranging in value from 0.0 to 1.0, similar to using the rand() function in a spreadsheet. The corresponding price or yield assigned to the distribution is from the cumulative probability represented by the uniform standard deviate value. If the value is 0.615, the price drawn would correspond to the 0.615 or 61.5% level of the cumulative distribution. If the value from the uniform standard deviate falls between the cumulative probabilities assigned the original data values, the yield is found by interpolation (Pendell et al., 2007) . The same procedure is used to generate the wheat price and glyphosate price distributions. A multivariate distribution has been shown to correlate random yields appropriately, based on their historical correlation (Richardson, Klose and Gray, 2000) . The multivariate distribution is a closed-form distribution, which eliminates the possibility of simulated values exceeding values observed in history (Ribera, Hons and Richardson, 2004) .\nCorrelation between yields was included in the simulated net returns. Yield correlations range from 0.74 to 0.94. T-tests and F-tests were used to test for significant differences between the simulated data and the actual data. The statistical tests indicate that there were no statistically significant differences between the mean and variances of the experimental yield data, historical prices and costs and the simulated yields, prices and costs."}, {"section_title": "Risk Analysis Methods", "text": "Stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) was used to determine the preferred strategy when risk is considered. SERF orders a set of risky alternatives in terms of certainty equivalents (CEs) and risk premiums (RPs) derived from the difference in CEs for a specified risk preference . The CE value is the amount of certain payoff an individual would require to be indifferent between that payoff and the payoff of the risky alternative. The difference between CE values at a specific risk aversion level is known as the risk premium and represents the minimum certain amount that would have to be paid to an individual in order for the individual to be willing to switch from the less risky alternative to the more risky alternative .\nThe calculation of the CE depends on the utility function specified. A negative exponential utility function used in the SERF analysis conforms to the hypothesis that managers prefer less risk to more given the same expected return. With a negative exponential utility function, an absolute risk aversion coefficient (RAC) defined by Pratt (1964) as, r a (w) = -u (w)/u (w) is used. This ratio of the derivatives of the decision-maker\"s utility function, u(w), was used to derive the CEs. This functional form assumes managers have constant absolute risk aversion. Under this assumption, managers view a risky strategy for a specific level of risk aversion the same without regard for their level of wealth. Babcock, Choi, and Feinerman (1993) note this functional form is often used to analyze farmers' decisions under risk. For additional justification for this functional form, refer to Schumann et al. (2004) , who demonstrate the negative exponential function can be used as a reasonable approximation of risk averting behavior.\nThe simulated net return data outcomes from each crop production system were sorted into cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) which were used in the SERF analysis. Once the strategies were ranked using the CE results, a utility-weighted risk premium (RP) was calculated ). This was accomplished by subtracting the CE of a less preferred strategy from the preferred strategy. The risk premiums and the resulting rankings are reported in the analysis in graphical form for a range of RACs from risk-neutral to extremely risk-averse. Decision-makers with RACs equal to zero are considered risk-neutral while managers with RACs greater than zero exhibit risk-averse behavior. Anderson and Dillon (1992) proposed a relative risk aversion coefficient (RRAC) definition of 0.0 as risk neutral and 4.0 as extremely risk averse. Thus, as suggested by Hardaker et al., 2004 the upper range of absolute RAC for use with a negative exponential utility function was calculated by dividing 4.0 by an appropriate level of wealth. In this case, the measure of wealth is the average per acre net worth of farms in south-central Kansas in 2009 of $507/acre (KFMA, 2010). Ribera, et al. (2004) and Pendell et al. (2007) provide other applications of the methodology."}, {"section_title": "Risk Analysis", "text": "The SERF analysis under the 2006-2010 monthly wheat price series indicates that NTWW was preferred to BWW at all levels of risk aversion. Although NTWW was preferred to BWW, the risk premiums were always less than $5.00 per acre up to an RAC of 0.0079 (Figure 1) . Figure  2 reports the probability of net return for each of the three strategies being less than $0.00/acre, between $0.00 and $100/acre and more than $100/acre. The figure shows NTWW system had a higher probability of returns above $0.00 (78%) and $100/acre (38%) than the other strategies. The RTWW system had the greatest probability of having a net return below $0.00/acre (33%). Under the 2001-2005 monthly price series, SERF analysis indicates the BWW strategy was preferred to the NTWW strategy up to an RAC of 0.0047 (Figure 3 ). According to Anderson and Dillon (1992) , this RAC would correspond to moderate risk-averse behavior. 2 SERF analysis with the 2006 through 2010 wheat price series was performed using the lowest and highest glyphosate price during the last 10 years of $25.65 and $50.06/gallon respectively. NTWW was preferred to BWW at all levels of risk aversion. Under the highest price of glyphosate, NTWW was preferred up to a RAC of 0.004. Under this scenario, the largest risk premium or the incentive needed to use NTWW instead of BWW was $3.16/acre. A price of $50.63/gallon was needed to make the NTWW system less preferred at all levels of risk aversion to BWW.\n2 Similar results were obtained with a power utility function for both wheat price series.
