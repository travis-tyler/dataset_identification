Subjects with nondiabetic renal disease were excluded. All subjects were Caucasian, except for one who was of Chinese ethnicity.\nGFR measurements utilizing 99m\nTc-DTPA plasma clearance (iGFR) were routinely performed (5,6) on all clinic attendees two to three times yearly, irrespective of renal function or albuminuria status.\nAt baseline, mean \u03ee SEM age of the 85 subjects (n \u03ed 85, 49 male) was 38.4 \u03ee 1.3 years (range 14 -72) and the mean \u03ee SEM disease duration was 13.7 \u03ee 1.1 years (range 0.2-48.6). On average, 5.6 iGFR measurements had been performed on each individual (range 2-11). The initial mean \u03ee SEM iGFR was 106.1 \u03ee 2.6 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , which declined to 90.4 \u03ee 3.4 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 after 10.1 \u03ee 0.3 years (range 3.0 -15.7) of follow-up. The initial iGFR was \u03fe120 in 27%, 90 -120 in 54%, and \u03fd90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in 19% of the subjects. From these 85 subjects, those with a rate of decline in iGFR \u03fe3.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year were defined as having a declining renal function (\"decliners,\" n \u03ed 19) based on longitudinal data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (7).\nSerum for creatinine and cystatin C was collected on the same morning as the corresponding iGFR measurement. Creatinine assays were determined by the Jaffe alkaline picrate method in the same laboratory, using a Parallel American Monitor (1987 Monitor ( -1993 , a Hitachi 747 instrument (1994 -1997) , or a Hitachi 917 automatic analyzer (1998 -2004) .

The intraand interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for serum creatinine were 2.3 and 6.7%, respectively, using the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Cystatin C was measured from stored serum samples in a single batch in 2004 using an automated particleenhancing immunonephelometric assay on a BN II instrument (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). The intra-and interassay CVs for cystatin C were 2.58 and 3.95%, respectively, at a concentration of 1.54 mg/l.\nThe following techniques were used to estimate GFR: creatinine was transformed to a GFR value (Cr-GFR) using the equation 10 4 /serum creatinine (mol/l). Cystatin C was transformed to a GFR equivalent using the equation Cys-GFR \u03ed (86.7/cystatin C concentration) \u03ea 4.2 (3). Standard formulas were used to derive GFR from Cockcroft-Gault formula (CG-GFR) (9) and MDRD equations (1). For each individual, the trends of GFR (\u232cGFR) were derived from linear regression from each method. The regression line for all except one subject with declining GFR was statistically significant (P \u03fd 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 14 statistical software.\nRESULTS -The baseline and final iGFR in the group of decliners (n \u03ed 19) was mean \u03ee SEM 105.1 \u03ee 7 and 51.6 \u03ee 7 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , respectively, compared with 106.3 \u03ee 3 and 101.5 \u03ee 3 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 in the nondecliners. Decliners had a greater baseline A1C than nondecliners (P \u03fd 0.05). The median baseline and final albumin excretion rates were18 and 150 g/min, respectively, in decliners and 9 and 10 g/min, respectively, in nondecliners. Thus, both baseline and final albumin excretion rate was higher in decliners than nondecliners (P \u03fd 0.02).\nThe mean \u232ciGFR in the 19 decliners was 6.5 (range 3.3-26.2) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year. All of the creatinine-based methods significantly underestimated the decline in iGFR, i.e., 4.2 for Cr-GFR (P \u03fd 0.01 vs. \u232ciGFR), 3.6 for CG-GFR (P \u03fd 0.01), 3.4 for MDRD-4 -GFR (P \u03fd 0.01), and 3.5 for MDRD-6 -GFR (P \u03fd 0.01). In contrast, there was no difference between rates of decline observed with iGFR and those observed with cystatin C, i.e., \u232cCys-GFR 6.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (Fig. 1) . The sensitivity and specificity for each of the four creatinine-based methods for identifying the 19 subjects with declining iGFR were 42 and 100%, respectively, compared with 84 and 100%, respectively, for Cys-GFR.\nCONCLUSIONS -This study demonstrates that estimates of renal function derived from serum cystatin C accurately portray long-term changes in GFR when compared with serial iGFR measurements in a cohort of subjects with type 1 diabetes with declining renal function. In contrast, creatinine-based estimates such as the Cockcroft-Gault formula and MDRD-4 and -6 variable equations and 1/creatinine significantly underestimated the decline in iGFR in this population.\nThus serial measurements of serum cystatin C may facilitate early identification of patients at risk of developing renal failure. Cystatin C has the potential to be employed more widely for monitoring of GFR, given its advantages of availability of a simple and accurate automated assay and the ability to directly use the reciprocal of cystatin C level as a GFR equivalent.
