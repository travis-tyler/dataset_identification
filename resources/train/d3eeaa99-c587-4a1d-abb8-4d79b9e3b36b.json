[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than twenty-five million people worldwide and is the most common form of dementia. Symptomatic treatments have been developed, but effective intervention to alter disease progression is needed. Targets have been identified for disease-modifying drugs, but the results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Peripheral biomarkers of disease state may improve clinical trial design and analysis, increasing the likelihood of successful drug development. Amyloid-related measures, presumably reflecting principal pathology of AD, are among the leading cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers, and measurement of plasma levels of amyloid peptides has been the focus of much investigation. In this review, we discuss recent data on plasma b-amyloid (Ab) and examine the issues that have arisen in establishing it as a reliable biomarker of AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "(APP). In the AD brain, Ab accumulation is considered to play a pivotal role in neuronal loss and cognitive impairment (Selkoe 1994) . Although APP exists throughout the body (Arai et al. 1991) , Ab is primarily produced in brain (Laird et al. 2005) , making cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) an obvious candidate for Ab detection. Levels of CSF Ab42 decline with AD progression, which may suggest neuronal loss and increasing Ab plaque development (Jensen et al. 1999; Andreasen and Blennow 2002) .\nGiven the somewhat invasive nature of CSF sampling, changes in Ab in plasma would be an attractive biomarker. As reviewed in detail recently (Hampel et al. 2011) , changes in CSF and plasma Ab may reflect a shift from soluble Ab species in the periphery with increased insoluble Ab plaque formation in the brain. In subjects with familial AD or Down syndrome (DS), plasma Ab rises sharply before dementia onset, perhaps reflecting increased Ab production (Scheuner et al. 1996; Tokuda et al. 1997; Younkin 1998; Ertekin-Taner et al. 2000 Coppus et al. 2011 ). In the case of DS, recent studies suggest that plasma Ab is less of a predictor of dementia, per se, but can predict cognitive function in adults with DS independently (Head et al. 2011) . Data from our group demonstrate that ratio of Ab42:40 rather than absolute levels of the peptides is important to the pathophysiology of AD in genetically susceptible populations (Matsuoka et al. 2009 ). More recently, in an Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) study (Toledo et al. 2011b) , we analyzed data from 715 ADNI subjects with baseline Ab40 and Ab42 plasma measurements (50% with 4 serial annual measurements) including: 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD (n = 162). We also integrated these analyses with all available ADNI data on PIB PET, MRI and tau, and Ab42 measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on these subjects.\nWe noted that the effect of age differed according to AD stage and that plasma Ab42 showed a mild correlation with other biomarkers of Ab pathology, but they also were associated with infarctions in MRI. However, longitudinal measurements of Ab40 and Ab42 plasma levels showed only modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Thus, these findings show that plasma Ab measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year followup period in this ADNI study. However, with longer followup, plasma Ab measurements within subjects could be developed into a minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD. However, there is clearly a need for further research into the biology and dynamics of Ab, as discussed below. There is also a need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Ab. Data collected thus far on plasma Ab in sporadic, familial AD and Down Syndrome are summarized in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Sources of plasma Ab", "text": "APP has been localized in several peripheral tissues and organs that express b-secretase (Arai et al. 1991; Sinha et al. 1999; Vassar et al. 1999) . Although these tissues are viable sources to plasma Ab, their contribution is likely to be nominal given the vastly greater amount of Ab produced in the brain (DeMattos et al. 2002; Cirrito and Holtzman 2003) . Furthermore, data suggest that Ab in brain can be cleared into the periphery through rapid receptor-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier (Shibata et al. 2000; DeMattos et al. 2002; Deane et al. 2003 Deane et al. , 2004a Deane et al. , 2004b . Increased levels of plasma Ab have been reported in AD mouse models (Kawarabayashi et al. 2001) or after treatment with binding agents (DeMattos et al. 2002; Deane et al. 2003; Matsuoka et al. 2003) . In AD patients, plasma Ab levels are elevated and mainly incorporated into lipoproteins and different plasma proteins (Biere et al. 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Variables that affect plasma Ab", "text": "In comparison to CSF, validation of plasma Ab as a predictor of dementia in sporadic or late-onset forms of AD has been more difficult to determine. Relationships have been found between plasma Ab40:42 to Ab42:40 and dementia, but the direction of these associations vary among studies (Fukumoto et al. 2003; Mayeux et al. 2003; Blasko et al. 2008; Lopez et al. 2008; Schupf et al. 2008; Toledo et al. 2011b ). More consistency has been found in the ratio of plasma Ab42:40, with non-demented patients usually having higher risk of AD with lower Ab42:40 ratios (Graff-Radford et al. 2007; Okereke et al. 2009 ). In terms of predicting whether patients with MCI will convert to AD, no consistent change in plasma Ab or ratio has been found (Fukumoto et al. 2003; Lopez et al. 2008; Toledo et al. 2011b) . However, studies demonstrate that age-related changes (increases) in plasma Ab and reduced Ab40:42 ratio are primarily restricted to MCI patients or individuals with worsening cognitive status (Toledo et al. 2011b) .\nSources of variability in findings from existing studies are potentially due to variability in subject age and/or with disease severity (Fukumoto et al. 2003; Giedraitis et al. 2007 ), but may also relate to study size; very few largescale studies have been attempted. A recently published study in a large cohort of elderly patients identified an association between low cognitive reserve and plasma Ab42:40, which accentuated the relationship between low plasma Ab42:40 and greater cognitive decline in nondemented participants (Yaffe et al. 2011 ). Below we discuss potential factors that may contribute to the variability seen in studies and what steps are still needed to identify the parameters for clinical utility of plasma Ab."}, {"section_title": "Impact of age on plasma Ab", "text": "Several studies suggest that the levels of Ab in plasma increase as a function of age in non-demented individuals (Matsubara et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2003; Mayeux et al. 2003) . Although the mechanisms underlying this change are not confirmed, data from rodent studies implicate age-related reduction hepatic clearance of Ab, due to alterations in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) (Tamaki et al. 2006) . Studies in humans implicate the renal system and have found strong relationships between plasma Ab and creatinine (Cr) levels (Arvanitakis et al. 2002 )."}, {"section_title": "Concurrent disease states", "text": "To different degrees, aged populations are characterized by multiple health concerns. Although the etiology of AD has not been demonstrated to be vascular origin, plasma Ab level changes have been linked to neurovascular disease. A growing body of evidence suggests an association between vascular risk factors and AD, with neurovascular disease hypothesized to be an exacerbating factor of AD neuropathology (Girouard and Iadecola 2006) . Indeed, in another recent ADNI study (Toledo et al. 2011a) , we examined the relationship between vascular risk factors (VRF) and Ab brain burden measured by Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) PET studies. Briefly, 99 subjects had a PIB PET study and had information available on VRF (body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting glucose) in the ADNI cohort, while 81 subjects also had plasma cortisol, brain natriuretic peptide, leptin, c-reactive protein and superoxide dismutase-1 measurements. All subjects also had APOE genotyping. We used these data in a regression stepwise model to assess the relation between the VRF and the composite PIB PET score. The final model included baseline age, clinical diagnosis, number of APO e4 alleles, body mass index (BMI) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as variables. BMI showed an inverse relation with PIB PET score, and DBP had a positive relation with PIB PET score. In a second adjusted model, plasma cortisol levels also were associated with PIB PET score, but there was no association of systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, or impaired fasting glucose with PIB PET values. Thus, based on these data there appears to be an association between PIB PET measures and DBP as well as cortisol, thereby suggesting a possible link between these two VRF and deposits of Ab in brain. In terms of plasma Ab, although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm, current data suggest that subjects with AD, MCI, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or ischemia, levels of plasma Ab40 may be a viable biomarker of cerebrovascular damage (Lee et al. 2005; Gurol et al. 2006 ). In addition to vascular conditions, studies have focused on how plasma Ab levels can be influenced by known covariates of AD, such as clearance of Cr. As both Cr and Ab are cleared through the kidney, elevated levels of Cr are considered indicative of renal insufficiency. Indeed, data suggest direct relationships between renal function and plasma Ab (Arvanitakis et al. 2002) . Another important covariate of AD that may influence plasma Ab levels is homocysteine, whose levels have been correlated with cognitive decline in AD and conversion of MCI to AD (Tucker et al. 2005; Blasko et al. 2008 )."}, {"section_title": "Methodological concerns", "text": "Compared to CSF Ab levels, the levels of plasma Ab42 are very low, which has complicated studies due to the propensity for subjects to fall below the linear range of detection on many platforms. Levels of Ab40 in plasma are much higher, but data are still mixed regarding the direction of change with advancing disease. A potential factor in this variability may lie with the variety of ELISA and flourometric bioassay platforms available. Sensitivity and specificity of the platforms used are highly reliant on the antibodies used, which can vary. There are also several ELISA systems and protocols that have been used in clinical studies, which make data comparison difficult. Interestingly, recent studies investigating multiple assay protocols for plasma Ab in different laboratories found very good reproducibility of values (Okereke et al. 2009 ). While this has not necessarily been the case for CSF measures (Mattsson et al. 2011 ), a recent ADNI roundrobin study of CSF tau and Ab showed very good inter-lab reproducibility (Shaw et al. 2011 ). In addition to issues arising as a result of assays, Ab in both CSF and plasma is typically complexed to a variety of binding proteins, which may complicate detection (Biere et al. 1996; Koudinov et al. 1998 ). For example, Ab is hydrophobic and binds to certain test tube walls as well as to several plasma proteins, including albumin and lowdensity lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (Matsubara et al. 1999; Hampel et al. 2011) . Further, since measurement of soluble Ab is done with assays that are independent of aggregation state, both plasma protein binding and oligomerisation could mask the detection of Ab in plasma or CSF measured by these assays, which may explain contradictory results.\nVariability in samples is also an issue, with reports suggesting that fluctuations of Ab levels in CSF are dependent on the time of day and subject activity level (Bateman et al. 2007) . Whether this is the case for plasma Ab has yet to be conclusively determined. Data from AD rodent models are in concert with that seen in humans, with Ab in brain being acutely impacted by environmental stimuli could significantly affect brain Ab level (Kang et al. 2007 ). Other data from animal models suggest that time after eating can significantly affect plasma Ab level. Recent data suggest that plasma Ab in a fed state was significantly higher than that in a fasted state (Takeda et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Though controversy remains, there is a consensus that a pivotal and presumably initiating process in sporadic and genetically determined AD is the accumulation of toxic Ab species in brain. Biomarkers reflecting this accumulation are thus likely to be important in the selection of individuals for AD prevention and treatment trials and monitoring the effects of anti-amyloid interventions. Indeed, among the most exciting developments in AD therapeutic research is the development of amyloid PET imaging and CSF Ab42 measurement as indicators of brain amyloid. If antiAb therapies become available, it is likely that treatment will be guided by biomarkers of brain Ab.\nUnfortunately, amyloid PET scanning is expensive and not yet generally available, and lumbar puncture is somewhat invasive. A peripheral blood biomarker would offer substantial advantages over these approaches, allowing readily acceptable screening and monitoring. While it is known that there is communication between the peripheral and central Ab pools (via receptor mediated as well as passive mechanisms), the utility of plasma Ab measurements has remained limited. While some studies have shown correlations between plasma Ab and dementia risk and/or progression, such findings have been inconsistent. Biological and methodological issues likely contribute to these limitations, thereby underlining the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma Ab as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Ab.\nAs discussed, plasma Ab increases sharply before dementia onset, perhaps reflecting increased Ab production in subjects with familial AD or Down syndrome (Scheuner et al. 1996; Tokuda et al. 1997; Ertekin-Taner et al. 2008) . The same has not been found in sporadic or late-onset forms of AD. Although relationships have been found with plasma Ab40 or 42 and dementia, the direction of these associations is variable. A recent study of plasma Ab42 in normal, mildly impaired, and mildly demented cohorts is discouraging and yet provides some reason for optimism (Toledo et al. 2011b ). Overall, plasma Ab measurements were not useful in distinguishing among the cohorts, and showed minimal association with disease progression. At present, this study and that reported previously support the idea that plasma Ab assays are not useful for diagnosis or prediction of decline. However, a significant association between plasma Ab42 and brain amyloid was found, as indicated by CSF Ab42, while the ADNI study reported mild correlation of plasma Ab42 and other biomarkers of Ab pathology, but they also were associated with infarcts detected by MRI (Toledo et al. 2011b ).\nAs we discuss, sources of variability in plasma Ab studies may be due to difficulty in consistency of subject Plasma Ab as Biomarker of AD 847 age, disease severity. Recent data also suggest that technical precision may also be involved. Using a robotized method for specific steps allowed for a large improvement in consistency over results reported in the literature, and several significant relationships between plasma and CSF biomarkers were found (Figurski et al. 2012) . Although these correlations are still not strong enough to support use of plasma Ab as a diagnostic screening test, the data suggest that plasma Ab42 is well suited for use as a pharmacodynamic marker.\nAs opposed to studies examining levels of peptide alone, reports on ratio of plasma plasma Ab42:40, have had more consistent results, with lower Ab42:40 ratios predicting higher risk of AD (Graff-Radford et al. 2007; Okereke et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, a large cohort study of elderly patients found that low cognitive reserve and plasma Ab42:40, which accentuated the relationship between low plasma Ab42:40 and greater cognitive decline in nondemented participants (Yaffe et al. 2011) .\nWith improvements of assay conditions (e.g., with increasing sensitivity and reproducibility, and standardization of specimen handling to minimize interactions with other blood constituents and collection materials), and if the confounding effects of factors such as age and renal function are fully considered, it may be reasonable to expect that such measurements may become useful biomarkers of brain amyloidosis. This, in turn, could greatly facilitate the development and clinical application of disease-modifying therapies for AD. Improvements in the reproducibility of plasma Ab42 and Ab40 measurement support the utility of this biomarker test as a pharmacodynamic marker that reflects drug effect on Ab processing.\nincreased imminent risk for mild cognitive impairment and"}]
