It is coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and developed by participating countries with the support of the OECD. Between 2011 and 2015, PIAAC surveyed a nationally representative sample of adults between the ages of 16 and 65 in 33 countries and regions. 1 The survey focused on cognitive skills in three domains: literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. In addition, it collected data about educational background, family background, health and skill use on the job and outside of work. See appendix A for more technical information about the assessment. PIAAC results showed that U.S. adults (age 16 to 65) were not, on average, among the highest performers in any of the domains when compared internationally, and that U.S. young adults (age 16 to 34) performed particularly poorly compared to their international peers (OECD, 2013;Goodman et al., 2015). The average score of U.S. young adults in numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments was below the international average (of participating countries), though not measurably different from the international average in literacy. Compared with young adults in other participating countries, the United States scored lower, on average, than 12 countries in literacy, 21 countries in numeracy, and 17 countries in problem solving in technology-rich environments (table 1). It is important to take a closer look at the relatively poor performance of U.S. young adults as well as how their skills relate to the pathways they take from high school into the labor force. To assist researchers interested in examining the transition of young adults into the labor force, this report introduces a new U.S. PIAAC student-and-employment status variable, explains how this new variable was developed, and provides a first look at the results for U.S. young adults analyzed using this variable to classify by student and employment status."}, {"section_title": "About this report", "text": "This report is intended primarily for researchers using PIAAC data to investigate policy issues related to young adults and their transition into the labor force. The content of this report is primarily methodological and assumes that the reader has an understanding of basic statistical analysis. However, recognizing both that policymakers may also be interested in the findings that are possible with this new variable, and that the PIAAC International Data Explorer makes data analysis possible online for the general public, we have sought to keep the discussion accessible to these audiences and to provide a short review of the basic patterns of performance that emerge when using this new variable. Results in this report are presented: (1) as average scale scores (estimated on a 0-500 scale) in the three domains of literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments, and (2) as percentages of young adults reaching the proficiency levels established for each of these domains. There are five proficiency levels for literacy and numeracy (below Level 1, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4/5) and four levels for problem solving in technology-rich environments (below Level 1, Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). This report combines the top two proficiency levels (Levels 4 and 5) for the literacy and numeracy scales, following the OECD's reporting convention (OECD, 2013), because across all participating countries, no more than 2 percent of adults reached Level 5. As in all NCES reports, any reported difference in this report is based on statistical testing. All statistically significant differences described in this report are significant at the .05 level. No statistical adjustments to account for multiple comparisons have been used. Differences that are statistically significant are discussed using comparative terms such as \"higher\" and \"lower.\" Differences that are not statistically significant are either not discussed or referred to as \"not measurably different\" or \"not statistically significant.\" In this case, failure to find a difference as statistically significant does not necessarily mean that there was no difference. It could be that a real difference cannot be detected by the significance test because of a small sample size or an imprecise measurement in the sample. If the statistical test is significant, it means that there is convincing evidence (though no guarantee) of a real difference in the population. However, it is important to remember that statistically significant results do not necessarily identify those findings that have policy significance or practical importance. (See appendix A for more details on statistical testing.) This report provides findings for only a few select results; more PIAAC results can be generated with U.S. PIAAC data in the NCES International Data Explorer (IDE) at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/ide/. Additional PIAAC results and resources are available from the NCES PIAAC website, at https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/."}, {"section_title": "The challenge of studying young adults", "text": "Researchers who wish to use PIAAC data to analyze the transition of young adults into the labor force face a challenge identifying and choosing variables to use in the PIAAC dataset. There are several variables for employment and education status that would seem appropriate to identify different stages of transition into the labor force of young adults (exhibit 1). However, as they are separate variables, any analysis that calls for a detailed look at the status of young adults both in and out of the labor force, taking into consideration their education status, requires considering how to combine variables into meaningful analytical categories. This is not a simple matter and requires understanding the differences between these variables. For example, the three variables that identify employment status differ in fundamental ways (see exhibit 1 -upper panel). The most obvious variable to use to look at employment status is CQ07, which captures respondents' answers when asked to select one of ten categories (e.g., full-time employed, part-time employed, unemployed, student, permanently disabled, etc.) that \"best describes your current situation.\" However, the PIAAC system-derived variable CD05 is most widely used to identify employment status, as it matches the International Labor Organization's (ILO) definition for the currently active population based on a reference period of one week. 2 The third variable that can be used, EMP6CAT, indicates both employment status and intensity of work by combining the categories from CD05 with self-reported information on the number of hours worked in the last week (DQ10). Using the information on hours worked allows one to determine full-versus part-time employment in a consistent manner for all respondents. The data from CQ07 in contrast, based on personal judgment, do not offer this consistency and often differ from the strict categorization of the ILO's definition of currently active population (see appendix B for details). Likewise, the three variables that identify education status also have important differences (see exhibit 1 -lower panel). Variable BQ02A captures whether a person is currently in any formal education program. The other two variables measure formal program participation in the last 12 months for the whole population (FE12) and for the population excluding youth 16 to 24 years of age in their initial cycle of studies (FAET12). Exhibit 1. Yet even knowing the differences between these variables, there are multiple possible permutations for combining employment and education variables to create meaningful analytical categories with which to identify different stages of transition into the labor force for young adults. The simplest and most straightforward is to cross CD05 by the \"currently studying\" variable BQ02A. However, this combination will result in having students in every category of employment status and vice versa (see table 2). This combination has been used by the OECD Skills Outlook 2015 (p. 81) to identify \"disengaged\" young adults who presently are neither in education nor employed (sometimes referred to as \"NEETs\"), classifying those that are unemployed and out of the labor force (CD05) and not currently studying (BQ02A) as NEETs. This combination's category of neither in education nor employed provides a reasonable way to identify NEETs, but some of the other resulting categories (e.g., employed students, unemployed students, students out of the labor force, etc.) are arguably not analytically distinct (or informative) stages of transition into the labor force."}, {"section_title": "Employment and education variables in PIAAC", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TABLE 2.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Percentage of U.S. adults age 16 to 34 assessed in PIAAC, by current status/work history-employment status (derived) (CD05) and education-currently studying (BQ02A): 2012 and 2014", "text": "Employment status A variation on the OECD approach (2015) produced the derived variable EDWORK (in the PIAAC dataset), which modifies the simple cross of CD05 by BQ02A with information about participation during the last 12 months in formal education, and also in non-formal adult education/training (variables FE12 and NFE123). EDWORK provides six categories of young adults: those in education only; in education and working (either full-or part-time); working only (either full-or part-time); not in education or working but have participated in formal or non-formal training in the last 12 months; and those not in education or working and who have not participated in formal or non-formal training in the last 12 months. (This last category is used to create the variable named NEET in the PIAAC dataset4). EDWORK allows researchers to identify analytically distinct stages of the transition into the labor force from a perspective that prioritizes education and training, but is of less value when needing to focus on the transition into the labor force from a labor market perspective. EDWORK makes no distinction between being actively engaged in formal education at present versus only having participated once in the last 12 months. It also treats participating in non-formal education equally with formal education. Thus, some argue that the PIAAC variable NEET is a narrow or \"restrictive definition, because some respondents have participated in training in the 12 months prior to the survey, but have been inactive for a number of months before the survey\" and they are excluded from the cases identified as NEETs (OECD, 2015, p. 80). Furthermore, NEET does not allow one to distinguish between young adults who are looking for employment and those who are not, and a good case can be made that young adults who are looking for employment (unemployed) may require different interventions than those who are not active in the labor force (out of the labor force). Therefore, combining these two categories may present challenges in creating targeted policy interventions."}, {"section_title": "Out of the", "text": "In addition to these various issues, both of these approaches for combining employment and education variables are also problematic for another reason. The simple dichotomy between student and non-student ignores the body of research emerging on the relationship between education, intensity of work, and/or cognitive outcomes. This research calls into question the traditional assumption that students who work should be considered lesser (or less focused) students than those who do not work. For example, Dundes and Marx (2006) conclude that, based on their sample of undergraduate students, working a moderate number of hours helps youth in post-school labor market outcomes without compromising school achievement. Quintini (2015, p. 17) reports \"no sizeable differences in proficiency [are observed] based on hours worked, after controlling for individual characteristics, education level and type of work and study experience\" for youth 16 to 29 years of age. In sum, the task of selecting variables and deciding how to combine them to analyze the transition of young adults into the labor force requires a researcher to wade through an extensive set of questions and choices to determine (a) how to create (and justify) analytical categories or (b) whether to use the variables available in the PIAAC dataset. To simplify this process for those interested in examining the transition of young adults into the labor force from a labor market perspective, NCES has developed a new variable, presented in this report, that addresses these challenges and uses categories that are more policy relevant and more intuitive to understand than existing choices."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Student and Employment Status Variable", "text": "NCES has created the student and employment status variable to allow policymakers and others interested in issues related to young adults transitioning into the labor force to analyze PIAAC data simply and efficiently. This variable distinguishes young adults who are primarily students from those who are primarily workers, as well as those who are not students and are unemployed or out of the labor force (exhibit 2). Although the intensity of the formal education status (i.e., full-or part-time study) was not specifically collected in PIAAC, all young adults who are studying and not in the labor force full-time are assumed to be focusing on their studies and are therefore categorized as primarily students in their transition. Meanwhile, young adults who are employed full-time, regardless of their educational status, and those who are employed part-time, but not currently studying, are both assumed to have begun developing careers and are therefore categorized as primarily workers in their transition. These categories permit analyses of \"engaged\" young adults who are continuing their education or who have joined the labor force. The student and employment status variable also allows researchers to distinguish between young adults who are primarily workers with full-time jobs versus those with part-time jobs. The last two categories of non-students, unemployed and out of the labor force, can be combined to analyze the concept of NEETs 5 , or they can be used separately to examine in a more nuanced way (than the concept of NEETs permits) the different levels of engagement (or lack of engagement) with the labor market. Exhibit 2. The classification scheme used to create the student and employment status variable relies on data from three variables, which classify young adults according to the criteria listed in exhibit 3. Specifically, the student and employment status variable is based on CD05 and DQ10 (combined into EMP6CAT) and BQ02A, so it,"}, {"section_title": "Student and employment status variable categories for U.S. adults age 16 to 34", "text": "\u2022 aligns with the ILO's definition and official PIAAC reports of employment, and \u2022 restricts the category of \"students\" to young adults currently enrolled in formal education. The latter restriction makes for a more conservative than expansive construction of \"student,\" but this definition aligns with common assumptions of what \"student\" means. (In contrast, EDWORK 's corresponding category of young adults \"in education only\" includes individuals who took a formal or non-formal course once within the past 12 months and excludes young adults enrolled in a formal education program who are employed part-time.) The construction of this variable distinguishes between the young adult population who are most involved in skill-use and skill-producing activities (i.e., students and those employed full-time), and those who are not (i.e., non-students who either work part-time, are unemployed, or are out of the labor force). This distinction rests in part on the strong link established between formal education and skills across all age groups (Goodman et al., 2015;OECD, 2015). Average scores for the student and employment subgroups across PIAAC's three assessed domains (literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments) validate this variable's classification scheme (see table 3). Students scored higher, on average, in all three domains than non-students across all the employment status categories. And both students and non-students who were employed full-time scored higher, on average, than nonstudents in the other employment status categories. (See appendix B for more information about the construction of the student and employment status variable.) Exhibit 3.  The new student and employment status variable permits analyses to address questions that are difficult or impossible to address without this classification scheme. These include questions about,"}, {"section_title": "Criteria for student and employment variable categorization", "text": "\u2022 the differences between NEETs who are unemployed versus NEETs who are out of the labor force; \u2022 the extent of remedial education and job training required by and provided for full-time, part-time, or unemployed young adults; \u2022 how efficient the market is at employing the most skilled young adults; and \u2022 the scope of skill mismatch among young adults in different stages of transition to the labor force. This variable can also be applied to compare young adults' transition into the labor force internationally to get insight into the effects of specific features of labor markets in different countries (e.g., the impact of apprenticeships in Germany). For more information on how the variable can be created for other countries see coding in appendix B. There are, however, some important limitations of this variable to keep in mind when analyzing young adults with PIAAC 2012/14 data. First, sample sizes across the categories are not uniform. For example, the category out of the labor force has only 327 cases, which is not sufficient to support an in-depth analysis of, for example, race/ethnicity by education attainment for just young adults in this category. However, the categories of student and full-time employed, with 1,287 and 1,490 cases, respectively, can support such an analysis. Thus, the same depth of analysis is not always possible across all categories (see appendix B for the sample sizes for all categories). Second, in order to have sufficient sample sizes for analyses, young adults are typically defined as 16 to 34 years old. However, the populations of young adults age 16 to 24 and age 25 to 34 may be at different stages in their transition into the labor force. To give a sense of the differences between these two groups, this report includes the breakouts in table 3 to show the percentage distribution and average scale scores across the age group of 16 to 34 in comparison with both the age groups 16 to 24, and 24 to 34 for all the employment status categories by whether or not they were currently studying for a formal degree or certificate. Table 3 shows a markedly different pattern between these two age groups in regards to \"currently studying\" for a formal degree or certificate among those classified as employed part-time, unemployed, and out of the labor force. For all three of these employment categories, a larger percentage of young adults in the age group 16 to 24 than in the age group 24 to 34 were currently studying. In contrast, there was relatively little difference between these two age groups in regards to \"currently studying\" among those classified as employed full-time. The great majority of full-time employed young adults in both the age groups 16 to 24 and 24 to 34 were not currently studying for a formal degree or certificate (76 and 85 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "A First Look at U.S. PIAAC Data With the Student and Employment Status Variable", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Statistical profile of U.S. young adults and their performance by student and employment status", "text": "Looking at young adults age 16 to 34 in the United States with the student and employment status variable, one finds nearly 78 percent were either students or employed full-time, with 30 percent of young adults classified as students, and nearly one-half (48 percent) classified as employed full-time (figure 1). As previously discussed, however, age was an important factor that influenced these percentage distributions. Among those 16-to 34-year-olds, the young adults age 16 to 24 comprised the majority (84 percent) of those in the student category, while those age 25 to 34 made up the majority (73 percent) of the full-time employed category (figure 2).6 FIGURE 1.

The first is the extent of the problem of \"disconnected youth\"-segments of the young adult population that are not engaged in education or the workforce, in this case, the combined categories of unemployed and out of the labor force young adults (OECD, 2013; U.S. Department of Education, 2015; Ross & Svajlenka, 2016). While those not engaged in formal education or employed represent a smaller percentage of young adults than those who are students or employed full-time (12 percent unemployed or out of the labor force versus 78 percent in full-time employed or student, as shown in figure 1), they are nonetheless a sizable absolute number of the young adult population in the United States. PIAAC 2012/14 data indicate about 4 million young adults ages 16 to 24 fall into this category of \"disconnected youth,\" with 9 million in this category when one looks at all young adults ages 16 to 34. The second critical issue is that young adults who are not studying but are currently looking for work (i.e., unemployed, non-student) have significantly lower skills in numeracy than those who are not studying and not looking for work (i.e., out of the labor force, non-student). In fact, those who are not studying but are looking for work have the highest percentages in the lowest proficiency levels in numeracy. This finding may reflect the efficiency of the education system and the labor market, as it suggests that they both are recruiting young adults most skilled in numeracy. However, this finding also indicates a potential mismatch in skills between education and training and the work requirements of the labor market, as well as the need for training of those actively wanting to be a part of the labor force."}, {"section_title": "Explore this variable further", "text": "Researchers interested in exploring further aspects of the transition of young adults into the labor force can find PIAAC results, information about the assessment, data, and data tools on the NCES website.

The design collects information that can be used to analyze the relationship between the measured competencies, PIAAC behavioral measures, and social/economic measures obtained from the responses to the background questions and the job requirements approach module of the assessment. PIAAC was designed as a computer-based assessment. Respondents who had little or no familiarity with computers, however, were directed to a paper-and-pencil version of the assessment that tested skills in the domains of literacy and numeracy only. Approximately 15 percent of the respondents in the Main Study and 23 percent in the National Supplement were directed to the paper-andpencil path. Regardless of whether they took the assessment in the computer or paper-and-pencil format, all respondents first took a \"Core\" test to determine their capacity to undertake the full assessment. Those who were unsuccessful at the Core test were directed to the assessment of reading components, which is all they were asked to complete. Those who succeeded at the Core test proceeded to the full assessment. See chapter 2 in the U.S. PIAAC Main Study and National Supplement Technical Report for details on the national survey design, and the development of instruments and the background questionnaire. "}, {"section_title": "Scales Scores and Proficiency Levels", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sampling", "text": "For PIAAC, the U.S. household sample was selected on the basis of a four-stage, stratified area sample: (1) primary sampling units (PSUs) consisting of counties or groups of contiguous counties; (2) secondary sampling units (referred to as segments) consisting of area blocks; (3) housing units containing households; and (4) eligible persons within households. For both the Main Study and the National Supplement household sample, person-level data were collected through a screener, a background questionnaire, and the assessment. The screener instrument was conducted using a computer-assisted personal interviewing system and collected information that included the age and gender of all household members. It determined which household member or members was/were eligible for the study and selected the sample person(s). Of the 26,003 sampled housing units in the combined Main Study and National Supplement household sample, 3,500 were either vacant or not a housing unit, resulting in a sample of 22,503 households. A total of 9,460 households had at least one eligible adult and completed the screener (more than one adult per household could be selected to complete the questionnaire), which was used to select survey respondents. The final screener response rate was 84.7 percent weighted (note that all response rates referenced in this section were computed using base weights for the combined sample). Based on the screener data, 10,668 respondents age 16 to 74 were selected to complete the background questionnaire and the assessment; 8,488 actually completed the background questionnaire. Of the 2,180 respondents who did not complete the background questionnaire, 182 were unable to do so because of a literacy-related barrier: either the inability to communicate in English or Spanish (the two languages in which the background questionnaire was administered), a reading or writing difficulty, or a mental disability. The final PIAAC 2012/2014 response rate for the background questionnaire was 80.9 percent weighted. The numerator of the response rate included respondents who completed the background questionnaire and respondents who were unable to complete it because of a literacy-related barrier. Of the 8,488 adults age 16 to 74 who completed the background questionnaire, 8,341 completed the adult literacy assessment. An additional 26 were unable to complete the assessment for literacy-related reasons. The final PIAAC 2012/2014 response rate for the overall assessment was 98.8 percent weighted. The numerator of the response rate included respondents who answered at least one question on each scale and the 26 respondents who were unable to do so because of a language problem or mental disability. The overall weighted response rate for the PIAAC 2012/2014 household sample was 67.8 percent. The final U.S. household reporting sample for PIAAC 2012/2014-including the literacy-related nonrespondents to the background questionnaire-consisted of 8,670 respondents. These 8,670 respondents included the 8,490 respondents who completed the background questionnaire, plus the 180 respondents who were unable to complete the background questionnaire for literacyrelated reasons. Of the 8,490 respondents who completed the background questionnaire, 7,760 were age 16 to 65 and 730 were age 66 to 74. The sample was subject to unit nonresponse from the screener, background questionnaire, assessment (including reading components), and item nonresponse to background questionnaire items. The screener and background questionnaire stages had unit response rates below 85 percent and thus required an analysis of the potential for nonresponse bias according to NCES statistical standards. See chapter 3 in the U.S. PIAAC Main Study and National Supplement Technical Report for complete details on the sample design. "}, {"section_title": "Nonresponse Bias", "text": "The nonresponse bias analysis of the household sample revealed differences in the characteristics of respondents who participated in the background questionnaire compared with those who refused. In a bivariate unit-level analysis at the background questionnaire stage, estimated percentages for respondents were compared with those for the total eligible sample to identify any potential bias owing to nonresponse. Multivariate analyses were conducted to further explore the potential for nonresponse bias by identifying the domains with the most differential response rates. The three samples (Main Study, National Supplement area sample, and National Supplement list sample) were analyzed separately to inform the separate nonresponse weighting adjustments for each sample. For the Main Study, these analyses revealed that the subgroup with the lowest response rates for the background questionnaire had the following characteristics: (1) Hispanic, (2) age 26 and older with no children in the household, and (3) reside outside the Northeastern United States in areas with low levels of linguistic isolation (a low percentage who have some difficulty speaking English) and with unemployment rates exceeding approximately 5 percent. For the National Supplement area sample, the lowest response rates to the background questionnaire were for persons with the following characteristics: (1) age 25 to 34 or older than 55, (2) sampled as not unemployed (age 16 to 34) or older (age 66 to 74), (3) no children in the household, (4) reside in the Northeastern United States in a census tract with an employment rate exceeding approximately For the National Supplement list sample, the subgroup with the lowest background questionnaire response rates corresponded to the following: (1) female with no children in the household, (2) reside in a Metropolitan Statistical Area in the Western or Northeastern United States, and (3) reside in a census tract in which less than approximately 29 percent of the population has a high school education. In general, persons with children in the household were found to be more likely to participate, as were persons in areas with a high percentage of the population below 150 percent of poverty. However, the variables found to be significant in the multivariate analysis-those used to define areas with low response rates-were used in weighting adjustments in an effort to reduce bias.

Using the computerized interview and assessment software provided by the PIAAC Consortium, 1 the interviewer read the background questionnaire questions from a laptop and entered all responses directly into the laptop. Skip patterns and follow-up probes for contradictory or out-of-range responses were programmed into the interview software. At the completion of the background questionnaire, the participant was administered the computer-based Core test or the paper-and-pencil based Core test if the participant could not or would not use the computer. Upon the completion and scoring of the Core tasks, the respondent was routed to the computer-based assessment (CBA), the paper-based assessment (PBA) of literacy and numeracy, or the paper-based reading components. The background questionnaire and the assessment took approximately 2 hours to complete, however the time varied by the respondent. The number of assessment items also varied based on the respondents' performance on the Core test and the adaptive routing implemented in the automated portion of the assessment. Progress through the assessment was controlled by the computer based on the respondent's performance on various components of the assessment. The PIAAC assessment was composed of the following components: \u2022 The Core consisted of three modules: the CBA Core Stage 1, the CBA Core Stage 2, and the PBA Core. \u00a2 The CBA Core Stage 1 included six tasks and was designed to determine whether the participant had the basic set of ICT skills needed to complete the computerbased assessment.

CBA Core Stage 1 questions were automatically scored by the computer, and a participant who passed the CBA Core Stage 1 continued on to the CBA Core \u00a2 The PBA Core consisted of eight tasks and measured basic literacy and numeracy skills necessary to undertake the assessment.

The scores for respondents that had no computer experience, failed the ICT skills test, or refused the CBA did not contribute to the estimation of the item parameters for the problem solving in technology-rich environments (PS-TRE) domain.

The properties of a sample selected through a complex design could be very different from those of a simple random sample in which every individual in the target population has an equal chance of selection and in which the observations from different sampled individuals can be considered statistically independent of one another. Therefore, the properties of the sample for the complex data collection design were taken into account during the analysis of the data. One way of addressing the properties of the sample design was by using sampling weights to combine the Main Study and National Supplement household samples through a compositing procedure and account for the fact that the probabilities of selection were not identical for all respondents. For the household sample, the sampling weights were further adjusted for nonresponse to the screener and background questionnaire, extreme weights were trimmed, and weights for all respondents calibrated to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey population totals for those age 16 to 74. Since literacy-related nonrespondents to the screener, the background questionnaire, and the assessment are similar in proficiency, the weights of the literacy-related nonresponse cases were not adjusted during the screener-level nonresponse adjustment. Instead, the background questionnaire weights for the background questionnaire and assessment literacy-related cases were adjusted to account for the literacy-related screener nonrespondents. This adjustment was necessary primarily to allow the literacy-related background questionnaire and assessment nonrespondents to represent the literacy-related screener nonrespondents in the calibration procedure. All population and subpopulation characteristics based on the PIAAC data used sampling weights in their estimation. The statistics presented in this report are estimates of group and subgroup performance based on a sample of respondents, rather than the values that could be calculated if every person in the nation answered every question on the instrument. Therefore, it is important to have measures of the degree of uncertainty of the estimates. Accordingly, in addition to providing estimates of percentages of respondents and their average scale scores, this report provides information about the uncertainty of each statistic in the form of standard errors on the U.S. PIAAC website at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ piaac/results/summary.aspx. Because the assessment used clustered sampling, conventional formulas for estimating sampling variability (e.g., standard errors) that assume simple random sampling and hence independence of observations would have been inappropriate for this report. For this reason, the PIAAC assessment used a paired jackknife replication approach (sometimes referred to as JK2) to estimate standard errors (Rust & Rao, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Testing", "text": "The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic.

In order to provide clear results for a wide audience, it was determined that the time frame reference for both a person's educational and employment status should be the same.

This may differ from the stricter system-derived current employment status variable (CD05), commonly used to define employment status in NCES and OECD reports. The system-derived current employment status (CD05) bases its derivation on the International Labor Organization's (ILO) definition of currently active population (with a reference period of one week). The variable (CD05) is derived using respondents' answers to five questions in the beginning of the labor force status section of the background questionnaire. The \"employed\" category consist of those who participated in paid employment or were self-employed. The \"unemployed\" category consists of those who were without work, were currently available for work, and were seeking work. 1 The \"out of the labor force\" category consists of those who were without work and were not seeking work. Meanwhile, in the CQ07 variable the respondents are asked to mark one of the statements best describing one's current situation; if more than one statement is applicable, the respondents are asked to indicate the statement that best describe how they see themselves. The self-perception of the main activity (CQ07) differs from results for the system-derived current employment variable (CD05), at times significantly (see table B-2). For example, 101 cases of young adults who see themselves as \"unemployed\" actually reported participating in activities to meet the PIAAC-ILO definition of currently employed. Conversely, 137 cases of young adults who report themselves as \"unemployed\" were classified as out of the labor force by the PIAAC-ILO definition based on the activities they participate in.

EDWORK categories distinguish between those who are currently studying and not working; currently studying and working; and not currently studying, but are working. The variable also has two categories that include information on non-formal education activities in the last 12 months for those who are neither studying nor working in the present: not in education or work but has participated in education or training in last 12 months; not in education or work and has not participated in education or training in last 12 months (NEET).
