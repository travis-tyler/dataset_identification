[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Between 1990 and 1999, the population of Brunswick County grew about 40 percent to more than 71,200 people (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000), making it one of the fastest growing counties in North Carolina. This figure does not include the thousands of tourists who visit the County's beaches each summer. Increased growth in the permanent population as well as in the tourist population have caused stress on the County's water resources. A recent study of aquifer susceptibility (Heath, 1997) emphasized the need for additional information on Brunswick County's ground-water resources. Brunswick County planners recognize the importance of good, potable water and have stated that \"the County's ground-water resources are an invaluable source of public and private potable water and shall receive the highest level of protection\" (Brunswick County Land Use Plan, 1997). County planners recognize that land-use changes associated with development and population growth increase the demand for water resources. Because future drinkingwater supplies are a primary concern in Brunswick County, current (2001) water-resource information will give County planners and managers information that is needed to plan effectively for future growth and development. In 1995, Brunswick County relied on both surface water (61 percent) and ground water (39 percent) for water supply (Walters, 1997). Additional surface water is available for use from Bladen County; however, it requires piping for water transfer and more treatment than water from the Castle Hayne aquifer, which is the primary ground-watersupply source for municipalities in Brunswick County. Because of the increased number of ground-water users in the County, particularly in the coastal area, a better understanding of the quantity and quality of available ground-water resources is needed for adequate planning and management. Water supply is not the only water-resource issue associated with population growth. Forested land that once provided recharge areas for aquifers is being transformed into less permeable urban or suburban land uses. Stormwater runoff and landfills must be managed appropriately to protect water quality. In addition, high-density municipal and industrial development can create potential ground-water contamination problems. Many of these management issues can be dealt with more effectively with an improved understanding of Brunswick County's ground-water resources. In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) entered into a cooperative agreement with Brunswick County to investigate the ground-water resources of the County in order to provide a better understanding of these resources. The primary objectives of the investigation were to characterize the hydrogeologic setting and quantity and quality of the ground water beneath Brunswick County."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of this report is to summarize waterresources data and hydrogeologic setting for Brunswick County, North Carolina. Data compiled for this report include land-surface data, such as meteorologic, surface water, land use and land cover, and soils; and subsurface data, such as geology, hydrogeology, and ground-water levels and quality. Each section of the report provides a brief description of the available data within and adjacent to Brunswick County, the sources of the data, and a description of how these data can be used."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Blankenship evaluated ground-water quality and quantity and the effects of local pumping and recharge. LeGrand (1960) conducted a reconnaissance of the geology and ground-water resources of the Wilmington and New Bern area. LeGrand identified the Castle Hayne aquifer as a major ground-water supply source for the area."}, {"section_title": "Methods of Data Collection and Compilation", "text": "The data presented in this report were compiled from selected previous studies except for well-location data and recently collected (1999)(2000) ground-waterlevel data. Geology and hydrogeology reports on the area were reviewed and evaluated, including those pertaining to regional studies in surrounding counties and South Carolina. Data were compiled from these reports and from files of the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the USGS, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, Brunswick County, North Carolina State University, East Carolina University, and local agencies. If wells having historic information could be located, the latitude and longitude of these wells were recorded by using a global positioning system (GPS). GPS latitude and longitude data were collected in North American Datum 1983 and recorded in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Latitude and longitude data are accurate to within plus or minus 33 ft. Some wellmeasuring points and(or) land-surface elevations were surveyed previously by DENR. These elevations are listed in this report as accurate to within 0.1 ft. Landsurface elevations not having traditional land-survey information were interpolated from USGS 1:24,000scale topographic maps and are assumed accurate to within one-half of the land-surface contour interval, or 2.5 ft. The periodic water levels measured in each well by the USGS for this report were determined with a chalked steel tape or an electronic water-level indicator. Wells completed in some of the deeper, confined aquifers are sealed at the surface and accessible by hose connections. Pressures in these flowing wells were measured with a pressure gauge and converted to water level in feet above land surface. A network of continuous ground-water-level monitors was established in 11 wells at 6 locations for this investigation ( fig. 1). Ground-water levels were measured hourly, using a float and incremental encoder or submersible pressure transducer, and logged by a data recorder. At monitoring sites BR-079, BR-080, BR-081, BR-082, BR-083,  fig. 1), the data were transmitted by satellite telemetry to the USGS office in Raleigh and automatically loaded into the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) data base. These data are available to the public online at a USGS website (U.S. Geological Survey, 2001). At monitoring sites BR-078, BR-099, and BR-100, the data were periodically downloaded to a field computer and manually loaded into the NWIS data base."}, {"section_title": "LAND-SURFACE DATA", "text": "Land-surface data compiled for Brunswick County are presented in this section of the report. These data include meteorologic, surface-water, and land-use and land-cover data."}, {"section_title": "Meteorologic Data", "text": "Precipitation is a contributing factor in the rate of recharge to the surficial aquifer in Brunswick County. The response of ground-water levels to precipitation can be used to estimate rates of recharge to an aquifer and the degree of confinement of an aquifer. Barometric pressure in combination with groundwater-level data can be used to determine the storage characteristics of a confined aquifer (Domenico and Schwartz, 1990). Temperature, precipitation, and barometric pressure data were compiled from weather stations in and around Brunswick County (table 1; fig. 1). The average annual precipitation from stations with more than 10 years of record (three of four stations) ranged from 54.7 inches (in.) at Longwood to 56.6 in. at Southport. Mean monthly precipitation data at each station for the period of record are shown in figure 2 and table 2. Although precipitation is highest from June to September, ground-water recharge from precipitation generally is greater during the winter and early spring when evapotranspiration rates are low. The mean monthly temperatures at the Longwood, Southport, and Wilmington Airport weather stations for the periods of record are shown in figure 3 and table 2."}, {"section_title": "Surface-Water Data", "text": "The surface waters of Brunswick County ( fig. 1   tidal streams, such as the Cape Fear River, the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Lockwood Folly River, and the Shallotte River; and the Atlantic Ocean. Streamflow data can be used for many purposes, including the following (Wahl and others, 1995 1). These streamgages collect stream stage and discharge data at 15-minute intervals on Hood Creek and on the Waccamaw River. Streamflow characteristics for these two locations are presented in table 3. Streamflow statistics for annual runoff are particularly important in calculating aquifer recharge. Annual runoff indicates the depth of water with which the drainage area of the stream would be covered if all of the runoff for the year were uniformly distributed over it. For the periods of record for the two USGS streamgages, the annual runoff for Hood Creek near Leland is 24.18 in., and the annual runoff for the Waccamaw River at Freeland is 14.66 in. (table 3)."}, {"section_title": "Land-Use and Land-Cover Data", "text": "Land use refers to activities that occur on the land surface, whereas land cover refers to the physical overlay of the land surface. Land-use and land-cover data are applied most effectively when multiple data sets are used to evaluate changes in land use and land cover over time. Land-use and land-cover data can be used for many purposes, including as input variables in an evaluation of the susceptibility of surficial aquifers to contamination. Land-use and land-cover data evaluated for this study were obtained from National Land Cover Data (NLCD), which is a product of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium of Federal agency programs. These Federal programs include the Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA); Remote Sensing Application Center of the U.S. Forest Service; Coastal Change Analysis Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and the Gap Analysis Program, National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program, and Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center of the USGS. The NLCD were obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) \"winter leaves-off\" satellite images acquired during 1991-93 (Vogelmann and others, 1998). Additional \"summer leaves-on\" images were collected and referenced. Data sets were referenced to Albers conical equal area coordinates and projected to North Carolina State plane coordinates by the USGS North Carolina District. A more detailed description of the NLCD data sets is available from the USEPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000a). Land-use and land-cover data for Brunswick County are presented in figure 4. An evaluation of land-use and land-cover data for the period 1991-93 indicates that when open water is not included in the land-use and land-cover total, most of Brunswick County is either forested land (about 57 percent) or wetlands (about 29 percent). Only about 3 percent of Brunswick County is in the residential, commercial, or industrial land-use category. The other 11 percent of the County is in the agriculture (8 percent), transitional (2 percent), and sand (1 percent) land-use and land-cover categories. Table 3.

These subsurface data relate to soils data, geology and hydrogeology, ground-water levels, and ground-water quality. As part of a cooperative program between the USGS and the North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (CGIA), 1:24,000-scale soil maps were digitized according to NRCS standards. Soils information, such as soil type, thickness, and permeability, are available from the Map Unit Interpretations Record (MUIR) attribute data base that is linked to the SSURGO soil-unit delineation. Database documentation is available from the NRCS (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1998), and aerial photos and soils information are available in the soil survey of Brunswick County (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1986). Geographical information system programs were written to process the MUIR data to extract thickness and permeability by layer for each soil unit (S.E. Terziotti, U.S. Geological Survey, oral commun., April 2000). As many as six soil layers of an individual soil type are identified in the MUIR data for Brunswick County. The weighted average, by percent, of each soil component was applied to each mapping unit for thickness and harmonic mean permeability. A detailed description of the techniques used to calculate soil thickness and harmonic mean permeability is provided by Eimers and others (2000). The classification, thickness, and harmonic mean permeability of Brunswick County soils are presented in figures 5, 6, and 7, respectively.  "}, {"section_title": "Geologic Data", "text": "The surficial geology of a particular area affects the movement and storage of ground water, aquifer characteristics, and the formation of stream-drainage networks. Ground-water quality also is influenced by surficial geology. The most recent evaluation of the surficial geology of Brunswick County was completed as part of a regional evaluation conducted by Ator and others (2000). The authors presented a conceptual hydrogeologic framework for the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain from New Jersey to South Carolina. Seven subregions were identified based on similarities in surficial geology and physiography. In Brunswick County, these subregions include Middle Coastal Plain sediments, Coastal Lowlands, and Alluvial and Estuarine Valleys. The surficial geology/physiography of Brunswick County from Ator and others 2000is presented in figure 8. A reconnaissance stratigraphy of Brunswick County was reported by Zarra (1991). In his report, Zarra focused on the uppermost 50 to 200 ft of sediments and subdivided the shallow stratigraphy of the County into a surficial sand, a Pliocene/Pleistocene unit, the Castle Hayne Formation, and the Peedee Formation. The surficial sand ranges from 10 to 50 ft thick with a reported average thickness of 25 ft. The thickness of the Pliocene/Pleistocene unit ranges from 0 to 50 ft from west to east and averages about 20 ft. The Pliocene/Pleistocene unit is absent in the northeastern part of Brunswick County. The Castle Hayne Formation occurs only in the southeastern third of the County and ranges from 0 to 50 ft thick. The Peedee Formation underlies the entire County. This unit is present at depths of 15 ft beneath the surficial sand in the northeast, 30 to 50 ft in the west, and 50 ft in the center of Brunswick County. Locations of stratigraphic sections A-A', B-B', D-D', and E-E' from Zarra (1991) are shown in figure 8, and the sections are presented in figure 9. Zarra also presented information on the earliest Miocene sediments, the Riverbend Formation, and the Beaufort Formation, but because they only occur in New Hanover County, they were not discussed in this report.   Zarra, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "Hydrogeologic Data", "text": "A hydrogeologic framework incorporates the hydraulic properties of geologic units into an interpretation of the ground-water-flow characteristics of the subsurface. The hydraulic properties of an individual stratigraphic unit may not be known or may not be different enough to distinguish among geologic units. A hydrogeologic unit is composed of a formation, part of a formation, or a group of formations having similar hydraulic characteristics. These hydrogeologic units are termed aquifers if they produce water, or confining units if they restrict the flow of water. Winner and Coble (1996) conducted the most comprehensive study of the hydrogeologic framework of the North Carolina Coastal Plain to date. This study was a regional investigation in which four hydrogeologic sections were completed in or near Brunswick County-northwest to southeast sections A-A' and D-D' and southwest to northeast sections K-K' and L-L' (figs. 10, 11). These sections have been modified to illustrate the thickness and relative dip of the individual hydrogeologic units in and near Brunswick County. Although the sections do not present detailed hydrogeology beneath Brunswick County, they provide a general understanding. The uppermost three aquifers are important sources of ground-water supply in Brunswick County. The surficial aquifer is an important source of ground water, not only for domestic supplies and some public supplies but also for discharge to streams, lakes,    wetlands, and underlying aquifers, such as the Castle Hayne and Peedee aquifers. The Castle Hayne aquifer is used for water supply by Brunswick County and Southport water systems and is the most productive aquifer in the County. The Peedee aquifer is the source of water for many of the domestic and industrial wells. Because of high chloride concentrations and high costs associated with increased depth of exploration, the ground water below these aquifers is used to a lesser degree."}, {"section_title": "SELECTED HYDROLOGIC DATA", "text": "Ground-water levels and historic ground-waterquality data compiled for Brunswick County are presented in this section of the report. Data collected by the USGS are verified and quality assured before being entered into the NWIS data base. Data in NWIS are available to the public on the internet (U.S. Geological Survey, 2000b)."}, {"section_title": "Ground-Water-Level Data", "text": "Ground-water-level data are used to monitor water-level trends and evaluate the quantity and availability of the resource. In the surficial aquifer, water levels may fluctuate several feet seasonally, increasing from about October through March and declining from about April through September when higher evapotranspiration occurs. Water levels in unstressed, deeper, confined aquifers usually fluctuate less than in the surficial aquifers over the course of a year. Water-level changes observed in these aquifers may be a result of nearby pumping, large-scale regional pumping, or reduced recharge. Ground-water wells in the NWIS data base are identified by a unique 15-digit site-identification number. Wells in this report also are referenced by a local identifier that consists of a 2-letter county code (BR for Brunswick County) and a sequential number. Some wells measured as part of the USGS/DENR Cooperative Program also may be identified by a local identifier with an \"NC\" prefix. During the 1970's, the DWQ installed several well clusters in Brunswick County and throughout the Coastal Plain. These wells are the source of much of the hydrogeologic and water-level information available for Brunswick County. Historic ground-water-level data were obtained from USGS files in Raleigh, the Wilmington Regional Office of DENR, the Groundwater Section (DWQ) of the North Carolina Division of Water Quality, the North Carolina Division of Water Resources (DWR), and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Water-level data obtained from other agencies are periodic measurements of the depth to water in an individual well. Data collected by the USGS may be periodic measurements or continuous data obtained from water-level recorders. Periodic water-level data collected and(or) evaluated from 73 wells ( fig. 12) for this report are presented in the supplemental data section (1A). Historic continuous water-level data also were collected as part of the USGS/DENR statewide ground-water-level monitoring program. A network of wells for recording continuous ground-water levels was established for this investigation. Water-level recorders were installed at well clusters throughout Brunswick County ( fig. 1). Ground-water levels were measured by using a float system and incremental encoder, or a submersible pressure transducer, and logged by a data recorder. The ground-water-level data at wells BR-079, BR-080, BR-081, BR-082, BR-083,  are transmitted by satellite telemetry to the USGS office in Raleigh and automatically loaded into the NWIS data base. The data from wells BR-078, BR-099 and BR-100 ( fig. 1) are downloaded quarterly to a field computer and manually loaded into the NWIS data base. Data from these wells and historic data from BR-012 are presented in the supplemental data section (1B) of this report. In the surficial aquifer, measured water levels ranged from 19.26 to 27.87 ft above msl during the period January 1987 to December 2000. In the Castle Hayne aquifer, measured water levels ranged from 3.38 ft below msl to 47.05 ft above msl during the period October 1984 to December 2000. In the Peedee aquifer, measured water levels ranged from 14.53 to 54.63 ft above msl during the period October 1984 to December 2000. In the Black Creek aquifer, measured water levels ranged from 4.00 to 34.31 ft above msl during the period October 1999 to December 2000."}, {"section_title": "Vertical Gradients", "text": "Vertical gradients are calculated for clustered wells to determine if ground water is moving upward or downward between aquifers. If ground water is moving downward, the overlying aquifer is considered to potentially be recharging the aquifer below. If groundwater flow is upward, the underlying aquifer is considered to potentially be discharging to the aquifer above. Vertical gradient is determined by dividing the difference in head values by the difference in aquifer depths. The value of vertical gradient typically is given as a unitless number because it is a length divided by a length. For example, if well A is screened at 40 ft below land surface and has a water level of 10 ft below land surface, and well B is screened at 100 ft below land surface and has a water level of 60 ft below land surface, the vertical gradient would be calculated as follows: where dh is the change in head, and dl is the length between the bottoms of the two wells. The value of depth of the screens or open holes is represented by the median of the interval. A negative value of vertical gradient would represent an upward gradient. The vertical gradients at the four ground-water monitoring stations were calculated for this report. At the Southport station, the vertical gradient between the surficial aquifer (24.65 ft above msl) and the Castle Hayne aquifer (6.08 ft above msl) is 0.364. The vertical gradient between the Castle Hayne aquifer and the Peedee aquifer (4.93 ft above msl) is 0.009. This indicates that ground water is moving downward through the confining units at the Southport groundwater monitoring station. At the Sunset Harbor station, the vertical gradient between the surficial aquifer (28.90 ft above msl) and the Peedee aquifer (20.78 ft above msl) is 0.093. This indicates that ground water is moving "}, {"section_title": "Ground-Water-Quality Data", "text": "Ground-water-quality data can be used to evaluate the suitability of ground water for human consumption, irrigation, or other uses. Analysis for concentrations of specific chemicals can be used to determine if contamination has occurred from saltwater, landfills, septic systems, farms, or other potentially harmful sources. Some constituents also can be analyzed to estimate the age of the ground water. Water-quality data collected from the same location over time can indicate trends in the quality of ground water. Water-quality data for Brunswick County were compiled from the files of the USGS and DWQ. Historic water-quality data generally are limited to standard anion and cation analyses or chloride analyses. The comparability of historic water-quality data can be problematic because methods for sample collection and analytical techniques may be unknown. These data, however, can be useful in making general comparisons to more recent analyses. If an analysis is complete (concentrations of all major ionic species measured) and analytical error is small, the sum of the milliequivalents per liter of cations should be approximately equal to the sum of the milliequivalents per liter of anions. The nearness to this standard is a good means of testing the acceptability of an analysis. Historic water-quality data are available for 39 wells ( fig. 13) from 1941 to 1999 having cation and anion balance within 5 percent (table 4, p. 24). Additional water-quality data for Brunswick County are available in Lautier (1998) and Woods and others (2000). A common water-quality issue in coastal environments is saltwater intrusion. Saltwater can reach a well through lateral movement within an aquifer or by migrating vertically upward from an underlying aquifer (often called upconing). Brunswick County currently (2001) has no formal monitoring plan for saltwater intrusion. In general, chloride concentrations increase with depth and occur at shallower depths toward the sea. A chloride concentration of 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L) is the potable limit for ground water according to the Federal Drinking Water Standards (U.S Environmental Protection Agency, 2000b). Chloride-concentration data for ground water in Brunswick County were compiled from USGS and DWQ files and are presented in table 5 (p. 41). The chloride concentrations measured in all aquifers underlying Brunswick County ranged from near 0 to 15,000 mg/L. In the surficial aquifer, chloride concentrations ranged from 5.0 mg/L to 60 mg/L; in the Castle Hayne aquifer, chloride concentrations ranged from near 0 to 15,000 mg/L. Chloride concentrations in the Peedee aquifer ranged from 8.0 mg/L to 210 mg/L, and in the Black Creek aquifer, chloride concentrations ranged from 620 mg/L to 2,700 mg/L. Chloride concentrations in the deepest aquifer, the Cape Fear aquifer, ranged from 2,500 mg/L to 7,100 mg/L.
