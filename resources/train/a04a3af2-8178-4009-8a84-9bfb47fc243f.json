The Framingham study found that the age-specific risk of AD was almost twofold greater in women than men (17.2% vs. 9.1% at age 65 years and 28.5% vs. 10.2% at age 75 years) [3] . Holland et al. [6] reported that female gender was associated with a greater rate of cognitive change in MCI subjects than men over a 1-year period, raising further questions about what happens over longer periods.\nStudies have also begun to examine underlying reasons for a possible sexual dimorphism in rates of decline. A greater potency of the AD risk associated with the apolipoprotein E4 allele and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Met66 allele has been noted in women [1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12] . Other theories proposed to explain gender differences include sex hormones (such as estrogen), smaller head size, lower cognitive reserve, lower levels of exercise in women (at least in the United States) and differences in occupational or educational attainment. Gender differences in pathologic vulnerability for AD are supported by studies noting greater annual threedimensional tensor-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain atrophy rates in women [4] and a significant association of gender with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [5] . In one study, equivalent increases in AD pathology increased the odds of clinical AD by 20-fold for women versus threefold for men [5] . Collectively, these studies argue for more definitive long-term examination of gender differences in MCI rates of progression and pathologic vulnerability.\nThe aim of this report was to use 8-year longitudinal data on at-risk subjects from a national biomarker study to test the hypothesis that women progress cognitively and functionally at faster rates than men, after covarying for baseline cognition, age, and education. A second aim was to model the long-term trajectories of decline in men versus women to see if the assumptions of linear decline noted by the prior 1-year study [6] held true over a longer period of follow-up. The long-term data allowed us to test for both linear and curvilinear patterns of decline as well as acceleration over time. A third aim was to examine interactions between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and gender on cognitive decline and to see if gender had an effect beyond that conferred by the E4 genotype. Finally, we examined gender differences in the variability of decline in both cognition and function, using instruments widely used in prevention trials."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "MCI subjects recruited in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1; adni.loni.usc.edu) were used in our analyses. ADNI (ADNI ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00106899) is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. ADNI-1 originally recruited 398 MCI subjects who then had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. Additional details are also provided in the ADNI-1 procedures manual [33, 34] .\nAll ADNI-1 MCI subjects were eligible for inclusion. Criteria for classification as MCI in ADNI-1 are as follows: an inclusive mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score from 24-30, subjective memory complaint, objective evidence of impaired memory calculated by scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II adjusted for education, a score of 0.5 on the global CDR, absence of significant confounding conditions such as current major depressive episode, normal, or near normal daily activities, and absence of clinical dementia. For a detailed list of all selection criteria, readers are referred to the ADNI-1 procedures manual [34] . In addition, data for all the following parameters were required for subjects included for analysis: baseline age, race, gender, and years of education; baseline MMSE score; Alzheimer's disease assessment scalecognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) for at least two different time points, and APOE genotyping results. APOE allele genotyping of all subjects was executed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells, and details are provided elsewhere [34] . In total, 398 MCI subjects from ADNI-1 were included. The term \"baseline\" is used to indicate data collected at the subject's first visit (which may be screening or baseline)."}, {"section_title": "Outcome measures", "text": "The ADAS-cog 11 is a 70-point scale designed to assess severity of cognitive impairment, and it is commonly used in MCI and Alzheimer's trials.

Higher scores indicate worse performance, as it is scored based on number of errors.\nThe clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), with a range from 0 to 18, is the sum of the ratings for the six domains of the CDR global dementia rating scale. It provides a quantitative assessment of cognitive and functional impairments based on a semi-structured interview of the subject and informant [35] . Higher scores indicate greater impairment."}, {"section_title": "Follow-up", "text": "ADNI MCI subjects were followed through ADNI-1 and then enrolled in ADNI-2.

The model explains this in terms of m, the ADAS-Cog value for subject j at 3.45 years, b, the rate of change in ADAS-Cog and g, the curvature in the ADAS-Cog trajectory. Finally, \u03b5 jt is the measurement error, assumed to have a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation (SD) s e . The curvature parameter captures nonlinearity of the trajectories: g 5 0 indicates linear growth, i.e. constant rate of change, g . 0 indicates that the rate of change is increasing over time, whereas g , 0 indicates that the rate of change is decreasing over time. The follow-up time is centered; the median follow-up time (3.45 years) is subtracted from the actual follow-up time, to allow the slope and curvature parameters to be estimated approximately independently.\nTo confirm our findings with regard to slopes and curvatures, a mixed-effects model was used to model the effect of gender on cognitive decline, taking into account the effect of confounders, such as baseline MMSE, age, years of education, and APOE \u03b54 status on baseline, with outcome being ADAS-Cog, as follows: \nIn the mentioned model, A i (t) is the ADAS-Cog value of subject i at time t (in years). Model (2) explains this in terms of m, the baseline ADAS-Cog value for a 75.1-year-old male with 16 years of education, MMSE of 27 and of APOE \u03b54 negative. The terms with a are effects of gender, APOE \u03b54 status, MMSE, age, and years of education on baseline ADAS-Cog values. The terms with b are effects on rates of change and b 0 is the baseline rate of change. The terms with g are effects on curvature and g 0 is the baseline curvature. We include a random effect b i and r i to account for the effect of unmeasured subject factors on the baseline ADAS-Cog value and rate of change, respectively: both are assumed to have a zero mean Gaussian distribution with SD s b . Finally, \u03b5 it is the measurement error assumed to have an independent zero mean Gaussian distribution with SD s b . Note that the square root transformation was used to obtain approximate Gaussianity of estimated error terms as well as constant variance across fitted values of the response. A similar model was fit for CDR-SB. Model (0.2) was fit by the method of restricted maximum likelihood using the nlme package in the R computing platform (www.r-project. org). In our models, we used the subject's initial MMSE as a covariate to represent baseline cognition; however, gender differences in cognitive decline remained significant when the baseline ADAS-Cog was used as a covariate in the model rather than the MMSE."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baseline characteristics", "text": "Baseline features of the sample are summarized in Table 1 .

Previously, Holland et al. [6] reported a smaller gender difference in a much shorter (1 year) follow-up study of MCI subjects. We confirm and extend this to a follow-up period of up to 8 years (mean of 4 years). The baseline rate of ADAS change reported in Holland et al Median rates of ADAS-Cog change per year by gender and number of APOE \u03b54 alleles. APOE \u03b542 indicates no APOE \u03b54 alleles, APOE \u03b541 is one allele, and APOE \u03b5411 is two alleles. Women had higher median annual rate of change than men regardless of APOE \u03b54 genotype group. Abbreviation: ADAS-Cog, Alzheimer's disease assessment scalecognitive subscale. (0.49 points/year) was lower than that in our study-likely due to the fact that our much longer follow-up allowed us to quantify a curvilinear acceleration of change over time. The similarity of the gender effect on ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB indicates that women have a faster rate of decline in both cognitive performance and functional status. Our models adjusted for age and APOE \u03b54, which correlate substantially with risk for amyloid positive status. Gender differences are present in APOE \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers; however, gender effects appear to be greatest in E4 homozygotes, a group at greatest risk for conversion. Overall, these data confirm and extend prior findings [3] [4] [5] [6] that women with MCI may have a greater vulnerability for cognitive and functional decline. The strengths of our study include its use of a relatively large baseline sample size (398 MCI subjects recruited nationally), the employment of specific clinical criteria for amnestic MCI with standardized data collection across multiple sites, and relatively long (mean, 4 years) follow-up duration. We focused primarily on MCI subjects originally recruited in ADNI-1 because they had a more traditional form of MCI (i.e. late MCI) whose memory criteria are well established. We did not include any subjects newly recruited in ADNI-Go or ADNI-2 with early MCI because they lacked sufficient long-term follow-up. One potential limitation is that ADNI MCI subjects are not necessarily representative of the population as a whole and as such are more representative of MCI subjects recruited at research centers or those who have been enrolled into secondary prevention trials. Although our mean follow-up time of 4 years is longer than that of others addressing this question, it may still not have been long enough to conclusively test for gender differences in rates of conversion to dementia. The rate of conversion from MCI to dementia was slightly higher among women than men but this was not statistically significant. Subjects who progressed to AD dementia were not excluded. All data points on subjects who entered the study as MCI in ADNI-1 were analyzed.\nAlthough ADNI classified subject visits as \"annual\" (e.g. year 1, 2, and so forth), there was considerable variability in actual visit dates. AD does not progress in fixed annual chunks but there is a slow steady progression that is somewhat variable for each subject. Therefore, in our analyses, we used the actual date of the follow-up visit for each subject to give a more precise statistical measure of progression and variability (due to drop outs or fluctuations) over time. This is one reason why our figures show dips and peaks (e.g. around year 6). Attrition biases are possible, but the baseline cognitive status, follow-up period, and number of follow-up visits were similar between males and females. Finally, our study cannot determine causality or pathologic mechanisms because we did not look at other biomarkers or genes aside from APOE \u03b54. In this regard, it should be noted that amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data are only available in a small fraction of ADNI-1 subjects.\nSeveral different factors could underlie possible gender differences in rates of cognitive progression, including genetic, lifestyle, hormonal, psychological, and neurobiological. We found a gender effect after adjusting for the APOE \u03b54 effect, suggesting that additional factors may be at play.

Abbreviations: CDR-SB, clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes; ADAS-Cog, Alzheimer's disease assessment scalecognitive subscale.\nhave noted an increased effect of APOE \u03b54 in women; for example, in women, APOE \u03b54 was reported to result in greater conversion risk [11] , altered default mode connectivity [12] , greater atrophy of hippocampus [30] , and greater decrements on delayed word recall [30] . In contrast, Holland et al. [6] did not report a gender by APOE interaction on brain atrophy. The greater variability of ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB rates of decline in women suggests there could be potential undiscovered genetic causes. In this regard, it is of interest that the Met66 allele of BDNF gene, which reduces the transport of BDNF, as well as the 219K allele of the ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1 gene have both been linked to increased risk for AD in women [1] .\nFurther analysis should include other genetic factors besides APOE \u03b54 that may be significant to cognitive decline, and ADNI genetic data are now becoming available. Likewise, in a few years, we will have access to at least 4 years of ADAS and CDR data from ADNI-2 MCI subjects for our analysis to be replicated, and it should be possible to correlate gender differences in cognitive progression with various biomarkers such as amyloid deposition, cognitive reserve, and brain atrophy rates; ADNI-2 subjects receive MRI scans, florbetapir PET scans, CSF studies, and resting state functional MRI. This is highly relevant in light of a prior study which noted that women may be at much greater risk than men for cognitive decline and dementia diagnosis for every one unit of increase in global brain pathology [5] . These data raise the hypothesis that there may be gender differences in cognitive reserve (with men having higher reserve).\nOur findings also have relevance for clinical treatment/ prevention trials, including Dominant Inherited Alzheimer Network Treatment Units, Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative, and the Amyloid Lowering Trial in Asymptomatic Individuals (A4 trial). Despite many candidate drugs being in trials, the causes of AD are not fully known, and uncovering mechanisms underlying gender differences in cognitive progression may yield additional new treatment targets or nonpharmacologic strategies for risk modification and allowing a more personalized intervention. For example, trials of anti-amyloid therapeutics have revealed a greater vulnerability for cerebral adverse events such as amyloidrelated imaging abnormalities in E4 carriers and many ongoing studies stratify enrollment by E4 and also use differential treatment dosing by E4. In a similar vein, our findings support a prior call for AD prevention trials to deliberately stratify by sex and have adequate sample size to test for a therapeutic risk-benefit in men and women separately [1] . One could conceivably also have separate thresholds for efficacy. In addition, differences in variability in the rate of change by gender suggest that unequal numbers of males and females may be required to measure the same effect size. Furthermore, the curvilinear acceleration noted in this study suggests that usual statistical approach in trials of linear models may not be optimal to model MCI disease progression over longer periods. The CDR-SB has been suggested as an acceptable single cognitive/functional end point for MCI trials, and our data suggest that lower baseline MMSE, female gender, and APOE \u03b54 are predictors of faster decline, and sample sizes for various specific effect sizes can be computed using the data. To our knowledge, no prior study has modeled long-term changes in cognition and function in MCI, as well as the effects of covariates, so comprehensively."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, our results show a robust gender difference in the rate of change in ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB in MCI subjects, with women declining at much higher rates than men.

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional sources (PubMed, conference abstracts).

Interpretation: Women with mild cognitive impairment have significantly greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and functional decline than men. These findings confirm and extend prior reports on gender differences in neurobiological risk for Alzheimer's.\n3.
