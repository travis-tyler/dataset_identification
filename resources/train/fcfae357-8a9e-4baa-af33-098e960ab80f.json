[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Given the importance of a college education to entering and staying in the middle class and the high cost of obtaining a bachelor's degree, Who Wins? and Who Pays? are questions being asked today at kitchen tables and in the halls of government throughout the nation. This study shows that the answers are different than what is commonly found in the media.\nMuch of the current debate about the cost and value of higher education has focused on how much students pay, how much they borrow, and how poorly some of them are being educated. Much less attention is being paid to how well or how badly taxpayers are being served both by the institutions they are helping to fund and by the students they have helped to graduate.\nUsing publicly available data, we look at who wins and who pays across the full spectrum of higher education institutions in the United States, combining information on \"institutional control\" (public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit college or university) and selectivity (ranging from open admission to most selective, based on Barron's Profiles of American Colleges).\nWe focus on two critical questions:\n\u2022 Do students who earn a bachelor's degree and participate in the labor force experience returns, such as higher wages, that justify the costs incurred by them in earning that degree?\n\u2022 Do taxpayers get a positive return on their investment in the nation's colleges and universities?\nThe answer to the first is \"yes.\"\n\u2022 In terms of wages, a bachelor's degree, whether from a public, a not-for-profit, or a for-profit institution, pays a handsome net financial reward in comparison to a high school diploma-a reward that over a lifetime can vary, on average, from more than $230,000 at less selective not-for-profit colleges (such as the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut and Dowling College in New York) to well over $500,000 at the most competitive public or not-for-profit institutions (such as the University of California at Los Angeles and Amherst College)."}, {"section_title": "\u00ae", "text": "The answer to the second question is more complicated.\n\u2022 Taxpayers benefit from the higher state and federal income taxes paid on the higher salaries earned by college graduates, varying from $60,000 in additional taxes paid over the work life of a graduate from a less selective public institution to almost $150,000 in additional income taxes paid over the work life of a graduate from the most selective not-for-profit colleges or universities.\n\u2022 However, taxpayers also subsidize the education that students receive in most colleges and universities. This takes the form mostly of direct state appropriations for public universities and tax exemptions for not-for-profit ones.\n\u2022 Taxpayers subsidize bachelor's degrees in nearly all not-for-profit institutions at around $8,000 per degree. In public institutions, the taxpayer investment is more than $60,000.\n\u2022 Taxpayer subsidies increase dramatically among the most selective institutions, from almost $60,000 in the most selective not-for-profit institutions to well over $100,000 in the most selective public institutions.\n\u2022 Because for-profit institutions do not receive state subsidies and pay taxes rather than receive tax exemptions, even after including the cost of government-funded financial aid, taxpayers benefit by around $6,000 per bachelor's degree.\nFrom the data presented in this study, we conclude that:\n\u2022 Given the financial return to graduates for each completed bachelor's degree, the high cost of dropouts, and the high dropout rates in less selective public colleges and universities, the states and the Federal Government must focus their resources and policies on increasing retention and degree completion at less selective institutions.\n\u2022 Given that the lowest levels of taxpayer support go to the institutions that enroll the highest percentage of students from low-income families, nontraditional students, and minority students, the states and the Federal Government must reverse their policies and focus their support for completion on the neediest students.\n\u2022 Given that the research on cost shows that not-forprofit and for-profit institutions are the best deal for taxpayers, to lower cost and increase capacity, the states and the Federal Government should support high-quality, nontraditional providers.\n\u2022 Given that state and federal policy discussions concerning how and who to fund must be informed by reliable data drawn from institutions across all types of control and levels of selectivity, the states and the Federal Government should move to make such data available, and the latter should move to scrap the antiquated and inadequate federal Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) in favor of a data system based on student-level data that can measure the success of the growing number of \"nontraditional\" college students, who now make up the majority of postsecondary students in the country.\nWe compared the demographic representativeness of our sample with the full NPSAS: 08 baccalaureate sample and found few differences other than that our sample had a slightly higher percentage of whites (1.7 percent) and their Expected Family Contribution for financial aid purposes was also higher (by $786) (see Appendix Table 3 ). We also compared the cost of earning a degree for our sample with the full NPSAS sample and again found few differences (see Appendix  Table 4 ).\nIt is unlikely that all of the students pursuing bachelor's degrees in NPSAS: 08 are actually represented in the PayScale.com data of \"survivors\" (the ones who actually graduate, and then among these, the ones who, interested in knowing what other college graduates seeking employment earn, decide to submit salary data to PayScale.com). But as just noted, we do not find noteworthy differences between the full NPSAS: 08 baccalaureate sample and our sample, and, therefore, we are confident that the results are representative of four-year college graduates. Of course, this does not mean the same thing as being nationally representative of all college students (approximately half of whom do not graduate) or the U.S. population as a whole (a quarter of which never enrolls in college).\nare drawn from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Tax Foundation, and the Internal Revenue Service.\nWe started with NPSAS: 08 as the sample by which to identify students in colleges and universities pursuing bachelor's degrees. The NPSAS: 08 sample includes about 114,000 undergraduate students, 64,951 of whom were pursuing a bachelor's degree, and around 14,000 graduate students, all of whom were randomly selected from more than 1,600 postsecondary institutions. The sampled students represent approximately 21 million undergraduate students and 3 million graduate students who were enrolled in postsecondary education between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008 . To be included in the NPSAS: 08 study, students must have been enrolled at an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and was located in a state, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. For this study, we restricted our sample to students pursuing a bachelor's degree.\nTo calculate financial benefits for students and taxpayers by institution, we needed an estimate of salaries (as a measure of financial return). We used PayScale.com's 2010 salary report, which reports starting salary and mid-career salary data for bachelor's degree holders from 999 schools. We merged these salary data with NPSAS: 08 using each school's IPEDS UNITID. We also incorporated data on the selectivity of each school from Barron's Profiles of American Colleges.\n7 Once we excluded students in not-for-profit or public schools not classified by Barron's, students missing NPSAS: 08 cost data, or students missing PayScale.com data, 39,139 students were left in our study.\nfor-profit campuses covered by Barron's, for which we have both NPSAS and PayScale.com data, are in the less competitive category. Therefore, there is only one group for for-profit institutions. In the end, we have 11 categories of campuses for which we calculate cost and returns."}, {"section_title": "A college education is an expensive investment-in time, money, and effort-and it is getting more so each year.", "text": "As costs escalate, students, parents, and taxpayers need to be sure that the returns to the graduate, and ultimately to the nation, justify the cost.

As costs escalate, students, parents, and taxpayers need to be sure that the returns to the graduate, and ultimately to the nation, justify the cost. But how can they be certain?\nThere are the myriad rewards for earning a college degree that represent a high value to our society and are quantifiable, such as the tendency of collegeeducated adults to be healthier, live longer, and be more actively engaged citizens (for example, by voting and volunteering at higher rates). More personal rewards, such as a commitment to lifelong learning, are more difficult to measure. But most students, their families, taxpayers, and their government officials need answers to a more focused set of questions pertaining to the financial benefits and costs of a bachelor's degree. 1 We understand that restricting our analysis to students who actually graduate with a bachelor's degree presents only a limited window on costs because far too many colleges have low graduation rates. However, when we measure taxpayer efficiency, as will become evident below, we consider the costs for all students, including those who do not finish.\nAmong these are the two questions we study in this report:\n\u2022 Do students who earn a bachelor's degree and participate in the labor force experience returns, such as higher wages, that justify the costs incurred by them in obtaining that degree?\n\u2022 Do taxpayers get a positive return on their investment in the nation's colleges and universities?\nTo answer these questions, we first need to be clear about what is included in our calculations, which are limited to direct, economically measurable costs and benefits.\nFrom the perspective of the graduate, we measure:\n\u2022 Costs, which include the actual outlays for earning the degree, including tuition paid, books, room and board, and foregone wages\n\u2022 Benefits, which include current salaries and earnings over the graduate's work life \u00ae From the perspective of the taxpayer, we measure:\n\u2022 Costs, which include direct appropriations and foregone taxes\n\u2022 Benefits, which include taxes derived from the higher salaries and earnings of graduates Clearly, in this report we are viewing bachelor's degrees solely from the perspective of the financial returns on the investments made in these degrees by students and taxpayers. This, however, is not to suggest that we are satisfied with the costs and benefits associated with current retention and graduation rates. To the contrary, we strongly support President Obama's emphasis on increasing postsecondary completion rates for all types of degrees and certificates. It is in light of this national commitment that one of the purposes of our report is to show just how valuable completion is to both students and taxpayers-and to help emphasize further the urgent need for colleges and universities to work even harder to get students across the finish line."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "One reason that completing a bachelor's degree is so important is that graduation pays off for both the graduate and the taxpayer. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 3 the salaries of college graduates with a bachelor's degree between the ages of 25 and 34, working year-round, average around 46 percent more than those of someone who has attended some 2 Although we focus only on bachelor's degrees in this report, we recognize that this is only one piece of postsecondary credentials awarded in the United States. Therefore, the results in this study should not be read as applicable across all degrees or certificate programs. Furthermore, for some sectors of higher education, bachelor's degrees are only a small part of their degree production. Based on data from the 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 08), only 13.6 percent of degree recipients at for-profit colleges received bachelor's degrees, another 30.5 percent earned associate's degrees, and 55.9 percent completed certificates. In stark contrast, at not-forprofit institutions, 90.1 percent received bachelor's degrees, 6.1 percent received associate's degrees, and only 3.8 percent received certificates. At public institutions, the corresponding percentages are 49.8 percent received bachelor's degrees, 41.3 percent received associate's degrees, and 8.9 percent received certificates.\n3 See http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032010/perinc/ new04_001.htm. college but has not completed a degree. The contrast is even greater compared to someone with just a high school diploma: College graduates out-earn high school graduates by about two thirds. Moreover, many analysts predict that, even in today's challenging economic context, the demand for college-educated adults will grow over the foreseeable future, which should make the rewards for completing college even greater."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "While these salary figures show that a bachelor's degree pays, the federal and state governments, who underwrite much of higher education, have increasingly limited financial resources to support colleges and universities. Moreover, as college tuition and fees grow faster than median household income, the ability of students and families to pay for college is declining. 5 In turn, the question of whether there is a return to student and taxpayer investments in college degrees-and the size of these returns-is becoming ever more important.\nWe will be able more precisely to measure financial returns to graduates as states begin to match studentlevel data with measures of student success in the labor market using, for instance, unemployment insurance records, but that will take place state-by-state during the course of the next decade or so. In the meantime, in this study we explore these important questions by using the best data sets currently available.\nOne reason that completing a bachelor's degree is so important is that graduation pays off for both the graduate and the taxpayer."}, {"section_title": "Who Wins?

We use these data to estimate the return to the graduate, comparing salaries to the earnings of high school graduates and considering the costs a student incurred in earning the degree. We then look at how much more income tax is generated by the higher salaries associated with a bachelor's degree. We next estimate the taxpayer costs of a bachelor's degree in each of the 11 categories we have identified. We also highlight how the benefits and costs of gaining a bachelor's degree differ across types of schools. We conclude with some policy recommendations that follow from these results.\nThroughout, we explain the methods we used and the assumptions we made in order to permit other researchers to duplicate our findings or develop estimates based on other assumptions and models. (Details on our methods and data sources are found in the Appendix.)\nIn the first part of this study-on student costs and benefits-we combine data, on the costs of obtaining a bachelor's degree, from the U.S. Department of Education's 2008 National Postsecondary Aid Study (NPSAS: 08) with salary data on graduates from almost 1,000 campuses reported by PayScale.com.

Appendix Table 1 highlights the variables used by Barron's to divide institutions into six categories of selectivity (ranging from \"noncompetitive\" through \"most competitive\").\nBecause few students attend colleges in some of the resulting categories, 9 we combined public and not-for-profit schools in the noncompetitive and less competitive levels of selectivity.

Moreover, on average, the investment in the most selective not-for-profit institutions has the greatest payoff over a graduate's work lifetime-graduates from these schools have the highest earnings of any group of students, surpassing their peers who attended the most selective public institutions. 16 But Table 1 also makes evident that except for institutions in this most selective category, graduates of public institutions have a higher lifetime return than students graduating from the more expensive not-for-profit institutions. Consequently, one of the best ways for a student to cut college costs is to enroll at an in-state public college-not surprisingly, however, that option, with its high level of public subsidies, is also far more expensive for taxpayers than if the student attended almost any not-for-profit college or university (see Table 3 on p. 12). 16 We are making no inference here about the value added of particular schools. Graduates of these most selective private schools may have done as well regardless from where they actually graduated. For more information on this issue, see Dale, S. B., & Krueger, A. B. (2002) .

But the returns to students vary significantly across our analytic categories, as does the timing of the returns. For example, because our calculations take into account the costs students incurred earning the degree, and given the higher costs of attending a not-for-profit private institution, during the first decade after graduation, no matter what the level of selectivity, the net financial returns are, on average, higher for public and for-profit institution bachelor's graduates than for graduates of not-forprofit colleges and universities.\nWe also see that the first decade's net returns to students graduating from for-profit institutions are comparable to those of graduates from public institutions of roughly the same or even greater levels of selectivity (from \"non\" and \"less competitive\" up to and including \"very competitive\"). 15 However, in comparison with the two highest categories of public institutions-institutions that enroll about one fifth of the students covered by Barron's-the financial returns to graduates of for-profit institutions fall significantly behind. 12 We use net present value to turn a stream of earnings that will be generated over many years into a value today. NPV is the same standard used by federal government economists. For an easy-to-follow description, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value. Appendix Table 6 presents the net present value of the first decade and estimated lifetime returns of high school graduates. Finally, graduates from for-profit institutions do better over their lifetimes than graduates from not-for-profit institutions in the non/less competitive and competitive categories. However, lifetime earnings of graduates from for-profit institutions lag those of graduates from public institutions in the non/less competitive category by about 8 percent, a gap that grows as selectivity increases.\nIn short, although graduates from \"marquee\" colleges and universities reap the greatest financial returns, there is a significant return awaiting graduates from even the least selective institutions-those without a widely recognizable brand name, which happen to award the majority of the nation's bachelor's degrees.\nFurthermore, despite some arguments that the nation is producing far more bachelor's degree holders than we need, 17 the labor market is signaling strong demand for bachelor's degree recipients. Even if the skills of a particular job do not require a bachelor's degree, the fact that an applicant holds a bachelor's degree signals a variety of attributes that are valued by employers. Indeed, a bachelor's degree may not be an automatic ticket to a good job and a middle-class lifestyle, but, on average, students who complete their studies earn clear, positive returns on the time and money they invest in earning that degree, whether from a public, not-forprofit, or for-profit college or university. Table 2 focuses on the net present value of the returns taxpayers receive from the higher income taxes that graduates with bachelor's degrees pay relative to the income taxes high school graduates pay. 18 As explained in the Appendix, we have calculated the federal tax on Clearly, taxpayers derive substantial benefits from the higher wages bachelor's graduates earn in comparison to high school graduates. And although the tax benefits that flow from graduates in the most selective colleges are greater than from less selective ones, the numbers of graduates from these highly and most selective institutions is small relative to the number of graduates from other schools. Therefore, from the taxpayer perspective, the payoffs from the graduates of the schools producing the most graduates, regardless of their status as public, not-for-profit, or for-profit institutions, are substantial."}, {"section_title": "Returns to Taxpayers Through Tax Receipts", "text": "we first calculated the federal taxes paid by the bachelor's graduates from within each of the 11 categories of schools we are using, and then we increased that calculated amount by 25 percent to reflect state income tax collections.\nWe know that some states, including some large ones such as Florida and Texas, have no income taxes. Meanwhile, some states, such as California and New York, have income tax rates far higher than other states. Consequently, our numbers necessarily include error if applied to any specific state; moreover, given the lack of uniformity in the distribution of types of schools (by control and selectivity) across the states, there may be error in the aggregate numbers as well. These potential errors aside, we believe that the 25 percent calculation of the added state taxpayer benefit is reasonable for this national overview and expect that our future state-bystate reports will overcome much of the error resulting from the use of this uniform calculation.\nWith this caveat in mind, note that while the returns to the graduates we reported in Table 1 subtract the costs of getting that degree, the returns to the taxpayer via income taxes do not. 20 Financial aid and other taxpayer costs are considered in the next section.\nNo matter what form of control is considered, during the first decade, the return to the taxpayer ranges between $17,000 for each bachelor's graduate from non/less competitive institutions to $30,000 for each graduate from highly competitive institutions. Tax returns increase slightly with higher selectivity until the very last category, where graduates from the most selective not-for-profit institutions pay on average almost one-quarter more in taxes than graduates of the most selective public institutions. 20 We also do not take into account either the net return to taxpayers from relevant local taxes or the cost to taxpayers represented by the deductions available to those who qualify, for example, for the Hope Scholarship Credit or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, which could reduce federal income tax liability by as much as $2,500 in 2010. While we are not implying these balance each other, some degree of offsetting is taking place.

Table 3 summarizes the results of the calculations we used to estimate taxpayer costs per student per year and for each bachelor's degree awarded (see Appendix Table 8 for the full set of calculations).\nGiven that state appropriations support mostly public colleges and universities, at each level of selectivity, taxpayers are investing far more in students in public institutions than in not-for-profit ones.

While the details on the assumptions and calculations leading to our estimates are found in Appendix Table 8 , here we summarize the main steps in our analysis.\nWe begin by calculating the amount the institutions in our sample receive from federal, state, and local governments, including grants to students for tuition (e.g., Pell Grants) along with state and local subsidies as reported by IPEDS, but excluding amounts spent on research.\n25 IPEDS data are from the 2007-08 academic 25 As noted above, we do not measure state appropriations supporting the research mission of research universities.\ninstitutions. Indeed, Table 3 shows that taxpayer costs are substantially higher among the most selective institutions. We recognize that this is driven in part by the mix of graduate and undergraduate students in these schools-but our analysis is constrained by IPEDS data, which do not allow a partition of expenses along these lines.\nThe range of annual taxpayer costs to educate a student, excluding specific research-related costs enumerated in IPEDS, 22 is substantial, ranging from an actual gain for taxpayers from for-profit schools of nearly $800 per student per year all the way up to a taxpayer cost of more than $23,000 in the most selective public institutions."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "When we calculate the taxpayer cost per degree, 24 we estimate that taxpayers are investing around $108,000 for each degree awarded by the most selective public institutions in the country, which is between 60 percent to 72 percent more than the amount they are investing in students in less selective institutions. In contrast, taxpayers gain an average of about $6,000 per bachelor's degree granted by for-profit institutions. This net benefit received by taxpayers from each student studying at the for-profit institutions in our sample is 22 Although a share of the state subsidy for the public research institutions also supports their research mission, there is no way of calculating this share using our data. A reviewer of this study suggested that one reasonable proxy would be to take the difference in average faculty salaries between baccalaureate and research institutions. Although this is a rough proxy, it suggests an amount that can be treated as the \"research premium.\" According to a recent Midwestern Higher Education Compact's Average Faculty Salaries report (see http://www.mhec.org/pdfs/facsalaries2010.pdf), this research premium is 37 percent for full professors, 17 percent for associate professors, and 19 percent for assistant professors.\n23 The most competitive public institution category (made up mostly of flagship research institutions) in our sample is composed of only four universities for which we had the requisite data. Together, they enroll approximately 90,000 students compared to the more than 1 million students enrolled in public competitive universities. These research universities cost taxpayers much more than nonresearch campuses because they receive substantially more federal and state subsidies. For example, a flagship such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill receives about twice as much in state appropriations and nine times as much in government contracts per FTE student as other public campuses in North Carolina.\n24 Calculated by multiplying the annual cost per student per year by an estimate of the amount of time it takes on average for a student to earn a bachelor's degree at the institutions in our sample and taking into account dropout rates (see the section Funds Paid to Government in the Appendix). Even as taxpayers funnel more money to more selective institutions, the number of students from low-income families who benefit from these higher subsidies declines.\n\u00ae foregone taxes). However, our calculations are based on the answer to a simple question: Did an institution pay taxes? If the answer is \"yes,\" then the taxes paid are \"credited\" to taxpayers. If the answer is \"no,\" the foregone taxes are treated as an implicit subsidy (i.e., \"expenditure\") that taxpayers must ultimately cover.\nThe result is the total annual benefit or cost to taxpayers. That amount is divided by the total number of full-time equivalent students in the institutions making up the sample of each of the 11 categories in order to calculate the annual benefit or cost to taxpayers per student per year. Once again, we adjust this amount to 2010 dollars.\nAs an example, Table 4 shows the \"bottom line\" calculations for the non/less selective institutions by control. The flows between schools in each sector clearly differ-for-profit institutions receive more money from the government in the form of Pell Grants, but this revenue is far less than the amount of direct subsidies that public institutions receive. When we look at the other side of the ledger-payments made by these institutions back to the government-we see that the tax exemptions granted to not-for-profit and public institutions cost taxpayers millions of dollars per year, while the for-profit institutions pay more than $300 million in taxes annually. Strictly from a taxpayer perspective, for-profit institutions represent year, and we adjust these amounts by changes in the consumer price index to reflect 2010 dollars."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "In the next step, we subtract the funds received from governments from the amount these institutions pay to the governments, including federal, state, and local taxes paid or foregone by the institutions 27 and the interest paid by students 28 on their loans. 29 Some may perceive a double-counting of taxes (once in the net benefit [paid] calculation and again when we calculate 26 We used 2007-08 IPEDS data to match the year NPSAS data were collected. We updated these figures to 2010 data to match the salary data reported by PayScale.com.\n27 Public and private not-for-profit institutions are tax-exempt and do not pay tax on investment income, increases to endowments (gifts), and real estate or operating revenues. For-profit institutions pay sales tax on revenues (which include Pell and Title IV loans) and income taxes on operating profits and investment income. In this study, we treat the foregone tax payments as an implicit subsidy and, therefore, a cost to the taxpayers. In contrast, taxes paid are a benefit received by taxpayers. Because there is no database covering the payments in lieu of property taxes made by public and not-for-profit colleges and universities, we were unable to account for them in our calculations. Moreover, these are voluntary payments and should not be treated the same as taxes. To see how the landscape on payments in lieu of property taxes is becoming an increasingly important issue as localities feel fiscal stress, see http://chronicle.com/article/Payments-in-Lieu-of-Taxes-/63804/.\n28 As a point of clarification, we note that, like Pell Grants, which are awarded to individuals and not the schools they attend, these interest payments are made by individuals, not institutions.\n29 Because the government uses collection methods that are hard for an individual to avoid (e.g., wage garnishment), the Federal Budget takes into account that the government collects 100 percent on average for each Title IV dollar loaned (\"principal\"), regardless of default rates. Given that the interest accrued while students are in school is included in the principal, we assume that the taxpayer benefits by an amount equal to the interest charged on unsubsidized loans (at 6.8 percent interest rate) and PLUS loans for parents of dependent students and graduate or professional degree students (at 8.5 percent interest rate) disbursed during the period. See the section Funds Paid to Government in the Appendix. Not surprisingly, at every level of selectivity, taxpayers gain less from public institutions than from private ones, whether these are not-for-profit or for-profit.\nThe two categories where schools are on average in the \"red\" from the taxpayers' perspective include only public institutions. We have noted in the Appendix that our cost estimates for the most selective public institutions (mostly flagship schools) are likely to be the most inflated because IPEDS, our primary data source for costs, does not allow us to estimate separately the state and other subsidies to graduate 31 The average annual government subsidy per student is derived from Appendix Table 8 by adding the total annual benefit (cost) to taxpayers of each of the Barron's ratings and dividing this sum by the total number of students in that rating.\na better deal than tax-exempt not-for-profit or public institutions."}, {"section_title": "30", "text": "One final trend should be highlighted. Our estimates point out that taxpayers are investing far more for each bachelor's degree awarded by the most selective institutions than they are investing in educating students in less selective institutions. But even as taxpayers funnel more money to more selective institutions, the number of students from low-income families who benefit from these higher subsidies declines. This is made clear in Table 5 , which shows that the concentration of Pell Grant students falls dramatically with increasing levels of selectivity just as the level of subsidy increases. Combining Pell Grant enrollments by selectivity with levels of taxpayer subsidies shows a perverse pattern: Students from low-income families are concentrated in colleges and universities that get the lowest levels of taxpayer support."}, {"section_title": "Overall Financial Returns to Taxpayers per Degree", "text": "In this final analysis, we estimate the net benefit to the taxpayer for bachelor's graduates from each of the 11 categories of schools by adding the net lifetime returns to taxpayers (lifetime taxes paid by degree holders, from Table 2 ) to the total cost to taxpayers per bachelor's degree (from Table 3 ). In Table 6 , we see that, in most cases, taxpayers more than share in the added income that graduates earn, making a \"profit\" 30 We recognize that taxpayers choose to subsidize the education provided by these institutions.

As expected, the savings from a 50 percent reduction in dropouts decline dramatically as one moves through more selective institutions (i.e., very, highly, and most competitive), where the costs are driven by other factors besides dropout rates. Indeed, a 50 percent reduction in dropouts at Barron's most competitive institutions amounts to savings of no more than 4 percent. We recognize that more is involved in evaluating these flagship campuses than simple profit/loss calculations and that we need to consider their importance in generating basic research, producing the next generation of researchers, and creating knowledgeingredients essential to maintaining the competitiveness of the American economy. These benefits may balance out the taxpayer costs these institutions incur for producing bachelor's degree students, but this is a policy decision for governors, state legislators, and other stakeholders to make, informed by accurate considerations of costs.\nFinally, we need to draw attention to the costs incurred by the nation's high college dropout rates. Policymakers in the states and the federal government, along with the nation's leading foundations, are now focusing on a productivity-driven \"completion agenda\" aimed at increasing the number of Americans with postsecondary credentials. Decreasing the number of college dropouts is important not only to ensure the competitiveness of the American economy in the future, but also because high dropout rates increase the cost of college degrees substantially.

A bachelor's degree, whether from a public, a not-forprofit, or a for-profit institution, pays a handsome net financial reward in comparison to a high school diploma-a reward that over a lifetime can range, on average, from a net present value in 2010 dollars of more than $230,000, at non/less selective not-forprofit colleges, to more than $550,000 at the most competitive not-for-profit institutions.\nGiven the importance of a college education to joining and staying in the middle class and the high cost of obtaining it, Who Wins? and Who Pays? are questions being asked today at kitchen tables and in the halls of government throughout the nation. This study shows that the answers are somewhat different than what is commonly found in the media. Much of the current debate about the cost and value of higher education has focused on how much students pay, how much they borrow, and how poorly some of them are being educated. Much less attention is being paid to how well or how badly taxpayers are being served both by the institutions they are helping to fund and by the students they have helped to graduate. This study has sought to rectify this imbalance. Taxpayers derive significant benefits from the higher wages college graduates earn relative to high school graduates. During the first decade following graduation, when most graduates are still in the early stages of their career, the net return to taxpayers is between $17,000 and $30,000 per graduate from schools in most levels of selectivity. The largest taxpayer gain comes from graduates of not-for-profit schools in the most competitive category, where graduates pay on average more than $37,000 in additional taxes.\nThe returns to taxpayers via additional tax receipts across the lifetime of bachelor's graduates range from $52,000 at non/less competitive not-for-profit schools to nearly $150,000 at the most competitive not-forprofit institutions. Except in the case of graduates from the most competitive not-for-profit institutions, graduates from public institutions, on average, provide a greater return to taxpayers via their income taxes.\nThe benefit to the taxpayer among graduates from forprofit institutions is, on average, slightly higher than that from graduates from non/less competitive not-forprofit colleges but lower than that from graduates in all other categories of control and levels of selectivity. As with first-decade results, graduates of the most competitive not-for-profit colleges and universities on average return to taxpayers more than graduates from equally selective public institutions."}, {"section_title": "Q: Who Pays?", "text": "A: Taxpayers, whose net return on their total investment in bachelor's degrees varies widely.\nWhile taxpayers derive substantial benefits from the higher wages college graduates earn relative to high school graduates, they also are investing substantial While during the first decade after graduation the costs of attending a not-for-profit institution, on average, leave bachelor's graduates with a lower financial return compared to those from public or forprofit institutions, over a lifetime, the highest earnings are found among graduates of the most selective notfor-profit colleges. In other words, a degree from an Ivy League university or a similarly elite not-for-profit campus pays off, as long as the graduate lives out his or her full work life."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "However, except for institutions in the most selective category, graduates of public colleges and universities have a higher net lifetime return than students in the more expensive not-for-profit institutions. As for bachelor's graduates of for-profit institutions, the value of whose degrees has recently been questioned by the media and some appointed and elected officials, during the first decade, their net returns are on average higher than those of graduates from public institutions of roughly the same or even somewhat higher levels of selectivity, and higher than the net returns to graduates from not-for-profit institutions at all levels of selectivity. Over their lifetime, graduates from forprofit institutions on average have done nearly as well as graduates from public colleges ($284,000 versus $306,000) and better, by 21 percent, than graduates from not-for-prof it institutions in comparable categories of selectivity-and 14 percent better than graduates of not-for-profit schools in the next higher \"competitive\" category. 33 As noted earlier, this study does not consider the value added of an education at these institutions-students with the credentials to get into one of these marquee universities may do quite well in the labor market, regardless what school they attended. We also do not consider the substantial differences in earnings between graduates in different fields. Some majors could make the cost of an Ivy League degree impossible to offset even over a work life of 40 years. We also recognize a similar problem in the comparison of the earnings of college graduates versus high school graduates. Because the distribution of high school graduates who choose to attend college is not random, some of the salary gains we observe could be driven by characteristics that are common among those who pursue a college degree rather than being the result of any value that a college education added.\n\u00ae in the form of Pell Grants pale in comparison to the size of these other subsidies. 34 Moreover, when the percentage of Pell Grant enrollments by selectivity is combined with levels of taxpayer subsidies, we can see that students from low-income families and minority students-composing the fastest growing segment of the population-are concentrated in colleges and universities that get the lowest levels of taxpayer support.\nWhile there may be legitimate reasons supporting these patterns of subsidies across institutions of higher education, we believe that in this time of fiscal shortages and challenges to higher education, debate must be informed by the data in this study.\n34 While our focus in this study is not on the \"price\" of higher education-what students are actually asked to pay (except as an intermediate variable in Appendix Table 7 )-the cost to students and their parents is so significant that it cannot be passed unmentioned. Details on how we arrived at the estimates on the annual and total cost of a bachelor's degree can be found in the Appendix (see Appendix  Table 7 ). Here it is enough to underline that the total real cost of a bachelor's degree, the ticket to a middle-class life, ranges on average between $82,000 at the for-profit colleges in our sample to $198,000 at the most selective not-for-profit institutions. Meanwhile, the maximum annual Pell Grant in 2010 was $5,550. As Kevin Carey recently observed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, \"low-income undergraduates are actually much worse off than equivalent students were 30 years ago. A student without a Pell Grant in 1980 paid less out of pocket to attend a public four-year university than a student with a Pell Grant pays today\" (http://chronicle.com/article/44-Billion-Ought-to-BuySome/126812/?sid=at&utm_source). amounts of money in colleges and universities to gain those benefits-and these investments are skewed toward more elite schools. We estimate that taxpayers are investing around $108,000 for each degree awarded by the most selective public institutions in our sample, far in excess of the amount they are investing in the degrees of students in non/less competitive public institutions ($68,000) or even very competitive ones ($61,000). Taxpayers also subsidize the costs of degrees in not-for-profit institutions, but at much lower levels. But even here, students graduating from the most selective not-for-profits receive far higher taxpayer subsidies than students who attend less selective ones. In contrast, taxpayers gain on average approximately $6,000 per bachelor's degree granted by the for-profit institutions in our study.\nWhen it comes to the overall financial return to taxpayers per degree-that is, when lifetime taxes paid by degree holders are compared to the total cost to taxpayers for each bachelor's degree-we calculate that taxpayers absorb losses producing graduates from public institutions that are classified as non/less competitive and most competitive. Taxpayer financial benefits from graduates of public competitive, very competitive, and highly competitive schools are positive but lower than from graduates from not-for-profit colleges. At the same time, on average, the benefit to taxpayers from graduates of for-profit and notfor-profit institutions, which receive significantly lower taxpayer subsidies, ranges from $61,000 for the former to $88,000 for the most competitive not-for-profit schools.\nWe have documented substantial taxpayer subsidies to students in most colleges and universities-through direct appropriations to public institutions or tax subsidies to not-for-profit colleges. The federal government also supports students directly through the Pell Grant program, which is targeted toward students with financial needs and is designed to allow them to attend college when they might otherwise have not been able to do so. But taxpayer subsidies in the three lowest levels of selectivity, reducing the number of dropouts by half would cut the cost of producing a graduate by more than 20 percent. Efforts to increase completion should be focused on these schools, where the problem of low graduation rates is most severe and where the payoffs are potentially the greatest.\n\u2022 Focus support for completion on the neediest students . If the nation is to retain its competitive edge, it must reverse the current policies that today result in providing the lowest levels of taxpayer support to the institutions that enroll the highest percentage of students from low-income families, nontraditional students, and minority studentsthe fastest growing segments of the population. Through incentives that affect how appropriations of state support are made and how Title IV funds are administered, states and the U.S. Department\nFrom the data presented in this study, several broad policy considerations seem appropriate:\n\u2022 Reward completion and retention . Given the financial return to graduates for each completed bachelor's degree and the high cost of dropouts, the nation must focus its resources and policies on increasing degree completions and reenrollments. One way to do this is for states to make a substantial share of their appropriations based on performance rather than enrollment. A complementary process is for states to participate in the Alliance of States initiative of Complete College America and actively work to make college completion a top policy priority. 35 The U.S. Department of Education can contribute to this process by making continued Pell Grant eligibility subject to periodic performance reviews.

Given that this interest, accrued while students are in school, is included in the principal, we assume that the taxpayer benefits by an amount equal to the interest charged on this and any other types of loans while the student is in school. 58 We did not calculate the interest earned on unsubsidized and PLUS (Parent and Grad) loans that accrued while the student was in school on an NPV basis because these dollars are rolled into the \"principal\" loan balance in that same period and subject to future payments of interest. Because the government uses collection methods that are hard for an individual to avoid (e.g., wage garnishment), we assume that the government collects the full principal owed and do not discount the interest earned.\n59 This is consistent with the Federal Budget, which also assumes that the government collects 100 percent on average for each Title IV dollar loaned (\"principal\"), regardless of default rates. 60 We used historical data from 2007-08 for all the input components.\nWe combine taxes foregone and taxes paid to measure the net tax flow between institutions and government. We are likely overstating the extent of foregone taxes because some institutions make voluntary payments in 58 We calculate the interest paid by the type of loan issued and the prevailing interest rate in 2008 based on the program funding source: unsubsidized loans: 6.8 percent; Parent PLUS: 8.4 percent for not-forprofit and for-profit; 8.2 percent for public institutions; Grad PLUS: 8.5 percent for not-for-profit and for-profit; 8.3 percent for public institutions.\n59 In addition, while one could argue that these future interest dollar payments could be discounted, we did not take them into consideration here because of the limitations on accurately gathering the measure we would need, such as average length student loans outstanding, average student loan balances, and the like. What we do know, as noted here, is that the government collects 100 percent of the principal balance, and that is all that is included in our analysis.\nunsubsidized. The primary difference is the point at which interest begins to accrue. No interest accrues on a subsidized loan and no principal is due until the end of the six-month grace period that begins after a student graduates, leaves the institution, or drops below half-time enrollment (six units). Therefore, the government subsidized Title IV loans (FFEL 55 and Direct Loans) represent a cost to the federal government and the taxpayers. We estimate the costs of this subsidy to be the equivalent of the average three-month Treasury bill rate 2.91 percent 56 times the total subsidized loan disbursements made during academic year 2007-08. 57 As with other calculations, this was converted into 2010 dollars.\n\u2022 Total subsidies via students = (Amount of subsidized Direct Loan + amount of subsidized Federal Family Education Loan) \u00d7 2.91%\n\u2022 Research Expense (IPEDS): These expenditures are included in funds received from government. Because they are funds dedicated for specific activities that usually have little to do with bachelor degree production, they are subtracted from the amount received from government.

A positive value means the college graduate has a net benefit from the college education compared with a high school graduate.\n\u2022 Average Financial Return to the Taxpayers by a Bachelor's Degree Versus High School Diploma: While most of the financial rewards to earning a college degree accrue to the individual, the federal and state governments \"share\" in these benef its by collecting taxes on the larger income stream."}, {"section_title": "50", "text": "The average financial return to the taxpayers equals the NPV of the average income tax (including both federal and state income taxes) an individual with a bachelor's degree will pay for the first decade and over his or her lifetime minus the same sums calculated for a high school graduate. In order to estimate financial return to taxpayers, we calculate tax as percentage of adjusted gross income (AGI) using the most recently available AGI and average total income tax data from the Internal Revenue Service. 51 See Appendix Table 5 for these rates. As noted in the body of the study, we increase the additional federal tax payments by an additional 25 percent, which is the national average of state income tax collections relative to federal income tax collections. 52 50 Note that these tax payments are calculated on the additional incomes earned by college graduates relative to the taxes paid by high school graduates. 51 This is from IRS, 2008, \"Appendix IPEDS does not report revenue or expense separated by undergraduate or graduate student status. Therefore, we first use the total reported cost divided by all FTE students in the school year to obtain annual cost per student. Because graduate education is more expensive than undergraduate education, our cost to taxpayers per undergraduate degree is likely overestimated. Among public institutions, this bias is most severe for highly and most selective institutions, where more than 20 percent of students are graduate students; there is little difference among the three less selective levels of public colleges and universities, where 85 percent or more of the students are undergraduates. Among not-for-profit schools, the pattern is less linear, but among the most selective not-for-profits, the costs are most overstated because more than one quarter of the students in these institutions are graduate students. In for-profit institutions, costs are also likely overstated because more than 20 percent of their students are at the graduate level-although the bias here may not be as severe because for-profit institutions tend not to invest heavily in the most expensive graduate degree programs, such as those in the natural and physical sciences."}, {"section_title": "61", "text": "\u2022 Foregone Taxes on Investment Income: According to the IRS, the standard federal corporate tax rate is 35 percent for income greater than $18.3 million. 62 State corporate tax rates vary from zero (e.g., in Nevada and Wyoming) to 9.99 percent in Pennsylvania. We use 5 percent as an estimate of the average state corporate tax rate across the nation and apply this rate to all education sectors.\n\u2022 Foregone taxes on investment income = Investment income \u00d7 40% (35% federal plus 5% state tax)\n\u2022 Foregone Taxes on Endowment Contributions: We assume that contributors to university endowments would generate taxable income levels that fall at least in the 25 percent federal tax brackets. It is likely that many of the individuals making contributions have taxable income levels that would fall in higher tax brackets, but we use this rate as a conservative estimate for calculating these foregone taxes.\n\u2022 Foregone taxes on endowments = Grants or gifts \u00d7 25%\n61 We do not consider foregone taxes on operating revenues received by public or not-for-profit institutions because they have none, given that they are not organized as revenue-generating entities. Table 8 , we present the values of the key outcome measure: the weighted total benefit/ cost to the taxpayers per degree.\nIPEDS reports four-, five-, and six-year graduation rates."}, {"section_title": "64", "text": "By multiplying this graduation rate by the Graduate Rate Survey (GRS) cohort, we know the number of students who completed in each of these years. We multiply the number of students by the annual cost per student times the number of years to graduation. Summing gives us the cost incurred to produce a graduate within the six-year window defined by the Student-Right-To-Know (SRK) and Campus Security Act of 1990 (codified in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092; U.S. Public Law 101-542).\nWe also include the costs incurred by students who do not graduate. IPEDS reports a first-year retention rate. We subtract this from 100 percent to get an estimate of the dropout rate. We multiply this rate by the size of the GRS cohort to calculate the number of students who dropped out in Year 1. Unfortunately, IPEDS does not report retention rates after the first year. However, using the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) survey, Nate Johnson has calculated nationwide actual attrition rates in each year beginning in Year 2 and ending in Year 6. 65 Because we do not have annual rates for individual campuses, we use these national rates to estimate the number of dropouts each year in each campus. The rates (and hence the numbers) of dropouts fall dramatically over time, but the amount of money spent on each student increases year after year (i.e., a student who drops out after three years costs more than a student who drops out after one year). We add these additional costs to the direct outlays on each graduate. These costs are standardized by the number of graduates, which is our estimate of the cost per bachelor's degree. "}]
