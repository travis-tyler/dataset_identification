The implications of this work will provide planners and regional analysts more insight as to how some LULC categories attract more lightning than others, as well as how CG lightning is sporadic and complicated to model. Some limitations of this research are that the lightning data utilized in this study are not point data, complicating the measurement of spatial shifts in lightning occurrence since raster cells are fixed to a specific latitude and longitude.

Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Why Study Lightning?", "text": "Lightning is a phenomenon that has perplexed, terrified, amazed, and devastated humans and other organisms. It is one of the world's most dangerous, but often underestimated, severe weather phenomena and it continues to claim dozens of lives every year in the United States (Curran et al., 2000;NWS, 2016;Holle, 2016). Fulminologists-scientists who study atmospheric electricity-have generated substantial information regarding the development of lightning. Lightning is formed when small particles of iceknown as graupel (Figure 1.1)form inside a cloud. The graupel is ionized through collisions with other particles in the cloud that are driven by powerful updrafts; this process is known as an electron avalanche (Cooray, 2015).  , hail, sleet, and snow, respectively (NWS, 2016). Once enough electrically charged particles surpass the threshold of atmospheric insulation, a stepped leader (Figure 1.2)-a concentrated current of energy that is negatively or positively charged propagating toward the surface-will connect with a vertically-propagating stepped leader from the surface or object on Earth, and the resulting phenomena is the lightning flash (Cooray, 2015). Thunder is the acoustic aftermath of a lightning flash, caused by rapid heating and expansion of the surrounding air, which has been recorded to reach temperatures of up to 6000 K (Rakov and Uman, 2003). Most people who are aware of the hazard of lightning often jest about the statistical probability of being struck, which is 1 in 1,042,000 (NWS, 2013). This fact likely causes many to neglect the safety methods disseminated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS), and fatalities continue to occur. However, a brief analysis of lightning fatalities shows that the total has decreased over time for the country and Louisiana (Figure 1.3;Curran et al., 2000;Roeder et al., 2015;NWS, 2016). Louisiana is ranked ninth among the states in lightning-induced deaths per year (Holle, 2016), despite having a population that ranks 25th. Louisiana often has the second highest rate of lightning frequency in the United States. Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama also have high flash frequencies (Holle, 2016). Florida's high flash rate exists because of its proximity to the atmospheric features required to create a thunderstorm, such as convection, moisture, and heat (Zhu et al., 2015). Louisiana is also in a similar position; although it lacks the persistent convective enhancement of peninsular Florida, the state has a constant supply of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico that fuels atmospheric instability for a substantial number of days throughout the year. In addition to moisture (Lericos et al., 2002) and pollution (Smith et al., 2005). Instrumentation designed to detect lightning has improved in recent decades. This has allowed atmospheric scientists to create climatological averages of lightning over specific areas, and of course to research the spatio-temporal patterns of lightning. Although there have been many tools for examining lightning in past years (e.g. boys cameras, cloud chambers, lightning chimes), modern ground-based electromagnetic sensor and orbiting satellites in space keep a far more accurate and precise count of lightning totals on a near-real-time basis over far wider areas than ever before. Despite their many advantages, weaknesses of the modern lightning detection systems exist. Specifically, ground-based measurement systems often detect electromagnetic perturbations only to a limited height of the atmosphere, whereas satellite instrumentation can only sense the perturbations down to a limited depth of the atmosphere and may confuse lightning with other distortions of light in the Earth-atmosphere system (Boccippio et al., 2000;Boccippio et al., 2002;Ushio et al., 2002;Mach et al., 2007;Beirle et al., 2014. Studies have consistently shown that ground-based detection systems are more precise, accurate, and reliable than their space-based counterparts (Idone et al., 1998;Biagi et al., 2007;Holle, 2014;Mallick et al., 2014). Rapid technological advancements continue to further lightning observation and study. Lightning detection systems consistently show that strikes are more frequent on tall, ellipsoid-shaped buildings and surfaces that can generate a large electrical field (Rakov and Uman, 2003 (Roeder et al., 2015;Cecil et al., 2015;Dowdy, 2016). In addition, LULC due to anthropogenic activity has also been explored through geographic research methods (Contiu & Gorza, 2016;Maclaurin and Leyk, 2016). This chapter will review the spatio-temporal and other geographically-focused studies."}, {"section_title": "Diurnal Lightning Studies", "text": "Diurnal patterns of lightning have been investigated thoroughly. Wallace (1975) found that thunderstorm activity depends upon diurnal kinematic and thermodynamic variables in the U.S., with most locations experiencing a peak in severe thunderstorms in the afternoon. Easterling and Robinson (1985) divided the U.S. into nine regions based on diurnal thunderstorm tendencies and found that the central region's thunderstorms occur mostly at night, while eastern and western thunderstorms display an afternoon preference, and those in the Northeast and the Pacific coast are rare. L\u03ccpez and Holle (1998) showed that Colorado storms are more commonly characterized by a west to east shift in maximum frequency from early morning to late evening, while Florida has lightning patterns that tend to be maximized between Cape Canaveral and Orlando in the afternoon. Carey and Rutledge (2003) analyzed the diurnal characteristics of lightning over the Kansas/Colorado border to Minnesota; their results showed that the amperage of a lightning flash depends upon the strength, size, and location of the storm, but overall the most powerful flashes occur in the afternoon. Smith et al. (2005) found that over the Gulf of  2014found evidence using data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) that, over the U.S., lightning tends to occur between 1200 and 1800 local time, but occurrences before noon are more common over areas along the Gulf Coast and portions of the East Coast than elsewhere. Virts et al. (2015) found summer frequencies of lightning strikes to be maximized during the late afternoon and early evening, in general across the contiguous U.S., with lightning tending to occur most frequently from sunrise to late morning in the northern Gulf of Mexicoshowing evidence of strong regional influence on diurnal lightning patterns."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Lightning Studies", "text": "Seasonal lightning studies have been conducted around the world. Collier et al. (2006) reported that in southern Africa the highest flash rate is in the summer over Madagascar and South Africa. In a global study of seasonal lightning variability Yang et al. (2009) determined that Africa and Asia contains higher rates of CG lightning than any other location on the globe. Tinmaker et al. 2014identified a bimodal pattern of frequency over the Indian Seas, with peaks in April and October, corresponding to the timing of the monsoon front. Virts et al. (2015) showed that summer is the most active lightning season over the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding coastal areas and that most lightning activity is concentrated over the land. A lightning climatology for the U.S. Southwest in conjunction with the North American monsoon showed a drastic increase in lightning during the summer, when the monsoon period is at its strongest (Holle and Murphy 2015). Dowdy (2016) concluded that ENSO has the strongest influence on seasonal lightning variability around the globe."}, {"section_title": "Lightning Frequency", "text": "Climatological studies of lightning across the U.S. have been completed for various regions, with data for global tropical coverage (Figure 2.1) and global coverage ( Figure 2.2) also having become recently available. Changnon (1988aChangnon ( , 1988b showed that the peak frequency of  thunder events in the U.S. tends to occur the most over the Gulf Coast and the least over the West Coast. Watson and Holle (1996) found that in the southeastern U.S., the CG strike frequency is maximized along the shores of Florida and that urban areas often show enhanced frequency. Hodanish et al. (1997) found that for each season, synoptic and mesoscale mechanisms influence the location of lightning occurrence in Florida. Huffines and Orville (1999) found that Florida has the highest lightning strike density in the U.S. due to its unique geographic features that allow convection to promote thunderstorm development rapidly. Orville and Huffines (1999)  Synoptic-scale spatial patterns have revealed previously unknown characteristics of thunderstorms. In analyzing summer thunderstorm features over the southeastern U.S., Murphy and Konrad (2005) found, not surprisingly, that larger thunderstorms tend to produce more lightning than more localized thunderstorms. Williams (2005) determined that, while lightning is sensitive to temperature when analyzed under smaller temporal scales, under more extensive temporal analysis the connection diminishes for global lightning occurrences. Lightning climatologies focused elsewhere in the world have also been completed in recent years, in response to newly-available and detailed lightning data availability. Burrows et al. (2002) reported that Canadian lightning flashes are concentrated most heavily in southern Alberta, southeast of Nova Scotia, and southern Ontario. Burrows and Kochtubajda (2010) concurred, concluding that Canadian lightning maxima tends to occur nearest to the U.S. border in areas where heat, moisture, and instability tend to be abundant. In a review of lightning in the tropical Western Hemisphere, Pinto et al. (2007) found that lightning flash densities vary from 19 to 65 flashes km -2 year -1 . Antonescu and Burecea (2010) (Todd, 1977). Vogelmann et al. (1998) used  , Tan et al. (2010 found that urban area increased substantially, grassland area increased moderately, and barren and forest area decreased (Tan et al., 2010). Environmental impacts of development have become a ubiquitous concern in recent decades, with a number of studies using Landsat data to highlight connections between land modification and the environmental change created by it. For example, Kalnay and Cai (2003) found that a drastic reduction in diurnal temperature range accompanied urbanization globally. Tang et al. (2005) found that an increase in urbanization would subsequently lead to an increase in runoff of harmful chemicals into the Muskegon River watershed in Michigan. Scanlon et al. (2005) suggested that urban development reduces the amount of moisture in the soil. Seneviratne et al. (2006) showed that an increase in climatic variability in Europe would place a greater stress on moisture availability in soilwhich in turn would be increasingly limited should urban expansion continue. Chen et al. (2006) determined that urban heat island patterns were scattered among the land types in the Pearl River Delta of China, with developed areas (concrete) and bare land being the warmest. Fortunately, even the long-problematic constraint of cloud cover in Landsat based studies was found to be of only minor concern in such LULC change studies, since these typically only require one cloud-free image per year (Ju and Roy, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Land Change Influences on Lightning", "text": "Despite the abundance of literature on lightning climatology and use of Landsat imagery for environmental change analysis, there remains a gap in the literature on the overlap of these two important topics. This section will focus on explaining how changes to atmospheric particulate flux, often derived from LULC, near developed areas may influence lightning, as well as how urban environments can perturb the typical lightning behaviors. Urban areas are well-known to increase the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms (Ashley et al., 2012;Harberlie et al., 2015). Urban influences on lightning flash frequency could occur due to increases in atmospheric particulates, enhanced convection, or a greater availability of attractive objects. In an analysis of lightning patterns around 16 major U.S. cities from 1989-1992, Westcott (1995) found that areas downwind and over cities experienced a 40-80% increase in lightning activity over adjacent environs. Naccaroto et al. (2003) found a 60-100% enhancement in CG lightning over urban areas in Brazil, with this increase attributed to enhanced heat output from urban surfaces. Bentley and Stallins (2005) found that in Atlanta, Georgia, July is the most active lightning month, and that each season has its own predominant synoptic conditions for producing lightning when coupled with urban enhancement. In a followup study by Stallins and Bentley (2006), the northeast quadrant of Atlanta was found to support the most lightning, with the enhancement attributed to increased urban-induced instability. While high-quality work on the relationship between LULC change and environmental factors has been conducted, more work is needed to for a more complete understanding. In the next chapter, data and methods of how this thesis will explore the relationship between LULC change and lightning flash patterns will be completed."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3.

For this project, data from 1995 to 2011 are analyzed, so as to overlap with the temporal period of available data in the NOAA C-CAP data set. The data are provided to NOAA through a contract with Vaisala Inc.'s NLDN (Figure 3.10). These data come with their own coordinate reference system, which displays coordinates in meters instead of latitude/longitude. An adjustment of this projection was made, so that the lightning data projection matches the LULC classification data. derived products that can be disseminated. These products include daily tile summaries, daily, county and state counts for the continental U.S., and 4 km x 4 km Albers Equal Area gridded summaries, which are distributed in frequency by hour per month, by hour per year, by day, by month, and by year. In addition, NOAA's lightning products also consist of a positive polarity only database. Albers Equal Area was the map projection selected because of the importance of preserving area in any display of spatial density of lightning strikes. Frequency per month and per year data are utilized for addressing Research Objective 1 (\"Analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of cloud-to-ground lightning in the northern Gulf Coast region\"). Data sets such as the satellite-based LIS/OTD have far too much noise for such an analysis, because it detects intra-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-air lightning flashes. This would misconstrue the sample and introduce bias to the study, because non-CG flashes are presumably not as directly related to LULC. Therefore, only CG data are used. The cost of acquiring data from the NLDN directly has largely confined the examination of the accuracy of the NOAA database to Vaisala employees themselves. Vaisala associated scientist Kenneth Cummins confirmed that the NLDN was the most accurate of all lightning location systems in 2009 and would rapidly improve its accuracy in the coming years (Cummins and Murphy, 2009). Soon afterwards, scientists affiliated with Vaisala revealed accuracy ranges of their network between 90-95% in the U.S. and 86-92% for the entire globe, with little variation at night (Demetriades et al., 2010;Cramer and Cummins, 2014). Data manipulation requirements are minimal. Becasue this database is a derived product, most errors have already been corrected. The first step was importing the netCDF into QGIS and implementing a projection change from Albers to the projection of the LULC change data used in this project, which is Albers Conformal Conic, which does not affect the frequency of the data at all. The second step was completing a \"raster align\" in QGIS, which is equivalent to the raster registration tool in ArcMap. This procedure allows the cells of the lightning data to be superimposed on the cells of the LULC classification data. The raster align function in QGIS also clips the portion of data from the entire file so that analysis of data can be restricted to the intended region. A sample of the extracted data is provided for the northern Gulf Coast ( Figure   3.11). Lastly, all files were exported as GRID files, which maintains their values in a geocoded format.

A linear regression with a categorical variable simply takes a dependent variable and tests it among factorsor LULC in this case."}, {"section_title": "One-way Analysis of Variance and Scheff\u00e9's 95% Simultaneous Confidence Interval Test", "text": "One-way ANOVA is a statistical method that tests for a difference between means among sample sets of two or more variables. Specifically, it determines whether any differences amongst the means exist between two or more samples. Any significant difference of means between two or more variables are indicated by a small enough p-value for the ANOVA (generally > 0.05) that allows one to reject the null hypothesis of no significant differences of mean between any of the sampled variables. The assumptions for ANOVA are identical to that of a linear regression test. As such, ANOVA is an appropriate inferential statistical method for analyzing differences between data sets, and influences of extraneous variables on other various variables within a data set. It offers the advantage over t-tests of providing comparisons of the mean from multiple variables, taken two at a time, simultaneously. This minimizes the possibility of committing a type I error (Freund et al., 2010) as compared to conducting multiple t-tests. The equation for ANOVA is as follows: where F is the ANOVA coefficient, MST is the mean sum of squares due to treatment, and MSE is the mean sum of squares due to error. ANOVA will be employed with the LULC classification type being the treatment variable; gridded lightning frequencies represent the cases for which the mean is calculated and tested for difference against the mean of the other LULC types. Because the study area is relatively small, differences in synoptic patterns conducive to lightning are assumed to be negligible. This analysis will show whether differences exist between groups, and, with further information on how LULC changes have occurred over time, could give an improved explanation for changes in lightning totals over the total period of record. ANOVA is easily executed in R, QGIS, and ArcGIS through add-on modules and packages. If ANOVA results suggest significant differences in lightning frequency by LULC type (i.e., a rejection of the null hypothesis), Scheff\u00e9's 95% Simultaneous Confidence Interval Test (Scheff\u00e9, 1959) will be conducted to determine which LULC types differ statistically significantly from which others."}, {"section_title": "Geographically Weighted Regression", "text": "A GWR (Fotheringham, 2002) and one-way ANOVA test will be completed to address Research Objective 2 (\"Investigate the influence of LULC types and land change on lightning frequency and patterns over the northern Gulf Coast region\") by determining the extent to which LULC is associated with lightning patterns over Louisiana. GWR is a geospatial method of determining the change in relationship across time and space between two spatially similar values. In contrast to linear regression, GWR considers spatial bounds as a means of weighting the relationship. GWR is represented by the following equation: where \u03b2(ui,vi) indicates the vector of the location-specific parameter estimates, (ui,vi) represents the geographic coordinates of location i in space, and is the error term with mean zero and common variance \u03c3 2 (GEOPOPSCI, 2016). The assumptions for GWR are the same as linear regression or ordinary least squares regression (Fotheringham, 2002). Specifically, the data must be normally distributed, have no multicollinearity, be homoscedastic, and have random variance for all independent and dependent variables (Fotheringham, 2002). GWR will provide evidence regarding whether local LULC changes are associated with lightning frequency. Potential pitfalls of GWR are location bias and the inability to detect anomalous LULC-related climatic patterns that could lead to a sudden shift in lightning patterns. GWR is easily executable in R, QGIS, and ArcGIS through add-on modules and packages. First, however, an amalgamated lightning raster and the classification rasters must be converted to point shapefiles in ArcMap. This is because GWR only accepts point data for analysis and must be given specified coordinate boundaries. Once this step is completed using the raster-to-point tool in ArcMap, each LULC file and lightning file are conjoined to be analyzed by the GWR tool in ArcMap. Chapter 4 will describe and interpret the results of these methods.                  for trend identifies no significant temporal trend in areal lightning frequency over the period (Table 4.1). The 17-year climatology map shows that most of the area over land sees an abundance of CG lightning flashes per year. Interestingly, there are areas in southern Louisiana (eg. Lake Charles) on land that see less-frequent lightning than nearby surrounding areas. In addition, areas near Baton Rouge and the I-10/I-12 corridor heading to New Orleans and Biloxi, respectively, both show local maxima in lightning frequencies. This could be evidence of the sea breeze effect, but most likely it is due to the abundance of taller objects that attract lightning by weakening the electric field between the cloud and the ground. CG lightning over the Gulf of Mexico appears to be significantly less than CG lightning over land. Aside from the absence of built-up areas over water, ocean mixing due to winds in a storm make it difficult for an electric field with the appropriate charge to develop to attract a stepped leader.  Table 4.1 Shows resulting statistics for trend line fitted to 17-year lightning climatology. classes. The largest minimum and maximum flashes are also observed in the developed tiles, this is strong evidence towards an urban-lightning relationship over the temporal period studied.  \nResults from the GWR show static values between all four years of LULC classification data studied. Total lightning frequencies from 1995 to 2011 were utilized as the dependent variable, and the LULC classes for each year were the independent variable. Based on the weight placed on spatial coordinates by the GWR and the derivation of coordinates from raster data that were affixed to each 4 km x 4 km cell across the study region, few spatial differences in        (Curran et al., 2000;NWS, 2016), it is important to maintain an accurate assessment of all severe weather impacts in the U.S. to mitigate further damage. The results of this study yielded insightful observations regarding the patterns and placement of CG lightning in southern Louisiana and its peripheral areas. The lightning climatology revealed inter-annual frequency and spatial fluctuations for the study area. One interesting feature is that CG lightning always appears to have its strongest values over land, which coincide with the results of previous research (Orville et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2008). Another interesting observation from the lightning climatology is the sudden increase in lightning totals leading up to 2005 when the Gulf Coast experienced an extreme hurricane season. While this study does not necessarily suggest there is a relationship between hurricanes and lightning, the environment around that time should be investigated further for any possible connection. After 2005, there was a sharp decrease in the frequency of CG lightning in the area. While the trend analysis was not statistically significant, an anomalous period of increased total lightning between 2003 and 2005 could generate questions about whether changes in temperature or meteorological forcing mechanisms influenced CG lightning in the region. The results of the linear regression analysis showed strong relationships between all LULC classes and lightning frequency except for developed medium-intensity and estuarine forested wetland. Results from Scheff\u00e9's test showed that lightning frequencies in developed medium-intensity cells were the highest for all four years of LULC classification analyzed. Results from GWR showed very little change in relationship between LULC and lightning frequencies for the 1996-2010 period. However, this result could be influenced by the spatial constraint of the point data. Further analysis with point data would need to be completed to ascertain the true characteristics of the spatio-temporal patterns of lightning. Among the other LULC categories, results were mostly consistent between years. This result is likely due to prevailing climatic patterns, which determine where electrified storms occur and how much lightning is experienced within that region, and/or the small number of years analyzed. While the highest means of lightning are in urbanized LULC types, there is some possibility that the result occurs not because of increased lightning rates over these types but instead because of increased frequency of thunderstorm tracks over urban areas (Maier et al., 1981;Nastos et al., 2014). It is in this regard that a higher-resolution data set could provide more insight into the location of CG lightning flashes over time. The sudden increase in lightning frequency of the estuarine aquatic bed LULC type to the top three could again be due to a change in climate forcing mechanisms, or (more likely) due to the observed local changes in that LULC category (eg. Lightning rod installation or industrial equipment), thereby enhancing the amount of lightning observed over that class. On land, a temporal decrease in lightning frequency over deciduous forests occurred, along with an increase in evergreen forests. Again, these results could be due to changes in LULC, as shown in Figure   3.9. Overall, the results of this thesis provided an abundance of information regarding LULC relationship to lightning frequency. While urbanized areas tend to have the highest mean lightning frequencies on a per-pixel basis, variation in other LULC means could lead to greater shifts in lightning amounts between LULC categories besides the urban types. In addition, with several ocean, coastal, and land modifications being undertaken in the area now, future trends could see an increase in urban lightning totals due to more development spurred by population growth. Ultimately, it is hoped that the results of this thesis will help inhabitants of the Gulf, particularly in Louisiana, to better prepare for severe thunderstorms and provide industrial management teams and environmental planners the information needed to establish greater safety measures to prevent or mitigate damages."}, {"section_title": "Linear Regression", "text": "A Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for normality was completed before proceeding with the linear regression test, and a p-value below 0.0001 was recorded (Massey, 1951).

The negative residuals represent areas of under estimation and the positive residuals represent over estimation. We observe the highest residuals in urban environments but also in south central   present because these were discarded during data handling to prevent error due to the presence of unavailable data and unnecessary zero values.

LULC categories denoted by \"a\" in tables 4.5 -4.8 are in the group of LULCs with the highest means (while not differing significantly from each other), those denoted by \"b\" in the tables are in the group of LULCs with the second-highest means (while not differing significantly from each other), those denoted by \"c\" are in the group with the lowest means and are not significantly different from     each other.

The LULCs that have the highest three means are among the highest. This could be due to a change in the amount of estuarine aquatic bed over time, but figure 3.9 states there was no change. Since it is known that Louisiana is experiencing coastal erosion (Williams et al., 2012;Visser et al., 2013), aquatic environments are changing constantly, and could result in changing land-air interactions as well."}]
