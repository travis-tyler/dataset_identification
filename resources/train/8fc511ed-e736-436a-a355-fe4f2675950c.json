[{"section_title": "ANATOMY AND BIOLOGY OF THE PROSTATE", "text": "The prostate is a \u00aebromuscular gland surrounding the male urethra (see Fig. 1 ,2). It is located behind the symphysis pubis, inferior to the bladder and anterior to the rectum. The prostate is traversed by the urethra and both ejaculatory ducts. It is divided into anatomical areas and zones. The distal glandular prostate constitutes around 95% of the glandular tissue and is divided into two regions: the peripheral and central zone, comprising nearly 75% and 25% of its volume, respectively. The \u00aebromuscular stroma blends proximally with the detrusor muscle \u00aebres that surround the urethra at the bladder neck. The proximal glandular prostate consists of the transition zone, which accounts for about 5% of the glandular element, and a periurethral zone. It is of clinical importance to distinguish the transition zone from the rest of the prostate. Whilst it rarely develops a malignant cancer, it is the sole site for the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Histologically, the prostate is composed of non-striated \u00aebromuscular tissue and glandular tissue. Numerous follicles and papillae open into 12\u00b120 excretory ducts. The ductal epithelium is responsible for production and secretion of prostate speci\u00aec antigen (PSA). The basement membrane creates a barrier preventing escape of PSA into the peripheral circulation. It is the disruption of this barrier by disease which allows an in\u00afux of PSA into the systemic circulation.\nprostatitis is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, dysuria, haematuria and urinary frequency. Most causative organisms, usually derived from the urinary tract, are sensitive to the quinolone antibiotics e.g. cipro\u00afoxacin.\nWhilst modern antibiotics have reduced the incidence of acute prostatitis, its ability to elevate the serum PSA level has led to increased clinical prominence. 2, 3 Pansadoro et al. 4 found that 71% of men with acute prostatitis had elevations of their serum PSA, mostly in the 4\u00b1 10 mg/L range. This elevation is usually transient, lasting for about 6 weeks. 5 Chronic prostatitis, now increasingly common, runs a more indolent course and is frequently sterile. 6 Serum PSA concentrations are increased in less than 10% of patients. 4 Other non-infective causes of prostatic inammation, including urethral catheterization, acute urinary retention, prostate biopsy and prostatic massage, are also capable of causing an increase in the serum PSA concentration. 7 Serum PSA concentrations return to normal once the acute in\u00afammation has subsided. Several authors have shown that standard digital rectal examination produces a small, clinically insigni\u00aecant rise in the serum PSA."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia Whilst BPH is one of the most common ailments affecting ageing men, with more than 60% in their sixties having histologically proven disease, only two-thirds will develop symptoms. Stromal nodules enlarge and coalesce, producing urethral compression. 9 Subsequently, the bladder undergoes secondary changes resulting in detrusor hypertrophy, \u00aebrosis, diverticula formation and eventually detrusor failure if the disease progresses unchecked.\nSymptoms are best divided into those of out\u00afow obstruction and those of secondary bladder irritation, and are generally referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Since there is much subjective variation in symptomatology, the objective International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was developed. 10 In uncomplicated cases, investigations are usually limited to digital examination of the prostate, uro\u00afowmetry and measurement of the post-void residual bladder volume.\nTreatment is aimed at symptomatic relief and options vary as to the best approach: watchful waiting, drug therapy and surgery. Pharmacologically, the a adrenergic antagonists were known to relieve symptoms and to have revolutionized the management of BPH.\n11 They act to relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck. Other commonly used pharmacological agents include 5-a reductase inhibitors e.g., \u00aenasteride.

It has withstood many other competitors (e.g. microwave, laser, ultrasound) as well as the test of time.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia leads to an increase in prostatic size and a subsequent increase in the serum PSA concentration. Stamey et al. 13 studied the PSA of men with BPH undergoing prostatectomy. Using the Yang Pros-check assay, they attributed 0\u00b43 mg/ L of serum PSA to each gram of prostate tissue. Hence, the concept of PSA density was introduced to differentiate a small gland with high PSA (likely to be malignant) and a large gland with a raised PSA appropriate to its size."}, {"section_title": "Adenocarcinoma of the prostate", "text": "Prostate speci\u00aec antigen's rapid rise in prominence is due to its close association with cancer of the prostate (CaP). Whilst this is the most common cancer in Western men, its relatively slow growth allows many men to`die with the disease rather than from it'. It is third to lung and large bowel cancer, in terms of male cancer deaths. In 1995 there were 8866 registered deaths in England and Wales from prostate cancer."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "The incidence has increased rapidly in recent years, which cannot be accounted for by better diagnosis of the disease alone."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "The prevalence of prostate cancer is proportional to age. The median age of affected men is around 72 years. Not all men with CaP develop invasive disease. Autopsy studies have shown foci of CaP in up to 50\u00b170% of men over 70 years. 16, 17 However, only 25% of these cancers are larger than 1 cm 3 in volume and likely to be signi\u00aecant. 18 Therefore, it appears that many men have microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma, which, paradoxically, never become clinically signi\u00aecant.\nGeographically, Scandinavia has the highest worldwide incidence (Sweden=75/100 000) and the Far East the lowest (Japan=8/100 000). When racial factors are compared, however, by far the highest incidence is amongst black men in the USA (152/100 000). 15 It appears that immigrants adopt the aetiological risks of their new country rather than retain those of their original country. Geographical trends have been used to try to establish aetiology for CaP. Pollutants, dietary factors, sexual activity, venereal disease and hormonal factors have all been implicated in different studies.\n19,20 Unlike breast cancer, it is clear that familial CaP is less common, accounting for possibly only 10% of cases. 21 Pathologically, adenocarcinomas represent 95% of prostate cancers, the rest consisting of sarcomas, lymphomas, squamous cell carcinomas and metastases from other sites. The majority (80%) of prostate tumours originate in the peripheral zone of the prostate, 22 the remaining few originating in the transition zone. Prostate cancer is a multifocal disease in more than 85% of prostatectomy specimens, with 70% having bilateral disease.\n23 Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is also found in many surgical specimens. This is characterized by cytologically atypical cells lining normal architectured ducts. Despite the close relationship between PIN and CaP, the absolute proof of PIN's natural history is lacking. However, when high-grade PIN alone is found in prostate biopsies, subsequent repeat biopsy shows CaP in 30\u00b150%. 24 As PIN does not lead to basement membrane disruption, serum PSA is unaffected. Tumour grade has best been de\u00aened by Gleason and Mellinger, 25 who looked at the macroscopic glandular differentiation of the tumour (score 1\u00b1 5). An overall sum is derived by adding the \u00aerst and second most predominant architectures. Prognosis is proportional to the sum score (worse for high scores). After initially localized growth, the tumour penetrates the capsule along perineural and lymphatic channels to reach the periprostatic tissues. The \u00aerst metastases appear in the local obturator lymph nodes. Circulating tumour cells then lodge in the skeleton, forming osteosclerotic metastases. Rarely, metastases are found in the liver, bladder and adrenal glands.\nWith the introduction of PSA, the presentation of CaP to the clinician has changed markedly. 17 Previously, nearly all tumours presented at an advanced stage with either skeletal metastases or bladder out\u00afow obstruction. Currently in the UK, over one-third of patients diagnosed with CaP presented to the urologist with only an elevated PSA. At diagnosis, 25% are found to have organcon\u00aened disease. 26 In the USA, where annual PSA screening has been advocated by the American Cancer Society, 27 60\u00b175% of patients present to their urologist with organ-con\u00aened disease. 28, 29 Data from the USA has also shown a reduction in the mean age at diagnosis, with the use of PSA testing. 30 However, despite increasing detection and radical treatment of early disease, the overall mortality rate does not appear to have fallen. 29, 31 It is suggested that screening has merely detected these tumours earlier, without treatment in\u00afuencing their natural history \u00b1 so-called`lead time bias '. 32 Due to the slow growth of CaP, the answers to PSA screening trials may not be available for several years. Currently, PSA screening for CaP is not advocated in the UK, 33,34 although the test is available to men who request it, following careful counselling. Once suspected, the diagnosis of CaP is con\u00aermed by a biopsy performed transrectally under ultrasound guidance.\nThe treatment options vary with tumour stage, patient \u00aetness and preference. Tumours suitable for cure from radical treatment must be con\u00aened within the prostate capsule and have no metastases. Since the most likely site for extralymphatic spread is the skeleton, a radionucleotide bone scan is the most useful radiological investigation. Whilst direct radiological pelvic imaging [either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] can show nodal enlargement over 1 cm in size, it will understage small nodal metastases and overstage reactive lymphadenopathy. As a result, most clinicians no longer use this imaging to stage the disease. The likelihood of extracapsular spread can be estimated by a combination of clinical examination, PSA concentration and grade of tumour. 35 Recent research has raised hopes for improved staging of CaP. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PSA mRNA, circulating prostatic epithelial cells can be identi\u00aeed. It is hoped this will identify men with microscopic metastases who are therefore not suitable for radical prostatectomy. 36 Some authors claim that this technique can be used for`molecular staging' of prostate cancer, though reproducibility and clinical applicability remain to be con\u00aermed.\nThe treatment of CaP is complex and much debated. For organ-con\u00aened CaP, the options vary between watchful waiting, radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy. In our unit the patient is educated about each choice before making an informed decision. Traditionally, surgery has been the preferred treatment. The complications from radical prostatectomy include erectile dysfunction (30%), urinary incontinence (8%) and mortality (0\u00b42%). 37 Radical radiotherapy offers an alternative to surgery. This can be external beam or by implant of radioactive seeds (brachytherapy). Whilst radiotherapy avoids surgery, it also has signi\u00aecant associated morbidity and mortality. Radiotherapy has never been proven in a clinical trial to be as ef\u00aecacious as surgery, although retrospective studies show comparable outcomes. 38 In watchful waiting, as the name suggests, treatment is only initiated for symptoms that develop from tumour growth. Because CaP is often slow growing, and radical treatment has signi\u00aecant morbidity, some patients choose watchful waiting, accepting continued quality of life rather than potentially increased quantity of life. Chodak 39 conducted a meta-analysis of 828 patients treated by watchful waiting. Eightyseven per cent of patients with Gleason score < 8 were alive at 10 years. In locally advanced disease, radical radiotherapy can be offered, with or without adjuvant androgen withdrawal. In metastatic prostate cancer, conventional treatment is by androgen withdrawal. The duration and degree of tumour regression following testosterone withdrawal is unpredictable, in some men lasting decades. However, most patients will escape hormonal control of the disease between 2\u00b13 years following initiation of therapy, and will have a subsequent limited life expectancy of 6\u00b19 months. Commonly used methods of androgen ablation include gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, surgical castration, and non-steroidal anti-androgens."}, {"section_title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF PSA", "text": "Prostate speci\u00aec antigen is a 28 400 Da glycoprotein 40 comprising 237 amino acid residues 41 with \u00aeve inter-chain disulphide bonds and approximately 8% carbohydrate in the form of a N-linked oligosaccharide sidechain. In seminal plasma PSA can be shown to exist in \u00aeve isoforms, two biologically active and differing in the degree of glycosylation, and three biologically inactive or`nicked' forms. 42 This inherent heterogeneity has proved problematic in the various puri\u00aecations, and some procedures have not yielded a product in which all isoforms are represented. Prostate speci\u00aec antigen exhibits serine protease activity (EC 3.4.21.77) similar to chymotrypsin. 43 Prostate speci\u00aec antigen is a member of the human kallikrein family, with which it shares considerable structural and functional homology and a gene location on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2\u00b1q13.4)."}, {"section_title": "44", "text": "Prostate speci\u00aec antigen, redesignated as hK3 in conformity with the uni\u00aeed nomenclature of the kallikreins, has 80% sequence homology with hK2 (glandular kallikrein) and 63% with hK1 (pancreatic\u00b1renal kallikrein). 45 Monoclonal antibodies to PSA have been classi\u00aeed by the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine (ISOBM) TD-3 workshop 46 into six major groupings by cross inhibition, af\u00aenity constant determination and by assay pairing.

Synthesis of PSA has also been demonstrated in a number of tumour cell-lines, notably neuroblastoma. 49 The function of PSA is to liquefy the seminal coagulum by proteolysis, with release of the entrapped spermatozoa, 50 and may have a bioactive role in fertilization. 51 In relation to carcinoma of the prostate the literature is confusing and even contradictory, with evidence promoting both its stimulatory and inhibitory role. 52 It has been shown that PSA can cleave insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3"}, {"section_title": "53", "text": "[liberating bioactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)], 54 activate the transforming growth factor (TGF-b) 55 and regulate the bioactivity of parathyroid hormone-related protein. 56 Recent experimental evidence suggests that PSA may also have antiangiogenic activity by inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation induced by \u00aebro-blast growth factor (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 57 PSA has also been shown to release angiostatin-like fragments from plasminogen."}, {"section_title": "58", "text": "Free and complexed PSA The predominant molecular form present in blood plasma is the 80\u00b190 kDa complex of PSA with a1-antichymotrypsin (ACT); free PSA represents a small but variable proportion of the total PSA (t-PSA) concentration. Minor fractions of PSA exist as complexes with other protease inhibitors, predominantly a2-macroglobulin (A2M), inter-a-trypsin inhibitor (IATI) and, at high concentrations, a1-antitrypsin (AAT). In seminal plasma, some 5% of the PSA is complexed with protein C inhibitor (PCI). 45 Whilst all commercial assays for PSA recognize free PSA (f-PSA) the PSA\u00b1ACT and PSA\u00b1AAT complexes, 59 and possibly also the PSA\u00b1IATI complex, none recognize the PSA\u00b1 A2M complex in which the PSA molecule is interiorized by the altered conformational structure of the inhibitor. 60 It can be shown that, in vitro, up to 60% of seminal plasma derived f-PSA will bind to A2M in 1\u00b13 hours at 37\u00b0C, the binding to ACT taking about 24 hours, and that to AAT 48 hours. f-PSA is mainly in the biologically inactive or`nicked' form, with cleavage of the polypeptide chain between residues 85\u00b186, 145\u00b1146 or 182\u00b1183, 61 and in this state will not bind to the protease inhibitors.

Although differences due to calibration have been minimized in recent years by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommendations 64 and programmes by both the Institute of Reference Methods and Materials of the European Community (IRMM) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to certify reference materials or standards, differences related to reaction kinetics and antibody speci\u00aecity remain. These are a direct result of the multitudinous molecular forms in which PSA exists in the serum.\nProstate speci\u00aec antigen has \u00aeve major epitope domains. Four of these domains have been tentatively localized to amino-acid residues 1\u00b113, 53\u00b164, 80\u00b191 and 151\u00b1164, 65 with antibodies speci\u00aec to f-PSA binding to the kallikrein loop between residues 84\u00b191. The latter domain incorporates the active site and is blocked by complexing with ACT. In the PSA\u00b1ACT complex a further domain is affected by a variable degree of steric hindrance to antibody binding. 66 This phenomenon affects the molar response of free and complexed PSA, with the result that some antibodies (and assays) show a marked preference for binding f-PSA and give relatively less signal per unit mass of complexed PSA.\nAssays formulated with two (monoclonal) antibodies directed against epitope domains unaffected by ACT binding will give an equivalent signal with both free and complexed PSA and this is considered as equimolar. The molar equivalence of an assay may also be affected by reaction kinetics, the shorter incubation times favouring antibody binding to the smaller molecular weight f-PSA. Shortening of the incubation time in an equimolar assay (Hybritech TANDEM-R, see Appendix 1 for details) from the recommended 120 min to 15 min results in signi\u00aecant skewing of the assay in favour of f-PSA. 67 A similar pattern may be seen with the two t-PSA assays available on the DPC Immulite immunoassay platform,`total PSA' and the`3rd generation' PSA; using these assays, with the same antibody pairing albeit in a reversed sequence, the longer incubation of th\u00e8 3rd generation' assay gives an equimolar response in contrast to the skewed response in the`total PSA' assay.\nThe gradual adoption by industry of a 90:10 mixture of PSA\u00b1ACT complex and f-PSA as the calibrator for t-PSA assays 68 has minimized the differences that were previously apparent between equimolar and non-equimolar assays in clinical samples.\nThe discrepancy in values obtained between equimolar and skewed assays is dependent on the ratio of free to total PSA in the clinical sample, and will become increasingly apparent as the ratio increases above 15%. The Yang Pros-Check 2 assay, a competitive binding radioimmunoassay with polyclonal antibody, gave results which were signi\u00aecantly higher than the Hybritech TANDEM-R. 68 The same effect was reported, for some clinical samples, for the Bayer ACS-180 2 PSA assay. 69 The calibrator in this assay was changed from free PSA to the 90:10 complex to give the PSA-2 format. The resultant effect was to minimize the differences between clinical samples without altering the inherent non-equimolarity induced by a combination of the antibody pairing and the assay kinetics. Nagasaki et al. 70 de\u00aened the degree of skewness in the Abbott IMx monoclonal/ polyclonal assay, now withdrawn, as [t-PSA]=[f-PSA/0\u00b455+c-PSA]. This (almost) two-fold over-representation of f-PSA would not have made any signi\u00aecant differences in clinical interpretation of t-PSA concentrations in most situations 71 but would have caused erroneous interpretations of the f-PSA:t-PSA ratios."}, {"section_title": "PSA ASSAYS", "text": "Most of the total PSA assays currently available on the UK market are formulated for use on speci\u00aec immunoassay platforms, and the assay appears in the repertoire of all major instrument platforms (see Appendix 1) .

Capture antibody refers to the initial antibody in the reaction, usually bound to the solid phase. Tracer antibody refers to the second antibody of the immunometric assay, complexed with the relevant tracer particle or system. Differences in the molar responsiveness of assays for t-PSA will have a signi\u00aecant in\u00afuence on the interpretation that can be placed on any individual PSA value. With the increased proportion of f-PSA in benign hyperplasia and prostatitis, the bias induced in the skewed assays will potentially lead to an increase in false positive results. 94, 95 The skewed t-PSA assay will distort the PSA index (f-PSA expressed as a percentage of t-PSA) to an extent that may have clinical relevance and can only be partially corrected by the use of assay-speci\u00aec threshold values. 96 Whilst the general tenet that equimolarity of response demands appropriate monoclonal antibody selection, and that polyclonal antibodies favour a non-equimolar response, is true, it should be noted that attention to antibody selection and assay kinetics can produce an equimolar response with polyclonal antibodies incorporated in the assay as with the Bayer Immuno-1 and DPC 3rd generation assay. 97 Various publications 95, 98, 99 have con\u00aermed the UK NEQAS observations that the Abbott IMx monoclonal/polyclonal antibody assay, the Bayer ACS-180 PSA-1 and PSA-2 and the DPC Immulite Total PSA assays are not equimolar and overestimate the f-PSA to a variable extent. These assays cannot be used in calculation of a PSA index with any reliability. It should be emphasized that the Abbott IMx monoclonal/ polyclonal assay has now been withdrawn in favour of the Total PSA assay, a dual monoclonal assay, which is equimolar, and that the DPC 3rd generation PSA assay available on the Immulite and Immulite 2000 platforms is also equimolar.

The high-risk status of this population requires the sensitivity of detection to be maintained at the 95% level at the expense of speci\u00aecity. 113 Reference intervals for f-PSA are poorly documented but it would appear that, as for t-PSA, there is a positive correlation with age. 114 From the limited data currently available, it would appear that there is no signi\u00aecant variation in PSA index (free:total ratio) with age. 114, 115 PSA is complexed by serine protease inhibitors but acute phase increases in AAT and ACT have no in\u00afuence on the measured PSA concentration or the free:total PSA ratio.

With an 8% threshold, a sensitivity of 95% can be achieved but only at a speci\u00aecity of 44%. 121 The trend towards using a threshold value of 3 mg/L t-PSA as an indicator for biopsy can be justi\u00aeed if a low index value of 10% is also required. 122 Computer modelling with logistic regression analysis shows that, for a patient with a normal digital rectal examination (DRE), a t-PSA of 3 mg/L and a PSA index of 10%, the probability of prostate cancer is 30%, rising to 50% with an index of 5% at the same t-PSA concentration. 123 Catalona et al. 124 observed that, for a standard 90% detection rate, the discriminant PSA index of 13% for a prostate gland of less than 40 g needed to increase to 21% for glands over 40 g. Pearson et al. 125 showed that, whilst the PSA index remains stable with increasing age, it is signi\u00aecantly lower in men with prostate cancer than in normal individuals and men with BPH, and that this may be apparent for up to 8 years prior to diagnosis.\nIt would appear, however, that the PSA index is only valid for concentrations of t-PSA between 3\u00b110 mg/L, and that the discriminant values are assay-speci\u00aec. The calculation of a PSA index is also only valid when the constituent PSA concentrations are derived from matched assays with the same calibration, 126 and the t-PSA assay has an equimolar response. 95 This is supported by the differing opinions expressed by Pannek et al., 127, 128 who found no association between PSA index values and clinical stage when using unrelated assays from two separate manufacturers, 127 but a signi\u00aecant association when using matched assays from a single manufacturer. 128 Similar indices can be derived from c-PSA and t-PSA, with equal clinical effect, 129, 130 although it has been suggested that the assay of c-PSA alone will give similar diagnostic potential at lower operational cost. 131 The data to support this hypothesis are limited and have not yet been subjected to the extensive independent evaluation that has supported the free:total ratio. 132 The assay of f-PSA in patients with established metastatic or late stage disease may give misleading results. In some patients the f-PSA and PSA index rise anomalously, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of c-PSA. It is assumed that this represents the overproduction of`nicked' PSA, with its inability to bind to serine protease inhibitors."}, {"section_title": "PSA density", "text": "Prostate speci\u00aec antigen density is the ratio of PSA concentration to prostate volume as determined by transrectal ultrasound, 133 higher values being associated with prostate cancer and lower values being associated with benign hyperplasia. Its potential value is in those men who have a PSA in the 4\u00b110 mg/L range and have a normal DRE. 134 Although densities in excess of 0\u00b415 are considered suggestive of malignancy, 135 clinical studies have not shown any advantage in diagnostic sensitivity. Various factors are known to in\u00afuence the reliability of the PSA density; these include variability in the transrectal ultrasound measurements, the shape of the gland (which will in\u00afuence the calculation of gland volume), and variation in the proportion of stroma to epithelial tissue within the gland.\nWhilst a 5 cm 3 cancer in a 40 cm 3 gland may give a high PSA density, the same 5 cm 3 cancer in an 80 cm 3 gland will give a lower PSA density and escape detection.

Serial PSA measurements demonstrate the growth characteristics of each tumour. Thus CaP control, recurrence or hormonal escape can be determined. This allows detection and treatment of skeletal metastases prior to skeletal fracturing. Second line treatments can then be introduced prior to the onset of symptoms.\nIn summary, PSA has revolutionized the clinical care of prostate cancer. It is vital to the diagnosis and subsequent follow-up of the disease. It is hoped that it will be useful in screening for the disease. "}]
