This study examines progressions of established biomarkers along with a novel marker in a longitudinal cognitive decline.

We calculated standardized biomarker progression rates and used them as predictors of outcome within 5 years.\nResults: Early cognitive declines were more strongly explained by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, precuneus and medial temporal cortical thickness, and the complex instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) marker progressions. Using Cox proportional hazards model, we found that these progressions were a significant risk factor for conversion from both MCI to AD (adjusted hazard ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.93; P 5 1.23 ! 10 25 ) and cognitively normal to MCI (adjusted hazard ratio 1.76; 95% confidence interval 1.32-2.34; P 5 1.55 ! 10 25 ).

Accurate and earlier diagnosis of patient states is difficult, partly because, despite the popularity of the AD cascade model [2] , amyloid and tau-based, pathologic progressions, such as neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary pathology, are interacting in a much more complex way than previously thought [3] . The complexity of the AD pathologic events is now accepted to occur years before symptomatic onset and it challenges current knowledge of the underlying pathologic pathways [4] . Determining new diagnostic criteria that incorporate biomarkers to construct models of disease progression enabled the mechanism to stage and stratify patients during the presymptomatic phase [5] . For example, the revised National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria [6] helped reduce heterogeneity in trial groups, monitor treatment outcomes, and match persons to presumptive treatments. However, despite the deeper understanding and availability of AD in vivo biomarkers, the evidence base for this is relatively limited [7] . A major challenge is to construct models of disease progression that estimate biomarker ordering and dynamics directly from real-world data sets enabling quantitative evaluation of the disease since its earliest stages [8] . At the presymptomatic stage, this would mean to allow the capturing of healthy individuals at risk of developing AD.\nHypothetical models of AD progression have been proposed that describe presymptomatic sequences in which different biomarkers become abnormal [9] . The most well validated of these models generally propose that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid pathology and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) abnormalities precede CSF phosphorylated and total tau (t-tau), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) hypometabolism, and measures of brain metabolism precede regional neurodegeneration, e.g., volume and atrophy rate markers derived from structural magnetic resonance (MRI), which all occur before a significant clinical change in cognitive performance test scores [10] . When attempting to validate the ordering of these biomarkers, e.g., Brickman et al. [11] , CSF brain amyloidosis, neuronal degeneration, namely elevated CSF tau protein, decreased cortical FDG-PET, and medial temporal atrophy on MRI, the results are always dependent on defining abnormal biomarker levels and choosing cut points, which are not easy to establish. Others are also attempting to determine biomarker ordering using a priori staging based on clinical diagnosis and not informed directly by measured data sets [12] . Such attempts can only provide ordering of a small number of biomarkers and limit the temporal resolution of such models to crude stages (e.g., normal, early mild cognitive impairment [MCI] , late MCI, or AD). For instance, empirically derived MCI stages or subtypes demonstrate heterogeneity that is not captured by conventional criteria in MCI cognitive profiles. Conventional profiles are susceptible to false-positive errors, which implicates the result of prior MCI studies and may be diluting important biomarker relationships [13] . Moreover, because the way a biomarker is measured can make a difference in diagnostic accuracy, harmonized protocols are still needed [14] [15] [16] .\nIn the context mentioned previously, a recently introduced, probabilistic, event-based model (EBM) provided a generative model of AD progression, as a sequence of events, at which individual biomarkers become abnormal. Recent work [17] demonstrated the EBM's consistent ability to learn normal and abnormal distributions of presymptomatic AD biomarker values from data, without requiring any a priori staging or cut points. Researchers might be using such an approach to stage subjects retrospectively and follow a large elderly cohort over a long period of time. For example, Rembach et al. [18] showed such an analysis in plasma amyloid beta and Lim et al. [19] estimated the rate of change of prodromal AD biomarkers and obtained an average cognitive trajectory over time. Similarly, Tarnanas et al. [20] showed a 2-year rate of change but with the introduction of a novel computer-based marker along with MRI and event-related potential biomarkers in subjects with MCI. However, although a promising approach, one issue not systematically examined previously is whether biomarker changes from baseline value to end point or biomarker changes over all the intermediate time points (referred in this study as biomarker progressions) were more strongly associated with cognitive declines. A recent study [21] examined the relative ability of baseline values versus biomarker progressions at each stage of AD in predicting cognitive declines and proved that progressions explained higher variability in cognitive declines than values at the baseline. This finding provides an improved model of the longitudinal, nonlinear association between biomarker and regional atrophy progressions and shows that future clinical trials would benefit by identifying such biomarker progressions most strongly associated with cognitive and functional declines at later stages [22] .\nGiven the amount of recent accumulated knowledge on normal and abnormal function of biomarker progressions, it is not surprising that computer-processable disease models are taking the lead in drug and biomarker discovery efforts [23] . As an illustration [24] , proposed two computerprocessable cause-and-effect models are based on the Biological Expression Language (http://www.openbel.org/), which support the automatic reasoning of interlinked molecules, and normal and abnormal biological processes. They argued that computer-processable disease models should be based on cause-and-effect regulatory effects that link upstream causal entities to downstream bioclinical effects. In agreement with that group, we believe that computerprocessable disease model approaches would be enhanced with the addition of quantitative, real-life, complex activities of daily living, a computerized cognitive performance data set, such as our complex instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) marker with day-out task (DOT) and dualtask walk (NAV) profiles.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the relative ability of individual biomarker progressions in relation to our complex iADL marker of longitudinal cognitive and functional declines. We used 5-year longitudinal data at each stage of AD to assess which progressions are associated with such declines. To conduct a fair comparison, analogous to a recent study [21] , we standardized all biomarkers and presented clinical values corresponding to each standard deviation. We hypothesized that the fine-grained staging potential of our complex iADL marker could improve clinical trial designs by predicting (1) conversion from cognitively normal (CNstable) to MCI (CN-converters) and (2) conversion from MCI (MCI-stable) to AD (MCI-converters), allowing the recruitment of high-risk populations with higher accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from two independent data sets: the Greek Association for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders outpatient memory clinic, belonging to the Third Neurological Clinic of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and Virtual Reality Medical Center, San Diego.

In the end, 215 subjects with valid data for our variables of interest, from which 71 with normal cognition, 61 with MCI, and 83 with AD using baseline diagnosis, were used in this study. Subjects with normal cognition did not meet criteria for dementia or MCI [25, 26] , had a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30, and a global clinical dementia rating (CDR) [27] score of 0. MCI subjects had a CDR of 0.5, MMSE score between 24 and 30, evidence of objective memory loss or a memory complaint (as measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II), absence of significant other cognitive domains impairment, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia. Mildly demented AD participants had MMSE scores between 20 and 26, global CDR scores of 0.5 or 1.0, and met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD [28] . To minimize the influence of vascular pathology, we used the Hachinski ischemic index and excluded participants with significant vascular disease burden at study baseline.

The ADNI-Mem and ADNI-Exe scores are psychometrically optimized, robust, previously validated composite scores of memory and executive function, respectively, with high external validity [32] ."}, {"section_title": "DOT and NAV marker tasks", "text": "The complex iADL marker of this study was a complex activity of daily living, which previous research showed as a valid and reliable early indicator of cognitive decline in elderly persons [20, 33] . In summary, complex iADL is a set of naturalistic tasks that required coordination of information by eliciting medium-to-high cognitive control, such as inhibition of external stimuli or processing speed (e.g., reaction time at interactive events), which is believed to be affected by aging [20] (Appendix).\nThe complex iADL marker used in this study consisted of two modules simulating complex activities of daily living (CADL): the three-dimensional (3D) immersive reality day-out task (DOT) and the 3D immersive reality spatial navigation only task (NAV). The DOT was a complex task breakdown followed by a rehearsal exercise of a virtual apartment building fire evacuation drill. The drill included six different scenarios of increasing difficulty, where participants navigated the virtual environment using a first-person perspective and simple hand pointing gestures for forward, backward, and left, and right lateral movement, respectively. They could also use natural finger pointing and grabbing gestures to select, pick, drop, and move objects inside the virtual environment and had to complete each within 8 minutes. All participant movement within the virtual building was recorded at 10 Hz and represented as a series of x, y, z coordinates, with actions annotated and time stamped.\nThe DOT naturalistic actions script was based on an ordered list of right and wrong actions that was prepared by an occupational psychologist and was used to examine executive function and prospective memory as well as planning and reasoning in a complex emergency routine. The fire evacuation drill setting had six different simulated fire situations (from easy to more difficult) taking place at a virtual apartment block with three levels and five apartments per level. The task put a medium-to-high load on the cognitive control processes with which older adults prioritize, organize, initiate, and complete a number of subroutines (e.g., pick-up the phone and call the fire department, sound the fire-alarm) to evacuate safely and in the fastest possible way from an apartment level (e.g., second floor) to the ground area (e.g., determine and gather information on the size of the fire, avoid smoke, avoid wrong actions such as using the elevator). In this sense, DOT is a CADL, which previous research showed is a valid and reliable indicator of cognitive decline in elderly persons [20] .\nThe NAV task took place at the same virtual apartment block but with the player challenged in different aspects of executive function, such as volition, self-awareness, planning, inhibition of dominant response, external distraction during response control, and dual-task coordination [33] . The goal at difficulty level 1 was to navigate from point A to point B, after the route was demonstrated by a first-person perspective camera walk through without iteration. The NAV task took place with six levels of difficulty, with the addition of one more point of destination per difficulty level-for example, level 3 has three points to reach, level 4 has four, and so forth. Each level had a starting position (start) and an end position (goal) and multiple ways to arrive from start to goal. Participants were asked to make their way from start to goal in the shortest time possible.\nBoth tasks took place at the same virtual reality enriched environment and placed a medium-to-high demand on higher-order cognitive control processes. One of the cognitive control processes with the highest demand was to follow a mental strategy to reach a goal in parallel with behavioral performance monitoring while inhibiting environmental stressors-for example, virtual distractors requiring the player to count stimuli while walking, a process that typically involves high cognitive control. Scoring was computed for both DOT and NAVand has been described before [34] . It basically consists of a quantitative ratio of efficacy that is computed by an algorithm that follows four activity parameters in real-time: (1) omission of one of the activities, (2) repetition of the same activity, (3) incorrect order in performing the activities, and (4) number of attempts before completing a given activity. In addition to the quantitative score mentioned previously, we also get a graphical representation, which illustrates the length of time participants spent at each specific set of x, y, z coordinates in the 3D space. Fig. 1 shows a graphical example of mean group completion performance at DOT.\nThe order of participating in either the DOT or NAV tasks was random, and both started after each participant had 5 minutes to read written instructions detailing the task, virtual building layout, and task rules. Then, participants practiced the virtual environment using gestures to move around the building and completed three practice runs involving object collection, button pressing, unlocking the stairwell door with a key code, and folder sorting. This also allowed participants to familiarize themselves with the building. None of the practice runs were used in the main task. The practice session took in total approximately 20 minutes.\nParticipants in this study played all difficulty levels of DOT and NAV in a baseline session (visit 1) and then at the end of the 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, or 60-month follow-up. To standardize performance during different difficulty levels of the DOT and NAV tasks, we used an algorithm that detects subtle changes in intra-individual variability, which we validated previously [33] . This algorithm reflects a transient, within-person change in behavioral performance, and more particularly, latency (variability across response time performance scores) and accuracy based (variability across accuracy scores-correct vs. wrong responses) and has been reportedly associated with early functional and cognitive decline [20, 33, 34] ."}, {"section_title": "FDG-PET metrics and analysis", "text": "18F-FDG PET imaging was performed by the Virtual Reality Medical Center, at two different sites in San Diego, CA, USA.

Similar to that work, we considered changes in diagnosis when subjects remained in a new diagnostic category for at least two follow-up assessments. Therefore, we used estimates and observed baseline progressions as predictors of cognitive decline at either ADNI-Mem or ADNI-Exe. When applying our mixed-effects models, we controlled for age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele status (\u03b54 present or absent), years of education, and practice effects (Appendix).\nTo examine the amount, magnitude, and timing of practice effects, we used a piecewise approach to observe changes in cognitive slopes. For example, because the normative magnitude and precise timing of when practice effects subside are not established, we allowed slope changes between baseline and 6-month assessment, between 6-month assessment and 12-month follow-up assessment, and so on. This analysis indicated that the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-memory function model fitness is best if we assume that the practice effect peaked at the 6-month assessment, and for executive function (ADNI-Exe) at the 12-month assessment, similar to the recent work [21] . We included this change point in the model to control for practice effects. In addition, the variability in cognitive decline (i.e., individual differences in slopes explained by the subject-specific baseline biomarker progressions) was compared with variability in our novel computerized screening market progressions. All biomarker variables were standardized so that estimated effects on cognitive decline could be meaningfully compared across different biomarkers and our novel computerized screening marker. Standardization was done using baseline means and standard deviations, and each model included time in months (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months from baseline). Each brain volume was divided by intracranial volume (ICV), and white matter hyperintensity/ICV was first normalized due to common skewed distribution with a log transformation.\nFinally, we applied the same mixed-effects models to each stage separately for normal cognition, MCI, and AD. We examined the predictive effect of progressions on cognitive declines within each group, with intercept and time treated as random effects in all models. Changes in diagnoses in the MCI group from MCI to AD were indicated using a variable.

When examining each biomarker explanatory ability with regard to ADNI-Mem changes, the highest portion of variability across diagnosis groups was explained by progressions of the complex iADL marker, followed by the FDG-PET scores and ventricular volume loss, respectively.

When examined longitudinally together with preclinical AD biomarker progressions, our novel marker progressions explained more variability of declines in memory and executive functions in normal, MCI, and AD subjects.\nWhen interpreting these results, it is important to stress that our analysis was based on biomarker progressions of subjects at risk, who subsequently phenoconvert to clinical AD, and not predefined cutoff values. Comparatively exploring the two major cognitive domains investigated, namely memory and executive functions, we produced comparable results to a previous study regarding the individual biomarker progressions' capabilities to explain cognitive declines [21] . We found robust associations of both ADNIMem and ADNI-Exe domain declines, for all individual biomarker progressions of the MCI and AD groups. Our complex iADL marker correlated with FDG-PET score changes, ventricular volume increases, whole-brain volume declines, and medial temporal cortical thinning progressions, explaining cognitive progressions in concert with previous research [20, 37] .\nWhen examining individual biomarker progressions for the normal subjects in our study, we found that the complex iADL marker, CSF Ab42, and t-tau biomarker progression values, as well as precuneus thickness and medial temporal cortical thinning progressions, explained more variability in ADNI-Exe than ADNI-Mem trajectory declines. Given the small number of data points in this study, e.g., progression from CN-stable to MCI and MCI to AD and the fact that we controlled for vascular brain disease, this finding shows that certain functional or structural biomarkers change relatively late in a long disease process. This trend was more apparent in memory declines than executive functional declines. The interpretation of this finding includes the possibility that executive dysfunction in complex activities is more common among people with AD risk alleles during the presymptomatic stage, and recruitment into trials should take such phenotypes into account. Other studies have also observed differences in memory and executive functioning during the presymptomatic stage among people with AD risk alleles [30, 38] . Such difference might be linked to different genetic architecture and different susceptibility to medications designed to modify the underlying biology [39] . As our knowledge and understanding of these phenomena grow, we could limit enrollment of subjects at risk using biomarkers in combination Abbreviations: MCI, mild cognitive impairment; CN, cognitively normal; AUC, area under receiver operating characteristic curve; n-c, number of converters; n-s, number of stable subjects. with the computerized screening marker progression, which gives early indication of this specific subgroup [40] . Most importantly, with the increasing pressure to develop accurate biomarkers of preclinical AD, costs and benefits associated with the various biosignatures need to be considered (Table 6 ). Our findings provide further evidence that a novel computerized screening marker can be used in combination with or independent of CSF Ab42 and hippocampal measurements to best identify patients at risk, optimizing the costs/benefits ratio in clinical trials [8, 42, 43] . This study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provided individual biomarker and a complex iADL marker progressions predicting conversion from CN-stable to MCI and MCI to AD. Previous attempts have focused either on overt disease stages or a subset of biomarkers [4, 38, 44, 45] . The follow-up period in our study was longer than in most previous studies, and potential differences in findings need to be interpreted taking this into account. Finally, we used a systematic approach to model building, and all biomarker/clinical data were collected and processed with uniform standard criteria to address the challenges posed by the multiplicity of potential biomarkers of interest.\nSome limitations should be taken into account. First, although we tried to minimize the influence of vascular pathology, we cannot rule out the possible role of subclinical vascular pathology. Second, our sample size was too small for a genome-wide search that could better explain the differences observed. Previous studies estimated required sample sizes per arm for longitudinal trials among subjects with normal cognition when examining biomarker baseline values [46, 47] . Based on those studies, enriching with FDG-PET baseline values gives the smallest sample size of 1039 when the outcome is a CDR-sum of boxes. Sample size for our study was computed a priori based on similar studies in the literature [26] and in accordance to Kelley and Rausch recommendations [48] to obtain sufficiently narrow confidence intervals for the model parameters of interest.\nUltimately, as research is linking amyloid and tau pathology as consequences of the AD, instead of the driving mechanism, the focus moves toward trials in presymptomatic populations. Complex iADL impairments can be another observable consequence, and it is particularly important to define useful markers predictive of further cognitive declines. In that context, our results provide support for two major conclusions. First, progressions from a complex iADL marker scores can be used to define at-risk presymptomatic populations as an inexpensive low-risk solution. Second, once a clear definition of the preclinical phenotype is provided, the complex iADL marker progressions can further refine the enrollment of people with MCI progressing to AD, ensuring that those people will benefit early from future interventions.

Persons at risk for AD could benefit through the use of multiple, diverse assessment tools, such as the computerized screening marker capable of reliably identifying cognitive changes at the earliest stages.\nFuture directions: Initial strategic steps for integrating computerized screening markers into future development of diagnostic and therapy trial technologies are (1) establish a transsectoral multidisciplinary global network of collaborating investigators as an international shared resource and (2) build the technological platform for managing such a resource."}, {"section_title": "Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography metrics and analysis", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related hypometabolism was computed with the pre-defined regions of interest (MetaROIs) average [35] using the SPM8 15O-H2O PET template [36] .
