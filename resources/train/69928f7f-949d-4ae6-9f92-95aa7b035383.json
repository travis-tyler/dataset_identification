[{"section_title": "Too many children are not proficient in reading by the end of third grade.", "text": "According to the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), only 35% of America's fourth graders are proficient readers, which means that 65% of our nation's fourth graders are not. In fact, 31% of children demonstrate only basic reading skills, and 34% are below even the basic reading level. The statistics are worse for specific subgroups. Seventy-eight percent of low-income children -82% of all African American, 77% of all Hispanic and 81% of all Native American children -and more than 90% of dual-language learners score below proficiency on NAEP tests. Research shows that students who are reading at grade level in third grade are more likely to graduate from high school on time. Policy levers that governors can pull now. Early literacy is critical within a state's coordinated, seamless early childhood system. Governors can promote reading proficiency by the end of third grade by creating high-quality early childhood experiences for children. In establishing a policy agenda focused on early literacy, governors should consider using the authorities and resources outlined in the sections that follow."}, {"section_title": "Why Focus on Early Literacy? 65%", "text": "U.S. fourth-graders who are not proficient readers"}, {"section_title": "78%", "text": "Low-income children in the U.S. who score below proficiency on NAEP tests"}, {"section_title": "90%", "text": "Dual-language learners in the U.S. who score below proficiency on NAEP tests"}, {"section_title": "82%", "text": "African-American children in the U.S. who score below proficiency on NAEP tests"}, {"section_title": "77%", "text": "Hispanic children in the U.S. who score below proficiency on NAEP tests"}, {"section_title": "81%", "text": "Native American children in the U.S. who score below proficiency on NAEP tests As the chief executive of state government, governors are uniquely positioned to create a collaborative governance structure that promotes early literacy. Governors can issue an executive order to state agencies under their purview (see example from Mississippi) or create a state-level committee and convene key stakeholders to cultivate crossagency leadership. These key stakeholders should include the following individuals or groups: \u2022 Members of the higher education community who can influence and improve professional development systems, and those who oversee the early childhood and early elementary -pre-kindergarten through grade 3credentialing processes. \u2022 Members of the state and local business community who are concerned about educating and training their future workforce. \u2022 Early Care and Education (ECE) providers and administrators, who are building the foundation for school success. \u2022 Other sectors, such as health providers, that can help unpack and address the key barriers to getting children ready for school. \u2022 State early childhood and kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) system administrators, who must work to create a seamless system of aligned curricula and standards across the two systems. Governors have the authority to direct state agencies -the state education agency, the office of early learning and other agencies -to include early literacy goals and initiatives in their strategic planning processes and work together to support early literacy through a high-quality state system of early care and education. As the state's most powerful and compelling voice, governors can use their position to elevate and champion early literacy across the state. For example, governors can communicate with and influence other state policymakers on key decisions that affect early literacy. They can also help raise public awareness of early literacy rates by visiting high-quality early childhood programs that are using innovative and effective approaches to language and literacy development. Governors can also increase media exposure or help make the connection between grade-level reading and other sectors. Specifically, governors can explore the following strategies: \u2022 Use State of the State addresses or large-scale meetings to focus on early literacy and aligning ECE systems that will garner media attention. As a key player in the state budget process, governors can reinforce policy priorities through state budget proposals. By allocating resources to early literacy initiatives, governors can demonstrate to the state legislature, the advocacy community and the general public that spending on early literacy is a priority. Governors can increase investments in high-quality early care and education and address financing strategies that affect costs and eligibility by using the following strategies: \u2022 Expand the number of Pre-k classroom slots for 3-and 4-year-olds or offer universal preschool. \u2022 Change eligibility criteria to enable more families with slightly higher incomes to access child care subsidies, raise provider rates and extend the number of months for which families are eligible for assistance. \u2022 Set family income eligibility limits for subsidized child care at up to 85% of the state median income (or 200% of the federal poverty level) and adjust the limit annually to account for inflation. \u2022 Cap family copayments for child care subsidies at 10% of family income. \u2022 Set provider reimbursement rates at the 75th percentile of current market rates so that families have adequate choice of providers in their communities. \u2022 Use chronic absence data to encourage greater investment in health, transportation, after-school programs, early care and education, and other resources to help improve attendance. \u2022 Improve access to health care services through Medicaid expansion, developmental screenings and referrals or increased access to maternal and child health home visiting services. \u2022 Invest in early childhood professionals through educator scholarships and additional professional development and training options. \u2022 Improve child welfare outcomes by enhancing in-home preventive services and reducing the number of out-of-home child placements."}, {"section_title": "BUDGETING STATE EXAMPLES", "text": "IDAHO | Helping at-risk students acquire reading skills by third grade has been a legislative priority for Gov. Brad Little, and he proposed doubling funding for a program that provides staffing for additional reading instruction. MICHIGAN | Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a funding increase of $24.5 million to support literacy coaches in Michigan public schools. These coaches will help support school districts in complying with the state's Read by Grade Three law, which passed in 2016 under the previous administration. The law takes effect in the 2019-20 school year, focusing on early literacy services. The budget that the governor signed ultimately increased funding for literacy coaches by $14 million. NEVADA | Gov. Steve Sisolak requested $63 million in funding for Read By Grade Three early reading support (up from the current $41 million) to identify struggling readers and provide intervention services. OREGON | Gov. Kate Brown championed the Student Success Act, which includes a $400 million investment to strengthen ECE programs and provides new funding to schools for strategies to improve 3rd grade reading proficiency. The law expands supports for infants and toddlers, access to full-day Pre-k, early intervention services, professional development and culturally specific early childhood programs."}, {"section_title": "GOVERNOR'S POCKET GUIDE TO EARLY LITERACY", "text": "Adopt comprehensive language and literacy standards and curricula for early care and education programs and early elementary education: \u2022 Ensure that birth to grade 3 learning standards reflect the three areas of early language and literacy skills and knowledge: (1) language and communication, (2) the mechanics of reading and (3) content knowledge. \u2022 Align early childhood and early elementary curricula and instruction to the birth to grade 3 learning standards. Increase the number of young children who have high-quality early learning experiences: \u2022 Expand access to high-quality child care. \u2022 Expand access to high-quality Pre-k programs. \u2022 Expand access to high-quality full-day kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Engage and support families as partners in early language and literacy development:", "text": "\u2022 Invest in programs that increase families' capacity to build their children's language and literacy skills (e.g., home visiting, public-private partnerships to promote parent-child book reading and build home libraries, early literacy campaigns focused on families). \u2022 Incorporate family engagement in existing ECE and K-3 policies, practices and intervention planning. In addition to the policy levers outlined above, governors can support actions by key policymakers and stakeholders that promote reading proficiency by the end of third grade. Initially identified in the 2013 publication, \"A Governor's Guide to Early Literacy That Supports Reading by Third Grade,\" governors and policymakers can use these five action steps and their substeps as a checklist to identify what governors can champion to strengthen language and literacy development in their state and set children on a trajectory to grade-level reading and overall success in school and beyond. NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on Capitol Hill and before the administration on key federal issues to developing and implementing innovative solutions to public policy challenges through the NGA Center for Best Practices (NGA Center).
