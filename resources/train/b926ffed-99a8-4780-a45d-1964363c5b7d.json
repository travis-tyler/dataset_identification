[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Ina V.S. Mullis"}, {"section_title": "TIMSS 2019: Monitoring Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement", "text": "Entering into its third decade and seventh cycle of data collection, TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) is a well established international assessment of mathematics and science at the fourth and eighth grades. TIMSS 2019 is the most recent in the TIMSS trend series, which began with the first assessments in 1995 and continued every four years-1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019. About 60 countries use TIMSS trend data for monitoring the effectiveness of their educational systems in a global context, and new countries join TIMSS in each cycle. About 70 countries are expected to participate in TIMSS 2019. As a mathematics and science assessment, TIMSS is a valuable resource for monitoring educational effectiveness because science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, often known as STEM, are key curriculum areas. It is clear that even today many jobs require a basic understanding of mathematics and science, and this will become increasingly so in the future. Workers in STEM occupations are responsible for finding solutions to world problems such as hunger and disappearing habitats as well as sustaining growth and stability in the global economy. Mathematics and science also are basic to daily life. Science is the natural world, including our weather, land and water, and sources of food and fuel. Mathematics helps us manage a host of daily tasks and is essential in developing the technology we depend on, such as computers, smartphones, and television. Because mathematics and science pervade every aspect of our lives, the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, more widely known as IEA, has been conducting international assessments of mathematics and science for nearly 60 years. IEA is an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of cross-national achievement since 1959. IEA pioneered international comparative assessment of educational achievement in the 1960s to gain a deeper understanding of policy effects across countries' different systems of education. Today, IEA's Amsterdam office manages country participation in a number of international studies, and IEA's Hamburg division is a large data processing and research center. As a major program of IEA, TIMSS has the benefit of drawing on the cooperative expertise provided by representatives from countries all around the world.  TIMSS and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study), an international assessment of reading, together comprise IEA's core cycle of studies measuring achievement in three fundamental subjects-mathematics, science, and reading."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS & PIRLS", "text": "Policy Relevant Data About the Content and Contexts for Learning Mathematics and Science TIMSS uses the curriculum, broadly defined, as the major organizing concept in considering how educational opportunities are provided to students and the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. The TIMSS Curriculum Model has three aspects: the intended curriculum, the implemented curriculum, and the attained curriculum (see Exhibit 1). These represent, respectively, the mathematics and science that students are expected to learn as defined by countries' curriculum policies and publications and how the educational system should be organized to facilitate this learning; what is actually taught in classrooms, the characteristics of those teaching it, and how it is taught; and, finally, what it is that students have learned and what they think about learning these subjects.\n\u2022 The mathematics results for all countries participating in TIMSS 2019 will be reported on the same achievement scale, including the results for countries administering the less difficult version of TIMSS mathematics Both regular and less difficult versions of TIMSS mathematics at fourth grade are equivalent in scope, and about one-third of the items are the same. The other two-thirds of the items are based on the same areas of the framework, but with those in the less difficult version being generally less difficult. A substantial portion of the items in the less difficult version are from TIMSS Numeracy 2015 to enable measuring trends. The items in common between the two versions of mathematics at fourth grade will enable the two assessments to be linked, so that the results can be reported together and directly compared. It is important to have a good match between TIMSS and the students' curriculum and achievement. Experience with TIMSS Numeracy and PIRLS Literacy (the less difficult version of IEA's PIRLS reading assessment) indicates that lower performing students are more strongly motivated by less difficult items, and better able to demonstrate what they know and can do, resulting in fewer omitted items, especially for constructed response questions, and higher completion rates.\n\u2022 Content dimension, specifying the subject matter to be assessed \u2022 Cognitive dimension, specifying the thinking processes to be assessed Exhibit 1.1 shows the target percentage of testing time devoted to each content and cognitive domain for the TIMSS 2019 fourth and eighth grade assessments. The content domains differ for the fourth and eighth grades, reflecting the mathematics widely taught at each grade. There is more emphasis on number at the fourth grade than at the eighth grade. At the eighth grade, two of the four content domains are algebra and geometry. Because these generally are not taught as separable areas in primary school, the introductory or prealgebra topics assessed at the fourth grade are included as part of number. The fourth grade data domain focuses on collecting, reading, and representing data, whereas at the eighth grade it includes more emphasis on interpretation of data, basic statistics, and the fundamentals of probability. It is important to highlight that TIMSS assesses a range of problem solving situations within mathematics, with about two-thirds of the items requiring students to use applying and reasoning skills. The cognitive domains are the same for both grades, but with a shift in emphasis. Compared to the fourth grade, the eighth grade has less emphasis on the knowing domain and greater emphasis on the reasoning domain. Following this brief introduction, the chapter begins with the fourth grade content domains, identifying the three main content domains and the assessment topics within each domain. Next, Chapter 1 continues with the description of the TIMSS Mathematics-Eighth Grade content domains and, then, the descriptions of the cognitive domains for both the fourth and eighth grades.\n2.

Demonstrate knowledge of decimal place value including representing decimals using words, numbers, or models; compare, order, and round decimals; add and subtract decimals, including those set in problem situations. (Decimals may have one or two decimal places, allowing for computations with money.)\n2. Organize and represent data to help answer questions. Using Data to Solve Problems 1.

This includes both paperTIMSS and eTIMSS. At the eighth grade, students will be permitted to use calculators, although the mathematics items are developed to be calculator neutral\u2212do not advantage or disadvantage students whether or not they have calculators. In paperTIMSS, consistent with past TIMSS assessments, students at the eighth grade may bring their own calculators to the assessment. In eTIMSS, students at the eighth grade will have access to a calculator provided as part of the on-screen interface and will not be permitted to bring their own calculators. The on-screen calculator includes the four basic functions (+ , \u2212 , \u00d7, \u00f7) and a square root key. The eventual transition to eTIMSS will result in calculators being standardized.\n\n\nIn 2019, TIMSS Science also will assess science practices. These practices include skills from daily life and school studies that students use in a systematic way to conduct scientific inquiry and\n\n\nLynch School of Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch School of Education\n\n\n\n\nB. Recognize that tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon, and relate phases of the Moon and eclipses to the relative positions of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. 2. The Sun, stars, Earth, Moon, and planets: A. Recognize that the Sun is a star and provides light and heat to each member of the Solar System; explain that the Sun and other stars produce their own light, but that other members of the Solar System are visible because of light reflected from the Sun. B. Compare and contrast certain physical features of Earth with those of the Moon and other planets (e.g., presence and composition of an atmosphere, average surface temperature, presence of water, mass, gravity, distance from the Sun, period of revolution and rotation, ability to support life); recognize that the force of gravity keeps planets and moons in their orbits.\n\n\n\n\nThe TIMSS 2019 Context Questionnaires have the dual purpose of linking to the past and building a bridge to the future. The world is changing in important ways, and so are educational policies and practices around the world. It is important for the TIMSS 2019 Context Questionnaires to reflect these changes. This will be managed by updating aspects of existing scales to reflect new and improved understandings of the constructs being measured, and also by including new scales about important aspects of educational effectiveness. The framework also includes other topics that are important to TIMSS participating countries and education researchers but have not been shown to be related to achievement on the TIMSS assessment. These topics are generally considered to be important aspects of the education systems and beneficial for student learning, and TIMSS plays a key role in collecting data on these topics in the international context. For example, through the curriculum questionnaire and TIMSS Encyclopedia, TIMSS plays an important role in documenting international trends in curricular policy and other educational policies. However, many country level policies do not show a direct relationship with TIMSS achievement. The remainder of this chapter details the topics to be covered in the TIMSS 2019 context questionnaires. The chapter is structured to focus on five broad areas: \u2022 \n\u2022 Age of Entry-Policies about the age of entry into formal education (first year of primary school, ISCED Level 1) are important for understanding achievement as well as the variation in students' ages across countries at the fourth grade (Martin, Mullis, & Foy, 2011). Typically, across the TIMSS countries, students enter primary school at ages 5 to 7. \u2022 Grade Retention-Because TIMSS is a grade-based study, the degree of grade retention can be an important factor to consider when evaluating achievement results. Research has shown that grade retention does not have a positive relationship with student achievement or the emotional well-being of the student and is overall inefficient (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, Hidalgo-Hidalgo, & Robles-Zurita, 2014; Hattie, 2009). Many TIMSS countries practice automatic promotion, especially in the primary grades (Mullis, Martin, Goh, & Cotter, 2016). \u2022 Tracking-Some education systems address differential student abilities and interests by assigning students to different schools that provide academic or vocational routes. A breadth of literature has suggested that tracking students into different schools or routes early in the educational process can exacerbate differences in student achievement (Hanushek & W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2006;Marks, 2005;Parker, Jerrim, Schoon, & Marsh, 2016;Sch\u00fctz, Ursprung, & W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2008;Van de Werfhorst & Mijs, 2010). Given that educational tracking can begin as early as middle school, the timing and extent of educational tracking is especially important for interpreting the eighth grade results.\n\nParents' Perceptions of Their Child's School TIMSS 2019 will collect information on what parents think about their child's school, by asking parents to indicate their level of agreement with statements that evaluate the school academically as well as school safety and the extent that schools communicate with and involve parents in their child's education. TIMSS 2015 results show that most parents tended to be satisfied with the school their child attended, which is consistent with results from other educational surveys (Barrows, Peterson, & West, 2017;Stacer & Perrucci, 2013).\n\n\n\nConducted every four years since 1995, with each assessment linked to the one that preceded it, TIMSS provides regular and timely data for educators and policymakers on trends in students' mathematics and science achievement. As an additional advantage, administering TIMSS at the fourth and eighth grades every four years provides the opportunity to monitor achievement changes within a grade cohort, as the fourth grade students in one TIMSS cycle become the eighth grade students in the next cycle. The seventh in the TIMSS series of assessments, TIMSS 2019 continues the TIMSS tradition of innovation by beginning the transition to the eTIMSS digital format. For the first time, about half the countries will transition to administering the assessment via computer, while the rest will administer TIMSS in a paper and pencil format as in previous assessments.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, the TIMSS target grade should be the grade that represents four years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1. \u2022 At the eighth grade, the TIMSS target grade should be the grade that represents eight years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1. ISCED is the International Standard Classification of Education developed by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and provides an international standard for describing levels of schooling across countries (UNESCO, 2012). The ISCED system describes the full range of schooling, from preprimary (Level 0) to doctoral study (Level 8). ISCED Level 1 corresponds to primary education or the first stage of basic education. Four years after the beginning of Level 1 is the fourth year of formal schooling and is the target grade for the fourth grade TIMSS assessment. This also is the fourth grade in most countries. Similarly, eight years after the first year of ISCED Level 1 is the target grade for eighth grade TIMSS, and is the eighth grade in most countries. However, given the cognitive demands of the assessments, TIMSS wants to avoid assessing very young students. Thus, TIMSS recommends that countries assess the next higher grade (i.e., fifth grade for fourth grade TIMSS, and ninth grade for eighth grade TIMSS) if, for fourth grade students, the average age at the time of testing would be less than 9.5 years, and, for eighth grade students, less than 13.5 years. To represent the target population with an acceptable margin of error while keeping the assessment burden on schools and students to a minimum, each country selects a nationally representative probability sample of students at each grade. The basic TIMSS sample design consists of at least 150 schools and one or more intact classes per grade, for a student sample of approximately 4,000 students in each country.\nUsing items that were administered in both 1995 and 1999 assessments as a basis for linking the two sets of assessment results, the TIMSS 1999 data also were placed on the scales so that countries could gauge changes in students' mathematics and science achievement since 1995. This was done separately for mathematics and science and for fourth and eighth grades. Using similar procedures, the data from TIMSS 2003, TIMSS 2007, TIMSS 2011, and TIMSS 2015 were placed on the TIMSS scales, as will be the data from TIMSS 2019. This will enable TIMSS 2019 countries that have participated in TIMSS since its inception to have comparable achievement data from 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019, and to plot changes in performance over this 24 year period. As previously mentioned, in addition to the achievement scales for mathematics and science overall, TIMSS 2019 will construct scales for reporting relative student performance in each of the mathematics and science content and cognitive domains defined in the TIMSS 2019 Assessment Frameworks. More specifically, in mathematics at the fourth grade there will be three content scales, corresponding to the three content domains-number, measurement and geometry, and data display-and four at the eighth grade-number, algebra, geometry, and data and probability. In science, there also will be three content scales at fourth grade-life science, physical science, and Earth science-and four at the eighth grade-biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science. The TIMSS 2019 Assessment Frameworks also specify three cognitive domains-knowing, applying, and reasoning-which span the mathematics and science content at both grades. Reporting scales will be constructed for each cognitive domain in mathematics and science at each grade level.\nTo facilitate the process of creating the student achievement booklets, TIMSS groups the assessment items into a series of item blocks, with approximately 10 to 14 items in each block at the fourth grade and 12 to 18 at the eighth grade. As far as possible, within each block the distribution of items across content and cognitive domains matches the distribution across the item pool overall, as described in Chapters 1 and 2. Similar to the TIMSS 2015 assessment, TIMSS 2019 has a total of 28 blocks at each grade, 14 consisting of mathematics items and 14 consisting of science items. Student booklets are assembled from various combinations of these item blocks. Following the 2015 assessment, eight of the 14 mathematics blocks and eight of the 14 science blocks at each grade were secured for use in 2019 as a basis for measuring trends. The remaining 12 blocks (six mathematics and six science) were available with permission from IEA for use in publications, research, and teaching, and had to be replaced by newly developed items for the TIMSS 2019 assessment. Accordingly, the 28 blocks in the TIMSS 2019 assessment comprise 16 blocks of trend items (eight mathematics and eight science) and 12 blocks of new items to be used for the first time in 2019. As shown in Exhibit 4.1, the TIMSS 2019 mathematics blocks are labeled M01 through M14 and the science blocks S01 through S14. Mathematics and science blocks ending in odd numbers (01, 03, 05, etc.) contain the trend items from the 2015 assessment, as do blocks ending in 06. The blocks ending in even numbers (except 06) contain the items developed for use for the first time in TIMSS 2019. Fourth grade students are expected to spend, on average, 18 minutes on each item block, and eighth grade students, 22\u00bd minutes. Consequently, the 28 blocks of fourth grade items are estimated to contain almost 8\u00bd hours of testing time and the eighth grade blocks about 10\u00bd hours. In previous TIMSS cycles, National Research Coordinators from participating countries agreed that the testing time for any one student should not be increased from previous assessments. Thus, as in the past, the assessment time for each student booklet must fit into 72 minutes for the fourth grade and 90 minutes for the eighth grade. An additional 30 minutes for a student questionnaire also was planned at each grade level. In choosing how to distribute assessment blocks across student achievement booklets, the major goal was to maximize coverage of the framework while ensuring that every student responded to sufficient items to provide reliable measurement of trends in both mathematics and science. A further goal was to ensure that achievement in the mathematics and science content and cognitive domains could be measured reliably. To enable linking among booklets while keeping the number of booklets to a minimum, each block appears in two booklets. TIMSS has used the same booklet design since 2007. The TIMSS 2019 booklet design shows how the 28 assessment blocks are distributed across 14 student achievement booklets (see Exhibit 4.2). The fourth and eighth grade booklet designs are identical, although the fourth grade blocks contain 18 minutes of assessment items and the eighth grade blocks 22\u00bd minutes. Each student booklet consists of four blocks of items: two blocks of mathematics items, and two of science items. In half of the booklets, the two mathematics blocks come first, and then the two science blocks, and in the other half the order is reversed. Additionally, in most booklets two of the blocks contain trend items from TIMSS 2015 and two contain items newly developed for TIMSS 2019. For example, as may be seen from Exhibit 4.2, students assigned Booklet 1 complete two blocks of mathematics items, M01 and M02, and two blocks of science items, S01 and S02. The items in blocks M01 and S01 are trend items from TIMSS 2015, while those in M02 and S02 are items new for TIMSS 2019. Similarly, students assigned Booklet 2 complete two science blocks, S02 and S03, followed by two mathematics blocks, M02 and M03. S02 and M02 contain the new items and S03 and M03 the trend items. Countries participating in TIMSS aim for a sample of at least 4,000 students to ensure that there are enough respondents for each item. The 14 student booklets are distributed among the students in each sampled class according to a predetermined order, so that approximately equal proportions of students respond to each booklet.  Less Difficult TIMSS Mathematics at Fourth Grade As described in the introduction to this volume, countries participating in TIMSS 2019 at the fourth grade can choose to administer an assessment with some less difficult blocks than the regular TIMSS fourth grade mathematics assessment. Participants availing of this option administer the fourth grade science assessment as usual, so that student booklets contain a combination of less difficult mathematics items and regular science items. As shown in Exhibit 4.3, the item block design for the less difficult mathematics has the same number of item blocks as the regular mathematics assessment, so that the same block to booklet assignment can be used for both less difficult and regular fourth grade assessments (i.e., the booklet design shown in Exhibit 4.2). An essential aspect of the less difficult mathematics assessment is that the student achievement results are reported on the same TIMSS achievement scale as the regular mathematics assessment, so that results are comparable regardless of the version of the assessment the students have taken. To support the link between the two versions, the less difficult mathematics assessment includes four blocks of items that also are included in the regular assessment-blocks N02, N06, N08, and N10 in Exhibit 4.3. These correspond to blocks M01, M03, M11, and M13 in the regular assessment. The less difficult assessment capitalizes on its origins in the TIMSS 2015 Numeracy assessment by including eight blocks of items from that assessment-blocks N01, N03, N05, N06, N07, N09, N11, and N13 in Exhibit 4.3. Block N06 was in both the fourth grade TIMSS and the TIMSS Numeracy assessment in 2015.  Both the regular and less difficult mathematics items will follow the same development guidelines described in the Question Types and Scoring Procedures section with respect to the use of multiple choice and constructed response items.\n\nHe is F years older than Jenny.

"}, {"section_title": "The TIMSS International Assessments in Mathematics and Science", "text": "The TIMSS international assessments of mathematics and science were inaugurated in 1995 as a follow-up to IEA's earlier studies conducted separately in these curriculum areas (two in mathematics and two in science) during the 1960s through the 1980s. After the early assessment cycles in the 1990s, TIMSS has been stable over the next two decades with regular assessments every four years at the fourth and eighth grades. Since 1995, the achievement results of each TIMSS assessment (mathematics and science, fourth and eighth grades) have been reported on achievement scales that span the assessment cycles, making it possible to detect changes in achievement from one cycle to the next, and to measure trends in achievement over time. In addition, assessing fourth and eighth grades provides a quasi-cohort design with the fourth grade student cohort assessed in one cycle becoming the eighth grade student cohort assessed in the next cycle. This enables TIMSS to provide valuable information about trends in educational achievement across time and across grades within a particular assessment. There also are periodic assessments of TIMSS Advanced. First conducted in 1995 and then again in 2008, TIMSS Advanced was recently assessed again as part of TIMSS 2015. It targets students who are engaged in advanced mathematics and physics studies that prepare them to enter STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programs in higher education. TIMSS Advanced assesses these students in their final year of secondary school, and is the only international assessment that provides essential information about students specifically prepared for STEM careers. All of the countries, institutions, and agencies involved in the TIMSS assessments have worked collaboratively in building the most comprehensive, innovative, and stable trend measures of mathematics and science achievement possible. The TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center, IEA Amsterdam, IEA Hamburg, and the participating countries have worked together to make continual enhancements to TIMSS over its long history of development. For example, in 2011 TIMSS and PIRLS were assessed together to study the relative impact of mathematics, science, and reading achievement at the fourth grade. In 2015, to celebrate 20 years of trends TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced were assessed together for the first time since 1995, providing a profile of education through secondary school. Now, for 2019, TIMSS is starting the transition to a digital format (see the section eTIMSS: The Future of TIMSS). Taken together, TIMSS' focus on regular assessments measuring trends in achievement, attention to emerging issues in content and the contexts for learning, and robust methods and procedures make it important to educational decision making in the participating countries. The TIMSS achievement data in combination with the context questionnaire scales can be used to: The TIMSS 2019 Assessment Frameworks Chapters 1 and 2 of this volume contain the TIMSS 2019 Assessment Frameworks for mathematics and science, respectively. The TIMSS assessments are conducted according to mathematics and science assessment frameworks that have been updated with each assessment throughout TIMSS' 24 year history. The frameworks are organized around two dimensions: a content dimension specifying the subject matter to be assessed and a cognitive dimension specifying the thinking processes to be assessed as students engage with the content. TIMSS 2019 will follow the usual practice of conducting assessments at the fourth and eighth grades. The TIMSS 2019 Assessment Frameworks for these assessments are summarized briefly below. It is important to emphasize that the items in each TIMSS assessment cover a range of thinking skills, including students' abilities to apply what they have learned, solve problems, and use analysis and logical thinking to reason through situations. As noted above, the three cognitive domains are the same for mathematics and science and for both grades, encompassing a range of cognitive processes involved in learning mathematics and science concepts, and then applying these concepts and reasoning with them. TIMSS Science also integrates science practices across domains, including skills from daily life and school studies that students use in systematic ways to conduct the scientific inquiry that is fundamental to all science disciplines."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Content Domains", "text": "The TIMSS assessment frameworks for 2019 were updated from those used in 2015 to provide participating countries opportunities to introduce fresh ideas and current information about curricula, standards, frameworks, and instruction in mathematics and science. The updating process keeps the frameworks educationally relevant, creates coherence from assessment to assessment, and permits the TIMSS frameworks, instruments, and procedures to evolve gradually into the future."}, {"section_title": "eTIMSS: The Future of TIMSS", "text": "TIMSS 2019 will begin the transition to conducting the assessments in the eTIMSS digital format. eTIMSS will provide enhanced measurement of the TIMSS mathematics and science frameworks and take advantage of efficiencies provided by the IEA eAssessment systems. It is anticipated that about half the countries participating in TIMSS 2019 will transition to administering the assessment via computer. The rest of the countries will administer TIMSS in a paper and pencil format as in previous assessments. To provide extended coverage of the mathematics and science frameworks, eTIMSS 2019 will include additional innovative problem solving and inquiry tasks, known as PSIs. The PSIs simulate real world and laboratory situations where students can integrate and apply process skills and content knowledge to solve mathematics problems and conduct scientific experiments or investigations. The PSI tasks-such as design a building or study plants' growing conditions-involve visually attractive, interactive scenarios that present students with adaptive and responsive ways to follow a series of steps toward a solution. According to early pilot efforts, students find the PSIs engaging and motivating. Also, there will be an opportunity digitally to track students' problem solving or inquiry paths through the PSIs. Studying the process data about what student approaches are successful or unsuccessful in solving problems may provide information to help improve instruction. It should be emphasized that the demanding criteria for the PSIs make them very difficult and resource intensive to develop. Special teams of consultants as well as the TIMSS 2019 SMIRC members have collaborated virtually and in meetings to develop tasks that: 1) assess mathematics and science (not reading or perseverance), 2) take advantage of the \"e\" environment, and 3) are engaging and motivating for students. To support the transition to eTIMSS, IEA Hamburg is developing eAssessment systems to increase operational efficiency in item development, translation and translation verification, assessment delivery, data entry, and scoring. The eTIMSS infrastructure will include: the eTIMSS Item Builder to enter the achievement items, an online translation system to support translation and verification, the eTIMSS Player to deliver the assessment and record students' responses, an online Data Monitor to track data collection, and an online scoring system to facilitate national centers' work in managing and implementing scoring of students' constructed responses. eTIMSS also includes new digitally based ways for students to respond to constructed response items, which will enable students' responses to many items to be scored by computer rather than \"human\" scored. In particular, a number keypad enables students to enter the answers to many constructed response mathematics items, such that the answers can be computer scored. Other types of constructed response items that can be computer scored use the drag and drop or sorting functions to answer questions about classifications or measurements. Design considerations for TIMSS 2019 and eTIMSS 2019 are described in Chapter 4: TIMSS 2019 Assessment Design."}, {"section_title": "Less Difficult TIMSS Mathematics at Fourth Grade", "text": "By their fourth year of schooling, many children have graduated from basic arithmetic and are studying the broader domains and concepts of mathematics. For a variety of reasons, however, there are countries where most children in the fourth grade are still developing fundamental numeracy skills. Thus, beginning in 2015 and continuing in 2019, IEA has extended TIMSS by offering a less difficult mathematics assessment at the fourth grade. The purpose of including less difficult items was to extend the TIMSS mathematics achievement scale at fourth grade to provide better measurement at the lower end of the scale. In 2015, the less difficult mathematics items, known as TIMSS Numeracy, were given as a separate mathematics assessment, although most countries that participated in TIMSS Numeracy also participated in TIMSS, as usual, to have science results. This led to several important developments. First, TIMSS 2015 was able to report all fourth grade mathematics results on the same achievement scale whether the students participated in TIMSS, TIMSS Numeracy, or both. In turn, this enables TIMSS 2019 to have two versions of TIMSS-one with less difficult mathematics-so that countries do not have to administer two different assessments in order to assess both numeracy and science.

Describing these skills plays a crucial role in the development of an assessment like TIMSS 2019, because they are vital in ensuring that the survey covers the appropriate range of cognitive skills across the content domains already outlined. The first domain, knowing, covers the facts, concepts, and procedures students need to know, while the second, applying, focuses on the ability of students to apply knowledge and conceptual understanding to solve problems or answer questions.

The first domain, knowing, addresses the student's ability to recall, recognize, describe, and provide examples of facts, concepts, and procedures that are necessary for a solid foundation in science. The second domain, applying, focuses on using this knowledge to compare, contrast, and classify groups of objects or materials; relating knowledge of a science concept to a specific context; generating explanations; and solving practical problems. The third domain, reasoning, includes using evidence and science understanding to analyze, synthesize, and generalize, often in unfamiliar situations and complex contexts. These three cognitive domains are used at both grades, however, the target percentages for each domain vary between fourth and eighth grade in accordance with the increased cognitive ability, instruction, experience, and breadth and depth of understanding of students at the higher grade level. The percentage of items that involve knowing is higher at the fourth grade compared to the eighth grade, while the percentage of items that ask students to engage in reasoning is higher at the eighth grade compared to the fourth grade. While there is some hierarchy in the thinking processes across the three cognitive domains (from knowing to applying to reasoning), each cognitive domain contains items representing a full range of difficulty. Exhibit 2.4 shows the target percentages in terms of assessment time for each of the three cognitive domains at the fourth and eighth grades.

Students of science must become proficient at these practices to develop an understanding of how the scientific enterprise is conducted. These practices include skills from daily life and school studies that students use in a systematic way to conduct scientific inquiry. The science practices are fundamental to all science disciplines. Five practices that are fundamental to scientific inquiry are represented in TIMSS 2019: 1. Asking questions based on observations-Scientific inquiry includes observations of phenomena in the natural world. These observations, when considered together with theory, lead to questions, which are used to formulate testable hypotheses to help answer those questions. 2. Generating evidence-Testing hypotheses requires designing and executing systematic investigations and controlled experiments in order to generate evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. Scientists relate their theories to properties that can be observed or measured in order to determine the evidence to be gathered, the equipment and procedures needed to collect the evidence, and the measurements to be recorded."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "Making an argument from evidence-Scientists use evidence together with science knowledge to construct explanations, justify and support the reasonableness of their explanations and conclusions, and extend their conclusions to new situations. These science practices are assessed in the context of one of the science content domains, and by drawing upon the range of thinking processes specified in the cognitive domains. Some items in the TIMSS 2019 science assessment at both the fourth and eighth grades assess one or more of these important science practices as well as content specified in the content domains and thinking processes specified in the cognitive domains. At both the fourth and eighth grades, students participating in TIMSS complete questionnaires about their experiences, instruction, and attitudes toward learning mathematics and science. Their teachers and school principals complete questionnaires to provide data about school and classroom resources and approaches, and parents of fourth graders fill out a questionnaire about students' home contexts for learning. To better understand national contexts and policies, representatives from each participating country complete a curriculum questionnaire and contribute a chapter to the TIMSS 2019 Encyclopedia. Students taking TIMSS using a computer or tablet also fill out a short questionnaire about their experiences with computers and the Internet. The TIMSS questionnaires have undergone a process of evolution and development since TIMSS was first administered in 1995, a process that continually sought to improve the quality and relevance of the data while keeping the response burden on principals, teachers, students, and parents to a minimum. In each four year assessment cycle, the questionnaire development team at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center worked with the TIMSS Questionnaire Item Review Committee (QIRC) to review the questionnaires and suggest ways to update them-including adding new topics, refining individual questions, and deleting questions or topics that are no longer useful. The TIMSS 2019 Context Questionnaire Framework describes those aspects of the learning context to be addressed by the TIMSS 2019 questionnaires, together with a rationale for why they should be included and research literature references as appropriate. As a study of trends in student achievement and mathematics, TIMSS' first priority in characterizing the educational context is to gather data on policy relevant and malleable attributes of the home and school that can help interpret achievement changes from assessment to assessment. Where possible, such contextual data are summarized as context questionnaire scales that are used to measure changes from one assessment to the next. Relating changes in student achievement to changes in educational policies or practice can be a powerful source of evidence that the policy or practice is beneficial for student learning. For example, TIMSS 2015 reported differences from TIMSS 2011 on a number of background scales such as the Early Literacy and Numeracy Activities scale and the Students Like Learning Mathematics scale. TIMSS 2019 plans to improve and expand trend measurement using these and other scales."}, {"section_title": "Community and National Policies", "text": "Countries, regions, and communities make key educational policy decisions about the curriculum and how it is best implemented. Primarily through the TIMSS Encyclopedia and curriculum questionnaires, TIMSS 2019 will cover five broad national and community policies: Intended Mathematics and Science Curriculum Since 1995, TIMSS has collected extensive data on the content of the intended curriculum. Whether formulated at the national, community, or school level, curricular documents define and communicate the curriculum, providing expectations for students in terms of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed or acquired through their formal mathematics and science education. Internationally, mathematics and science curricula differ across countries and are constantly evolving. In mathematics, countries differ in the degree of emphasis they place on acquiring basic skills, memorizing rules, procedures, or facts, understanding mathematical concepts, applying mathematics to \"real life\" situations, communicating or reasoning mathematically, and problem solving in everyday situations. In science, countries vary in the extent that they focus on acquiring basic science facts, understanding and applying science concepts, formulating hypotheses, designing and conducting investigations to test hypotheses, using inquiry-based learning, and communicating scientific explanations. Differences in the structure of the science curriculum can result in different experiences for students in different countries. By the eighth grade, some countries teach science as separate subjects (biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science), and others teach it as one integrated subject. Continuing previous practices, countries will provide summaries of their fourth and eighth grade mathematics and science curricula in the TIMSS 2019 Encyclopedia and answer questions about their curricula in the curriculum questionnaire. Collecting data on curricular content over time can provide insights into the evolution of national curricula. For example, the TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia (Mullis, Martin, Goh, & Cotter, 2016) found that countries are increasingly incorporating problem solving into their mathematics curricula and are incorporating inquiry and investigative skills into the science curricula. To an increasing extent, curricula are also emphasizing the integration of technology into mathematics and science learning."}, {"section_title": "Language(s) of Instruction", "text": "A multilingual population can increase the challenge of implementing the mathematics and science curricula, and for these reasons the TIMSS 2019 Encyclopedia will contain information about languages of instruction.

Preprimary education is an area of investment for many countries. Research findings indicate that attendance at preprimary programs can have a positive effect on academic outcomes (Duncan & Magnusson, 2013). As described in the TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia (Mullis, Martin, Goh, & Cotter, 2016), almost all countries participating in TIMSS 2015 provided universal preprimary education for children age 3 or older, and a number of countries also sponsored universal programs for children younger than 3 years old."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Education", "text": "In every country, teachers are the primary implementers of the curriculum, so teacher education policies and practices are a major interest. TIMSS 2019 will collect information about teacher preparation, certification, and professional development. As described in the TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia, many countries have increased the educational requirements for teachers, particularly for primary school teachers as well as secondary school science teachers. As of 2015, almost all TIMSS countries called for fourth and eighth grade teachers to have a four year degree from a university, and the percentage of teachers at both grade levels who had a bachelor's degree increased from 2007. A number of countries have also strengthened the requirements for entry to teacher education programs, with some requiring that prospective teachers achieve a minimum grade point average or pass an examination."}, {"section_title": "Principal Certification", "text": "Given the central role principals play in managing teachers, students, and school resources, TIMSS will continue collecting data on national principal certification policies. To encourage the development of strong leadership skills, some countries have specific education and training requirements for principals, such as the completion of certification programs in school leadership or specialized principal training programs."}, {"section_title": "Home Contexts", "text": "Parents or guardians and the general home environment are very influential on children's upbringing and their success in school. To better understand the effects of the home context on student achievement in mathematics and science, TIMSS 2019 will collect data through the home questionnaire given to the parents or caregivers of fourth grade students, supplemented by the student questionnaire at the fourth and eighth grades. This will include the following topics: \u2022 In education research, the aspects of home background that show the most consistent association with student achievement tend to be those that measure the socioeconomic status of the parents or caregivers (Dahl & Lochner, 2012;Davis-Kean, 2005;Martin, Foy, Mullis, & O'Dwyer, 2013;Sirin, 2005;Willms, 2006). Socioeconomic status is often indicated through proxy variables such as parental level of education, income, occupational class, and the number of books in the home. TIMSS has developed two scales that expand upon the classic conception of socioeconomic status to include home resources with the potential to facilitate student learning (e.g., an Internet connection): 1) the fourth grade TIMSS Home Resources for Learning scale based primarily on data from the home questionnaire, and 2) the eighth grade Home Educational Resources scale based on the data from the eighth grade student questionnaire. These two scales have shown a strong positive relationship with students' mathematics and science achievement in previous TIMSS cycles, and also will be included in TIMSS 2019. Language(s) Spoken in the Home TIMSS 2019 will collect information from students and parents on the language the child speaks in the home. Internationally, there are many reasons why some children speak a different language in the home than they do in the school. Some countries have numerous national languages and in these countries it is not uncommon for students to speak one language at home and another at school. Speaking another language in the home can also be common among immigrant families. In addition, some parents prioritize multilingualism and make great efforts to ensure their child is exposed to more than one language in the home."}, {"section_title": "Early Literacy and Numeracy Activities", "text": "Children's first teachers are their parents/guardians. The TIMSS 2019 home questionnaire will ask the parents/guardians of fourth grade students to provide information on the frequency that they engaged their child in early literacy and numeracy activities before beginning primary school. The questionnaire also will ask parents to report how well their child could do certain literacy and numeracy tasks upon entering primary school. Considerable research, including results from TIMSS and PIRLS, has documented the importance of early childhood learning activities and their relationship with student achievement and other educational outcomes (Anders et al., 2012;Gustafsson, Hansen, & Ros\u00e9n, 2013;Hart & Risley, 2003;Hooper, 2017;Melhuish et al., 2008;Sarama & Clements, 2009;S\u00e9n\u00e9chal & LeFevre, 2002;Skwarchuk, Sowinski, & LeFevre, 2014). Engaging children in early numeracy activities can stimulate their interest in mathematics and enhance the development of their numeracy skills (Anders et al., 2012;Claessens & Engel, 2013;Melhuish et al., 2008;Sarama & Clements, 2009). These activities include playing with blocks or construction toys, saying counting rhymes or singing counting songs, playing games involving shapes, and playing other types of games that involve quantitative reasoning. Students who have early numeracy skills when entering school often have higher achievement in primary school (Duncan et al., 2007;Princiotta, Flanagan, & Hausken, 2006). As recently demonstrated by analyses of TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 data (Gustafsson et al., 2013;Punter, Glas, & Meelissen, 2016), both early numeracy and literacy activities are related to a child's fourth grade achievement in mathematics, science, and reading. The association between early literacy activities and mathematics achievement could be linked to the fact that completing numeracy tasks often requires reading skills ."}, {"section_title": "Preprimary Education", "text": "TIMSS 2019 will collect data from parents on the duration of their child's preprimary school attendance-consistently identifying a positive relationship between duration of preprimary attendance and student achievement. Much research has detailed the importance of preprimary education (e.g., preschool, Kindergarten, early childhood education programs) on fostering higher academic outcomes (Duncan & Magnusson, 2013). It is argued that high quality preprimary education and other early childhood interventions are especially beneficial for disadvantaged students because they can play an important role in breaking the generationally repetitive cycle of poverty and low achievement (Duncan & Sojourner, 2013;Heckman & Masterov, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "School Contexts", "text": "A school's environment and organization can be an important determinant of effectiveness in reaching curricular goals. Accepting that an effective school is not simply a collection of discrete attributes, but rather a well managed, integrated system where each action or policy directly affects all other parts, the TIMSS 2019 school questionnaire will focus on a set of well researched school quality indicators: \u2022 To provide key contextual information about schools, the TIMSS 2019 school questionnaire will collect data from principals on a number of school characteristics including school size, school location, and school composition by economic status and language use. In addition, principals are asked about the proportion of the students who enter school with various early literacy and numeracy skills. TIMSS results have typically included data on school composition by economic status, measured by principals' estimates of the percentage of students from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. Since the Coleman report (Coleman et al., 1966), there has been great emphasis on how the socioeconomic composition of the student body is associated with individual student achievement (Martin, Foy, Mullis, & O'Dwyer, 2013;Rumberger & Palardy, 2005;Sirin, 2005 students from disadvantaged backgrounds may have higher achievement if they attend schools where the majority of students are from advantaged backgrounds. Some have attributed this association to peer effects-observing a strong relationship between students and their classmates (Sacerdote, 2011). The higher achievement for students in socioeconomically advantaged schools may also be partially explained by such schools having better facilities, instructional materials, and teachers. For example, in some countries, schools with high proportions of disadvantaged students have difficulty attracting highly qualified teachers (Akiba, LeTendre, & Scribner, 2007;Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Instruction Affected by Mathematics or Science Resource Shortages", "text": "Adequate working conditions and facilities, as well as sufficient instructional resources, are important for maintaining a favorable learning environment in schools (Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, & Pickeral, 2009).

Results from TIMSS international reports indicate that students in schools that are well resourced generally have higher achievement than those in schools where shortages of resources affect the capacity to implement the curriculum. Through the Instruction Affected by Mathematics Resource Shortages scale and the Instruction Affected by Science Resource Shortages scale, both based on principal reports, TIMSS 2019 will measure how general and subject-specific resource shortages affect curriculum implementation. General resources include teaching materials, supplies, school buildings and grounds, heating/cooling and lighting systems, classroom space, technology-based equipment such as electronic whiteboards, computers and tablets, videos, and Internet access. Subject-specific resources for mathematics and science may include subject-specific software/applications, calculators, laboratory equipment, and instructional materials.

Following the TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 school effectiveness study (Martin, Foy, Mullis, & O'Dwyer, 2013), TIMSS 2015 results showed a positive association between academic achievement and a school's emphasis on academic success. Aligning with the literature on academic optimism (Hoy, Tarter, & Hoy, 2006;McGuigan & Hoy, 2006;Wu, Hoy, & Tarter, 2013), indicators for the TIMSS measure of school emphasis on academic success include school administrators' and teachers' expectations for successful curriculum implementation and student achievement, parental support for student achievement, and the students' desire to achieve. Schools can also vary on how much they specifically emphasize preparing students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. The results from TIMSS Advanced 2015, which assessed students at the end of secondary school, showed a relationship between the degree a school supports advanced mathematics and physics education and achievement.

TIMSS reports have consistently shown a positive relationship between student achievement and teachers' and principals' reports that the school is safe and orderly, and school effectiveness research analyzing TIMSS/ PIRLS 2011 data showed that school safety was an important predictor of student achievement in many countries (Martin, Foy, Mullis, & O'Dwyer, 2013). Respect for individual students and teachers, a safe and orderly environment, and constructive interactions among administrators, teachers, parents, and students all contribute to a positive school climate and are associated with higher student achievement (Cohen et al., 2009;Greenberg, Skidmore, & Rhodes, 2004;Konishi, Hymel, Zumbo, & Li, 2010). The sense of security that comes from having few behavioral problems and little or no concern about student or teacher safety at school promotes a stable learning environment. A general lack of discipline, especially if students and teachers are afraid for their safety, does not facilitate learning and is related to lower academic achievement (Milam, Furr-Holden, & Leaf, 2010;Stanco, 2012).

Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior that is intended to harm students who are physically or psychologically less strong, and takes a variety of forms ranging from name calling to inflicting mental and physical harm. Bullying causes distress to victims, leads to low self-esteem, and makes victims feel like they do not belong (Glew et al., 2008). With the prevalence of the Internet, cyberbullying unfortunately appears to be common among students; and, like other bullying, cyberbullying, is associated with low self-esteem, distress, and poor achievement (Mishna, Cook, Gadalla, Daciuk, & Solomon, 2010;Tokunaga, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Sense of School Belonging", "text": "TIMSS 2019 will collect data from students on their sense of school belonging.

Preparation is critical for effective teaching (Darling-Hammond, 2000;Hill, Rowan, & Ball, 2005), and prospective teachers need coursework to gain knowledge in the subjects that they will teach, to understand about how students learn, and to learn about effective pedagogy in teaching mathematics and science. Professional development through seminars, workshops, and conferences can help teachers increase their effectiveness and broaden their knowledge (Blank & de las Alas, 2009;Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, & Shapley, 2007). Professional development is especially important for exposing teachers to recent developments such as curricular changes or new technology for classroom instruction. The TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia shows that many countries are increasing efforts to provide teachers with professional development opportunities. In addition to education and training, teaching experience is essential, and the first years of teaching are especially important for teacher development (Harris & Sass, 2011;Leigh, 2010).

For example, teachers who are strong classroom managers may be more efficient, as they can focus the instructional time on teaching the curricular content. Homework is one way teachers can extend instruction and evaluate student learning. The amount of homework assigned varies both within and across countries, with homework not assigned at all to fourth grade students in some countries. TIMSS 2019 will collect data on homework assignments, including how homework is used, through the teacher questionnaire at the fourth and eighth grades and the student questionnaire at the eighth grade. Although there are differences across countries, most eighth grade mathematics and science teachers assign homework, discuss the homework in class, and provide feedback to students. Students' reports on time spent completing homework do not show a clear relationship with TIMSS achievement-perhaps because struggling students take a longer amount of time to complete their homework.

For challenging topics, it is often necessary for the teacher to employ a variety of pedagogical techniques and explanations to ensure student comprehension. Another way that teachers can increase clarity is by linking new concepts to things students already know and understand (McLaughlin et al., 2005). The TIMSS 2019 Instructional Clarity scales benefit from two previous efforts. Five of the 10 items in each of the TIMSS 2015 Students' Views on Engaging Teaching scales at fourth and eighth grades measured instructional clarity. The scales showed positive associations between instructional clarity and student achievement in many participating countries, especially at the eighth grade. A number of countries also included a national extension in the fourth grade student questionnaire, and the results showed higher achievement for students reporting greater instructional clarity by their teachers (Bergem, Nilsen, & Scherer, 2016).

The Students Like Learning Mathematics and Students Like Learning Science scales measure a student's intrinsic motivation to learn the subjects. Intrinsic motivation is the \"energizer of behavior\" (Deci & Ryan, 1985, p. 32). Students who are intrinsically motivated to learn mathematics or science find the subject to be interesting and enjoyable. TIMSS data have shown a strong relationship between these scales and student achievement. TIMSS measures extrinsic motivation through the eighth grade Students Value Mathematics and Students Value Science scales. Extrinsic motivation refers to the drive that comes from external rewards like praise, career success, money, and other incentives. Research has consistently shown that intrinsic motivation is more closely related to achievement than extrinsic motivation (Becker, McElvany, & Kortenbruck, 2010;Vansteenkiste, Timmermans, Lens, Soenens, & Van den Broeck, 2008). Nevertheless, TIMSS results have consistently shown a strong relationship between students valuing the subject and their achievement. TIMSS also measures subject-specific self-concept through the Students Confident in Mathematics scales and Students Confident in Science scales, and the results from six previous TIMSS cycles have shown a strong relationship between students' academic self-concepts and their achievement.

One of the major strengths of TIMSS is its measurement of trends over time in mathematics and science achievement. The TIMSS achievement scales provide established metrics on which countries can compare students' progress in mathematics and science from assessment to assessment at the fourth and eighth grades. The TIMSS mathematics and science achievement scales were created with the first TIMSS assessment in 1995, separately for each subject and each grade. The scale units were established so that 100 points on the scale was equivalent to one standard deviation of the distribution of achievement across all of the countries that participated in TIMSS 1995, and the scale midpoint of 500 was located at the mean of this international achievement distribution.

Each item appears in two booklets, providing a mechanism for linking together the student responses from the various booklets when data from all booklets are taken together. Booklets are distributed among students in participating classrooms according to assignments predetermined by the TIMSS within-school sampling software, so that the student samples completing each booklet in each country are approximately equivalent in terms of student ability. After the assessment has been administered and the data collected and processed, TIMSS uses item response theory scaling methods to assemble a comprehensive picture of the achievement of the entire student population of a country from the combined responses of individual students to the booklets that they are assigned. 1 This approach reduces to manageable proportions what otherwise would be an impossible student burden, albeit at the cost of some complexity in booklet assembly, data collection, and data analysis."}, {"section_title": "eTIMSS Assessment Design", "text": "The item block design for eTIMSS 2019 (Exhibit 4.4) is similar to the paper and pencil TIMSS design (Exhibit 4.1), with each block in the paperTIMSS design having a counterpart in digital format in the eTIMSS design.
