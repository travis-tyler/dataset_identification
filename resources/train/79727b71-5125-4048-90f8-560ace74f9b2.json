[{"section_title": "Introduction and Acknowledgments", "text": "Karst aquifer systems are present throughout parts of the United States and some of its territories, and have developed in carbonate rocks (primarily limestone and dolomite) and evaporites (gypsum, anhydrite, and halite) that span an interval of time encompassing more than 550 million years. The depositional environments, diagenetic processes, post-depositional tectonic events, and geochemical weathering processes that form karst aquifers are varied and complex. These factors involve biological, chemical, and physical changes that when combined with the diverse climatic regimes in which karst development has taken place, result in the unique dual-or triple-porosity nature of karst aquifers. These complex hydrogeologic systems typically represent challenging and unique conditions to scientists attempting to study groundwater flow and contaminant transport in these terrains. The dissolution of carbonate rocks and the subsequent development of distinct and beautiful landscapes, caverns, and springs have resulted in the most exceptional karst areas being designated as national or state parks. Tens of thousands of similar areas in the United States have been developed into commercial caverns and known privately owned caves. Both public and private properties provide access for scientists to study the flow of groundwater in situ. Likewise, the range and complexity of landforms and groundwater flow systems associated with karst terrains are enormous, perhaps more than for any other aquifer type. Karst aquifers and landscapes that form in tropical areas, such as the cockpit karst along the north coast of Puerto Rico, differ greatly from karst landforms in more arid climates, such as the Edwards Plateau in west-central Texas or the Guadalupe Mountains near Carlsbad, New Mexico, where hypogenic processes have played a major role in speleogenesis. Many of these public and private lands also contain unique flora and fauna associated with these karst hydrogeologic systems. As a result, numerous federal, state, and local agencies have a strong interest in the study of karst terrains. Many of the major springs and aquifers in the United States have developed in carbonate rocks, such as the Floridan aquifer system in Florida and parts of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina; the Ozark Plateaus aquifer system in parts of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma; and the Edwards-Trinity aquifer system in west-central Texas. These aquifers, and the springs that discharge from them, serve as major water-supply sources and form unique ecological habitats. Competition for the water resources of karst aquifers is common, and urban development and the lack of attenuation of contaminants in karst areas due to dissolution features that form direct pathways into karst aquifers can impact the ecosystem and water quality associated with these aquifers. The concept for developing a platform for interaction among scientists within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) working on karst-related studies evolved from the November 1999 National Groundwater Meeting of the USGS. As a result, the Karst Interest Group (KIG) was formed in 2000. The KIG is a loose-knit, grass-roots organization of USGS and non-USGS scientists and researchers devoted to fostering better communication among scientists working on, or interested in, karst science. The primary mission of the KIG is to encourage and support interdisciplinary collaboration and technology transfer among scientists working in karst areas. Additionally, the KIG encourages collaborative studies between the different mission areas of the USGS as well as with other federal and state agencies, and with researchers from academia and institutes. To accomplish its mission, the KIG has organized a series of workshops that have been held near nationally important karst areas. To date (2017) seven KIG workshops, including the workshop documented in this report, have been held. The workshops typically include oral and poster sessions on selected karst-related topics and research, as well as field trips to local karst areas. To increase non-Sciences, UTSA, helped develop sessions on cave and karst research in China for this workshop. These proceedings could not have been accomplished without the assistance of Lawrence E. Spangler as coeditor who not only has subject matter expertise, but also serves as an editor with the USGS Science Publishing Network. We sincerely hope that this workshop continues to promote future collaboration among scientists of varied and diverse backgrounds, and improves our understanding of karst aquifer systems in the United States and its territories.

This conference series, which is growing with the next one scheduled for 2018, was instrumental in starting to legitimize \"cave\" and \"karst\" in scientific circles. 2. The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988, the first legislation to recognize the national importance of caves. 3. The creation of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute (NCKRI) in 1998 to conduct, support, facilitate, and promote cave and karst research, education, management, collection and archiving of data, and collaborations to support all of the above on a national and international level. While these events stand out in my mind, the cumulative effects of many other events were even more influential in bringing karst into the main stream. Four examples include the establishment of the Field Studies at Mammoth Cave program by Western Kentucky University in 1979; creation of the U.S. Geological Survey's Karst Interest Group in 2000 and its conference series in 2001; the Edwards Aquifer Authority's Distinguished Lecture Series, which since 2006 recruits international experts focused on karst hydrogeology; and the Geological Society of America, which formed a Karst Division in 2014 to recognize karst as a major and important discipline in the geosciences. These advances are certainly noteworthy and all were a struggle to establish and maintain. NCKRI is a prime example. Following 8 years as a federal institute within the National Park Service, it reorganized as a federal and state-supported nonprofit administered by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology starting in 2006. When I was brought on as NCKRI's Executive Director in 2007 to lead it in its new guise, I had high hopes and looked to increase the level of federal support from the seed-money appropriation received annually since 1998. Instead, the global economy collapsed in 2008, and cuts were made in NCKRI's seed money to help balance state and federal budgets. Nonetheless, NCKRI continued to advance, albeit slowly, and now with the economy in better shape NCKRI is enjoying additional funds through contracts, grants, donations, and other sources, and has high hopes to boost its federal funding over the next few years. NCKRI's story is a microcosm of recent karst programs in the US and internationally. During the economic recession there was less funding for students, basic research, applied contracting research, and management and education programs. Positions vacated by retiring cave and karst experts in all areas of employment were often not backfilled; some were laid off. But economic recovery is seeing restoration and even growth in all sectors. Other parts of the world have seen similar advances, falls, and recoveries. Some places like China and Europe, where karst is more prevalent, have had a longer and better appreciation of caves and karst. The world's first national karst institute was created in Romania in 1920. But like the US, cave and karst research did not begin to flourish until the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries, as exemplified by the creation of the International Union of Speleology (UIS) in 1965 and national institutes in China (1976), Switzerland (2000), Ukraine (2006), andBrazil (2007). Unfortunately, the Ukrainian institute has apparently been closed since the 2014 Russian take-over of Crimea where its headquarters was located. Within the past 20 years, karst knowledge and study have spread widely into developing countries. The annual international karst training program of China's International Research Center on Karst particularly stands out. Since 2008 it has hosted experts from around the world to teach students and professionals from developing countries that include Brazil, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Thailand, and Uganda, among others, and covered all of their expenses to attend. As in the US, these attendees conduct their karst work in many sectors of society. In the US, groundwater quality remains a vital topic of practical concern. While not ignored, it is less important in other countries where alternative water sources and treatment of poor quality water is already established. In contrast, engineering projects such as tunnels and dams are more common in many non-US countries. One major concern for most karst countries is the proliferation of covercollapse sinkholes, including those in urban non-karst areas where karst-like features can result from infrastructure failures, such as broken water lines. The lines between basic and applied research are blurring. Speleothem dating and paleoclimate studies are conducted internationally, no longer for purely academic purposes but to advance models of modern climate in the fight against climate change. China has taken a special interest in the karst carbon cycle to identify carbon sinks. The US currently leads the way in geomicrobiological cave research, with other important work in this field occurring primarily in Europe. Funding for many of these investigations is often tied to the development of new medicines, materials, and industrial processes. This exciting field has amazing implications for karst science and despite rapid advances, is certainly in its infancy. The US also leads in the field of extraterrestrial cave research, but has close partnerships with researchers primarily in Europe and Japan. With hundreds of apparent cave entrances identified on the Moon and Mars, and karst-like features found on Titan and other planetary bodies in absolutely non-karst environments, the definition of karst may be stretched, at least for beyond-Earth applications, to move away from the solution of bedrock to the physics of mobilizing material for subsurface transport. As excited as I am by the wonders we will see and learn underground in the coming years, I'm even more excited by the human dimension that will make that possible. I come from the generation where your typical karst scientist began as a caver-where physical exploration of the unknown whetted our appetites to solve all cavernous mysteries. My generation also saw the conflicts between traditional scientists and caver scientists, often with neither side appreciating the perspectives and data of the other. The modern karst generation is wonderfully integrated. It includes caver scientists and scientists who developed their interest in caves and karst in other diverse ways. I'm thrilled to see the blending of \"cave-truthed\" information with techniques and perspectives from fields once considered unrelated. With this new foundation being poured into a new mold for karst science, rather than end this status report with a projection of the future, I would prefer to sit back quietly and enjoy the future as it unfolds. But first there may be one more major task for the current generation of karst scientists, managers, educators, and explorers to accomplish. The UIS has developed a proposal for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to recognize 2021 as the International Year of Caves and Karst. This event will promote the need for proper cave and karst research and management through public education programs and coordination with governmental bodies. At the time of this writing, organizations in over 30 countries have agreed to participate, and at least 5 countries will formally carry this proposal to UNESCO, which will vote on it in October 2017. Assuming UNESCO approves, I encourage you to work with me to support this unprecedented opportunity to make \"cave\" and \"karst\" words that are known, appreciated, and properly acted upon around the world."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Park Service (NPS) manages significant karst landscapes that are found in about 50 NPS park units. The term \"significant\" is used to denote karst landscapes that are the dominant land-forming processes within at least a portion of a park unit. Karst landscapes are important for various reasons, including the large amounts of fresh water they provide. NPS park units, in general, only contain portions of larger karst landscapes. Even large parks, such as Grand Canyon National Park at 1.2 million acres in size, only contain a portion of a much larger karst landscape. In order to effectively manage and protect these landscapes, NPS managers must have a clear understanding of the entire karst system and processes at work within and outside of park boundaries. By understanding entire karst systems, managers can work with adjacent landowners to ensure the long-term viability of the NPS portions of these shared karst landscapes."}, {"section_title": "Management Needs", "text": "For many karst landscapes in the United States, and throughout the world, there is limited knowledge about groundwater basins. This includes basic information such as the bedrock geology, location of the total surface recharge area, where recharge into the ground takes place, the flow paths groundwater takes in the subsurface, and where those waters flow back to the surface as a spring. In many cases, the NPS does not have a basic understanding of how these shared karst landscapes operate or of the ecosystems they may contain. Karst landscapes can be complex with changing groundwater conditions based on low-or highflow conditions. In high-flow conditions water from one groundwater basin can easily flow into one or more other groundwater basins. Highways, buildings, sewer lines, oil and gas drilling rigs, pipelines, concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs), and other infrastructure create numerous opportunities for contamination to these valuable resources. The complexity of karst systems allows contamination to appear in unexpected places with often devastating consequences. A report series-Shared Karst Landscapes-has been initiated within the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD) to address these basic information needs for park units that contain significant karst landscapes. In order to provide a park manager a more holistic understanding of entire karst systems, the goals of these reports are to (1) provide an overview of available scientific information, (2) identify essential missing information, (3) recommend future research, (4) identify current and (or) potential vulnerabilities from anthropogenic activities within and adjacent to the park unit, and (5) provide documentation for planning efforts for the long-term protection and viability of significant karst landscapes. The first report in this series addresses the shared karst landscape found within Cedar Breaks National Monument and Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah. For park units that contain karst landscapes, the major landowners adjacent to NPS properties tend to be the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, other state and local agencies, and some private landowners."}, {"section_title": "Shared Karst Landscape Studies at Mammoth Cave", "text": "Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky is a prime example of the NPS successfully managing a portion of a much larger karst landscape based on extensive groundwater studies and ecosystem dynamics. Mammoth Cave was created as a national park in 1941 when little was known of the geology, hydrology, biology, or the extent of the cave. Even less was known of the karst landscape and its many complexities that reached far beyond park boundaries. From the 1940s to the present, members of the National Speleological Society (NSS) and the Cave Research Foundation (CRF) were attracted to the vast cave systems found in the area. Explorations and cave surveys completed by these organizations linked the adjacent Flint Ridge Cave System to Mammoth Cave in 1971 to form the longest known cave in the world at just over 232 kilometers (144 miles). Since then, these surveys have increased the known length of Mammoth Cave to over 652 kilometers (405 miles) and the cave still remains the longest known in the world. These explorations along with studies from other university scientists and students, a number of private, state, and federal agencies, and the efforts of NPS research geologist Dr. James Quinlan, began documentation of the groundwater basin complexities found within this immense karst landscape that included Mammoth Cave (Alexander, 1993). Dr. Quinlan's work along with numerous other scientists and cavers used the results of more than 400 dye traces to delineate 27 groundwater basins within a huge area south of the Green River. This work showed conclusively that water within groundwater basins originating outside Mammoth Cave National Park boundaries flows directly into the park through various passages within Mammoth Cave. It also showed major contamination issues for Mammoth Cave from the towns of Horse Cave and Park City, Kentucky, and nearby rural areas (Alexander, 1993). Scientific studies have continued to help augment this initial work. The overall basic scientific information gained from this research has provided the park with the ability to better manage its karst resources and has set an example of what is needed for the many other significant karst landscapes managed within the NPS."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "There has been some work done in other NPS park units with significant karst landscapes to proactively understand groundwater dynamics, potential contamination issues, and associated cave and karst ecosystems. Several studies have occurred only after actual or potential contamination issues were identified. These include potential lead mining in Mark Twain National Forest that threaten some of the largest springs in the country within Ozark National Scenic Riverways in Missouri, and a large hog CAFO on private property within a major karst landscape that includes portions of Buffalo National River. Because of the extensive karstification of the area, this CAFO potentially threatens the integrity of Buffalo National River. At the present time, both the north and south rims of Grand Canyon National Park get all their water from a cave spring located deep within the canyon below the north rim. The park has recently initiated a series of studies to understand the dynamics of karst groundwater basins in the park in anticipation of a complete replacement of their public water system. Within the NPS, much work remains for even a basic understanding of karst landscapes. The benefits of the GRD Shared Karst Landscapes report series is to help park managers quickly ascertain what information is available and what information is needed to help them better understand these vital resources. With better understanding and thorough planning efforts, park managers will have the ability to work intelligently with adjacent land managing agencies and other neighbors to provide long-term preservation for these important resources."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There are several methodologies for assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of karst aquifers such as the COP (V\u00edas and others, 2006) and PI (Goldscheider and others, 2000) methods. Both COP and PI consider the protection provided by layers overlying the aquifer (the O-factor in COP and P-factor in PI) and the reduction in protection due to infiltration conditions (the C-factor in COP and I-factor in PI) (Zwahlen, 2004). However, the C-factor in the COP method and I-factor in the PI method suffer from explorational bias in that their results are heavily dependent on knowing the location of all karst features. As an alternative, the P3 method (Probability, Protection, and Precipitation) minimizes explorational bias by using the probability of encountering karst features in addition to the location of known karst features. This methodology allows researchers to assess the vulnerability of karst aquifers by conducting thorough investigations of smaller areas and applying the results to larger study areas. The P3 method was first used to assess the vulnerability of the Edwards aquifer in the Cibolo and Dry Comal Creek basins in southcentral Texas, USA ( fig. 1) (Sullivan and Gao, 2017). The methodologies for calculating the three factors used in the P3 method are presented here to assist researchers wishing to apply the method to other aquifers. "}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Probability Factor", "text": "The probability factor assigns vulnerability values to areas within map units based on the probability of it containing a karst feature (for example, cave, sinkhole, spring). Based on prior studies, the factors used to assess probability within the study area were distance to streams, distance to faults, lithology, and Distance to Nearest Neighbor (DNN) (Veni, 2003;Hovorka and others, 2004;Lindgren and others, 2004;Gao and Alexander, 2008;Shah and others, 2008;Doctor and Doctor, 2012;Ramanathan and others, 2015). In other locations, additional factors such as distance to ponds, quarries, and sinkholes were used to assess karst feature probability (Doctor and Doctor, 2012). When applying the P3 method to other aquifers, researchers should evaluate the factors likely to influence karst feature probability to determine which to use in their analysis. The primary data used to calculate the probability factor are the locations of karst features, based on the premise that karst development indicates preferential flow paths for aquifer recharge. The Texas Speleological Survey (TSS) provided GIS data specifying the locations of 2,275 known karst features in Bexar, Comal, and Kendall Counties (TSS, 2016). The locations of an additional 1,124 karst features were taken from detailed karst investigations at the Camp Bullis (Texas) Training Site (Zara Environmental and George Veni and Associates, 2009). Two initial screenings were conducted to assign probability factor scores. First, areas within 10 meters of a stream and (or) 500 meters of a karst feature were assigned a probability factor score of 0, indicating a very high probability of contaminants infiltrating the aquifer. In this study, probability scores ranged from 0, very high, to 0.9, very low. Second, lithologies within the Edwards aquifer artesian zone and the Fort Terrett Formation were assigned probability factor scores of 0.7, indicating low probability. The lithologies within the artesian zone were assigned low probability scores because the confining conditions lower the probability of contaminants infiltrating the aquifer in this region. The Fort Terrett Formation was assigned a low probability because only nine karst features were documented in this lithology in the study area counties. Areas not assigned a probability factor score during the initial screening were analyzed based on distance from streams, distance from faults, and DNN. At the end of the analysis, the lowest of the three probability scores, which equates to the highest vulnerability, was assigned. For example, a region earning a probability score of 0.7 based on distance from a stream and a probability score of 0.1 based on DNN would be assigned a probability score of 0.1. Distance from streams and faults were both analyzed using the following procedure: 1. Karst point features were created for each lithology (table 1). For lithologies present within the Camp Bullis Training Site, only the Camp Bullis data were used in the analysis because the area was subject to documented, thorough karst investigations. The Person Formation is not present within the Camp Bullis Training Site, so TSS data were used for its analysis. 2. Distance from each karst feature to its nearest stream/fault was calculated by using the NEAR tool in ArcGIS 10.2.2 (all mentions of tools within the manuscript refer to ArcGIS 10.2.2 tools). 3. The distribution type was determined by comparing the actual Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) against the expected CDF for normal and lognormal distributions. During this analysis, distance from faults and distance from streams were both found to have normal distributions. Probability factor scores were then assigned to areas based on standard deviation (\u03c3) intervals from the mean distance (x \u0305 ) (table 2). Table 1. Predominant lithologies present in the study area. Areas not assigned a probability factor score of 0 during initial screening were subject to additional analysis. The lowest of the three probability scores, which equates to the highest vulnerability, was assigned. The DNN was assessed based on the results of Nearest Neighbor Analysis (NNA) (Clark and Evans, 1954), which is used to measure how a population deviates from a random distribution. The key parameters are the Clark-Evans index (R), which measures a distribution's deviation from randomness and the standard variate of the normal curve (c), which measures whether a distribution is clustered, random, or dispersed. NNA was conducted using the following procedure:"}, {"section_title": "The analysis was again restricted to", "text": "Camp Bullis Training Site data with the exception of the Person Formation. 2. In order to minimize edge effects, karst features closer to the lithological boundary than their nearest neighbor were not used in the analysis. After eliminating these karst features, only the following map units had enough remaining karst features to conduct NNA: Krgl, Kgru, Kk, and Kp (see table  1). 3. The POINT DISTANCE tool was used to identify the DNN for each karst feature. 4. The AVERAGE NEAREST NEIGHBOR tool was used to calculate nearest neighbor statistics."}, {"section_title": "The distribution type was determined by", "text": "comparing the actual CDF against the expected CDF for normal and lognormal distributions. In this case, the DNN were found to fit a log-normal distribution so the mean distance and standard deviation of the log-transformed data were used to assign probability factor scores using table 2. Additionally, the use of NNA for sinkholes is most appropriate for R values below 0.55 (Galve and others, 2009). Within the study area, all R values were below 0.55 (table 3) except for the Kainer Formation (Kk). However, the negative c value for the Kainer Formation demonstrates strong clustering, indicating the use of NNA is appropriate. "}, {"section_title": "Protection Factor", "text": "The protection factor measures the degree of protection afforded by soil and lithological layers overlying the aquifer under study. The protection factor is identical to the O-factor in the COP method, but calculating the soil protection factor (O S ) and lithological protection factor (O L ) bear some description.

Table 4. Soil protection factor (Os) 1 (from V\u00edas and others, 2006). The criteria for assigning the O L factor are from V\u00edas and others (2006). The O L factor was calculated separately for the Edwards aquifer drainage, recharge, and artesian zones ( fig. 1). Within the drainage zone, the study area is underlain by the Trinity aquifer whose top elevation was taken as the interface between the upper and lower members of the Glen Rose Formation (map units Kgru and Kgrl, respectively). Within the recharge zone and artesian zones, the study area is underlain by the Edwards aquifer and the aquifer top elevation was set equal to the values used for the Edwards aquifer Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) (Lindgren and others, 2004). Within each area, the geologic map database of Texas (Stoeser and others, 2005) was used to determine the uppermost member. The thickness of each member (excluding alluvial deposits described below) was determined in ArcGIS by using the following procedure iteratively until the aquifer top was reached:"}, {"section_title": "Convert watershed Digital Elevation", "text": "Model (DEM) to a point feature using RASTER TO POINT. 2. Select point features along the interface of the lithological layer and layer immediately beneath it. 3. Convert points selected in step 2 to a DEM using TOPO TO RASTER. This creates a raster representing the elevation of the interface between the two lithologies. 4. Determine thickness using RASTER CALCULATOR to subtract the DEM created in step 3 from the watershed DEM during the first iteration. During subsequent iterations, the thicknesses of all overlying lithologies must also be subtracted from the watershed DEM: where T n-1 is the thickness of the lithology being calculated T n is the thickness of overlying lithologies DEM is the elevation value from the surface for the watershed being studied. The above procedure was modified to identify the elevation of the Kgru-Kgrl interface in the eastern portion of the drainage area. Because the interface is not exposed in that area, the raster created in step 3 did not extend to the eastern portion of the drainage area. This was overcome by assigning the reported average thickness to Kgru in the eastern portion of the drainage area. The resulting estimated interface points were used in step 3 above to create a raster representing the elevation of the Kgru-Kgrl interface. The thicknesses of alluvial deposits required a different procedure because they occupy areas removed by erosional processes rather than forming a lithological interface. For these areas, the following procedure was used: 1. Create DEM of riverbed with EXTRACT BY MASK from the watershed DEM with the river polyline as the mask. 2. Convert riverbed DEM to point feature using RASTER TO POINT. 3. Convert point feature to DEM using TOPO TO RASTER. This creates a DEM extending the plane of the riverbed elevation underneath the alluvial deposits. 4. Depending on the meander of the river, the riverbed DEM may not extend fully beneath the alluvial deposits. This can be overcome by using FOCAL STATISTICS and selecting the \"Ignore NoData in calculations\" option. When this option is selected, NoData values (i.e., gaps in the riverbed DEM) will be assigned values by the FOCAL STATISTICS tool. By selecting the MEAN option for statistics type, FOCAL STATISTICS will assign NoData cells values equal to the average values of surrounding cells from the riverbed DEM."}, {"section_title": "Merge DEMs from steps 3 and 4 with", "text": "RASTER CALCULATOR and the following expression: CON(ISNULL(DEM_step3.tif), DEM_step4.tif, DEM_step3.tif).

The stream network in much of the study area consists of bedrock, making these assumptions appropriate. In areas where these assumptions do not hold, the resulting error will likely be small because the probability factor discussed below assigns areas within 10 meters of streams a probability factor of 0, indicating very high vulnerability.

The factor considers that vulnerability increases with precipitation until dilution of contamination becomes more important than increasing recharge. The effective infiltration curve of Civita and De Maio (2004) was used to define the value intervals for the precipitation quantity sub-factor (P Q ) shown in table 6. The intervals were developed to correspond to precipitation index ratings on the infiltration curve below 6, between 6 and 9, and above 9. There are two recharge estimates for the study area. Ockerman (2007) estimated the recharge rate for the Upper Cibolo Creek basin to be 15 percent whereas the SWAT model developed by Sullivan and Gao (2016) estimated recharge for the entire study area to be 14 percent (Note SWAT model recharge estimate not published in Sullivan and Gao, 2016). The effective infiltration rate for the study area was determined by multiplying the average annual rainfall by 1.15 to account for wet years, then by the recharge rate of 15 percent. For other study areas, the ranges in table 6 must be adjusted based on the corresponding estimated recharge rate. The precipitation intensity sub-factor (P I ) is assigned by first calculating the precipitation intensity, which equals the average annual precipitation (mm yr -1 ) divided by the number of rainy days. The P I sub-factor is then assigned using the ranges in table 6. The final precipitation factor is the sum of the P Q and P I sub-factors."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Map Development", "text": "Vulnerability maps for the P3 method were generated by multiplying the probability, protection, and precipitation values together to obtain a vulnerability score. The resulting scores are rated from very low to very high vulnerability using the criteria in table 7. "}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "Assessing the validity of vulnerability maps requires using such tools as spring hydrograph analyses and tracer tests (Zwahlen, 2004). Unlike validation of numerical models, validation of vulnerability maps is a qualitative comparison of the vulnerability map with the expected vulnerability. Spring hydrographs demonstrate how rapidly the aquifer responds to rainfall, thereby giving an assessment of how quickly contaminants can enter the aquifer. Recharge areas for rapid response springs are associated with very high aquifer vulnerability. Similarly, tracer tests provide an estimated travel time from source input to output as well as indications of contaminant attenuation time along the flow path from source input to output. In this case, tracer velocities of 43 meters/hour are associated with areas of very high aquifer vulnerability (V\u00edas and others, 2010). In addition to these methods, nitrate sample results were also used in the validation process. Once nitrate enters the Edwards aquifer, it is expected to be diluted until it reaches the typical nitrate level for the aquifer of 1.85 milligrams per liter as N (mg-N L -1 ) (Musgrove and others, 2010). The Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) defines nitrate levels above 5 mg-N L -1 as elevated (Tremallo and others, 2015). Based on these factors, portions of the aquifer where nitrate concentrations exceeded 5 mg-N L -1 were considered areas of very high or high vulnerability. This methodology was used to qualitatively assess accuracy of the P3 vulnerability map. Conversely, if the P3 vulnerability map does not accurately identify areas of expected very high or high vulnerability there is likely an error in the vulnerability map. This would most likely be caused by karst feature data gaps, because although the P3 method seeks to minimize explorational bias, it does not eliminate it. Were this to occur, additional field studies of the affected areas would be warranted to identify additional karst features and adjust the P3 vulnerability map accordingly."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The protection of karst aquifers from contamination is of vital importance because they make up a large portion of available worldwide groundwater resources. A key method for aquifer managers to protect karst aquifers is through the development of vulnerability maps. While several methods exist, they suffer from explorational bias because they rely heavily on knowledge of specific locations of karst features. The P3 method was developed to minimize explorational bias by producing vulnerability maps that rely on the probability of encountering karst features as well as the locations of known karst features. The P3 method was first used and successfully validated in the Cibolo and Dry Comal Creek watersheds of south-central Texas, USA. The methodologies for calculating the probability, protection, and precipitation factors were presented as well as how to validate the resulting vulnerability map to allow researchers to utilize the P3 method to assess aquifer vulnerability in other karst regions.

Calculate study area annual deposition rate. The study area annual deposition rate was determined by clipping the national-scale atmospheric wet deposition annual map (2338.383-m resolution) by the study area boundary in ArcGIS 10.2.2. The geometric mean of the resulting raster was multiplied by the area of the study area to determine the annual atmospheric wet deposition of nitrogen. 2.

In this method, annual statewide nitrogen inputs are calculated based on annual sales data from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (APFCO) for each State, and the statewide totals are apportioned to the county level based on each county's effective population. For calendar years 2007-2010, APFCO data were not available for analysis, so an alternative method was developed. First, quarterly non-farm fertilizer total tonnage data were obtained from the Office of the Texas State Chemist (OTSC, 2014). The OTSC reporting periods do not correspond to the calendar year, so converting these values to annual amounts required apportioning the quarterly data to individual months. This conversion was accomplished by using monthly fertilizer sales data from Missouri, which publishes monthly non-farm fertilizer sales information (fig. 2) (Missouri Plant Food Control Service, 2014). The validity of utilizing non-farm fertilizer data from Missouri as a surrogate for Texas was evaluated by comparing the seasonal variations in non-farm fertilizer use against recommended fertilizing practices for turf grass. In Texas, fertilization is recommended approximately 3 weeks after grass turns green in the spring and every 8-10 weeks thereafter (Taylor II and Gray, 1999a, b). Additional fertilization is recommended 4-6 weeks before the anticipated first frost for both Bermuda and St. Augustine grasses as well as in December and February for lawns over-seeded with a winter grass variety (Taylor II and Gray, 1999a, b). The data for Missouri show peaks in March, August, and October, corresponding to the recommended early spring, summer, and fall fertilization times. Slightly higher percentages in December through February correlate with recommended winter fertilization times for over-seeded turf. The alignment of the monthly Missouri non-farm fertilizer use with recommended fertilization practices for lawns typical of Texas indicates the data from Missouri likely represents non-farm fertilization practices in Texas. The derived monthly use percentages were then used to determine annual non-farm fertilizer sales from the OTSC data. For calendar years 2007-2010, sales were determined by apportioning quarterly fertilizer sales to individual months based on the use percentages on figure 2. The monthly data were then summed to determine annual fertilizer tonnage use. The resulting values, expressed in tons of product, were converted into kg-N by determining the average nitrogen content of non-farm fertilizer applied in Texas in 2006. This was accomplished by dividing the statewide non-farm nitrogen estimate from Gronberg and Spahr (2012) of 39,445,277 kg-N by 328,341,766 kg-product, the total product reported by the OTSC for 2006 (OTSC, 2014), for a nitrogen content of 12 percent. Allocating statewide non-farm fertilizer sales to the county level was accomplished by using the method of Gronberg and Spahr (2012). Decennial census population data from 2000 and 2010 were used to determine county population values. Population estimates between years were obtained through linear interpolation. The county NFFU estimates were apportioned to the study area by evaluating the various land uses within each study area county. The percentage of non-farm fertilizer land use (table  1) within the study area at the county level was taken to represent the percentage of each county's NFFU within the study area. The resulting percentages were multiplied by the annual county-level NFFU to determine the estimated NFFU within each study area county.

Based on this, these four crops were selected for further analysis. First, the planted area for each crop by county was determined from NASS agricultural surveys (NASS, 2015). Next, CropScape data were used to determine the percentage of each county's crop area located within the study area (for example, 6.55 percent of the corn planted in Bexar County is planted in the study area). The resulting percentages were multiplied by the crop's planted area in each county to determine the total planted area for each crop in the study area.

For livestock, the statewide average stocking rates for each animal type were taken from the USDA Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2014). Livestock were then apportioned throughout the study area into HRUs with agricultural land uses. Similarly, dogs were apportioned to HRUs containing urban land classes proportionally to population density. Deer were assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the study area whereas feral hogs were evenly distributed throughout land classes containing suitable habitat. Finally, birds were located in the HRUs associated with the bird count locations identified above. A second step is necessary because SWAT only reads one manure operation per HRU per year. For HRUs with multiple animal types, this was overcome by combining manure input from multiple animal types into a single CFRT_KG value. Because different animal types have different manure nitrogen characteristics, CFRT_KG values for various animal types could not be simply added together. Rather, the combined CFRT_KG value was based on a continuous fertilizer operation for the animal type with the highest CFRT_KG value in the HRU. The CFRT_KG values for other animals in the HRU were then adjusted based on the ratio of manure nitrogen content for each animal.

In its current form, the septic system module turns all OSSFs within an HRU on at the same time. This is significant because if SWAT agglomerates multiple OSSFs into a single HRU, there is no way to account for OSSFs having different installation dates. This problem was mitigated by exempting the three OSSF land uses from the land use threshold during HRU delineation as well as defining four slope classes (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and greater than 6 percent) rather than the typical three slope classes. The septic system module within SWAT is designed to model leachate from traditional septic systems, but is unable to model aerobic treatment unit effluent. ATUDs were modeled by altering the properties of one of the septic system types within SWAT to account for ATUDs different effluent characteristics and shallower effluent discharge. This was accomplished by changing the depth of effluent discharge to 100 mm and the effluent concentrations for total nitrogen to 73 mg-N L -1 , ammonia to 29 mg-N L -1 , and nitrate to 44 mg-N L -1 (McCarthy and others, 2001). The same effluent concentrations were used for ATUS systems, with the difference being that the effluent is surface applied. ATUS discharge was therefore simulated by adding a continuous fertilizer operation with daily application of organic nitrogen for each ATUS HRU.

Pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is stable under anaerobic conditions in the Chattanooga Shale, located stratigraphically between the Fort Payne Formation and the Leipers Limestone. However, in the presence of oxygen and water, acid-loving chemolithotrophic bacteria can transform the iron sulfide minerals into a toxic solution of sulfuric acid, dissolved iron, and other trace metals known as acid rock drainage (ARD). The objective of this study was to disrupt chemolithotrophic bacteria responsible for ARD associated with the Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee's karstic central basin using chemical treatments and to foster an environment favorable for competing micro-organisms to attenuate the biologically induced ARD. Chemical treatments were injected into flow-through microcosms consisting of 501 grams of pyrite-rich shale pieces inoculated with ARD bacteria. Treatments included a sodium hydroxide-bleach mix, a sodium lactate solution, a sodium lactate-soy infant formula mix-each treatment with or without phosphate buffer, or injected sequentially with sodium hydroxide. The effectiveness of the treatments was assessed by monitoring pH, dissolved iron, and other geochemical properties in the discharge waters. The optimal treatment was a sequential injection of 1.5 grams sodium hydroxide, followed by 0.75 gram lactate and 1.5 grams soy formula dissolved in 20 milliliters of water. The pH of the discharge water rose to 6.0 within 10 days, dissolved-iron concentrations dropped below 1 milligram per liter, the median alkalinity increased to 98 milligrams per liter as CaCO 3 , and sulfur-reducing and slime-producing bacteria populations were stimulated and exhibited an increase in the estimated population counts. The ARD attenuating benefits of this treatment were still evident after 33 weeks. Other treatments provided a number of ARD attenuating effects but were tempered by problems such as high phosphate concentrations, short longevity, or other shortcomings."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As part of a broader study related to karst ecosystem assessment (Christman and others, 2016), an effort was undertaken in late 2014 to compile spring locations and associated flow and geochemical data for the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) region. Currently available data on spring locations, flow, and selected geochemical parameters were compiled from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017a), the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017b), and the Water Quality Portal (WQP) (U.S. Geological Survey and others, 2017). The WQP is jointly sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). The WQP database integrates publicly available water-quality data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS), the EPA STOrage and RETrieval (STORET) Data Warehouse, and data from the Agricultural Research Service's (ARS) Sustaining The Earth's Watersheds-Agricultural Research Database System (STEWARDS). These data were entered into a single geodatabase, and an effort was made to achieve consistency among various flow and geochemical measurements that were reported. Here, we present a brief summary of the results of this compilation effort, and some of the challenges encountered along the way. Within the fifteen States that intersect the Appalachian LCC region, a total of 3,654 springs were in the GNIS database, 7,545 were in the WQP database, and 9,910 point features were in the NHD as \"Spring/Seep\" (4619) or \"Sink/Rise\" (5291) feature types. In the NHD, a \"Spring/Seep\" feature is defined as \"a place where water issues from the ground naturally,\" whereas a \"Sink/Rise\" feature is defined as \"the place at which a stream disappears underground or reappears at the surface in a karst area.\" Because of this dual definition of a spring, both NHD feature types contain individual unique springs. At present, there is not a specific category for just \"Sinks,\" but that is currently under consideration for inclusion in the NHD as a point feature type, which would allow the \"Sink/Rise\" feature type to be reserved only for estavelles (Alan Rea, U.S. Geological Survey, oral comm., 2016). Certain parameters available within the WQP data were selected on the basis of overall spatial coverage and pertinence to karst systems; these included concentrations of calcium, magnesium, nitrate-nitrogen, chloride, total phosphorus and alkalinity, and physical measurements of specific conductance, temperature and flow. After selecting for the occurrence of at least one of these measured parameters for each spring location, the number of springs in the examined dataset was reduced to 6,133. The data were summarized among springs in the folded and faulted rocks of the Appalachian Valley and Ridge province and those in the flat-lying rocks of the Appalachian Plateaus, as described below. Because of the lack of a unique identifier for each spring that would serve as a common key attribute among these databases, it was unfortunately not possible to accurately identify and account for overlapping entries within the databases. For example, a spatial check using the exact geographic coordinates of each spring yielded only two overlapping entries between the GNIS springs and NHD springs, one overlapping entry between the NHD springs and WQP springs, and no overlapping entries between the WQP springs and GNIS springs; however, applying a buffer distance of 100 feet yielded 1,432 overlapping entries between the GNIS springs and NHD springs, 444 overlapping entries between the NHD and WQP springs, and 1,062 overlapping entries between the WQP springs and GNIS springs. Clearly, overlapping features exist among the three databases, therefore it should be decided by the user of the data on a case by case basis whether a given spring feature is duplicated, or may represent multiple spring orifices at a single geographic location. Because many of the NHD springs were originally added from the GNIS database, it was expected that there would be at least as many springs in the NHD database as there are in the GNIS database, but there is notable inconsistency between the two databases. For example, in Georgia the number of springs in the GNIS database is 207, whereas the NHD database only reports 46 \"Spring/Seep\" or \"Sink/Rise\" point features. The current categorization of point-feature types in the NHD database may identify springs as either a \"Spring/Seep\" or as a \"Sink/Rise\"; however, an effort is currently underway to identify and break out sinks separately within the NHD (Alan Rea, U.S. Geological Survey, oral comm., 2016). Interestingly, the majority of \"Spring/Seep\" or \"Sink/Rise\" points in the NHD are located in States west of the Mississippi River ( fig. 1). This fact highlights the degree to which the springs in the eastern United States are under-studied, the majority of which are not captured within the queried WQP or GNIS databases."}, {"section_title": "Results by State", "text": "Within the fifteen States that intersect the Appalachian LCC region, the numbers of all known springs from the three databases queried for this study are shown by State on figure 2. Kentucky and Tennessee stand out as having the largest number of spring locations identified. Note, however, that these springs were mostly obtained from the NHD, and many lack a unique name and (or) USGS groundwater identifying number that would facilitate crosschecking against the other databases. The locations of springs that intersect the areas of carbonate bedrock obtained from the national-scale karst map database of Weary and Doctor (2014) and those within a 1-kilometer buffer around carbonate polygons were selected as karst springs. The distribution of these karst springs among the various States ( fig. 3) is very similar to that for all springs ( fig. 2), indicating that the majority of springs in most of these States are karst springs. This finding is supported by the percentage of karst springs in each State, as shown on figure 4. States having less coverage of karst areas such as North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York show the lowest percentages of karst springs. Within the boundary of the Appalachian LCC region itself, 6,133 springs (irrespective of lithology) were identified that have some associated flow or geochemical data. It is worth noting that of these 6,133 springs, 682 springs (11 percent) had flow or geochemical data that were not collected by the USGS; the majority of these (606, or 89 percent) contained data collected by the National Park Service. Approximately 60 percent of the springs with flow and (or) water-quality data were in regions underlain by carbonate bedrock, and are assumed to be karst springs (n=3,741).   "}, {"section_title": "Karst Springs in the Appalachian LCC Region", "text": "Karst springs within the Appalachian LCC region were divided into two broad categories based on general physiography: (1) Valley and Ridge, and (2) Plateaus physiographic regions. The boundaries of these regions were identified using this two-fold categorization applied to 20 kilometer x 20 kilometer grid cells as described in Christman and others (2016). A map illustrating the spatial distribution of the springs in the WQP database that had associated flow and (or) selected geochemical data is shown on figure 5. No karst springs were found to lie within the boundary of the Appalachian LCC region in the States of Ohio, Illinois, and South Carolina. Available geochemical and discharge data from the springs were summarized by both State and physiographic region to examine the data for any general trends, and summary statistics were calculated (table 1). The geochemical parameters were chosen on the basis of completeness of the data as well as pertinence to karst systems, but the uneven spatial distribution of the collected geochemical and flow data preclude more than a broad, regional comparison of the data. If a single spring was associated with multiple measurements of any given parameter, the arithmetic mean value for that parameter was calculated and reported for that spring; thus, the values in the compiled dataset represent mean values for each parameter. Table 1 includes the count, median, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the mean parameter values for each physiographic region within each State. The distributions of the mean values for nearly all of the geochemical parameters were highly skewed (only water temperature exhibited a normal distribution), therefore, only the median values of the parameters were used for further comparison. Because of the inability to account for overlapping springs among the databases, the distributions of the geochemical parameters are unlikely to be accurate representations of the sample population. A more rigorous statistical characterization can be conducted once overlapping springs are removed from the compilation. A plot comparing the median values of geochemical parameters between the Valley and Ridge and Plateaus physiographic regions is shown on figure 6, with a multiplicative factor applied to several of the parameter values for ease of illustration. The median specific conductance and calcium concentration of the Plateau springs were notably greater than those of the Valley and Ridge springs. In contrast, alkalinity and magnesium concentrations were higher in springs of the Valley and Ridge region than those in the Plateau springs. Median nitrate and chloride concentrations in springs were roughly comparable between the two regions, while total phosphorus concentration was greater in the Plateau springs. Median spring water temperature was slightly higher for the Plateau springs than for the Valley and Ridge springs, as might be expected due to the higher elevations and thus, cooler temperatures of the Valley and Ridge. Median spring discharge was greater in the Valley and Ridge region than in the Plateaus region overall, but the standard deviation and overall range of discharge values varied greatly among different States (table 1). The paucity of discharge data in general precluded any meaningful comparisons of spring discharge among different States or physiographic regions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A preliminary assessment of a compilation database of springs within the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) region is presented.

The Tishomingo Anticline is an uplifted lobe of the central Arbuckle Mountains, encompassing an area of nearly 200 km 2 . This anticline is bounded to the south by the Washita Valley Fault Zone and Sycamore Creek Anticline, to the north by the Reagan Fault and Mill Creek Syncline, to the east by the Troy Granite, and to the west by the Dougherty Anticline and Washita Valley Syncline (Ham and McKinley, 1954). The Tishomingo Anticline is nonsymmetrical and dips to the west at an average of approximately 12 degrees. The eastern half of this anticline has been entirely eroded down to granite. An axis is apparent in the northwestern exposure trending west-northwest with dips becoming steeper to the northwest at 25 degrees (Ham and McKinley, 1954). All of the mapped faults associated with the anticline trend roughly northeast and are all pre-Desmoinesian (Early Pennsylvanian) in age. There are no northwest-trending faults (such as the Reagan and Washita Valley Faults) on the anticline, but instead these faults bound the anticline to the north and south, are of Missourian (Late Pennsylvanian) age, and dip to the south. These faults are also quite large and where drilled on the Arbuckle Anticline, vertical displacements of greater than 2,300 meters (m) have been measured (R.W. Allen and R.L.

Twelve activated charcoal dye detectors were deployed in creeks, springs, and caves in the area. Two intriguing positive results were obtained at the overflow spring and at a lower level spring.

The most obvious of these mineralogical distinctions is the presence of glauconite and absence of chert in the Cambrian-age Arbuckle formations. The opposite is true for the Ordovician-age Arbuckle formations (Puckette and others, 2009). Certain groupings of these chert types may be used as reliable formation markers (Ham, 1950). Using glauconite as an indicator of stratigraphic source material for the Arbuckle Group is appropriate because the Cambrian Lower Arbuckle Group is topographically isolated from the Ordovician Upper Arbuckle. As such, surface water flowing from the Cambrian Arbuckle Group does not drain to any of the recharge features known to connect to the cave and therefore, appears to receive no surface-derived material from the Lower Arbuckle. This would indicate that any glauconite found in the cave would erode into the cave from the subsurface Cambrian strata. Using glauconite as a stratigraphic source material indicator proves to be difficult, however, as it has very low weathering resistance. Chert on the other hand, is much harder and less soluble than carbonate rock and makes up the overwhelming fraction of mobile sediments within the cave. The chert gravel samples obtained from the cave contained a diverse suite of cryptocrystalline silicate materials, the most common being milky quartz, smoky quartz, and flint. Jasper and agate chalcedony are common as well as siliceous oolites, which are exclusive to the Cool Creek Formation (Decker, 1939 (Decker, 1939). These gravels also range from sub-angular to well rounded, indicating fairly significant movement. Sediments were visually inspected for glauconite, but results were negative. The Cool Creek Formation crops out in an adjacent watershed from the known extent of Mystic Cave and it is this watershed where surfacederived chert gravels are entrained into swallow holes and sinkholes. Because these gravels have not been found to be carried into swallow holes or sinkholes in the Kindblade Formation, we conclude that any surface-derived chert gravel is entering the subsurface from the watershed overlying the outcrop area of the Cool Creek Formation."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Data Collection", "text": "The data collected and discussed in this abstract are the results of Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) surveys and continuous waterlevel and electrical conductivity data collected with transducers installed in Mystic Cave.

Electrical Resistivity Imaging is an appealing method of unobtrusive subsurface data collection that provides continuous data related to properties of the underlying rock. Locations for the ERI lines are chosen based on the hydrologic, geologic, and structural characteristics of the site. These data help in the interpretation of the location of the water table, presence of void spaces, differentiation of rock units, and detection of structural features. The results of these surveys help to understand the overall hydrogeological context of the cave system. This technique is based on the measurement of electrical resistivity between electrodes. Resistance, in ohms, is a fundamental property of a volume of material defined as the material's opposition to the flow of electrical current (Reynolds, 1997). In a volume of material with length (L) and cross-sectional area (A), the material's resistance will be proportional to the potential drop of an induced electrical current (V/I), where V is the voltage and I is the current. Resistivity, in ohm-meters (ohm-m), is expressed as the resistance through a distance, making it independent of material geometry (Halihan and others, 2009). Advanced Geosciences, Inc.

The 600-800-ohm-m area near the surface on the southeast end of the image is the result of an epikarst setting where the soil mantle contains a dense network of fractured limestone. On the right side of the image is a large conductive feature, 0-600 ohm-m, with a large \"lobe\" shaped feature extending to the left and a linear component extending to the bottom of the image. This is interpreted as a potential void. The upper 25 m of this void is expected to be air-filled, but displays a similar conductive signature as the phreatic zone. The reason for the air-filled void space to be more conductive than the surrounding rock matrix is a result of the cave walls being covered in films of mineral-enriched water leaching downward from the surface. Water with high concentrations of dissolved minerals is a good conductor, which would provide a medium for an electrical current to flow through.  The geometry of this feature is not seen in other ERI surveys from the Arbuckle Mountains (Halihan, and others, 2009). However, the profile of this feature shares a close resemblance to an underwater survey sketch of a large chamber by John Brooks during a cave dive in the 1990s. The linear feature ranging from 2,000-4,000 ohm-m on the northwest side of the image starting at the surface and extending over 100 m below the surface is interpreted as a fault, which can be seen as a lineament on satellite imagery. The majority of the image ranges from 900-2,000 ohm-m, which is consistent with values for bedrock surveyed using this same technique near Connerville, OK (Halihan and others, 2009) and other electrical resistivity data collected in the Arbuckle Mountains. ER2-330-This survey was located east of Sump A near a southeast-trending branch of the main cave passage. The epikarst zone is present across the top of the image; however, it thins in the center of the image and thickens toward the southeast and northwest ends of the survey. Two fractures are apparent at 82 m and 252 m on the image. Both fractures are visible via lineaments on satellite imagery. The cavern profile signatures seen in ER1-550 are not present at the expected depth of the cave, indicating the passage may have veered off to the south following the strike of the bedding. ER3-550-This survey was located northeast of the Mystic River passage, and the data were acquired just west of Bison Tooth Cave. This image is similar to ER2-330 in that it shows competent bedrock with fractures and an epikarst zone along the top of the image. The resistivity values are lower than ER2-330, likely due to enhanced dissolution of the limestone. The conductive features near the surface occur at surface expressions of bedding planes and fractures, indicating that these areas are where recharge predominantly occurs. The cavern profile signatures seen in ER1-550 are not present at the expected depth of the cave. A resistive feature occurs at the appropriate depth along the Bison Tooth Cave fault, but it is thought that these resistivity values are too consistent with the surrounding bedrock. A conductive feature appears along a fault to the north, but this feature is clipped off from the profile due to the way the data was collected and processed and its significance remains inconclusive."}, {"section_title": "Continuous Water Monitoring Results", "text": "Increases in barometric pressure from the Sulphur Mesonet appear to correspond to water-level increases from transducer data in Mystic Cave. This indicates that atmospheric pressure is being exerted elsewhere, causing the water levels to rise in the cave in order to maintain pressure equilibrium throughout the system. The transducers recorded a significant recharge event on March 8, 2016. This rain event raised water levels from 3.4 to 16.4 feet inside the cave ( fig. 3). Inversely, electrical conductivity dropped from 450 to 320 microsiemens per centimeter. This indicates a major influx of rain water with low electricalconductivity values. Groundwater is typically more conductive than meteoric water as a result of dissolved minerals from the host rock. This is due to an increase in ionic strength, which increases electrical conductance. The greater the volume of fresh water entering the system the more the electrical conductance will decrease. As the meteoric water flushes through the system and flow returns to base-level conditions, electrical-conductivity values will begin to increase as they return to \"background\" levels. Each rain event that causes an increase in water level also decreases the electrical conductivity, but not proportionally. The inconsistency between the responses in water level and electrical conductivity are likely a result of the way in which recharge enters the karst system. On March 7, 2016, a 2.08-inch rain event was recorded at the Sulphur Mesonet north-northeast station. On March 8, 2016, at approximately 10:00 am, water levels began to rise from 3.39 to 16.4 feet by 12:45 pm, resulting in a total increase of 13.01 feet in less than 3 hours. The water level remained steady at 16.4 feet until 4:30 pm and then began to decrease rapidly until nearly 2:00 am. By this time water levels were near static conditions. The responses in water level and electrical conductivity from this rain event are substantially different than responses observed from April 17-20, 2016 (fig. 3). During this 4-day period, the Sulphur Mesonet Station recorded a total of 3.81 inches. The majority of the rainfall (2.93 inches) occurred on April 17, which resulted in a water-level increase from 3.02 to 12.25 feet in 4 hours. However, instead of a sudden spike and flat peak, the observed rise was a steep curve followed by another smaller steep curve 7 hours later. This pulse pattern indicates that water is initially entering a reservoir or impoundment before flowing into the cave. This could also explain why some precipitation events do not cause water-level rises and electrical conductivity drops and other precipitation events do. The shape of the waterlevel graph is also controlled by precipitation type. A sudden input of a large volume of meteoric water at a high flow rate will result in a similar pattern."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "From geospatial analyses of the geologic map and cave map layers, we could see that the passages of Mystic Cave were heavily controlled by faulting, with a few faults seemingly guiding the passages. We expected to see an influence of faulting in the ERI results, but the results from ER1-550 were totally unexpected. A large anomaly with a conductive signature was apparent in the data and situated along the fault. The profile and description of this feature appear to be consistent with the 'Optimystic Chamber', a large cavern that was encountered by cave diver John Brooks during the 1990s. The upper reaches of this feature appear to extend very close to the surface with a discernable expression near the fault. Additional high-resolution ERI surveys are currently being planned for a non-invasive investigation. The second anomaly at the left on figure 2 looks nearly identical in profile to the downstream section of the cave upstream from Sump B. This feature is interpreted as being consistent with the downstream section in expected location, depth, and profile. The results from ER2-330 were mostly negative, although a shallow epikarst zone is apparent. However, with regard to Mystic Cave, it is thought that the cave beyond Sump A veers off the fault to follow the strike of the bedding to the south. For ER3-550, we strayed far north of the main fault to survey three additional faults near Bison Tooth Cave to see if anomalies with conductive signatures might extended this far and to investigate the possibility of phreatic conduits associated with these faults. The results from this survey were mostly negative, but a few anomalies may require further investigation. Comparing transducer water-level data with Mesonet rainfall data, a rain event on February 23 had no effect on water level within the cave. However, every rain event thereafter had a direct effect within the cave. Upon analyzing these data, we postulated that a farm pond was required to fill before water could overflow the spillway into a sinkhole or swallow hole. However, at least three farm ponds are known on this ranch and each contains a swallow hole immediately below their dam although only one of those ponds was observed to overflow during the time of this investigation. The surface water from the overflowing pond terminates in a large swallow hole, which at the time of this paper, remains unexplored because of difficulty navigating surface debris. The swallow holes below the other two ponds have both been surveyed, but the cave nearest the main fault is currently the longest and most voluminous of all the caves surveyed during this investigation. The main fault appears to drain a fragmented basin of approximately 2.6 km 2 . This basin contains numerous sinkholes and swallow holes that drain areas within the basin ranging from a few square meters to several hundred square meters. We expect this basin to be the primary source of input for Mystic Cave. Several caves have been revealed after removing farm trash that was discarded into these sinkholes throughout the 20 th century. These caves are all of considerable length and trending in the direction of Mystic Cave. Because of the size of the study area, large data gaps currently exist. However, by continuing this study, we plan to fill these gaps through additional ERI surveys, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, tracer tests, and by physically surveying and exploring the subsurface through caves. We expect Mystic Cave to contain many tributaries, which may become more numerous in the farther upstream sections beyond the Mystic River passage; many leads remain unexplored.

However, water well drilling in extremely heterogeneous karst aquifers is typified by unpredictable results, with some wells providing very good water yields and water quality while others, often located only meters away, provide poorer yields and (or) water quality. Local scale (less than 100 meters) hydrogeologic factors that influence the distribution of permeability at, and flow of groundwater to, individual wells, and regional scale (100s to 1,000s of meters) factors that influence groundwater recharge, storage, and flow in karst aquifers contribute to this seemingly erratic variability. Numerous boreholes and completed water wells have been drilled over the years in a publicsupply well field near Elizabethtown, Kentucky, as the demand for public-supplied water has increased. The well field is underlain by karstic Mississippian limestones characterized by very low primary porosity and permeability but extensive fracture and dissolution porosity and permeability. Although four wells are regularly pumped, one primary well (PW1) supplies approximately 57 percent of the total daily average amount of water withdrawn from all wells, and nearly a quarter of the daily average amount of raw water processed by the water treatment plant. Borehole drillers' and caliper logs indicate that fractures and \"brecciated\" zones are more abundant and developed in the upper 25 meters of bedrock in PW1 than in most of the other wells. The reasons for this are not entirely clear; however, a video camera examination of PW1 confirmed the presence of several prominent solutionally widened bedding-plane partings and highly stratified zones of enhanced vuggy or brecciated porosity in the upper half of the well. Horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the karst aquifer at PW1 was estimated to be about 129 meters per day using pumping test data collected in October 2015 and leaky-confined analytical solution methods. In comparison, a hydraulic-conductivity estimate of about 8 meters per day was reported from results of a prior pumping test of an unused public-supply well (OW4) located approximately 1,000 meters south of PW1. Bedding-plane partings identified on a caliper log of well OW-4 appear to be more dispersed vertically and relatively less widened solutionally. In spite of the unpredictability in yield among wells, and water-quality issues such as high turbidity and sulfate concentrations in some wells, the Elizabethtown area is considered one of the better locations for karst groundwater development in Kentucky. Local and regional hydrogeologic factors that contribute to this assessment include extensive shallow karst conduit development, solutional enhancement of areally extensive bedding-plane partings, bedrock structure and dip, proximity of mapped faults, and the presence of scattered but relatively thick residual and alluvial deposits of sand and gravel that overlie the karstic limestone in many locations."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Globally, karst covers roughly 2.2\u00d710 7 km 2 or about 10 to 15 percent of the world's continental areas . China has one of the largest karst areas in the world, with more than 344.3\u00d710 4 km 2 of carbonate rock, which covers one-third of the total country (Yuan and others, 1991). The karst in China extends from the reef islands at 3\u00b0 N in the South China Sea to the Lesser Khingan Mountains at 48\u00b0 N, and from the Pamirs at 74\u00b0 E across to Taiwan Island at 121\u00b0 E ( fig. 1). There are two large areas of concentrated karst. One is the karst area in the Shanxi Plateau and adjacent regions, also called the North China Karst, which have a combined area of nearly 47\u00d710 4 km 2 and is a semi-arid to arid karst type. The other is the famous South China Karst with an area of nearly 55\u00d710 4 km 2 , mainly lying in Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces, and also includes parts of Chongqing, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces. The South China Karst is famous for its outstanding series of karst landforms such as fenglin (peak forest), fengcong (peak cluster), tiankeng (huge doline), deep karst gorges, caves, and the stone forest, in humid and semi-humid to tropical and subtropical climates. In addition, there is a large karst area on the Tibetan plateau, which is called plateau karst in China, with a total area of 11.5\u00d710 4 km 2 . Karst in mainland China covers a very large area, spanning from south to north and from west to east because of the broad distribution of carbonate rock. As a result of the differences in latitude, altitude, distance from the ocean, and climate, the characteristics of karst development in China, especially karst feature complexity, are quite varied from place to place (Yuan and others, 1991). China karst has an unusual character that arises from both its geological and climatic history. The following four synergistic characteristics of karst in China are distinct from other karst areas in the world others, 1991, 1998). The first is that most of the carbonate rocks in mainland China are pre-Triassic age, compact and hard, especially those of Paleozoic age, the exception being the Tibetan plateau, where the majority of the carbonate rocks are of Jurassic and Cretaceous age. The second is the dramatic Cenozoic uplift of mainland China, especially in western China, which has not only brought about conspicuous karst landforms but has also placed the karst features formed in different geological ages at different altitudes. The third is that most of the karst areas of mainland China escaped scouring and denudation during the last glaciation, which allowed the preservation of a remarkable diversity of karst features developed in rocks of different geological ages. The fourth is that because of the Asian monsoon, the combination of heat and moisture in mainland China provides strong external factors that support karst processes. Thus, many features of the Chinese karst occur only in China and are not truly comparable with landforms of somewhat similar superficial appearance in other parts of the world (Yuan and others, 1998). Karst environments are quite fragile and have been especially affected by fast economic development and urban expansion since the 1980s, and the frequently extreme climate events under the impact of global warming in mainland China. While people enjoy attractive and beautiful karst landscapes in China, a series of environmental and engineering geological problems in karst areas have risen, including drought, flooding, sinkhole collapse, rocky desertification, water pollution, and cessation of spring flow. Drought and flooding are usually more extreme in karst areas because of the dual impact on surface and subsurface waters. Liu and others (2014) stated that karst areas in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces had generally become drier (regional mean annual precipitation decreased by 11.4 mm per decade) and experienced enhanced precipitation extremes between 1951 and 2012."}, {"section_title": "Sinkhole problems have long plagued", "text": "China and challenged its geologists and engineers. The total area at high risk for sinkhole collapse is 34.3\u00d710 4 km 2 , which is mainly in Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. Since the 1950s, 3,315 sinkhole events and at least 40,000 sinkhole pits have been documented, of which more than 70 percent were triggered by human activities, especially groundwater extraction and tunneling, such as mining and railway tunnels. Also, extremely heavy rainfall is another key trigger for some natural sinkholes formed in the recent decade (China Geological Survey, 2016a). Rocky desertification is a serious ecological disaster in the South China Karst. It refers to the transformation of a karst landscape covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape almost devoid of soil and vegetation in tropical and subtropical karst regions (Yuan, 1997a;Wang and others, 2004;Jiang and others, 2014). The area of rocky desertification in the South China Karst was 9.2\u00d710 4 km 2 in 2015, mainly in Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces (China Geological Survey, 2016b). Water pollution is also a severe problem in China's karst areas. Guo and others (2010) pointed out that there are four main types of contamination of karst aquifers: (1) rural and agricultural pollution, (2) pollution from urban development and industry, (3) pollution from mining, and (4) accidental groundwater pollution. In addition, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and antibiotics have been found in karst waters in recent years (Hu and others, 2011; Ma and others, 2015; Sun and others, 2016). Cessation of flow from major karst springs and water-bursting during tunneling are often important environment problems. In the North China Karst there are more than 200 karst springs. Tens of them are the main local sources of water, but most of them have gone dry in the past few decades (Yuan and others, 1991). Liang and others (2013) stated that 30 percent of karst springs have dried up, discharge of 80 percent of karst springs has been dramatically reduced, and regional karst groundwater levels have been continuously declining at a rate of 1 to 2 meters in each aquifer over the past 30 years. Environmental geological problems in karst areas are always related to changes in natural equilibrium of the karst environmental system. Moreover, they are always related to karst processes (Yuan and others, 1991). Facing these problems in China's karst areas, the China Geological Survey has funded a series of scientific investigation projects on karst hydrogeology, sinkhole collapse, rocky desertification treatment, karst processes and the carbon cycle, and karst landform and cave protection, which yielded fruitful achievements and attracted much attention from home and abroad. Chinese karst scientists work hard to solve these complex problems and to contribute to the development of global karst research through academic ideas, new theories, case practices, international cooperation and exchanges, and the sharing of technology and knowledge. Since 1990, the famous Chinese karst scientist Prof. Daoxian Yuan has successfully proposed and hosted three successive international karst projects of the International Geoscience Programme (formerly International Geological Correlation Programme [IGCP]) of UNESCO: In addition, he has also taken part in other two successive karst-related IGCP projects as coleader: IGCP 513 \"Global Study of Karst Aquifers andWater Resources\" (2005\u22122009) and IGCP/SIDA598 \"Environmental Change and Sustainability in Karst Systems\" (2011\u22122015). These projects not only strongly promote the international development of karst science, but also put forward a new area of study in karst science-Karst Dynamics Theory. The International Research Center on Karst (IRCK) was established in 2008 as a new international academic research organization on karst under the auspices of UNESCO, under the Institute of Karst Geology, Chinese Geological Academy of Sciences in Guilin, Guangxi, China. Karst Dynamics Theory is the basis for IRCK's programs. For decades, Chinese karst scientists have been working hard to focus on the theoretical connotations of karst dynamics, hydrogeological surveys and groundwater exploration, global changes, rehabilitation of degraded karst ecosystems, karst environmental protection, and the prevention and control of karst geological hazards."}, {"section_title": "Karst Dynamics Theory", "text": "Prof. Daoxian Yuan proposed and created Karst Dynamics Theory in 1997 (Yuan, 1997b), which adopted the philosophy from Earth System Science. Karst dynamics is the discipline that studies the structure, functions, and rules of running and applying a Karst Dynamic System (KDS) ( fig. 2) (Yuan, 1997b). A KDS could be defined as the transportation and transferring system of material and energy that controls the formation and evolution of karst, which occurs at the interfaces between the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, but is constrained by existing karst features, and dominated by carbon cycling, water cycling, and calcium (magnesium) cycling (Yuan, 1997b)  2). Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and H 2 O are the two main driving forces of the KDS, which interact within the different spheres. Therefore, from the viewpoint of Earth System Science and Karst Dynamics, karst processes involve the dissolution or deposition of carbonate rock in the carbon cycle with its coupled water and calcium (magnesium) cycles. Karst features are the result and evidence of these processes on carbonate rock. An intrinsic feature of the KDS is the sensitivity of its responsiveness to surrounding environmental changes; as a result, karst processes play an important role in the global carbon and water cycles (Yuan, 1997b). The KDS is an open, tri-phase disequilibrium system, which consists of gaseous, aqueous, and solid phases. The gaseous phase consists of gases involved in karst processes, predominantly CO 2 , and is part of the atmosphere. It links with the biosphere through photosynthesis and decomposition, and links to human activities through the making of lime and cement, and the burning of fossil fuel, thus involving them in karst processes. The aqueous phase is the water flow that contains Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , HCO 3 -, CO 3 2-, H + , and dissolved CO 2 as its major constituents. It is a part of the global hydrosphere. It is not only the core of the KDS, but also serves as a link between the lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and human activities, and includes them in karst processes, particularly dissolution and deposition. The solid phase is dominated by different types of carbonate rocks and other soluble rocks in the lithosphere, and also linked to the mantle through deep faults and joints, thus gaining additional CO 2 from deeper parts of the Earth. The four principal functions of the KDS were established by numerous studies (Yuan, 1997b). The first function is to better understand the formation of karst features (or karstification), which cause environmental and geological problems. The second is to regulate the content of greenhouse gases (mainly CO 2 ) in karstification, and thus help to mitigate environmental acidification. The third is to evaluate the migration, enrichment, and precipitation of certain elements that influence both the formation of mineral deposits and biodiversity in karst areas. The final principal function of the KDS is to record the course of climatic and environmental changes (paleoenvironmental reconstruction or rehabilitation), and thus provide a basis for the study of global change. Thus, comparing traditional karst research from the academic perspectives based on geologicalgeographical descriptions, Karst Dynamics expand upon research areas and highlight interdisciplinary aspects, which is consistent with the tenets of modern science. In general, an accurate understanding of the structure, functions, and rules of running a KDS is the key to scientifically and reasonably solving resource and environmental problems in karst areas at local to global scales."}, {"section_title": "Hydrogeological Surveys in China's Karst Areas", "text": "As a developing country, China is making a huge effort to create hydrogeological maps of its karst areas at multiple scales. The China Geological Survey is the leading agency on hydrogeological surveys and research in China's karst. Many surveys were finished between 2003 and 2015, at a total expenditure of 480 million renminbi (RMB) ($69.3 million U.S.). Up to now, hydrogeological maps at 1:250,000 scale cover 78\u00d7104 km 2 and maps at 1:50,000 scale span 25\u00d7104 km 2 in the South China Karst (Xia, 2016). These maps show that total groundwater storage is 1,620\u00d7108 m 3 in the South China Karst and the total sustainable yield is 536.0\u00d7108 m 3 /yr; presently, only 12.1 percent is utilized. In the North China Karst, the total sustainable yield is 103\u00d7108 m 3 /yr, 66.0 percent of which is utilized (table 1, fig. 3). These values show that a huge potential reservoir of karst groundwater is available for use. An outstanding characteristic of karst groundwater systems in the South China Karst is the well-developed cave streams (Yuan and others, 1991). The latest studies show that there are 2,763 subterranean streams with a total groundwater discharge of 470\u00d710 8 m 3 /yr during the dry season, which is nearly the volume of the Yellow River. However, only 10 percent of the subterranean streams are sustainably exploited at present (Xia, 2016). In contrast, the outstanding characteristic of karst groundwater systems in the North China Karst is the large karst springs with catchment areas greater than 1,000 km 2 . There are 41 karst springs with a discharge of more than 1,000 liters (L)/s in north China and 171 karst springs with a discharge of more than 100 L/s (Liang and others, 2013).  B\u00f6gli, 1980;Yuan, 1997b;Liu and Dreybrodt, 2015). The area left of the white dashed line shows the basic framework, rules of material origin, and movement in a Karst Dynamic System. The area to the right of the white dashed line shows the fate of DIC (HCO 3 -) from karst processes, which is utilized by photosynthesis of aquatic phototrophs. The diffusion boundary layer (DBL) and water-air interface are both key boundary layers. Photos: photosynthesis by aquatic phototrophs; AOC: autochthonous organic carbon; SAOC: sedimentary autochthonous organic carbon; DIC1: dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the groundwater system; DIC2: dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the surfacewater system. Karst groundwater has been captured for use in four primary ways, depending on local hydrogeology, geology, landforms, and the ecological environment: 1. damming of karst conduits to create underground or surface-underground reservoirs, 2. tank storage of high-elevation epikarst springs in peak-cluster areas where water shortages are severe, 3. pumping of vadose and phreatic zone groundwater in peak-forest areas, and 4. installation of grout curtains in fissured karst aquifers to concentrate groundwater discharge and hydraulic head to fill watersupply tanks. According to distribution, exposed features, and demands for karst water, the groundwater exploitation and utilization ways mentioned above are widely used in the karst areas of southwest China. After 1999, over 10 large capture and exploitation projects for subterranean stream or karst spring use have been successfully constructed in accordance with the above ways ( fig. 4) (Jiang and others, 2006;Wang and others, 2006;Mo and others, 2006). These groundwater capture systems have greatly improved the water-supply capacities and effectively solved the water-shortage problems of 22 million people in the mountainous karst areas in south China. In addition, scientific studies of the karst water cycle along with modeling simulations and water quality have sharply increased since the 2000s. Some new techniques in karst groundwater studies, such as stable isotopes, non-traditional isotopes, rare earth elements, radioisotopes, persistent organic pollutants, biomarkers, microbiology, antibiotics, and others, have been widely used in karst hydrogeology. New ideas, such as global and extreme climate change, along with ecological water requirements in a karst system, also have been incorporated in new karst water research. In addition, an outstanding benefit of karst hydrogeology in China is that it connects closely with the needs of social and national economic development, and can solve many practical and theoretical problems."}, {"section_title": "The Carbon Cycle in Karst Systems", "text": "The role of karst processes in global climate change has increased scientific interest in the carbon cycle in karst systems for over 20 years. A preliminary conceptual model of the karst carbon cycle is illustrated on figure 2. In the 1990s, IGCP 379 preliminarily estimated that the global quantity of atmospheric CO 2 trapped by \"carbon dioxide-water-carbonate (CO 2 -H 2 O -CO 3 )\" is roughly 0.61 petagrams of carbon (PgC)/yr (Yuan, 1997;Yuan and Jiang, 2000). However, at that time, the estimate only considered an inorganic process whereby CO 2 is dissolved and consumed by carbonate rocks on continents and transformed to HCO 3 in water. Curl (2012) suggested that these processes cannot sequester carbon in karst systems. Veni (2013) proposed that most carbon moves rapidly through karst aquifers, but carbon may be stored in sediments and in secondary calcite deposited in caves, with a total stored global organic carbon volume of 2.2\u00d710 2 km 3 , and a potentially greater volume in paleokarst hydrocarbon reservoirs. Liu and others (2010, 2015) described a new model of CO 2 -H 2 O-carbonate-aquatic phototroph interaction, which suggests that the rapid kinetics of carbonate dissolution, coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic uptake of HCO 3 -, could provide a net carbon sink in karst stream organisms and sediments. Karst groundwater is often rich in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) because of carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid generated during the hydration of CO 2 . This DIC can be consumed by submerged aquatic phototrophs because the clear water allows light to penetrate stream benthic environments. The consumed DIC could then be sequestered as organic carbon (Jiang and others, 2013; Liu and others, 2015; Liu and Dreybrodt, 2015; Yang and others, 2015; Pu and others, 2017). Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic processes is a potentially bright prospect for sequestering carbon in surface karst systems. A preliminary estimate of the net atmospheric CO 2 sink produced by this new model could be as large as 0.477 PgC/yr on continents (Liu and Dreybrodt, 2015), which accounts for about 17 percent of the terrestrial missing carbon sink and is comparable with the carbon sink in the world's forests (Pan and others, 2011). In addition, catchment-scale estimates of the carbon sink in karst systems has been ongoing since 2013. The Institute of Karst Geology of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences is doing such research in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Pearl River. Tracing organic carbon sources (autochthonous or allochthonous), defining inorganic carbon-organic carbon mutual transformation, quantifying the impacts of sulfuric acid and nitric acid involvement and their promotion of carbonate dissolution reactions, and determining the regulating potential of carbon sinks with respect to climate and land use, are becoming a new frontier in Chinese karst research.

To address this problem, the Chinese government has launched a national program of integrating rocky desertification controls in karst areas. The first stage of work occurred during 2006\u22122015. In this stage, according to the local characteristics of the surface karst ecosystem and rocky desertification processes in the South China Karst, the critical countermeasures can be summarized as follows: As of 2015, the Chinese central government had invested 11.9 billion RMB ($1.73 billion U.S.) and received 130 billion RMB ($18.9 billion U.S.) from local governments and societal donations to implement that work. The 4\u00d710 4 km 2 area of rocky desertification had received first time treatment. Their remarkable results included preliminary ecological rehabilitation, reduction of bare rock ratios and rates of soil erosion, and a decrease in local poverty. Although these results are very good, some new problems have emerged: 1. although the trend of rocky desertification was curbed as a whole, rocky desertification in remote mountainous regions remained severe. 2. surface ecosystem functions have not been established in rehabilitation areas after surface revegetation. 3. there are no effective countermeasures to prevent soil piping through fissures, fractures, or conduits into underground spaces or aquifers. 4. water shortages are still severe in mountainous regions, while only 15 percent of the groundwater is utilized. 5. the win-win principle for restoration of the surface ecology lacks sustainable impetus as some cash crops face a series of problems such as continuous cropping of some crops and invasion of exotic species. In 2016, the Chinese government started the second stage of work, which extends from 2016 to 2020. This work will attempt to solve the above five problems and further focus on surface karst ecosystem stability and function, rational utilization of water and soil resources, and sustainable development by the people and nature in karst areas."}, {"section_title": "Karst and Cave Heritage in China", "text": "Zhang (2010) reported more than 3,000 caves in China, with a combined length of more than 4,000 km.

Thus, accurate characterization of karst aquifers is a crucial international need. A series of geophysical methods, such as high-density resistivity and transient electromagnetics, are widely used to explore the characteristics of karst aquifers. In recent years, karst scientists at the Institute of Karst Geology have developed many new geophysical methods to reveal the location, depth, extent, and structure of karst aquifers, including the multi-source high-power mise-a-la-masse technique (Han and others, 2016) and controlled source audio magnetotellurics (CSAMT) (Gan and others, 2017). These methods effectively raised the exploration accuracy for karst groundwater, and the average percentage of well completions has been greatly increased from 30 percent to over 70 percent in the South China Karst. Severe droughts occurred in southwest China karst areas in 2010 and in north China karst areas in 2011. The China Geological Survey organized more than 2,000 geologists and hydrogeologists to seek karst groundwater in these disaster-stricken areas.

Under support from the China Geological Survey, the rate of development of karst research and hydrogeological surveys has been rapidly growing in China in recent years, covering nearly the whole discipline of modern karst geoscience. This growth has been aided by frequent international academic exchanges and the big demands of social and national economic development. The China Geological Survey held a top meeting to propose an international big scientific plan on \"Resource and Environmental Effects of Global Karst Dynamic Systems\" (also called \"Global Karst\") on November 14, 2016, in Guilin, China. Fourteen karst scientists from 11 countries jointly signed a support statement on Global Karst at the meeting, meaning that an important and widespread international cooperation opportunity on karst research is coming soon. The China Geological Survey has released the 13th 5-year plan for geological science and technology, which states that the development direction of Karst Dynamics is a priority. Global climate change in karst areas, and the structure, function, and evolution of the karst critical zone, and environmental protection of karst are priority development disciplines. Chinese karst scientists are making huge efforts to promote development of modern karst science at home and abroad. It had been observed that seasonal variation of soil CO 2 followed a sinusoidal pattern similar to that of the soil surface temperature, with much higher values in the summer season and lower values in the winter season. In summer, peak values of soil CO 2 were always observed after rainfall events, while low values occurred during dry episodes. These observations indicate that soil moisture is the key controlling factor on soil CO 2 during the summer months when soil temperature is high and relatively stable. The content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in drip waters varies inter-and intra-annually and has a positive correlation with drip water discharge at rapid response sites. The DOC content of drip water increases sharply above a threshold of rainfall intensity (greater than 50 millimeters per day) and shows several pulses corresponding with intense rain events (greater than 25 millimeters per day). The DOC content was lower and less variable during the dry period than during the rainy period. Calcite growth rates from drip water exhibit significant intra-annual variations, with the lowest rates occurring during the summer monsoonal rainy season (July-August) and the peak rates occurring from autumn to spring. The temporal change in the calcite growth rate is negatively correlated to the drip rate and cave air PCO 2 , and positively correlated to the pH of the feeding drip water. The seasonal recharge regime of drip water is likely to be the primary control on the drip water quality and quantity, which, in turn, control the calcite growth rate in Shihua Cave. During the summer rainy season, periodic rainstorm events result in drip water with lower pH, lower calcite saturation indexes, and high DOC content, while at the same time cause an increase in PCO 2 of the cave air, which inhibits calcite growth. Notably, the annual laminae of some stalagmites in Shihua Cave are characterized by bi-optical variation in transparency and luminescence. Under conventional light transmission microscopy, an annual lamina is identified as a couplet of a thick transparent band and a thin opaque band. The very thin dark layers often, but not always, coincide with an enhanced luminescent band under reflected light microscopy with UV-excitation. The abrupt decrease in growth rate during the rainy season probably results in more defects in the calcite crystals, and forms the thin opaque (luminescent) layer observed in stalagmites. Inclusions (liquid and solid) in the calcite crystals probably incorporate luminescent organic colloids and trace elements.

The straight-line distances from an extremely large sinkhole pit, 85 meters (m) in diameter and 38 m in depth, to the highways and railway were 200 m, 600 m, and 500 m, respectively. Several methods including geophysical surveying, borehole and well drilling, groundwater elevation survey, and hydrochemical analysis of groundwater were used to study the formation mechanisms of these sinkholes. The spatial distribution of the Jili subterranean river was consistent with the north-south strike of the contact between the middle Carboniferous limestone bedrock and the overlying Quaternary deposits which control the location of sinkhole formation. In addition, both historical sinkhole events and analysis of data from a groundwater-air pressure monitoring system installed in the underlying karst conduit system indicate that sinkholes in this area are more likely induced by extreme weather conditions within typical karst settings. Extreme weather conditions in the study area before the sinkhole collapses consisted of a year-long drought followed by continuous precipitation, with a daily maximum precipitation of 442 millimeters between May 31 and June 1, 2010. Typical geological conditions include the Jili subterranean river in middle Carboniferous limestone overlain by the Quaternary overburden with thick clayey gravels. In the recharge zone of the subterranean river, a stabilized shallow water table was formed in response to the extreme rainstorm because of the presence of the thick clayey gravels. When the subterranean conduit was flooded through the cave entrance on the surface, air blasting may have caused cave roof collapse followed by the formation of soil cavities and surface collapses. Borehole monitoring results of the groundwater and air pressure monitoring show that potential karst sinkhole collapse can pose threats to Shanbei village, the Nan-Liu High-Speed Railway, and the Wu-Ping highway. Local government and land-use planners need to be aware of any early indicators of this geohazard so that devastating sinkholes can be prevented in the future. Monitoring results also indicate that groundwater and air pressure data collected from both the Quaternary deposits and the bedrock karst system can provide useful indicators for potential sinkhole collapses in similar karst areas.

This is especially true in karst aquifers where rapid recharge and groundwater flow rates can quickly affect water levels in wells, spring discharge, and groundwater geochemistry. The Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas is a highly productive fractured karst aquifer that responds rapidly to changes in hydrologic conditions in a region characterized by cyclic periods of drought and wet conditions. To better understand how groundwater quality changes over short (daily to monthly) and long (seasonal to decadal) timescales, the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Project began a monitoring and sampling effort in 2013 that combines high-frequency water-quality monitoring with discrete sample collection at different timescales. Three water wells in the Edwards aquifer have been instrumented to provide near-continuous (subhourly) water-quality data (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen). These data are augmented by the collection of six discrete samples per year for a range of geochemical constituents, including major ions, nitrate, selected isotopes, and age tracers. The wells are near San Antonio, Texas, along an updip-to-downdip aquifer transect, and consist of one monitoring well in the unconfined (recharge) zone and two public-supply wells in the confined zone of the aquifer. Discrete sample results indicate updip-to-downdip trends in groundwater geochemistry with respect to water-rock interaction and groundwater residence time. Drought conditions prevailed during the first year of data collection, providing baseline information for a period when little aquifer recharge occurred. Subsequent wet conditions resulted in extensive recharge and an accompanying regional hydrologic response. Groundwater geochemistry at the updip monitoring well varies rapidly in response to aquifer recharge. In contrast, groundwater geochemistry at the public-supply wells in the confined part of the aquifer is less variable. The combination of high-frequency and discrete data collection provides unique insights into changes in groundwater geochemistry in a dynamic karst aquifer at different temporal scales."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Edwards aquifer is one of the most prolific karst aquifers in the United States. It is a major source of water for residents in Bexar, Comal, Hays, Medina, and Uvalde Counties. The Edwards aquifer also supplies large quantities of water to agriculture, business, and industry in the region. The major artesian springs of the Edwards aquifer provide water for recreational activities, businesses, and downstream users, and habitat for several threatened or endangered species (Edwards Aquifer Research and Data Center, 2010). The Edwards aquifer is primarily recharged by direct infiltration as streams in the catchment area cross the limestone outcrops of the Edwards Group (recharge zone). The catchment area and recharge zone of the Edwards aquifer are depicted on figure 1. As the streams cross the recharge zone, they lose substantial amounts of water as direct infiltration into the highly permeable, faulted and fractured rocks of the outcrop. Direct infiltration of rainfall also occurs in the interstream areas of the recharge zone (Maclay and Small, 1976). The current (2017) method of estimating recharge to the Edwards aquifer (Puente, 1978) relies on a hand-drawn base-flow separation technique to identify the base-flow and storm runoff components of the streamflow hydrograph. The current method is hereinafter referred to as the \"Puente method.\" The base-flow and storm runoff components are then used in a series of mass-balance equations for estimating the amount of recharge to the Edwards aquifer. The Puente method is labor intensive and is subject to a potential lack of consistency in the results obtained by different hydrographers. A new approach for estimating recharge to the Edwards aquifer is being developed that automates the methodology by using the computational scripting language, Python, to estimate recharge from hydrologic input data such as rainfall and streamflow. The new automated approach will increase the transparency and reproducibility for recharge calculations. "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Currently 2017, annual recharge estimates are calculated separately for each of the major basins in the catchment area of the Edwards aquifer, as well as for the ungaged areas between the major basins ( fig. 1). The Puente method uses streamflow data collected at USGS streamflow-gaging stations near the upstream and downstream boundaries of the recharge zone ( fig. 1), and estimates of the distribution of rainfall. Since 2004, the distribution of rainfall in the catchment area and recharge zone of the Edwards aquifer has been estimated by using calibrated NEXRAD (NEXt-generation weather RADar) data (Edwards Aquifer Authority, written commun., 2016). The basic equation for computing recharge is as follows (from Puente, 1978): is a conversion factor from cubic feet per second-days to acre-feet. The volume of flow measured at each outlet gage of the catchment area is the sum of base flow and storm runoff. Base flow is the part of the hydrograph that is sustained by local springs and bank storage of water flowing into the stream. Base flow is generally characterized by a gradual increase or decrease in the hydrograph's discharge, depending on the amount of contribution from groundwater discharge (A and B) ( fig. 2) (Puente, 1978). The storm runoff is the part of the hydrograph that results from overland flow generated by a storm event, typically characterized by a sharp increase in discharge from base flow (C)  The equation for estimating total runoff from direct rainfall in the areas between the catchment area and recharge zone is as follows (modified from Puente, 1978): The Q a term in equation 2 is derived from a base-flow separation method described by Puente (1978), and is manually drawn by hand. The Q a is computed from a function of the difference between the peak of the base-flow storm response and the recession curve before the storm (D and E), added to the initial increase in base flow during a flood (A) and the base-flow component after a flood (B) ( fig. 2). The difference between components D and E ( fig. 2) is then applied to the relation between base-flow discharge in cubic feet per second, and the estimated groundwater storage contribution, in thousand acre-feet per second-days. This relation is represented as a polynomial function that is based on observations of long-term streamflow hydrographs collected during the winter months when evapotranspiration is less and storm events are less common compared to the rest of the year (Puente, 1978). It is assumed that runoff within the recharge zone occurs at a similar rate per unit area as in the catchment area. Similarly, the loss of water in the stream as a result of evapotranspiration is assumed to be proportionately equal for both the catchment and infiltration areas (Puente, 1978). The resulting study produced a detailed 1:24,000-scale hydrostratigraphic map, and names and descriptions of the geologic and hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs) in the study area, and focused on the geologic framework and hydrostratigraphy of the outcrops and hydrostratigraphy of the Edwards and Trinity aquifers within northern Bexar and Comal Counties, Texas. In addition, parts of the adjacent upper confining unit to the Edwards aquifer are included.

The rocks within the study area are sedimentary and range in age from Early to Late Cretaceous. The Miocene-age Balcones fault zone is the primary structural feature within the study area. The fault zone is an extensional system of faults that generally trend southwest to northeast in south-central Texas. The faults have normal throw, are en echelon, and are mostly downthrown to the southeast. The Early Cretaceous Edwards Group rocks were deposited in an open marine to supratidal environment during two marine transgressions. The Edwards Group consists of the Kainer and overlying Person Formations. Following tectonic uplift, subaerial exposure, and erosion near the end of Early Cretaceous time, the area of present-day south-central Texas was again submerged during the Late Cretaceous by a marine transgression resulting in deposition of the Georgetown Formation of the Washita Group. The Edwards Group overlies the Trinity Group and consists of mudstone to boundstone, dolomitic limestone, argillaceous limestone, an evaporite, shale, and chert. The Kainer Formation is subdivided into (from bottom to top) the basal nodular, dolomitic, Kirschberg Evaporite, and grainstone members. The Person Formation is subdivided into (from bottom to top) the regional dense, leached, and collapsed (undivided), and cyclic and marine (undivided) members. Hydrostratigraphically, the rocks exposed in the study area represent a section of the upper confining unit to the Edwards aquifer, the Edwards aquifer, the upper zone of the Trinity aquifer, and the middle zone of the Trinity aquifer. The Pecan Gap Formation (Taylor Group), Austin Group, Eagle Ford Group, Buda Limestone, and Del Rio Clay are generally considered to be the upper confining unit to the Edwards aquifer. The Edwards aquifer was subdivided into HSUs I to VIII (Maclay and Small, 1976 The Trinity aquifer is separated into upper, middle, and lower aquifer units (hereafter referred to as \"zones\") (Ashworth, 1983). The upper zone of the Trinity aquifer is in the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The middle zone of the Trinity aquifer is in the lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone, Hensell Sand, and Cow Creek Limestone. The lower zone of the Trinity aquifer consists of the Sligo and Hosston Formations, which do not crop out in the study area. The regionally extensive Hammett Shale forms a confining unit between the middle and lower zones of the Trinity aquifer. The upper zone of the Trinity aquifer is subdivided into five informal HSUs (from top to bottom): cavernous, Camp Bullis, upper evaporite, fossiliferous, and lower evaporite Clark and others, 2009). The middle zone of the Trinity aquifer consists of (from top to bottom) the Bulverde, Little Blanco, Twin Sisters, Doeppenschmidt, Rust, Honey Creek, Hensell, and Cow Creek HSUs (Blome and Clark, 2014;Clark and others, 2016). The underlying Hammett HSU is a regional confining unit between the middle and lower zones of the Trinity aquifer. The lower zone of the Trinity aquifer is not exposed in the study area. Groundwater recharge and flow paths in the study area are influenced not only by the hydrostratigraphic characteristics of the individual HSUs, but also by faults and fractures and geologic structure. Faulting associated with the Balcones fault zone (1) might affect groundwater flow paths by forming a barrier to flow that results in water moving parallel to the fault plane, (2) might affect groundwater flow paths by increasing flow across the fault because of fracturing and juxtaposing porous and permeable units, or (3) might have no effect on groundwater flow paths Small, 1976, 1983). The hydrologic connection between the Edwards and Trinity aquifers and the various HSUs is complex. The complexity of the aquifer system is a combination of the original depositional history, bioturbation, primary and secondary porosity, diagenesis, and fracturing of the area from faulting. All of these factors have resulted in the development or modification of porosity, permeability, and transmissivity within and between the aquifers. Faulting has produced highly fractured areas that have allowed for rapid infiltration of water and subsequent development of solutionally enhanced fractures, bedding planes, channels, and caves that are highly permeable and transmissive. The juxtaposition resulting from faulting also has resulted in areas of interconnectedness between the Edwards and Trinity aquifers and the various HSUs that compose the aquifers."}, {"section_title": "Aromatic-Ring Biodegradation in Soils From a Crude Oil Spill on Clear Creek, Obed Wild and Scenic River National Park, Tennessee", "text": "By Thomas D.

The WSR is located on the Cumberland Plateau, which has a Pennsylvanian-age sandstone cap protecting underlying Mississippian-age limestones from dissolution. However, there are fractures of varying sizes that allow water to percolate through the sandstone cap and recharge the underlying limestone aquifer. Oil and gas production occurs in areas bordering the WSR, and some of these areas are targeted for a significant increase in exploratory drilling. During July 2002, an exploratory drilling operation near the boundary of the WSR encountered a highly pressurized petroleum zone and released an estimated 12,000 barrels of oil in 24 hours. The spilled crude oil flowed down the embankment, and an unknown quantity percolated down into the sandstone cap. After 14 years, oil is still seeping out of the sandstone and into the creek. The objective of this project was to identify contaminated seeps, characterize the microbial community, and measure the rate of natural bioremediation. Several new seeps were identified and located with GPS. Subsurface bacteria from clean and contaminated sites along the creek found Pseudomonads, which are effective at biodegradation. Higher Pseudomonad concentrations were observed in soils with moderate concentrations of oil. Some of the more contaminated soils were dominated by sulfur-reducing bacteria, which are slow at biodegrading petroleum compounds. The more efficient heterotrophic aerobic and iron-reducing bacteria were present, but in smaller proportions. Microcosms were established using 40 cm 3 of sediment collected from contaminated seeps on White Creek. The concentration of aromatic petroleum compounds was measured using a fluorometer. The half-life for aromatic rings in unamended soils was 583 days. Adding peroxide and vitamin B-12 enhanced the rate of biodegradation and reduced the half-life to 163 days.

In northern Arkansas, swine and poultry CAFOs have increased in number in the Buffalo River watershed and neighboring watersheds and could result in increasing nutrient loads to karst groundwater systems underlying the region. In 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a study designed to discover whether increased concentrations of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate from CAFO-derived fertilizer applications would result in increased microbial activity along groundwater flow paths. Additionally, this study hypothesized that increasing heavy metal and antibiotic concentrations in association with increasing labile DOC concentrations could be detrimental to microbial nutrient cycling processes, with the exception of resistant bacteria species. To test both hypotheses, laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize the effect of microbial activity on concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) produced and denitrification activity. The microcosms were subjected to different treatment combinations of acetate, nitrate, phosphate, and heavy metals at varying concentrations plus controls. Field studies were used to evaluate laboratory conditions, and to compare biomass production and composition between samples from laboratory microcosms and field samples. Isotopes of DIC ( 13 C-DIC) and nitrate ( 15 N-NO 3 ), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used to assess microbial response to increasing DOC concentrations. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was used to characterize biomass produced during the experiments. Initial results indicate that DOC was converted to DIC, and NO 3 concentrations decreased in microcosms not treated with heavy metals. Microbial activity in the microcosms was greatest when the concentration of NO 3 was 10 times less than the concentration of DOC. Metals generally inhibited microbial activity at concentrations above 10 micrograms per liter.

The Boulder Zone, which is the permeable zone that receives the injected effluent, is a thick, fractured and cavernous dolomite in the lower part of the Oldsmar Formation, a shallow marine platform carbonate of early Eocene age. A comparatively thinner dolomite unit occurs at the top of the Oldsmar Formation and the Lower Floridan aquifer. The U.S. Geological Survey has reported that this dolomite unit is part of the uppermost major permeable unit of the Lower Florida aquifer. However, because it has been interpreted as a confining unit in at least one consultancy report, controversy surrounds its hydraulic nature in the south Florida hydrogeologic community. As use of the Floridan aquifer system in southeast Florida has increased, geologic and hydrogeologic frameworks have been developed and refined to assist water management decisions. Specific attention has been directed toward the dolomite unit due to its perceived potential to serve as an aquiclude to potential upward migrating Boulder Zone injectate. Cross-formational injectate bypass of this dolomite unit would pose a risk to the Underground Source of Drinking Water (USDW) that lies above in the Upper Floridan aquifer. Recent analyses of geologic, borehole geophysical, and seismicreflection data provide evidence that fracture-and solution-enhanced porosity and permeability are characteristic of the dolomite unit. This may cast doubt on the potential for this dolomite to serve as a confining unit to upward migration of injected effluent. The lithology of the dolomite unit has been consistently documented across southeast Florida in core and cuttings samples as a dense, crystalline dolomite with a characteristic signature in the data acquired by gamma, resistivity, and sonic borehole geophysical logging. The conceptualization that this unit serves as a confining unit is largely based on the results of hydraulic testing on plugs sampled from whole core, which are representative of comparatively smaller scale matrix porosity. However, indications of enhanced permeability are evident on borehole video imaging as secondary porosity associated with bedding plane and irregular touching vugs, and fractures. Borehole temperature log data from wells at a southeast Florida wellfield indicate tortuous stratiform lateral flow through fractures and vuggy megapores contained in the dolomite unit. Few hydraulic tests have been performed that isolate this unit and allow a quantitative hydraulic characterization at the field scale that takes into account the documented pore system. The characteristics of the dolomite unit have been generally interpreted from a borehole-scale perspective. However, new seismic-reflection data enable a more regional and continuous perspective on this interval of the Lower Floridan aquifer that is not possible from individual wells. Seismic-reflection profiles image an upper bounding surface to this unit that is a major regional karst unconformity related to subaerial exposure. This exposure would have allowed for the development of dissolution along bedding planes and creation of irregular vugs and sinkholes. Also, numerous columniform seismic-sag structures are identified on the seismic-reflection profiles, and there are some tectonic faults that might provide vertical pathways for cross-formational fluid flow upward through the dolomite unit. Subaerial karst unconformities at the upper surfaces of carbonate depositional cycles at several hierarchical scales and associated secondary porosity have produced stratiform permeable zones that contribute to much of the dissolution-enhanced permeability within the Floridan aquifer and in many large oil and gas fields around the world."}, {"section_title": "Collapse of the Devonian Prairie Evaporite Karst in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin: Structuration of the Overlying Cretaceous Athabasca Oil Sands and Regional Flow System Reversal by Subglacial Meltwater", "text": "Paul L.

Resulting salt removal patterns included a 1,000 kilometer (km)-long and 150 km-wide trend developed along the eastern margin of the salt basin on-lap with the Canadian Shield, and across the southern Saskatchewan area of the northern Williston Basin. Removal of up to 100 m of salt section in northeastern Alberta and up to 200 m of halite-dominated evaporite beds in southern Saskatchewan resulted in the largest known hypogene halite karst collapse and associated configuration of overlying strata. Multi-stage dissolution events in northeastern Alberta were mostly during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Columbian orogeny, followed by post-orogenic dissolution and collapse trends during deposition of the McMurray Formation (Aptian) strata. In contrast, dissolution stages across the southern Saskatchewan area of the northern Williston Basin occurred throughout the Paleozoic Antler and Mesozoic Laramide orogenic events. The hypogene karst collapses across southern Saskatchewan resulted in 10s to 100s of km-long subsidence troughs controlling depositional trends in the overlying 2 km-thick stratigraphic column. In contrast, northeastern Alberta was an unusual evaporite karst area because of the very low 1:2 thickness ratio of removed halite beds to overlying limestone strata, resulting in dissolution controlled structuration that impacted the distribution of overlying McMurray Formation (Aptian) fluvial-estuarine point bar sand complexes. This Athabasca Oil Sands deposit was emplaced above a 300-km-long segment of the halite dissolution trend that extended along the eastern margin of the Prairie Evaporite salt basin, only 200 m below. These sand reservoirs trapped Laramide oil migrations into the area that were subsequently biodegraded into commercially attractive bituminous sand deposits. During the Pleistocene, the hydraulic head resulting from Laurentide ice sheet loading resulted in pressured subglacial meltwater movement into the subsurface along permeable Devonian strata. The meltwater to the southwest mixed with regional basin aquifer water flows up-structure to the northeast, temporarily reversing the direction of regional flows.

Dissolution stages since the Late Devonian removed up to 200 meters (m) of halitedominated evaporite beds across southern Saskatchewan. At least a 100-150-m interval of salt was removed in northeastern Alberta since the Middle Jurassic. The strata above areas of salt removal in the subsurface of southern Saskatchewan were as much as 1-2 kilometers (km) thick (Broughton, 1977), but only a 200-400-m section in northeastern Alberta. As a result, the northern part of the Athabasca deposit had an unusually low 1:2 thickness ratio of removed salt beds (100 m) with overlying strata (200 m), resulting in 10s of km-long collapse trends in the halite karst with structural controls on the overlying depositional surface unlike anywhere else (Broughton, 2015(Broughton, , 2016. It is generally accepted that the dissolution stages resulted from subsurface water moving upward into the Prairie Evaporite Formation salt beds. There were multiple regional and local postburial water flow systems that variously impacted the salt removal patterns. The hydraulic head resulting from the newly formed Rocky Mountain uplands to the west along with tectonic compression impacted deep basin aquifer water flows to the northeast and controlled regional salt removal patterns within the halitedominated beds of the Prairie Evaporite basin (fig.  1). The drive was enhanced by movement of water from mountainous areas northeastward into areas with lower topographic relief (Garven, 1989). Flows variously mixed with influxes of surfacecharged groundwater. These flows combined with compaction-driven vertical flows of Devonian formation waters mostly from the Keg River Formation moved into the overlying Prairie Evaporite salt beds as responses to sedimentary basin loading. It is uncertain if aquifer flows up-structure to the northeast were largely basin-wide for 10s to 100s of km distances, or as lesser incremental flows that did not flush the entire system. Alternative models suggest that most salt dissolution patterns resulted only from compaction driven vertical water movements within the Devonian strata during sediment loading (Bachu and Underschultz, 1993;Bachu, 1995Bachu, , 1999.

Extensive dissolution stages occurred during the Middle-Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Columbian orogeny in the Alberta foreland basin, continuing as post-orogenic dissolution events during the Aptian accumulation of McMurray Formation strata. In Alberta, the Cordilleran fold and thrust fault belt developed as the deformation front advanced eastward, and northeastern Alberta was uplifted by Middle-Late Jurassic Columbian tectonism, concurrent with the buckling deformation of the craton underlying the foreland.

For example, the Saskatoon Low south of the city is a 40-km-long and 25-km-wide depression with 200 m of closure on the Cretaceous structure (Christiansen, 1967). It resulted from a large salt dissolution collapse that was propagated into the overlying 1,350-m-thick strata.

The Regina Low near the Roncott Platform resulted from a collapse structure with 175 m of closure (Christiansen and Sauer, 2002). Not all salt dissolution events resulted in only collapsesubsidence structures. For example, the Howe Lake site in southeastern Saskatchewan was a salt collapse structure, but extreme pressure built up from invasion by glacial meltwaters, resulted in a blowout crater (Christiansen, 1971;Christiansen and others, 1982)."}, {"section_title": "Subglacial Meltwaters", "text": "Geochemical studies of total dissolved solids (TDS) and stable isotopes such as \u03b4 18 O (H 2 O) in aquifer waters and saline surface seeps indicate that Pleistocene glacial meltwaters mixed with regional aquifer water.

Strongly pressured subglacial meltwaters were driven into the subsurface by the hydraulic head of the 1.5-2-km-thick ice sheet during the Laurentide glacial maximum (about 25-40 thousand years [ka]) and recession (about 8-12 ka) (Dyke and others, 2002). These influxes of glacial meltwaters into the regional aquifer extended along the length of the 1,000-km-long salt dissolution trend following the eastern margin of the Prairie Evaporite basin (fig. 1). The hydraulic head of the glacial meltwater flows was sufficient to reverse the regional aquifer water flows in the subsurface for up to 200-300 km southwest of the WCSB margin. Figure 3.

These subglacial meltwaters flowed down structure to the southwest into the shallow Cretaceous and Devonian aquifers, encountering the regional flow to the northeast in areas such as below the proto-Athabasca River Valley, which dissected the northern Athabasca Oil Sands (fig. 5A) 5B). This near linear trend of elevated salinity values (greater than 25,000 mg/L) coincides with the underlying trend of the Prairie Evaporite salt scarp, only 200 m below. Stable isotopes, mostly \u03b4 18 O (H 2 O), observed in saline spring and brine seeps at the surface along the Athabasca and Clearwater river valleys, which dissected the Athabasca Oil Sands deposit, indicate chemical compositions consistent with waters derived from glacial meltwaters mixed with Devonian aquifer waters, but also incorporating dissolved solids from evaporite beds within the Middle Devonian substrate (Grasby and Chen, 2005;Gue, 2012). Gue and others (2015) measured spring waters with \u03b4 18 O (H 2 O) values as low as -23.5\u2030 (permil). The proportion of glacial meltwater in these spring water samples ranged from 39 percent to as much as 75 percent. The geochemistry, such as isotope ratios and total dissolved solids for these mixed glacial, Devonian aquifer, and dissolved Prairie Evaporite beds, is similar to other geochemical measurements of water salinity in the Devonian substrate, such as below the bitumen mine floors. Broughton (2013) and Cowie (2013) interpreted that karstic collapse features, such as breccia pipe-sinkhole complexes and salt collapserelated faults within the Middle-Upper Devonian and Lower Cretaceous strata, served as vertical pathways for saline water migrations upward into overlying the McMurray beds. The saline waters were eventually discharged as saline seeps and springs at the surface (Gibson and others, 2013). These trends may have been accelerated during glacial loading and unloading (Grasby and Chen, 2005). Karst conduits were more highly developed and effective in the areas overlying the salt scarp and eastward across salt removal areas, providing connectivity between the Devonian aquifer and overlying McMurray hydraulic systems. These areas overlying the salt scarp contrast with areas to the west where the evaporite beds were not extensively impacted by dissolution. Nevertheless, extensive areas of the Middle Devonian salt beds sourced dissolved solids in the formation waters west of the salt scarp, particularly within strata underlying northeast-trending paleovalleys ( fig. 6).

There is a broad range of salinity values in the carbonate strata of the basin, ranging from 20 to more than 300 grams per liter, with similar measurements in water samples collected from the Alberta Basin (figs. 5B and 6). The highest TDS measurements are from groundwater samples collected within the north-central Williston Basin from strata overlying the Prairie Evaporite salt beds ( fig. 6). The TDS values become progressively lower toward the modern day recharge zones in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. Glacial meltwaters that invaded Devonian carbonate aquifers substantially diluted the brines that resulted in high Na/Cl but low Cl/Br ratios ( fig. 7). Brines formed by the dissolution of halite have a substantially different Br/Cl ratio than residual evaporated seawater because during precipitation of halite from seawater bromide is excluded from the crystal structure. This results in a higher Cl/Br mass ratio in halite minerals and subsequently, in dissolution brines compared to seawater. The Cl/Br ratio in halite is generally greater than 3,000, but can be an order of magnitude higher, depending on re-dissolution/ re-precipitation cycles, whereas the Cl/Br ratio of meteoric water is much lower, generally less than 200 (Gue and others, 2015). The Cl/Br ratios in spring waters are generally consistent with halite dissolution sourced Na and Cl ions mixed with lower TDS of formation waters ( fig. 7). This indicates that the brines discharged along the 1,000-km-long dissolution trend paralleling the eastern margin of the evaporite basin, have elevated salinities that resulted from dissolution of evaporite beds, and are mostly sourced from deep basin aquifer waters.

The ice sheet thickness varied from 1.5-2 km across Alberta and Saskatchewan to a 3-km-thick bulge over the present-day Hudson Bay in eastern Canada (Boulton and others, 1995;Margold and others, 2015). Salinity data indicate that a chemical boundary between saline and fresh formation waters extended across southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba areas of the northern Williston Basin. This partition resulted from the influx of meltwaters into bedrock underlying topographic lows for distances up to 300 km, southwestward of the basin edge onlap with the Canadian Shield. This resulted in a geochemical and hydrologic divide between Williston Basin deep aquifer water flows up-structure to the northeast, and southwestward flows down-dip by invading glacial meltwaters (Betcher and others, 1995). Geochemical evidence indicates that this invasion by fresh glacial meltwaters extended into areas characterized by high TDS, greater than 100,000 mg/L. The limits of the southwestward influx by freshwater may be approximated by the 2,000 mg/L boundary (Betcher and others, 1995;Grasby and Betcher, 2000;Grasby and others, 2000). Grasby and others 2000interpreted the hydraulic head of the subglacial meltwaters as dependent upon whether the flow system was dominated by hydrostatic or lithostatic pressure. Free water under lithostatic load at the base of a 1.5-km-thick ice sheet would have pressures equivalent to a 1,400-m-high water column. The ice sheet was probably thicker, perhaps more than 2 km across northern Alberta, but less than the 3-km-high bulge over the present- day Hudson Bay (Dyke and others, 2002;Fisher and others, 2009;Margold and others, 2015). This thickness of a relatively porous ice sheet would have a hydraulic head sufficient to reverse the regional basin flow direction up-structure to the northeast. Provided that the modern regional aquifer water flow system of the WCSB was similar to the pre-Quaternary system, it underwent two flow reversals ( fig. 8). The first resulted from glacial loading, and the second from reassertion of the earlier system following glacial retreat."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Impact of Karst Collapse on Major Hydrocarbon Accumulations: The Athabasca Oil Sands", "text": "Oil migrations into the northern Alberta Basin from Exshaw Formation (Devonian-Mississippian) source rocks to the west were trapped by unconsolidated sand reservoirs of the McMurray Formation (Aptian), and overlying Wabiskaw sands, if present, accumulated as the basal member of the Clearwater Formation (Albian). Oil accumulations in these multikilometer-long sand reservoirs subsequently biodegraded into bituminous sand deposits (Head and others, 2003). The 45,000-km\u00b2 Athabasca Oil Sand deposit consists of bituminous sand accumulations up to 100 m thick, resulting in a 200 billion cubic meter or a trillion barrel hydrocarbon resource ( fig. 5A).

A, Strongly pressured subglacial meltwaters driven into the subsurface by the hydraulic head of a 1.5-2-km-thick Laurentide ice sheet.

B, Holocene meteorically charged groundwater flows near river valleys in Cretaceous strata overlying the bitumen aquiclude were often counter to the regional aquifer water flows in Devonian strata below the aquiclude. Modified from Barson and others (2001). The unusual geological aspect of the Athabasca Oil Sands is that the northern one-third of the deposit overlies a portion of the largest known halite-dominated evaporite karst collapse. Removal of 100-150 m of salt beds collapsed the overlying 175-250-m interval of Middle-Upper Devonian strata, resulting in a significant structural control on the fluvial-estuarine McMurray Formation sand depositional trend. This hypogene salt karst collapse resulted in mosaics of differentially subsided Devonian fault blocks above the salt removal areas (Broughton, 2013(Broughton, , 2015. Dissolution patterns developed in the Prairie Evaporite strata, concurrent with overlying McMurray deposition, resulting in 10s of km-long syndepositional sand trends. The dissolution fronts advanced along northwest-and northeast-oriented fracture-fault lineaments that dissected the salt beds, and subsequently coalesced into larger salt removal areas. These overarching structural trends configured the overlying Devonian karst topography. A lattice-like organization by the lower McMurray braided river network resulted from draping onto the differentially subsided fault block pattern and resulting in a reticulated karstic Devonian topography. This resulted in 1-3-kmlong reservoirs of pebble gravel and sand channel fills oriented to the northwest and to the northeast. The 50-km-long V-shaped Bitumount Trough, the largest of the salt collapse structures, filled with these lower McMurray channel sand deposits that paralleled salt dissolution patterns in the Middle Devonian substrate. The northern margin of the Bitumount Trough collapsed during lower McMurray deposition, as a result of extensive dissolution along a lineament that cross-cut the underlying salt scarp. This trough, as much as 100 m deep, extended along the northern margin of the Bitumount Trough and was floored by a 20-km-long linear chain of Devonian fault blocks. The resulting accommodation space filled as a syndepositional sand trend, 40-60 m thick, and was subsequently bitumen saturated (Broughton, 2013(Broughton, , 2015. The Horizon, Muskeg River, and Aurora North mines are located along this trend. During the middle McMurray interval, salt dissolution fronts directed along cross-cutting lineaments migrated north of the Bitumount Trough. These advances resulted in salt removal patterns across the Central Collapse structure. Together, the Bitumount Trough and Central Collapse configured the northern Athabasca deposit as a lower estuary structural funnel. Incremental advances by the dissolution fronts underlying the Central Collapse area resulted in northeast-aligned terraces consisting of Upper Devonian-lower McMurray fault blocks that stepped down northward into the Central Collapse. Sand and fines were transported to the north along the relatively unstable Devonian substrate that floored the structural funnel. The sinuous river channel belts to the south were constrained along the more stable substrate below the main paleovalley ( fig. 5A). The main fairway branched onto the structural funnel as multiple, 10-30-km-long, sub-parallel fluvialmarine channel fairways. These aligned along the northwest-oriented structural grain imparted by salt dissolution trends only 200 m below. This resulted in the collinear alignments of 1-5-km-long stacked point bar complexes along these fluvial-marine fairways as they cascaded over the step-down terraces. This architecture permitted collinear alignments of detached aggradation sites, each consisting of overlying point bar complexes. The middle interval sand bar complexes, typically 2-5 km long and 20-40 m thick, resulted in giant scale reservoirs. Subsequent in-situ biodegradation during the early Paleogene resulted in giant commercially attractive sand complexes, each extending across 10s of km\u00b2.

Deep basin aquifer water, recharged along Rocky Mountain terrain uplands, flowed upstructure to the northeast, resulting in a 1,000-kmlong and 150-km-wide dissolution trend along the eastern margin of the Prairie Evaporite salt basin. Concurrent aquifer water recharged in the Montana Uplift flowed up-structure into the northern Williston Basin, resulting in extensive salt removal areas across southern Saskatchewan. These flows mixed with compaction driven vertical flows from the Keg River and other Devonian strata into the overlying Prairie Evaporite salt beds. The flows were directed to the northwest and to the northeast along crosscutting sets of fracture-fault lineaments, which were propagated upward from Precambrian blocks responding to orogenic deformation of the underlying basement rocks. Removal of 100-150 m of salt in northeastern Alberta and up to 200 m across southern Saskatchewan resulted in the largest known hypogene halite karst collapse. The salt karst collapse structures in northeastern Alberta extensively impacted depositional trends in the overlying strata accumulated as the Athabasca Oil Sands. During the Pleistocene, the hydraulic head of a 1.5-2-km-thick ice sheet resulted in subglacial meltwater influxes into the Devonian strata along the 1,000-km-long dissolution trend previously established along the eastern margin of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. These meltwaters were sufficiently pressured to temporarily reverse the basin water flows upstructure to the northeast until reasserted upon ice sheet withdrawal. The influx of fresh meltwaters came in contact with shallowly buried Middle Devonian salt beds, rejuvenating older collapse structure across southern Saskatchewan. Glacial meltwater flows into the subsurface and along lineaments within the salt beds resulted in aligned sinkholes on the subglacial topography in northeastern Alberta.

An approximately 500-meter (m)-thick section of Pennsylvanian, Mississippian, and Ordovician sandstone, shale, limestone, and dolomite is exposed within the Buffalo River valley (fig. 2). Abundant karst features and associated hydrologic systems are developed within Mississippian and Ordovician carbonate sequences (Hudson and others, 2011). Cherty limestone of the Lower to Middle Mississippian Boone Formation is the predominant host of karst features in the area and corresponds to the regional Springfield Plateau karst aquifer (Adamski and others, 1995). Sinkholes are common at the top of the Boone Formation where it is overlain by Batesville Sandstone, and springs are concentrated at the base of the Boone Formation within its basal chert-free St. Joe Limestone Member (Hudson and others, 2011). A lower karst aquifer, representing the upper part of the regional Ozark aquifer (Adamski and others, 1995), is recognized where erosion of structural highs has exposed lower parts of the Ordovician Everton Formation. The Everton Formation (Suhm, 1974) consists of predominantly sandy dolomite, but in western parts of the watershed also includes the 30-mthick Newton Sandstone Member and an underlying thin limestone interval that commonly hosts springs. A series of Pleistocene to Holocene tufa deposits consisting of high-porosity, finegrained calcite were deposited from near-surface discharge of springs and seeps, often sourced from solution conduits developed in Mississippian and Ordovician strata. Radiogenic isotopes of strontium (Sr) and uranium (U) can permit geochemical discrimination of different source waters (Roback and others, 2001;Paces and others, 2002;Frost and Toner, 2004;N\u00e9grel and others, 2004;Durand and others, 2005;Ryu and others, 2009;Paces and Wurster, 2014) as well as provide age estimates for tufa deposits determined by U-series methods (Richards and Dorale, 2003;Bourdon, 2015).

In the western part of the study area, a sample of ice associated with seepage from the lower part of the Everton Formation just below the Newton Sandstone Member was collected near the base of Big Bluff, whereas water from a spring discharging from the lower part of the Everton Formation just above its contact with the Powell Dolomite was collected about 1.5 km farther upstream."}, {"section_title": "Tufa Deposits", "text": "Tufa deposits were sampled in the western part of the Buffalo River watershed ( fig. 1) where they are localized in either the basal St. Joe Limestone Member of the Boone Formation or the spring horizon in the lower part of the Everton Formation (table 2). Deposits typically form conical mounds associated with vadose seepage discharging in areas protected by cliff overhangs (fig. 3). Due to the location within the Buffalo National River Park, sparse sampling of one to three small pieces of tufa was conducted from unobtrusive lower or back parts of each deposit. Although innermost portions that potentially represent the oldest material present in the mounds were preferred, sampling was biased toward younger material to not destroy these features. At Big Bluff, a series of five tufa deposits that lie at heights of 113 to 118 m above the Buffalo River were sampled along a 270-m-long traverse along a foot path named the Goat Trail. All tufa deposits are preserved in overhanging space of a cliff notch (fig. 3A) developed where the St. Joe Limestone Member of the Boone Formation overlies upper sandstone beds of the Everton Formation. Local draping of the tufa deposits across overhanging contacts with bedrock limestone demonstrates that these cliff-face notches predate the tufa deposition. At Jim Bluff, a tufa deposit emerges from and drapes across the St. Joe Limestone Member ( fig. 3C), like at Big Bluff.

At Steel Creek this discharge horizon is about 10 m above the Buffalo River from which the tufa deposit extends downward to where it was directly sampled about 2 m above the river. At Big Bluff, the tufa forms from a discharge horizon that lies about 30 m above the river beneath an overhanging cliff of the Newton Sandstone Member.

Water sourced from the Everton Formation and tufas derived therefrom have a wide range of measured (for water) or initial (for tufa) 234 U/ 238 U AR reaching values as high as 5 (for both water and tufa samples from Big Bluff). In contrast, tufa deposits sourced from the Mississippian St. Joe Limestone Member have a restricted range of initial 234 U/ 238 U AR from 1.1 to 1.3 with the exception of subsamples from the Jim Bluff tufa mound with values as high as 3.2. Because the St. Joe Limestone Member at Jim Bluff is downfaulted against the lower part of the Everton Formation (Hudson and Murray, 2003), it is likely that some groundwater from the adjacent lower part of the Everton Formation crossed the fault into the Boone Formation and provided a water source with elevated 234 U/ 238 U AR. A subsample from the same Jim Bluff mound does not have an elevated 234 U/ 238 U ratio, however, demonstrating that any such inter-aquifer groundwater mixing was heterogeneous. To obtain higher 234 U/ 238 U AR, 234 U must be preferentially enriched relative to 238 U by various processes related to recoil from alpha decay (Porcelli, 2008;Porcelli, 2015). In terms of hydrologic properties, 234 U enrichment is typically related to porosity, travel time, water/rock ratios, and chemical aggressiveness. Smaller water/rock ratios along a given flow path will favor higher 234 U/ 238 U AR, especially if bulk dissolution of aquifer rock is limited. Likewise, groundwaters traversing longer flow paths are likely to have higher 234 U/ 238 U values than those of more local extent. Therefore, elevated 234 U/ 238 U AR in large volume springs are consistent with integration of flow and long residence time in the regional Ozark aquifer relative to shorter, more localized flow in the \"flashy\" Mississippian Springfield Plateau karst aquifer. Preferential incorporation of 234 U relative to 238 U in vadose seeps discharging from the stratigraphically lower Everton Formation may also be enhanced in that those pathways have been exposed to flow for shorter time intervals due to more recent exposure by base-level lowering as compared to seeps higher up in the Boone Formation.  fig. 4), or values expected for Paleozoic sea water during those periods (0.7076-0.7087;McArthur and others, 2012). The cause of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variation of the water and tufa samples in the Buffalo River area is speculative, but we note that Mississippian-hosted samples with high ratios are mostly from western locations where surface waters probably flowed across upper Mississippian and Pennsylvanian shales before infiltrating the Boone Formation. Those shales are likely to have much higher rubidium/ strontium values than in the carbonate rocks, leading to elevated 87 Sr abundances in runoff and infiltration through those soils and bedrock units. The different ranges for U and Sr isotopic compositions determined in this study add to other contrasts between groundwater sourced from Mississippian and Ordovician aquifers, including differences in major-ion chemistry (Galloway, 2004). The physical characteristics of springs from these aquifers also differ as unconfined springs with flashy discharge are typical for the Boone Formation, whereas partly confined springs with more steady flow are typical for the Everton Formation (Hudson and others, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "U-series Ages from Tufa", "text": "U-series ages were determined from subsamples from 11 different tufa deposits at 6 different locations (table 2) and 5), and reflect deposition from focused discharge along a perched horizon in the Springfield Plateau aquifer.

The 151-169 ka time interval falls within the prominent full glacial epoch of marine isotope stage 6 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) during which precipitation and associated tufa deposition may have been enhanced. If paleoclimate did influence tufa deposition, older, dryer periods of exposure of the cliff face at Big Bluff may not have resulted in tufa deposition. For the tufa samples from tributary locations, those taken from loose blocks derived from discharge from the lower part of the Everton Formation at Hemmed-In Hollow (fig. 3D) have a 0.5-4.1 ka range of ages that is similar to that of the other lower Everton Formation-sourced tufa deposits more closely associated with the Buffalo River. In comparison, the tufa deposit hosted by the St. Joe Limestone Member at Lost Valley yielded imprecise ages of 24.9 \u00b1 76 ka and 20.3 \u00b1 25 ka that are relatively old given that the deposit presently lies about 1.3 m above the bed of Clark Creek (fig. 3E). This tufa deposit is located at the base of a prominent joint enlarged by dissolution that extends at least 5 m into the overlying St. Joe Limestone Member, indicating that it could have initially formed several meters below the landsurface elevation due to sinking karst waters. It is unclear how deep deposits with high-porosity, fine-grained tufa texture could form, but we note that cave deposits in the area (Paces and others, 2017) typically contain only coarse crystalline calcite speleothems. The oldest tufa deposits at Big Bluff lying high above the Buffalo River provide an upper limit on valley incision rate at this location. The contact of the St. Joe Limestone Member above less permeable sandstone of the upper Everton Formation is well documented as a major modern spring horizon at the base of the Springfield Plateau aquifer throughout the western part of the Buffalo River valley (Mott and others, 2000;Turner and others, 2007;Hudson and others, 2011). The oldest dated tufa deposits at Big Bluff are preserved high above the modern valley bottom, which is consistent with deposition from spring discharge that began when valley incision first exposed the base of the St. Joe Limestone Member. Discharge at this horizon continued for as long as 150 ka afterward at one tufa deposit as valley incision continued to exhume the underlying Everton Formation and uppermost Powell Dolomite. Using a 157 \u00b1 10 ka for the average age of the three oldest tufa deposits and a mean height of 116 m above the river yields an incision rate at Big Bluff of 0.74 millimeter per year (mm/yr) ( fig. 5). However, because this 157 ka average age might be biased toward a period of enhanced precipitation during marine isotope stage 6, this age is probably a minimum for when the base of the St. Joe Limestone Member was exposed at Big Bluff. Thus, the 0.74 mm/yr incision rate should be considered an upper limit. For comparison, at Boxley Valley (upstream of fig. 1) where the Buffalo River flows over the Boone Formation (Hudson and Turner, 2007), Covington and others (2015) calculated a dissolution rate for pure limestone of 1.05 mm/yr based on the CO 2 undersaturation of river samples collected over a wide discharge range. Other research is ongoing to date cave and river terrace deposits elsewhere in the Buffalo River valley to add additional constraints on incision rate, so the 0.74 mm/yr upper limit at Big Bluff can be compared to any future estimates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Radiogenic isotopes were measured for a set of water and tufa surface samples from karstic aquifers within Mississippian and Ordovician carbonate units located in the Buffalo River region in northern Arkansas.

The cave is currently being studied to help understand its development and how this links to landscape evolution of the Buffalo River karst watershed within the Ozark Plateaus physiographic province. Accumulations of coarse clastic sediments in passages above the level of a modern cave stream reflect deposition when base levels were higher in the past, and can thus be used to help constrain longer-term incision rates if the ages of those deposits are known. Ongoing dating studies combining cosmogenic nuclides, optically stimulated luminescence, paleomagnetism, and U-series disequilibrium dating will help elucidate the history of cave formation and evolution, which can then be compared to other records of watershed incision (Keen-Zebert and others, 2016). Clastic sediments in Fitton Cave are often capped by calcite flowstone or gypsum evaporative crusts; intercalated flowstone is uncommon. Flowstones provide minimum age constraints for deposition of underlying sediment, which in turn, provide minimum ages for initial formation of cave passages. Other forms of vadose speleothems are present in Fitton Cave (stalactites, stalagmites, helictites); however, deposits suggesting extended periods of phreatic conditions are absent. Besides providing 230 Th/U ages to constrain cave formation, strontium (Sr) and initial uranium (U) isotopic compositions from speleothems represent records of vadose water chemistry that provide insight into flow paths, processes, and histories within the cave. Oxygen (O) and carbon (C) stable isotope compositions from speleothems can also provide records that can be used to evaluate changes in regional climate conditions associated with the past glacial/interglacial cycles. This paper presents work on Fitton Cave speleothems collected in 2014 and 2015. We analyzed the speleothems for uranium-thorium (U-Th) isotopic compositions to establish 230 Th/U ages and initial 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios as well as Sr isotopes ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) to evaluate compositional variability in space and time. Besides flowstones, several broken stalagmites were analyzed to evaluate how chemical and environmental conditions may have varied over time at single drip sites.

The region is underlain by a series of relatively flat-lying Ordovician, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks. The broadly uplifted strata form several regional-scale plateaus in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas that are variously dissected by fluvial systems. Fitton Cave is developed in the Boone Formation, a Lower to Middle Mississippian platform carbonate consisting of cherty limestone up to about 120 meters (m) thick. Near the cave, Boone Formation limestone is directly overlain by Upper Mississippian Batesville Sandstone (about 10 m thick) and Fayetteville Shale (about 90 m thick). Upper Mississippian and Pennsylvanian clastic rocks in the region act as hydrologic confining units (Adamski and others, 1995). When removed by erosion, the underlying carbonate units become more exposed to dissolution by surface water, infiltration, and groundwater flow, resulting in karst features including cavernous porosity, sinkholes, sinking streams, and springs (Hudson and others, 2011). Dye-tracer tests indicate that groundwater can be transported through the Boone Formation at rates of several hundreds of meters per day (Mott and others, 2000).

Elevations of the overlying land surface were determined to estimate overburden thickness, which varies from 34 to 107 m and includes the Boone Formation, Batesville Sandstone, and Fayetteville Shale. Deposits of flowstone vary in thickness from several millimeters up to about 10 cm and consist of sparry calcite containing variable amounts of fine sediment. In one case (the T Room), gypsum constitutes the dominant phase, forming a 1-to 4-cm-thick crust capping sediments. In some areas, calcite deposits are corroded indicating partial dissolution at some time since their formation. No samples came from sites with active water flow or modern calcite precipitation. Stalagmites were collected as broken fragments and could not be related to their original growth positions. Specimens are about 20 to 40 cm long and about 12 cm in diameter.

Only 4 of the 77 subsamples have 230 Th/ 238 U AR that are unsupported by U present in the sample, indicating that post-depositional U mobility is not a common problem. Flowstones intercalated with sediments at Site 1 (FC1) and capping sediments at Double Drop Pit Passage (FC6, FC7, and FC8) consistently yield 230 Th/U ages between 415 and 690 ka, whereas younger ages were obtained for flowstone from Labyrinth south (FC5; 137\u00b118 ka to 306\u00b191 ka) and Missile Silo room (FC9; 159\u00b121 ka to 304\u00b162 ka).

Subsample ages generally are concordant with internal stratigraphy considering analytical uncertainties, although several apparent age reversals are present. Outermost surfaces show evidence of weathering and yield anomalously old ages or excess 230 Th, indicating post-depositional U loss (BNR-FC3A-u1 and BNR-FC3B-u1). Internal surfaces with anomalously old ages correspond to textural discontinuities that may reflect similar weathering periods . Growth rates range from 1.4 to 40 mm/ka and appear linear for tens of thousands of years before changing abruptly. Inflections are commonly associated with textural discontinuities ( fig. 3). "}, {"section_title": "Compositions of Speleothems", "text": "In addition to obtaining ages from U-Th isotope analysis, values for the U isotopic composition at the time of mineral formation can be calculated (initial 234 U/ 238 U AR). Because very little U isotope fractionation takes place during calcite precipitation from aqueous solutions, initial 234 U/ 238 U AR values are equivalent to the values present in vadose water at the time the mineral formed. The same is true for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions. Therefore, these isotopes are useful as natural tracers of water sources and how they vary both spatially and temporally. Fitton Cave speleothems have a wide range of initial 234 U/ 238 U AR and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions ( fig. 4). Results for individual sites tend to cluster relative to the entire range; however, differences are also observed between multiple samples from the same site, as well as for different layers in a single stalagmite. Several specimens have initial 234 U/ 238 U AR less than 1.0 (FC2, FC3, FC4, FC10), which is uncommon for near-surface water sources that typically have 234 U/ 238 U AR greater than 1.0. Most Fitton Cave speleothems have initial 234 U/ 238 U AR in the range of 1.07 to 2.0. All speleothems are enriched in radiogenic Sr (higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value) relative to values in the host limestone (median of 0.70850 for nine measurements). Therefore, vadose source water interacted with soil or bedrock having elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values prior to reaching deposition sites. Younger clastic rocks overlying the Boone Formation likely have higher rubidium/strontium values than host limestones, resulting in more radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in infiltrating water. Values of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and initial 234 U/ 238 U AR observed in Fitton Cave speleothems are generally correlated ( fig. 4). Because samples are widely dispersed within the cave, variations cannot be related to processes acting along any single vadose flow path. Samples from several sites have compositions that are consistent with values measured in vadose water as well as surface water or karst spring discharge ( fig. 4). Variations are not clearly related to overburden thickness or the geologic units hosting overlying vadose pathways. A set of subsamples from stalagmites FC3A and FC3B were analyzed for O and C stable isotopes (data accessible in file \"BNR_FittonCave_C-O_data.csv\" at doi:10.5066/F7DZ06H6). Subsamples distributed at fine spatial resolution on either side of a distinct textural discontinuity representing a growth hiatus in FC3A ( fig. 3) have \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C compositions ranging from -2.3 to -6.1 and 0.4 to -5.7 \u2030, respectively. Overall, the two isotopes are poorly correlated, indicating that kinetic isotope fractionation within the cave environment is unlikely to fully explain the pattern of variability. However, compositions of calcite above and below the textural discontinuity show distinct differences ( fig. 5), reflecting different compositions of infiltrating water likely related to climate-driven changes in moisture sources and plant communities at different time periods.

However, the younger 230 Th/U ages are not an artifact of postdepositional open-system isotopic behavior. Older dates have remarkably consistent U-series systematics considering that a number of speleothems show textural evidence of corrosion, and that ages close to the dating limit are particularly sensitive to U loss but show none. Therefore, younger 230 Th/U ages for flowstones are interpreted as real periods of time that postdate active streamflow capable of carrying coarse sediment far underground. The general absence of interbedded flowstone in coarse sediment sequences indicates that early, more-energetic stages of speleogenesis were not interrupted by periods of quiescence until base levels fell sufficiently to lower streamflow and allow flowstone caps to form on stabilized surfaces. Thus, flowstone ages are consistent with the older sediment burial ages that more closely reflect periods of passage formation, but may actually provide further constraints on periods of base level lowering related to regional incision."}, {"section_title": "Paleohydrologic Flow", "text": "Isotopic compositions of Sr and U are not affected substantially by many near-surface physical, chemical, or biological processes, allowing them to reflect values present in the water from which they precipitated (Ludwig and others, 1992;Paces and Wurster, 2014). Samples of vadose water, surface water, and karst spring sources associated with Fitton Cave have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and 234 U/ 238 U AR similar to those in speleothems ( fig. 4). Cecil Creek and associated groundwater discharge have elevated values similar to speleothems collected from Labyrinth south (FC5) and Double Drop Pit Passage (FC6, FC7). Drip water from Fitton Cave, sampled near the Missile Silo, and a vadose seep discharging from the base of the St. Joe Limestone along the Goat Trail at Big Bluff, about 9 kilometers to the west, have lower values in the range of those observed in speleothems from Site 1 (FC1, FC2) and Missile Silo (FC9, FC10, FC11), although variability in speleothems is large. Vadose water required to explain compositions of speleothems from Organ Pipe (FC3) and the T Room (FC4), which have the lowest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and initial 234 U/ 238 U AR less than 1.0, have not been sampled. The latter feature, though unusual, is not unique (Zhou and others, 2005). Water with 234 U/ 238 U AR less than 1.0 is presumed to have been the source for stalagmites and flowstone at these sites. Water depleted in 234 U relative to 238 U may be derived by dissolution of previously 234 U-leached bedrock (Osmond and Cowart, 2000), or by kinetics that inhibit the valence change of U (IV) to U(VI) after alpha decay from the intermediate daughter 234 Th (Zhou and others, 2005). In either case, greater dissolution of the host limestone along these flow paths (or less dissolution in overlying clastic units) is likely required to explain the low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values observed in these same materials. Water compositions responsible for speleothems in Fitton Cave varied widely and likely reflect water/rock interactions at different spatial scales. Clustering of data observed for materials from different sites as well as the general positive correlation between 234 U/ 238 U and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values imply that flow processes are not random but related to kinetic and compositional factors operating along a set of flow paths. These isotope data will ultimately provide important information to help understand those vadose zone hydrologic processes."}, {"section_title": "Past Environmental Conditions", "text": "The O and C stable isotope records preserved in speleothems have been widely used to evaluate histories of atmospheric flow patterns and temperatures (\u03b4 18 O) or changing plant communities (\u03b4 13 C) in continental settings (Winograd and others, 1992;Richards and Dorale, 2003;Fairchild and others, 2006). Many of those studies focus on late Pleistocene records when age uncertainties and temporal resolutions are optimal. Less is known about older, middle Pleistocene records like those available from the Fitton Cave stalagmites. Initial investigations of parts of specimen FC3A show systematic variations of both \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C that are likely related to changing surface conditions that occurred during the marine isotope stages (MIS) 8/7 glacial-interglacial transition ( fig. 6). Profiles are disrupted by a growth hiatus (about 245 to 257 ka) during MIS 8 full glacial conditions, but otherwise show clearly differing trends on either side of the discontinuity. Although substantial overlap is present, calcite deposited during MIS 7 tends to have higher \u03b4 13 C values for a given \u03b4 18 O value compared to that deposited during MIS 8, indicating a significant change in the surface environment. The MIS 8 calcite records a steep increase in \u03b4 13 C prior to the hiatus, which may be related to a shift toward reduced plant cover, or a change toward a prairie plant community during peak glacial conditions, similar to that noted in other speleothems from the region (Dorale and others, 1998). MIS 7 calcite trends sharply toward lower \u03b4 18 O values, and speleothem growth rate increases following the hiatus, possibly due to enhanced moisture availability coincident with deglaciation. Although these results are encouraging, data at similar spatial resolutions over the rest of this and other stalagmite records are needed to better interpret the significance of these variations. Ultimately, they should provide a history that can be compared to other detailed records to more clearly understand differences in the timing and degree of changes in the mid-continent region that can be related to their position with respect to the extent of the Laurentide ice sheet. Isotopes of Sr and U also can provide information on how the vadose hydrologic system responded to changing environmental conditions through time. Both initial 234 U/ 238 U AR and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values show differences in calcite deposited before and after the textural discontinuity in specimen FC3A. Assuming that the flow path to the drip site feeding this stalagmite remained fixed, the compositional shift is likely caused by differences in solubility related to water chemistry or water/rock volumes with time. Differences in composition between the two stalagmites may be more related to different flow paths feeding BNR-FC3A and FC3B, but where the record overlaps (BNR-FC3A-u9 and BNR-FC3B-u3), initial 234 U/ 238 U AR were identical, although 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values were not.

Regional aquifer system analysis (RASA) modeling conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the 1980s and 1990s required combining (lumping) multiple carbonate aquifers into single hydrogeologic units, an oversimplification that has proven adequate for regional generalizations at scales of 10 kilometers and greater, but one that is misleading and oftentimes inappropriate at site-specific scales and in locally predictive hydrogeologic studies at scales of meters to hundreds of meters. Unfortunately, the conceptualization and utilization of regional hydrostratigraphic nomenclature has been widely accepted by many in the consulting industry, and coincidently, within the NAWQA program. Although the methodologies, purposes, and scopes of these regional studies have been clearly defined in USGS reports, the overall trend of generalization has taken a firm hold on the karst community. Accurately elucidating the speleogenesis of these karst aquifers, including their hydrogeologic attributes, hydraulic properties, tectonic settings, and sedimentologic histories is an essential component of resolving these scale-dependent problems, as case studies from (1) the Boone Formation in northern Arkansas, and (2) the Potosi Formation in southern Missouri, will show. Although the following explanation of speleogenesis in the Ozarks has a modicum of speculation, the problems it addresses are real. The Boone and Potosi Formations encompass the full range of karst aquifers in this region of middle America, and highlight problems that lumping typically introduces at scales smaller than hundreds of meters, where most contamination problems occur. The Boone Formation, lumped as the Springfield Plateau aquifer, was part of the Ozark Plateaus aquifer system by . The middle 70 meters of the Boone, with as many as 60 intervals of alternating thin limestone and chert couplets, represent a low-yield zone of very thin (from 5 to 50 centimeters) karst aquifers. Although this interval is only one part of a single regional hydrogeologically lumped unit, each of the limestone layers has the potential to be karstified, with variable attributes and boundaries. Above and below the chertrich layers of the Boone are relatively pure limestones with completely different karst attributes, including greater spring yields, hydraulic conductivity, storage, and flow velocities, and completely different geomorphological characteristics. The continuity of the chert units, which act as confining units when indurated, decreases from south to north, resulting in an areal variability in hydrogeologic characteristics across the region. The source of much of this variability is hypothesized to be due to slight differences in karstification and sedimentation. The sedimentation appears to be related to distance from island arcs that provided air-fall ash that was spread across a shallow carbonate platform. The island arcs were above the subducting plate south of the Ouachita Mountains and resulted from the continent-to-continent Ouachita collision. Tectonic closure also resulted in a foreland bulge that produced slight uplift (200 meters), fracturing, and tilting in northern Arkansas. The chert interbedded with limestone confined groundwater flow, and systematic jointing and faulting limited groundwater basin size. In Missouri, farther from the ash source and foreland bulge, chert nodules formed in place of continuous thin chert confining layers, and the Boone aquifers produced higher yielding springs that drew recharge from larger areas and stratigraphic intervals. The Potosi Formation, on the other hand, is the dominant high-yielding groundwater source in the Ozark aquifer, which is made up of 14 individual geologic formations . Three of the ten largest springs in the conterminous United States are attributed to the Potosi Formation, as are most of the public water-supply wells in southern Missouri. The karstification of the Potosi Formation appears to have been impacted most by an early-formed paleokarst, by geochemical alteration of limestone to dolomite, by tectonic reactivation of basement faults, and by tectonic expulsion of thermally heated hypogenic flow from the Arkoma Basin to the south. This latter stage of warm water served to precipitate drusy quartz into many of the voids in the dolomitic aquifer, thereby reducing its overall permeability and porosity. Whereas the Springfield Plateau aquifer includes many karstified thin zones separated by impermeable chert layers that impact site-specific contamination, the Ozark aquifer combines and mixes flow from a stratigraphic interval of 14 aquifers, with only minor confining units in a more than 500-meter-thick stratigraphic section. Aquifer attributes extrapolated from these projects that require lumping should be approached carefully and always with an intensive field data-collection program to verify that key karst components at an appropriate scale are included.

This vast system extends throughout southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and eastern parts of Oklahoma and Kansas. The Ozark Plateaus aquifer system consists of four major geohydrologic units which, in ascending order, include the (1) basement confining unit, (2) St. Francois aquifer, (3) St. Francois confining unit, and (4) Ozark aquifer. The basement confining unit comprises the Mesoproterozoic volcanic and plutonic basement rocks of the St. Francois terrane and Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks (Imes, 1989). The St. Francois aquifer comprises Upper Cambrian strata that disconformably overlie the basement confining unit and conformably underlie the St. Francois confining unit (Imes, 1990a). In the ONSR area, the St. Francois aquifer consists of the Lamotte Sandstone and the Bonneterre Formation ( fig. 3).  Geological Survey, 1997. Irregular darker area with gray dashed outline delineates a 1:24,000-scale geologic map compilation covering the ONSR (Weary and others, 2016). The entire map area falls within the boundaries of 1:100,000-scale regional mapping (Weary and others, 2014). Proterozoic igneous rocks are locally exposed adjacent to overlying units upsection into the Gasconade Dolomite. The Elvins Group, which occurs only in the subsurface in the ONSR area, consists of the Davis Shale and overlying Derby-Doerun Dolomite. Bounding the top of the St. Francois aquifer is the St. Francois confining unit, which consists of the Cambrian Elvins Group, the Davis Formation, and the overlying Derby-Doerun Dolomite (usage of Missouri Geological Survey, 1979). These stratigraphic units contain beds of shale, shaley mudstone, and thinly bedded, dense, fine-grained dolomite, which analyses have shown are nonporous (primary porosity) and very impermeable Seeger, 2000, 2001). No studies have been undertaken to evaluate the secondary porosity, potentially the result of faults and jointing, of these rocks. From the top of the St. Francois confining unit to the topographic surface is the Ozark aquifer (Imes, 1990a), which in the study area, comprises in ascending order, the Potosi, Eminence, and Gasconade Dolomites, the Roubidoux Formation, and the Jefferson City Dolomite. The near-surface parts of the Ozark aquifer are generally unconfined and serve as the principal domestic water sources for most of southeastern Missouri, except in the St. Francois Mountains, where near-surface stratigraphic units of the St. Francois aquifer are commonly tapped. All of the springs in the ONSR area discharge from the Ozark aquifer."}, {"section_title": "Geologic Context for the Large Springs of the ONSR", "text": "The southern Ozarks are a landscape that has been exposed to surface erosion and development of subterranean drainage systems since the late Paleozoic. Over that time, the development of solution conduits and flow paths has been affected by the physical and chemical properties of the bedrock. These effects are recognizable in the observed spatial and stratigraphic relations among the rocks, caves, groundwater conduits, and springs in the ONSR and surrounding area."}, {"section_title": "Development of Enhanced Permeability in the Ozark Aquifer", "text": "Most of the lower Paleozoic rocks underlying the ONSR region were originally deposited as limestone under peritidal conditions in a shallow tropical inland sea. Deposition of marine sediments in the area probably occurred sporadically into the Early Pennsylvanian Period. Beginning in the Pennsylvanian and continuing to the present, the rocks of the Ozark Plateaus have been subject to subaerial weathering and erosion as well as diagenetic and hypogenic processes in the subsurface. Much of the alteration of the primary limestones to dolomite in the study area occurred during northward migration of hot brines from the Ouachita Mountains to the south (Leach, 1994). There was likely a cycle of transverse, hypogenic speleogensis associated with this fluid migration, and the horizontal permeability of these rocks was enhanced by mineralogic changes facilitating later development of solution conduits (Klimchouk, 2007). Kaufman and Crews (2013) have indicated that there is an increase in porosity and horizontal permeability that is stratigraphically concentrated near the tops of shallowing upward carbonate depositional sequences in the Ozarks due to a combination of stromatolitic fabrics, early diagenetic effects, and episodes of silicification and dolomitization. Faulting and jointing associated with the late Paleozoic ancestral Rocky Mountain-Ouachita-Alleghenian orogenies enhanced secondary vertical porosity (see Cox (2009) and Hudson (2000) for analyses of late Paleozoic faulting in the Ozark region)."}, {"section_title": "The Large Scale Structural Setting and Aquifer Geometry Are Conducive to Formation of Long Flow Paths and Large Integrated Systems", "text": "Strata in the Salem Plateau are relatively flat-lying, with a very gentle dip toward the east and southeast with beds typically dipping less than 1 degree. For example, except for a relatively short stretch where the Current River flows over a structural high exposing the Potosi Dolomite and protruding Proterozoic rhyolites ( fig. 2), the river flows down the regional dip surface with the channel of the river remaining in about the same stratigraphic position in the Eminence Dolomite. This reach, almost the entire distance of the length of the ONSR, is about 85 mi in a straight line from just below the headwaters at Montauk Springs toward the southeast to a point just downstream of Big Spring. The elevation loss for the top of the Eminence Dolomite between these points is about 440 feet (ft), indicating an average gradient of both the river and the strata of just over 5 ft per mile. This gentle incline, imposed on the sequence of laterally continuous strata, provides space for development of long stratabound flow paths from recharge areas to groundwater outlets at the springs ( fig. 4). Some recharge points proven by dye traces are at least 38 mi (61 km) away from the springs (Imes and Frederick, 2002). The maximum potential straight-line flow route is controlled by the length and width of the regional bedrock dip surface. Although there are many examples of interbasinal flow, and possibly underflow, deep incisions of the major streams segment the upper part of the aquifer and usually intercept flow routes that might otherwise continue farther down dip ( fig. 4)."}, {"section_title": "Laterally Continuous Siliceous Strata Are Aquitards That Vertically Segregate the Ozark Aquifer Into Vertically Stacked Compartments", "text": "Although the rocks that compose the Ozark aquifer are chiefly well-bedded dolomites, the sequence is punctuated by thin but laterally continuous siliceous strata that have significant effects on groundwater flow and speleogenesis in the ONSR area ( fig. 5). As noted in earlier studies, most of the cave passages in the area are concentrated in dolomites beneath these relatively insoluble beds (Orndorff and others, 2006;Lowell and others, 2010;Kaufman and Crews, 2013). These siliceous horizons, from stratigraphically lowest to highest, are (1) bedded chert in the uppermost Potosi Dolomite, (2) an unnamed sandstone package in the upper part of the Eminence Dolomite, (3) the basal Gunter Sandstone Member of the Gasconade Dolomite, (4) a Cryptozoon chert horizon at the base of the upper part of the Gasconade Dolomite, and 5basal quartz sandstone of the Roubidoux Formation. Figure 4. Selected dye traces to major springs in the Current River watershed area in southern Missouri (Aley and Aley, 1987;Imes and Kleeschulte, 1995). Large circles are 1 st magnitude springs, smaller circles are other spring locations. Dashed line delineates the Current River surface basin. Note evidence of interbasin underflow and crossing flow paths. See Mugel and others (2009) and Duley and others (2015) for additional traces and more detailed discussion. Mammoth Spring, the largest spring in Arkansas, is located just south of the stateline. A 1-to 3-ft-thick bed of porous chert near the top of the Potosi Dolomite was reported in the Eminence quadrangle (Orndorff and others, 1999) and in the Stegall Mountain quadrangle (Harrison and others, 2002). McDowell and Harrison (2000) reported a 3-to 6-ft-thick chert bed just above the Potosi-Eminence contact in the adjoining Powder Mill Ferry quadrangle. Although not noted in other geologic mapping in the study area, this siliceous interval is probably persistent across much of the study area and possibly confines the proximal part of the aquifer compartment feeding Blue (Current River), Cave, and Welch Springs ( fig. 4). There may be other siliceous intervals lower in the Potosi that influence groundwater flow, but their existence is conjectural due to lack of exposure of the unit.  Lowell and others (2010). In the study area, laterally extensive thin siliceous strata punctuate the carbonate sequence and function as aquitards. A, bedded cherts near the Potosi/Eminence Dolomite contact, B, a quartz sandstone and orthoquartzite-rich interval in the Eminence Dolomite, C, quartz sandstone and orthoquartzite beds in the Gunter Sandstone Member of the Gasconade Dolomite, D, bedded Cryptozoon chert interval in the upper part of the Gasconade Dolomite, E, quartz sandstone beds in the basal part of the Roubidoux Formation. A sandstone-rich interval in the Eminence Dolomite about 80-90 ft below the top of the formation is apparently horizontally continuous in the southeastern part of the study area and crops out in the Big Spring (Weary and McDowell, 2006), Van Buren South (Weary and Schindler, 2004), Van Buren North (Weary and Weems, 2004), and Stegall Mountain (Harrison and others, 2002) 7.5-minute quadrangles. Numerous caves are concentrated just below this horizon and although supplied by water from the underlying Potosi Dolomite, Big Spring issues from a conduit confined just beneath it as well (Weary and McDowell, 2006). Many caves and springs occur in massive and thick-bedded dolomites of the uppermost Eminence Dolomite, beneath the basal Gunter Sandstone Member of the overlying Gasconade Dolomite. The Gunter Sandstone in the ONSR area comprises beds of relatively impermeable silica-cemented quartz sandstone and orthoquartzite. In other parts of the Ozark aquifer, outside of the ONSR area, the Gunter is not quartz cemented and is permeable, and regarded as an aquifer unit Elfrink, 2007). Alley and Montauk Springs both rise from confinement beneath the Gunter Sandstone. The main passage of Round Spring Cavern, the ONSR's tourist cave, is developed primarily just below the Gunter Sandstone and makes an almost perfect dry analogue for the subaqueous cave feeding Alley Spring (Lowell and others, 2010). Numerous caves and springs occur about 100 ft below the top of the Gasconade Dolomite below a well-documented and laterally extensive bedded Cryptozoon chert interval (Lowell and others, 2010). None of the springs located at this horizon in the ONSR are very large, although 1 st magnitude Greer Spring, near the Eleven Point River to the south of the ONSR, may rise from this level ( fig. 4). Within the ONSR, 3 rd magnitude Blue Spring (Jacks Fork) probably rises from confinement under this chert horizon. Many caves and small springs in the ONSR area are located in non-cherty dolomite of the uppermost Gasconade Dolomite, just below the basal Roubidoux Formation quartz sandstones. Most of these occur in the upper reaches of Jacks Fork where the Gasconade is exposed in bluffs below Roubidoux cap rocks. Branson Cave and Jam Up Cave are two wellknown examples (Weary and Orndorff, 2012;Weary and others, 2013). Strata above the basal Roubidoux Formation sandstones in the ONSR area are usually unsaturated and tend to host numerous small ephemeral, vadose springs that are perched on laterally discontinuous sandstone or chert beds."}, {"section_title": "Springs Are Localized by Intersections of Downcut River Valleys and Bedrock Structural Highs", "text": "Structural contours, commonly drawn on the elevation data for the base of the Roubidoux Formation, are available for most of the 7.5minute geologic quadrangle maps that cover the ONSR. Undulations in this surface are interpreted to reflect tectonic folding and as such, this surface can be used as a proxy for elevation changes in parallel stratal surfaces, including the confining units below it (Lowell and others, 2010). Most of the major springs in the ONSR area are located in the deep river valleys (figs. 2 and 4) and occur on the flanks of structural highs in the bedrock. Montauk Springs (a single conduit spring that has three separate outlets in the valley-fill alluvium) for example, are located where downcutting by Pigeon Creek and its continuation, the upper Current River, impinges on the flank of a structural high ( fig.  6). This juxtaposition allows the ground surface to reach within a few tens of feet of the base of the subsurface Gunter Sandstone Member confining unit (Weary, 2015). Similar coincidences of springs adjacent to structural highs occur at all the first magnitude springs in the ONSR (Alley, Blue, Big, and Welch; see fig. 2 for locations). Hudson and others (2011) also noted that springs in the Ordovician Everton Formation in the Buffalo River, Arkansas area, about 120 mi (190 km) to the southwest of the ONSR, are localized over structural highs."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The development of large artesian springs and their contributing groundwater basins in the Ozark aquifer of the Salem Plateau results from a long geologic history that has allowed development of secondary and tertiary permeability and integration of quick-flow routes across large recharge areas; for instance, the average quick-flow rate of dye traces to Big Spring ranges from slightly less than 1 to 3 mi/day (Imes and others, 2007). The potential base-flow magnitude of the springs is determined by the storage volume in the aquifer within the contributing area for that spring. The volume of storage is influenced by the topography and number of aquifer compartments, separated by aquitards that are vertically stacked upgradient of the springs. The largest springs tend to have large recharge areas and discharge from lower in the stratigraphic section. The geometry of the Salem Plateau, underlain by subhorizontal, continuous strata lends itself to development of large spring basins. Large springs in the ONSR are located where downcutting streams erode into structural highs and lower the ground surface near the top of the locally confined part of the aquifer. At these places, unloading of downward hydrostatic pressure by erosion and surface drainage of the overlying rocks created strong upward pressure gradients. Over time, flow through fractures in the siliceous confining units has focused solution of the carbonate rocks above and below the aquitard. Ultimately, after solution of the adjoining dolomites, the siliceous units fail mechanically and collapse, opening the conduits to the surface and allowing concomitant increases in flow volume and velocity, further accelerating solution in the conduits proximal to the new large springs. Many of the large springs in the study area can be described as vauclusian, with large, singleconduit rise tubes that are steeply inclined to near-vertical (Vineyard and Feder, 1974). This geometry is the result of water rising steeply, under artesian pressure from the breach in the underlying local confining stratum. On its path to the surface, the water flow initially follows subvertical joints in the bedrock. Because most joints in the area are not throughgoing (continuous through more than a single bed), upward flow moves in a stepwise fashion, resulting in a slope determined by the thickness of the overlying rock beds and their joint spacing, as first described by Davis (1930, p. 549). This process of spring creation and cave enlargement has been repeated over time as the landscape is lowered by erosion, focused in the large river valleys. Higher aquifer compartments are eventually drained by the large springs and by dissection of their upgradient contributing areas, leaving fossil conduits (dry caves) in the uplands. The spring rise tubes are almost never preserved as the valleys are deepened and enlarged over time by erosion. New springs open as deeper confined compartments in the aquifer are breached, often in the vicinity of, and in a similar structural setting as, the previous spring ( fig. 7). The fact that geographically clustered caves are known from different stratigraphic levels in several places in the ONSR supports this hypothesis. Some of the elements of this model are similar to those proposed by Elfrink (2007) for speleogenesis in other parts of the Ozarks. Figure 7. Generalized conceptual cross section showing spatial relations between groundwater flow to springs, cave locations, and geohydrologic units in the Ozark aquifer in the ONSR area of the Ozarks. Note that there is some geographic distortion to fit this simplistic model (see figure 2 for actual spring locations). Alphabetical labels on aquitard units correspond to those used on figure 5. Previous spring conduits are left as dry caves in the remnants of the upland stratigraphy as the rivers sequentially cut down and drain the upper artesian compartments. Geohydrologic effects of Proterozoic igneous rock knobs in the mid-Current River area ( fig. 2) left out for simplicity. There are several implications that arise from this model. The geographic extent of the individual vertically stacked aquifer compartments may not be coincident, resulting in groundwater spring basin boundaries that are not vertical but rather interfingering. These overlapping relations allow \"crossing\" dye traces, where a tracer input at a single location may tend to flow to one spring via the shallower compartments, but dye leakage into deeper compartments may flow to a different spring. The divergent traces from a single input to Blue Spring (Jacks Fork) and Alley Spring are a good example of this phenomenon ( fig. 4). In addition, it can be assumed that the aquitard units that confine groundwater in upgradient areas proximal to the springs also seal off downward surface-water input into that part of the aquifer. Therefore, an area exists for some distance upgradient of each spring and downgradient of the closest dye injection point that is effectively not a part of that springs' recharge area and should not be drawn as part of the recharge area for that spring in mapping exercises. This refinement alters the traditional shape of mapped recharge areas and affects the application of spring discharge and recharge area estimates. Speleogenesis in the ONSR area probably began in the late Paleozoic with the development of a hypogenic intrastratal karst (Klimchouk, 2007), followed by later development of quick-flow routes to the large springs and associated conduit-forming and enlarging solution of the dolomite. Caves in the ONSR area tend to be stratabound, simple branchwork or single-conduit phreatic tubes and few are long. This indicates that processes controlling solutional enlargement of at least some of the caves are related to proximity to the springs they are feeding and that the age of cave enlargement is directly related to the history of Cenozoic dissection of the Salem Plateau."}, {"section_title": "Utilizing Fluorescent Dyes to Identify Meaningful Water-Quality Sampling Locations and Enhance Understanding of Groundwater Flow Near a Hog CAFO on Mantled Karst, Buffalo National River, Southern Ozarks Introduction", "text": "The landscape of the Springfield Plateau in the southern Ozarks ( fig. 1) is a mantled karst, with few apparent topographic features such as sinkholes on the land surface, yet the region is underlain by a system of welldeveloped fast-flow pathways and voids that pass water and entrained contaminants downgradient to resurgent springs and streams quickly and with little attenuation of pollutants. Karst scientists have long been aware and are fully knowledgeable about this and related areas of mantled karst, covered by insoluble debris weathered from the original carbonate bedrock (White, 1988;Quinlan, 1989;. Unfortunately, consultants, some landowners, and water managers unfamiliar with mantled karst have difficulty in recognizing the vulnerability of groundwater in these settings and the close interaction with surface water in such areas (Kosi\u010d and others, 2016;Murdoch and others, 2016). This is the case of Big Creek basin, the second largest tributary of the Buffalo National River. Big Creek basin has a total area of about 115 square kilometers (km 2 ) (Center for Advanced Spatial Technology, 2006), within which permission was recently granted for an industrial hog factory housing 6,500 swine in a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) (U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency and U.S. Small Business Agency, 2015). Waste from this CAFO was permitted to be spread from lagoons onto 2.5 km 2 of mantled karst in 2012 using documents that did not discuss groundwater or karst (Pesta, 2012). Figure 1.

The first is to present the results of five tracing events using three separate fluorescent dyes in Big Creek in the vicinity of the CAFO and its wastespreading fields, focusing on point-to-point groundwater flow connections and time of travel. The long duration of the traces was intended to show natural variation of the groundwater flow system in the karst for varying recharge, and establish that the rates of flow do indeed characterize the fast-flow conditions of conduit transport. The second objective is to provide an explanation of why the groundwater moves in the manner that it does, and to do so in terminology that will enlighten and educate lay people and other stakeholders, especially those who have the responsibility of promulgating regulations based on the established karst science. Documenting these karst attributes in peer-reviewed publications represents an important means to further educate all stakeholders."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The study area was chosen to include the potential flow boundaries of the groundwater system that are known from previous karst studies in the Ozarks (Aley, 1988;Mott and others, 2000), which include an area of natural groundwater flow larger than the site-specific location of the CAFO and its spreading fields (fig. 2). The spreading fields extend from Dry Creek to Big Creek, and the confluence of these streams south along Big Creek to slightly north of the CAFO. The reason for extending the study area boundaries in dye-tracing studies is to evaluate if surface-drainage basin boundaries and groundwater-basin boundaries are coincident or not. It is not uncommon for these boundaries to be different in karst (Quinlan, 1989;Hobza and others, 2005). In addition to placing dye receptors on Big Creek, its unnamed tributaries, Buffalo National River, Little Buffalo River, Left Fork of Big Creek, Dry Creek, Rock Creek, Cave Creek, and the springs that flow into these surface drainages, wells tapping the Boone Formation proximal to the CAFO also were monitored."}, {"section_title": "Hydrogeologic and Karst Characterization of the Study Area", "text": "Big Creek is one of the largest tributaries to the Buffalo National River, encompassing slightly more than 10 percent of the total drainage of the entire Buffalo River basin (Scott and Hofer, 1995;Mott and Laurans, 2004). Topographically, tributaries head in uplands on terrigenous sediments of Pennsylvanian age on the Boston Mountains Plateau ( fig. 1) and flow generally toward the north and east with relatively steep gradients, typically in the range of 3 to 5 meters (m) per kilometer (km). The stratigraphic unit of greatest concern to this study is the Boone Formation (Braden and Ausbrooks, 2003), an impure limestone interval ( fig. 3) that contains as much as 70 percent chert (Liner, 1978). The chert is hypothesized to have formed from atmospheric deposition of volcanic ash that was periodically ejected and carried by prevailing winds. In northern Arkansas, the setting was a shallow carbonate shelf (Brahana, 2014). The carbonate factory operating in this shallow marine setting at that time was hypothesized to have been overwhelmed by massive amounts of silica, which in the study area formed thin but fairly continuous layers of silica gel that typically ranged in thickness from 5 to 30 centimeters (cm). During periods of volcanic quiescence, carbonate sediments were deposited onto the thin layers of silica gel, and with successive sedimentation from these two sources, a sequence of approximately 80 m of these carbonate/silica couplets were laid down, compressed, and diagenetically altered and indurated into limestone and chert of the middle portion of the Boone Formation (Brahana, 2014). Structural uplift resulting from compressive closure of the Ouachita orogeny created a foreland bulge. This uplift acted concurrently with the volcanism, causing jointing, faulting, and tilting that allowed and facilitated pathways of weathering and karstification ( fig. 4) of the carbonate intervals of the middle Boone Formation.

Springs are common along the entire reach of Big Creek, ranging from relatively small discharges in the tens of liters per minute range to large discharges in tens of liters per second. These larger flows discharge from relatively pure carbonate lithologies, with caves more commonly found in the lower Boone or in Ordovician-aged limestones and dolomites (Mott and others, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Qualitative dye tracing was conducted from April 2014 through October 2014 in Big Creek and contiguous basins using three nontoxic, fluorescent dyes: fluorescein, rhodamine WT, and eosine. All dye injections were accomplished using liquid dyes, inasmuch as the powdered dyes (fluorescein and eosine) are easily caught up by air currents, and may cause severe cross-contamination if they are not in liquid form during injection. The liquid dyes were kept in impermeable containers, and dye receptors and personnel were isolated from incidental contact which would give false positive results (Quinlan, 1989;Aley, 2003). For each test, a single dye was injected into flowing groundwater in the middle part of the Boone, characterized by chert/limestone couplets ( fig. 5). Injection sites included handdug wells, a sinking stream in alluvium, and a swallet (table 1). The latter feature was a sinkhole that captured all of the flow of Dry Creek, a tributary upgradient from Big Creek and nearby spreading fields in limestone of the upper Boone. Fluorescein dye was introduced to a dug well about 500 m downgradient from the CAFO. At this location, groundwater is flowing on the epikarst, which is developed on the lower-middle Boone and overlain by Big Creek alluvium. Eosine was injected into a dug well that was surrounded by waste-spreading fields. Passive dye receptors similar in appearance to a tea bag were constructed by placing approximately 10 grams of coconut charcoal in a permeable packet that allowed flowing groundwater to contact the charcoal. In most cases, the permeable external layer of the packet was a \"milk sock\", whose manufactured purpose is to filter milk from automatic milking machines used by dairy barns. This fabric has enjoyed recent popularity within the dye-tracing community, especially for flow velocities of about 2 km/day or less. For greater flow velocities, such as surface streams, an additional packet was made with larger fabric openings approximately onefourth the size of window screen. In high-velocity streams, the milk sock receptor was often too fine a mesh to allow full contact of the flowing water with the charcoal, and thus did not yield meaningful positive dye detections. Passive dye receptors were placed in flowing groundwater and surface water throughout the study area, based on a previous karst inventory and discussions with local landowners. Receptors were placed in all available springs, wells, streams, and flowing water where we had been granted permission. Inasmuch as groundwater flow directions were not known at the start of the study, such a conservative approach is required (Quinlan, 1989).  If fluorescent dye were in the water, it was sorbed onto the charcoal in the receptor. These were left in place for periods of time varying from 1 day to 1 month, and were replaced by new receptors when the original receptors were retrieved. Receptors were identified by plastic tags with station number, date placed, and date retrieved noted in black permanent marker and placed into ziplock bags with additional information as appropriate recorded on the bag. Chain-of-custody forms were prepared and updated for the receptors through each transfer responsible for all remaining actions. Upon receipt from the field, the receptors were rinsed with distilled water in the Hydrogeology Laboratory at the University of Arkansas to remove sediment and related debris. They were allowed to air dry for at least 24 hours, and were then analyzed on a calibrated Shimadzu scanning spectrofluorophotometer (model RF 5000). One half of the dried charcoal was placed into plastic containers and an eluent of isopropyl alcohol and potassium hydroxide was added to mobilize any dye present on the charcoal into the residual solution (elutant). The elutant was then transferred by a disposable polyethylene pipette into a single-use cuvette, and analyzed for the wavelength of fluorescence specific to the three dyes that were used. Wavelength maxima for fluorescein were centered at 515 nanometers (nm), for eosine at 540 nm, and for rhodamine WT at 572 nm."}, {"section_title": "Data Verification", "text": "Verification of the accuracy of dye tracing is essential, and is documented by a process called quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC). QA/QC is a major component of all dye-tracing studies, and it provides unquestioned verification that the information gained from the passive detectors is valid.

For this study, it involved verifying that (1) the hydraulic head of the groundwater is higher at the point of injection that at the point the dye receptor was placed, (2) that the injection point is part of a dynamic groundwater flow system, (3) that positive attributes of the dye at specific locations are duplicated by other dye analysts through a series of blind testing, (4) that the concept of clean hands/dirty hands (Shelton, 1994) is honored strictly and that receptor retrieval is done by different personnel than those that injected the dye, (5) that crosscontamination of receptors is avoided by means of gloves and ziplock bags, and (6) that duplicate receptors reflect the same results."}, {"section_title": "Tracing Results", "text": "Five dye traces were undertaken in the study area in 2014, and a detailed summary of each is provided in table 1.

Photo by Carol Bitting. On April 22, 5 kilograms (kg) of fluorescein dye were injected into BS-39, a hand-dug well 13.17 m deep that had flowing groundwater on the epikarst perched on chert of the lower Boone Formation. BS-39 lies on an alluvial surface between the CAFO and Big Creek, about equidistant from both ( fig. 6). On April 27, 2 kg of rhodamine WT were injected at BS-78, a sinking stream at the intersection where a low-water county road crosses Sycamore Hollow (fig. 7). The dye was placed into alluvial gravel that overlaid limestone of the upper part of the middle Boone Formation. No positive instrument detections of the dye were confirmed from this trace. Insofar as passive dye receptors were only placed along Dry Creek and Big Creek for this test, results indicate there was no discernable eastern groundwater flow for the low-flow conditions at the time of this test. Positive traces were visually and instrumentally confirmed in an alluvial well downgradient and in multiple springs that resurge from below a chert layer in the bottom of Big Creek, upwelling about 660 m from the injection site 24 hours after injection. As with many of the other positive dye traces in the study area, the springs in the middle part of the Boone have multiple orifices and flow from a discrete karstified layer of a single limestone/chert couplet. This trace established that groundwater flowed from BS-39 to springs in Big Creek at a velocity of at least 660 meters per day (m/d). Springs associated with this resurgence would be an excellent place to sample for potential contamination from the CAFO, including feeding, waste-handling, and pond leakage. On May 12, 8 kg of eosine dye were injected into BS-36, a hand-dug well 12.23 m deep in the middle Boone Formation with visible groundwater flow along several zones near the water table that had been studied intensively (Murdoch and others, 2016). Well BS-36 is located within the generalized area of waste spreading, with fields on three sides and within several hundred meters of the well. One day following dye injection, more than 15 cm of rainfall caused a water-level rise in the well of more than 1 m, mobilizing much of the dye into permeable zones above the pre-injection water level. The dye was dispersed in a radial pattern ( fig. 8), with 36 confirmed positive eosine detections ( fig. 9) at springs and surface streams in Big Creek and in different basins other than Big Creek, as well as downstream in the Buffalo River. One positive trace to Mitch Hill Spring, on the opposite side of the Buffalo River from the injection point, reflected how complex the karst flow system is and how far from the study area flow could be detected. This positive Mitch Hill Spring trace was reconfirmed by both of the dye analysts in an external review using split receptor samples provided in a blind test. Obviously, some of the groundwater flow resurfaced and moved downgradient in Big Creek and other surface channels, but this test documented that groundwater flow from the area of the spreading fields surrounding BS-36 is mobilized during intense rainfall events, and sampling sites at springs along Left Fork of Big Creek, the Buffalo River, and surface streams in contiguous basins would be excellent sites for water-quality sampling at high-flow conditions. The radial pattern of flow resulting from this storm ( fig. 8) is a common feature observed in other dye traces in the middle Boone Formation (Aley, 1988;Mott and others, 2000). The traces shown by northwest-trending solid arrows from BS-36 to Left Fork of Big Creek ( fig. 8) represent dye that was detected at receptors in 7 days, yielding a conservative straight-line velocity of about 800 m/d. These values, along with those from the BS-39 injection site, are comparable to the results of the fluorescein trace from BS-36 in the same geologic interval. As a comparison of velocity, later recovery of dye from receptors from BS-36 showed a static zone of very little groundwater movement that served as a storage reservoir in the lower part of the well. The remaining dye, which was denser than water, was not flushed from the deeper part of the well for more than 3 months, and thus, during that time indicated there was no movement of water out of the well.  Solid arrows that emanate from the injection points show the locations of groundwater recovery sites on the map. Dashed lines from injection well BS-36 extend beyond the area shown on this map, with the full observed extent shown on figure 9. Actual flow paths in the subsurface are substantially more complex than the straight lines show. Tracing results shown here are groundwater-level dependent. On July 10, 5 kg of rhodamine WT were injected in to a swallet that captured the entire discharge of Dry Creek upstream from BS-71 ( fig. 7). This trace was initiated in the larger, more open voids of the upper Boone limestone (Stanton, 1994), which is chert free. This trace was visually confirmed at the confluence of Dry Creek and Big Creek, as well as instrumentally confirmed from dye receptors in springs along Dry Creek. This trace yielded the fastest groundwater velocity at nearly 7,000 m/d. Flow velocity based on this test was much greater than determinations made from tests in the karst in the middle Boone, and can be explained by less frictional flow from conduits in the pure-phase limestone of the upper Boone and a significant portion of the flow path occurring on the surface in Dry Creek. Figure 9. Flow from BS-36 during high flow after eosine injection on May 12, 2014. Dye was positively traced to 36 sites (springs and streams). Letters (yellow squares) show recommendations for sites to sample for evaluating contamination in the future. The dye-trace results show the full dispersive extent of karst flow in the subsurface into other surface-water basins, the Buffalo National River, and even beneath the Buffalo River to Mitch Hill Spring, identified by the black circle. Dark green rectangular patterns within area outlined around dye-injection site (yellow star) represent waste spreading fields. Five positive dye traces were recovered from the Buffalo National River during this test. On August 5, 2 kg of fluorescein were injected into BS-36, this time under extremely low-flow conditions. As with the trace at BS-78, no positive confirmation at any dye receptor except within the injection well was observed. The variation in stage in BS-36 at the time of this test was substantially lower than during the eosine injection on May 12, and the conditions of groundwater flow were also substantially different from that test. The May 12 test had 36 confirmed positive eosine traces (fig. 9); the August 5 fluorescein test had no confirmed traces. This result provides good insight for the water-level control on groundwater flow in the middle Boone, and helps explain our observations."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Information from these dye traces can be used for designing a more reliable and relevant water-quality sampling network to assess the impact of the CAFO on the karst groundwater and for gaining further understanding of the flow in this karst area (table 2). On the basis of the results of the dye tracing described herein, the key observations made on groundwater flow in the Boone Formation in the Big Creek study area are as follows: 1. Although the study area is mantled karst, subsurface flow is very important, and forms a significant part of the hydrologic budget. Groundwater velocities in the chert/limestone portion of the middle Boone Formation were conservatively measured to be in the range of 600 to 800 m/d. 2. Conduits in pure-phase limestones of the upper and lower Boone Formation have flow velocities that can exceed 5,000 m/d."}, {"section_title": "Groundwater flow in the Boone Formation", "text": "is not limited to the same surface drainage basin, which means that anomalously large springs should be part of the sampling network (Brahana, 1997). 4. Because the Buffalo National River is the main drain from the study area, and is used intensively for activities such as canoeing, fishing, and swimming, large springs and high-yield wells close to the river should be included in the sampling network."}, {"section_title": "Potential transport velocities of CAFO", "text": "wastes from the land surface appear to be most rapid during and shortly after intense rainfall. Minimum groundwater flow occurs during periods of low flow or during droughts. Sampling should accommodate these considerations. The chert obviously plays a role as confining layers in the Boone Formation, and adds to the complexity of the flow systems in the karst. Interbasin transport of the dye is consistent with groundwater following faults, which are common in the study area, with many not mapped. Insoluble material can be washed into the fault plane and divert groundwater flow along the fault. The appearance of linear patterns truncating topography ( fig. 7) and geology ( fig. 8) are consistent with this interpretation, and can be further tested with additional dye traces. Table 2.

The cave was formed over hundreds of thousands of years through erosion and dissolution of limestone by groundwater. Water still plays a vital role in the continuing geomorphic processes that form the cave and the cave ecosystem. The objective of this study was to conduct quantitative tracer studies to evaluate the transport of an injected tracer from the surface into the cave under different hydrologic conditions. The study included three quantitative tracer studies originating from a potential contamination source on the surface and monitoring in upper and lower level cave passages. The distance between the tracer release point (injection site) and the sinkhole in the stormrunoff channel used in this study was approximately 1,500 feet. Rhodamine WT (20-percent solution) dye was released in conjunction with either the onset of storm runoff or as the storm was winding down. The dye was released in August and October 2014, and in January 2015. Prior to each dye release, streams in the cave were monitored for a minimum of three consecutive storms to verify the absence of dye from previous tests. Continuous monitoring from June 2014, through January 2015, was accomplished using two portable fluorometers. Additional monitoring for the second tracer study was achieved by using 12 passive activated charcoal sampling devices. The monitoring equipment was located in different levels of the cave. One fluorometer was located in an upper level passage called Cataract Hall. The second fluorometer was placed in a lower level passage of the cave system in Cascade Hall, which lies along Silliman's Avenue. In the first tracer study, two check dams were constructed in the surface channel, and 180 milliliters of the Rhodamine WT dye were released on the rising limb of the storm runoff hydrograph (1.2-inch storm). It took 9.7 hours for the dye to reach the fluorometer in the upper level cave passage. The dye concentrations and discharge rate in the upper level passage were used to calculate a 3-percent recovery of the released dye. We were unsuccessful at detecting any dye in the lower level passage because of the location of the second fluorometer. The two low-level check dams on the surface were removed before the second tracer study. In the second study, 600 milliliters of Rhodamine WT dye were released during the rising limb of the storm runoff hydrograph (1.4-inch storm) and was detected in the upper level cave passage within 4 hours. Approximately 37 percent of the dye was accounted for in the upper level passage. The fluorometer in the lower level cave passage again failed to detect any dye; however, there were positive tracer results at 5 of the 12 passive sampler locations. The fluorometer in the lower level cave passage was moved to one of the locations with a positive recovery before the third tracer study was conducted. In the third tracer study, 600 milliliters of Rhodamine WT dye were released on the declining limb of the storm hydrograph (a 0.7-inch storm) and was detected in the upper level cave passage within 50 minutes. During that storm, approximately 38 percent of the dye was accounted for in the upper cave passage. Trace amounts of the dye also were detected in the lower level passage approximately 3.5 days later. Furthermore, subsequent storms resulted in the detection of additional dye in the upper cave passage that accounted for another 7 percent of the original amount of dye injected in the study. Additional dye detections following subsequent storms had not occurred in the previous two tracer studies. The tracer peaks associated with successive storms after the third study were probably because of the timing of the tracer release in the receding portion of the storm runoff, resulting in dye becoming stranded as the storm flow ceased. In summary, these studies demonstrated that temporary check dams more than doubled travel time between the surface and the subsurface, and also resulted in a reduction in the percentage of dye recovered in the upper level cave passage. The third study also demonstrated that if a chemical is released during the later part of the falling limb of a storm hydrograph, it may be transported faster into the cave than if it were released during the rising limb, but a portion is prone to temporary storage. Additional work is needed to account for the remaining dye and to better understand transport and storage mechanisms into and within the cave. During the monitoring period, drip rates for all the sites were very low, ranging between 0.7-2 drips per hour. However, there was a significant seasonal variation in electrical conductivity at three of the six drip sites, with most peak values occurring during the rainy season. Interestingly, the drip water did not show significant variability in pH during the whole monitoring period except for an increasing trend at all six drip sites during September-October 2013, which may have been caused by abnormal changes in summer rainfall in 2013. On the other hand, concentrations of dissolved major cations (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ ) in the cave drip water do not show significant changes. In addition, concentrations of CO 2 and temperature in Zhenzhu Cave show significant seasonal variations, with peak concentrations in the summer and lowest concentrations in the winter. Changes in the concentration of CO 2 negatively correlate with seasonal temperature differences between the cave environment and the surface (from Shijiazhuang meteorological station) at a high confidence level (R 2 =0.78). This may demonstrate that ventilation possibly caused seasonal variability in CO 2 in Zhenzhu Cave. A nearly 3-year-long (2011-2013) on-site monitoring program has been carried out with monthly sampling at Baojinggong Cave in South China and Shihua Cave in North China. Although there are differences in climatic conditions and cave geology between the two caves, we find that consistent controls on the \u03b4 18 O p , \u03b4 18 O w , and \u03b4 18 O c at Baojinggong Cave and Shihua Cave are as follows: 1) The \"Circulation effect\" of \u03b4 18 O p The \u03b4 18 O p values at the two caves do not correlate well with rainfall amount or temperature at seasonal or inter-annual scales. We find a similar seasonal circulation effect of \u03b4 18 O p at the two caves in the summer monsoon season-the \u03b4 18 O p value is relatively high if the short-distance water vapor is from the Pacific Ocean, whereas the \u03b4 18 O p value is relatively low if the long-distance water vapor is from the Indian Ocean. 2) The \"Evaporation effect\" of \u03b4 18 O w The amplitudes of the \u03b4 18 O values decrease greatly from precipitation to drip water, which is \"smoothed\" when waters infiltrate through the vadose zone at the two caves. The \u03b4 18 O versus \u03b4D plots of drip waters are slightly below the corresponding local meteoric water line. The average values of \u03b4 18 O w at all drip sites are higher than the annually weighted \u03b4 18 O p values. The \"peaks\" of \u03b4 18 O w correspond with the droughts above the cave or low humidity inside the cave. Therefore, seasonal changes in \u03b4 18 O w are due to evaporation processes in the vadose zone and inside the cave. 3) The \"Ventilation effect\" of \u03b4 18 O c The CO 2 concentration is higher in the summer season and lower in the winter season at the two caves. The drip sites closer to cave entrances were affected by strong cave ventilation and have lower CO 2 concentrations. Spatial variations in the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of calcite deposited on glass plates show good positive correlations, which indicate a kinetic fractionation effect. The \u03b4 18 O c values during enhanced ventilation periods are isotopically heavier than those of calculated results based on \u03b4 18 O w and temperature under equilibrium fractionation.

Multibeam-bathymetry and marine, high-resolution multichannel 2D and 3D seismic-reflection data acquired over two of these depressions at water depths of about 250 m (\"Miami sinkhole\") and 336 m (\"Key Biscayne sinkhole\") indicate the depressions are pockmarks. Seafloor pockmarks are concave, crater-like depressions that form through the outburst or venting of fluid (gas or liquid or both) at the sea floor and are important seabed features that provide information about fluid flow on continental margins. Both the Miami sinkhole and Key Biscayne sinkhole (about 25 and 48 m deep, respectively) have a seismic-chimney structure beneath them that indicates an origin related to seafloor fluid expulsion, as supported by multi-attribute analysis of the Key Biscayne sinkhole. Further, there is no widening of the depressions with depth as in the northern Fort Worth Basin, where widening of similar seismic, subcircular, karst-collapse structures is common. However, hypogenic karst dissolution is not ruled out as part of the evolution of the Miami Terrace depressions. Indeed, a hypogenic karst pipe plausibly extends downward from the bottom of the Key Biscayne sinkhole, providing a pathway for focused upward flow of fluids to the seafloor. In the Key Biscayne sinkhole, the proposed karst pipe occurs above the underlying seismic chimney that displays flat bright spots (a hydrocarbon indicator) in the seismic data, showing that possible fluids are currently trapped beneath the pockmark within a tightly folded popup structure. The Miami Terrace depressions have seismic-reflection features similar to modern pockmarks imaged on the Maldives carbonate platform. The seismic-reflection data also show that ancient satellite expulsions formed buried pockmarks, slumps, and paleo-collapse structures in the carbonate sediments near the Key Biscayne sinkhole. Additional processing of the 3D seismic data will aid in elucidating the origin of these seafloor depressions. Microkarst morphology and associated sedimentary features, including depositional texture and constituents present at cycle boundaries, were described using data from thin sections and core samples. In addition, a 6-inch section of the core, which spans a cycle boundary, was scanned by using highresolution computed tomography. The tomography scan was used to produce three-dimensional visualizations that show the detailed geometry of a single microkarstic surface contained in the core sample. The High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility at the University of Texas at Austin conducted the computed tomography scan and its computer image rendering. Eight high-frequency cycles, identified in the cored interval from 2,630 to 2,647 feet below land surface, are defined by an idealized vertical lithofacies succession characterized by benthic foraminiferal packstone and grainstone in the lower part that has indications of shallowing upwards through wackestone and packstone to a lime mudstone or ostracod-rich lime mudstone cap. Each cycle is bounded above and below by subaerial exposure surfaces. The upper part of the cycles exhibits microkarst with millimeter-to decimeter-scale paleotopography. The extent of karstification may affect only the upper few millimeters of the bed in which it developed, or it may extend downward a distance of up to 2 decimeters into the lime mudstone to wackestone units that form the uppermost part of the cycles. The morphology of these microkarstic surfaces varies depending on the intensity of dissolution that has occurred and possibly on the duration of subaerial exposure. One morphology appears on some slabbed core faces as an irregular linear feature that forms sharp, small-scale pinnacles separated by deep channels created by dissolution that create an intricate network of cavities. Another morphology has a more subdued, undulating surface with round-bottomed dissolution channels. Channels are open upward or semi-enclosed due to overhanging tips of adjacent pinnacles. Along slabbed core surfaces, areas of extensive dissolution can appear as isolated \"floating\" lime mudstone to wackestone clasts in a grain-dominated host rock, but actually are connected downward to the karstic mud-rich bed. Dissolution induced by subaerial exposure is responsible for many examples of secondary porosity associated with high permeability in aquifers, as well as in oil and gas field units around the world. A detailed description of small-scale karst and its relation to subaerial exposure at the highfrequency cycle scale has generally not been done extensively. This study of microkarstic features associated with high-frequency cycle boundaries in the Oldsmar Formation may provide insight into the occurrence and extent of this type of secondary porosity within platform carbonates. The Floridan aquifer system (FAS) underlies all of Florida and some of the less densely populated parts of southern Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina ( fig. 1), and is one of the principal regional aquifer systems in the United States. The FAS consists predominantly of permeable Tertiaryage carbonate rocks and some equivalent clastic units in the updip areas of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. In Georgia and Florida, the aquifer system is the principal source of freshwater for agricultural irrigation, and industrial, mining, commercial, and public-supply use (Miller, 1986;Maupin and Barber, 2005). The FAS also locally yields abundant water supplies in southeastern Alabama and South Carolina. In all four States, the aquifer system covers approximately 100,000 mi 2 . The aquifer system dips steeply into southeastern Mississippi and contains poor quality water; thus, it is not utilized for water supply in Mississippi and was not mapped by Miller (1986) or Williams and Kuniansky (2015). The FAS crops out in parts of southwest Georgia, southeast Alabama, and the western part of peninsular Florida where numerous karst features are present. In much of Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina, the FAS is overlain by an upper confining unit, which in local areas contains the Brunswick aquifer (Georgia) and the Intermediate aquifer system (Florida). Above the upper confining unit is the Surficial aquifer system (fig. 2). Below the FAS are less permeable rocks of the Cedar Keys Formation that also forms a confining unit. The revised extent of the FAS ( fig. 1) includes some of the updip clastic facies, which grade laterally into the Lower Floridan aquifer, and that have been previously included in the Southeastern Coastal Plain aquifer system, the FAS, or both. Additionally, the updip limit of the most productive part of the FAS was revised and indicates the approximate updip limit of the carbonate facies (former extent of FAS from Miller, 1986). The system includes Paleocene-to Miocene-age rocks that combine to form a vertically continuous sequence of mostly carbonate rocks that are interconnected, to varying degrees, vertically and horizontally within the system (Miller, 1986). In this revision, the system includes deeper rocks in a small area of Georgia where upper Cretaceous rocks are permeable and hydraulically connected to Paleocene rocks. The most significant difference in the revised framework is the delineation of internal boundaries between the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers. In the previous framework, discontinuous numbered middle confining units (MCUI through MCUVII; and MCUVIII in the Lower Floridan) were used to subdivide the system, some of which overlap each other vertically. Where units overlap, the least permeable rock unit within the middle part of the system was used to subdivide the system. Subregional variations in permeability, caused by facies changes, led to the use of different stratigraphic units to delineate the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers in peninsular Florida by local hydrogeologists. Where none of these units exist, the entire thickness of the FAS acts as a single hydrogeologic unit and was named the Upper Floridan aquifer. This variability in the way the system was subdivided at the subregional scale presents a challenge for regional studies of the system as a whole. Additionally, many of the previously numbered middle confining units could no longer be defined as low permeability or confining units (Williams and others, 2013;Williams and Kuniansky, 2015), based on results from numerous packer tests and flowmeter log data collected from the late 1980s to 2010, when work on the revised framework started. In the revised framework, internal boundaries between the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers are mapped using results from local studies; regional correlations of lithostratigraphic and hydrogeologic units or zones; and new information from digital televiewers, flowmeter logging analyses, and thousands of new borehole logs and aquifer tests Kuniansky and others, 2012;Williams and others, 2013). The nomenclature for the previously numbered middle confining units (MCUI-MCUVIII) of Miller (1986) is abandoned. Although the term \"confining unit\" is not totally abandoned within the revised framework, a new term \"composite unit\" is introduced for lithostratigraphic units that cannot be defined as either a confining or aquifer unit over their entire extent. This naming convention and mapping approach is a departure from the previous framework of the late 1980s in that three regionally mappable lithostratigraphic units are used to consistently subdivide the aquifer system into upper and lower aquifers across the entire aquifer system, but does not change the conceptual flow system. General hydraulic properties subareas of composite units (for example, confining, semi-confining, leaky, or permeable) are delineated and indicate where the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers behave as one aquifer system or are hydraulically separate. The revised framework uses stratigraphic names for the composite units within the middle part of the FAS rather than numbers. The three laterally extensive units used to subdivide the FAS into the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers, from shallowest to deepest are the Bucatunna Clay confining unit (BCU), the Lisbon-Avon Park composite unit (LISAPCU), and the middle Avon Park composite unit (MAPCU). All three of these units are subregional in extent, with the BCU present in the Florida panhandle; the LISAPCU present in Georgia, southeast Alabama, South Carolina, and northern peninsular Florida; and the MAPCU present in central and southern peninsular Florida. In southeast Georgia and northeast Florida both the LISAPCU and MAPCU are present. The revised framework introduces more zones of distinctly higher or lower permeability along narrower stratigraphic intervals within either the Upper or Lower Floridan aquifer to allow finer delineation of permeability variations within the aquifer system. The zones and units that subdivide the system are subregional in extent; thus, one or more geologic formations may be grouped to represent an important zone or unit while attempting to stay within the narrowest stratigraphic interval possible. Important considerations for mapping were (1) the mappability of the units or zones, (2) the stratigraphic position and continuity of hydraulic properties in subregional areas for logical grouping, (3) the degree of hydraulic head separation between zones or units, and (4) the use of geophysical log markers to define the positions of units or zones within the aquifer system. A schematic diagram of the relative vertical and horizontal relations of aquifers, zones, composite and confining units, and model layers by regions of the FAS is shown on figure 2. As the FAS thickened to over 3,000 feet (ft) southward, more zones were delineated. In peninsular Florida, from top to bottom, there are three zones in the Upper Floridan aquifer: the uppermost permeable zone (UPZ), the Ocala-Avon Park lower permeability zone (OCAPLPZ), and the Avon Park permeable zone (APPZ) (fig. 2). The uppermost part of the Upper Floridan is extremely permeable and mapped as the UPZ. There is a facies change within the Avon Park where it is less permeable and part of the LISAPCU in northern Florida, but the formation becomes thicker and more permeable to the south. The upper part of the Avon Park is somewhat less permeable than the APPZ or UPZ and mapped as the OCAPLPZ, but is part of the Upper Floridan. The middle part of the Avon Park is less permeable than the Upper or Lower Floridan aquifer zones and mapped as the MAPCU; it is used in southern peninsular Florida to divide the FAS into the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers. The Lower Floridan aquifer in peninsular Florida is subdivided into the lower Avon Park permeable zone (LAPPZ) and the Oldsmar permeable zone (OLDSPZ) by a mappable, generally less permeable unit called the Glauconite marker unit (GLAUCU). This unit is mapped by using the geophysical log signature for a distinctive glauconitic interval located in the uppermost part of the Oldsmar Formation. In the lower part of the Oldsmar Formation are extremely permeable cavernous areas locally named the Boulder Zone in south Florida and the Fernandina permeable zone in northeastern Florida and southeastern Georgia. In the revised framework, the Boulder Zone and Fernandina permeable zone are within the OLDSPZ. In developing the updated regional model of the FAS with MODFLOW-2005(Harbaugh, 2005, much thought and discussion went into the determination of how to incorporate the revised framework into the model with the least number of model layers while retaining the important subregional variations in hydraulic properties. The maximum number of layers discussed was 11, but the final number retained was 9. All model layers are continuous and have a minimum thickness of 50 ft. Thus, many of the layers may be composed of several different aquifers, or confining or composite units or zones within an aquifer ( fig. 2). Because there are actually three different discontinuous units that are used to separate the Upper and Lower FAS, and more zonations of permeability variations occur vertically in peninsular Florida, model layer 5 is composed of both the Lower FAS in the northern part of the study area and the Upper FAS in peninsular Florida. The variation in hydraulic properties of subregions is based on the revised framework (Williams and Kuniansky, 2015) using the spatial datasets for the framework (Williams and Dixon, 2015) and using aquifer test datasets Kuniansky and others, 2012). The current regional model of the freshwater part of the system has an equal-spaced model grid with 5,000-ft sides, and has a total of 863,971 active cells. Once the model of the freshwater part of the system is calibrated to historic flow and head datasets, it will be used to quantify current fresh groundwater resources, evaluate how these resources have changed over time, and provide forecast response tools for climate change/weather extremes, sea-level rise, and projected groundwater pumpage.  "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Karst aquifers develop in soluble rocks such as carbonates. They are characterized by a large heterogeneity in hydraulic properties owing to dissolution of the rocks, creating preferential flow paths. It is estimated that 25 percent of the world's population depends on karst aquifers for water supply . Goldscheider and others (2007) presented an example where almost half the population of a city was affected by contaminant transport through preferential flow paths in a karst aquifer. Flow modeling in karst is challenging because the assumption of equivalent porous media may not be valid, and the assumption may cause risk to public health due to the presence of preferential flow paths where contaminants can move faster. There are several approaches to modeling karst groundwater flow depending on the conceptualization of porous media and karst conduits. This study only considered a coupled discrete-continuum model Sauter, 1991, 1998), a type of hybrid model (Kuniansky, 2014), in which the porous media are assumed to be a three-dimensional (3-D) equivalent porous media, and the conduits are simulated by using a network of onedimensional discrete pipes that can flow under laminar and non-laminar conditions. Hybrid models have the advantage of integrating all of the existent information about the conduit system (Shoemaker and others, 2008). This study used MODFLOW-CFP mode 1   (Shoemaker and others, 2008), a hybrid modeling approach. Examples of using MODFLOW-CFP1 for field applications are found in Gallegos and others (2013), Hill and others (2010), and Kuniansky (2016 a, b), for areas in Florida where the spring conduits have been previously mapped. Gallegos and others (2013) also applied MODFLOW-CFP1 to simulate one lab experiment. With the objective of evaluating the performance of hybrid models and improving our understanding of karst flow, a 3-D sand box was built to simulate a simple karst system to which MODFLOW-CFP1 could be applied ( fig.  1). In this paper we present some results of the laboratory experiments and the process of a manual calibration for MODFLOW-CFP1 using FloPy (Bakker and others, 2016), a Python package that integrates MODFLOW with Python. The FloPy package facilitates the generation of MODFLOW input files, the execution of MODFLOW, and the analysis of modeling results. Because the current version of FloPy does not work with MODFLOW-CFP, we have developed new code for FloPy to make it compatible. Figure 1. Schematic view of the sand box used to simulate the simplified karst system. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the 3-D sand box. The tank is made of Plexiglas and is 100 centimeters (cm) long, 43.5 cm wide, and 41.8 cm high. Along the length, at each end of the sand box, a reservoir is used to maintain constant head, which controls the inflow and outflow of the system. Each reservoir is 10 cm in length. The remaining 80 cm of the sand box is filled with fine sand. A stainless steel pipe is placed in the center of the sand box to simulate a karst conduit. The pipe is 80 cm in length and 1.9 cm in diameter. A number of holes 0.2 cm in diameter are drilled in the pipe to allow water exchange between the porous medium and the karst pipe. A fine mesh was used to prevent sand infiltration into the porous pipe. Two reservoirs are also placed at the two ends of the pipe. A total of four external reservoirs are used to control inflow to and outflow from the porous medium and conduit by controlling hydraulic head in the reservoirs. The heads within the system are recorded using 20 sensors. As shown in the top view of figure 1, the sensors are placed in two parallel planes, each one containing 10 sensors. One plane is located next to the conduit, and the other is 11 cm from the first plane ( fig. 1). The system is sealed at the top with Plexiglas, thus representing a confined karst aquifer. The porous medium is fine sand with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.788 cm/s that was measured in the laboratory using a Darcy column. For the data presented here, the outflow tank for the matrix and conduit are kept at the same height of 46.4 cm above an established datum. At the beginning of the experiment, the inflow tanks of matrix and conduit are also set at the same height of 60 cm. After the experiment starts, the conduit tank is raised incrementally by 2.5 cm until a height of 75 cm is reached. This gives a total of seven sets of head measurements that were made when the system reached steady state. In addition to the head measurements by the sensors, heads and flow rates at the inflow and outflow ends of the sand box are recorded. Heads at the inflow are measured before the water enters the system, and heads at the outflow are measured after water leaves the system. The flow rates are calculated by measuring pressure drops in the pipes connected to the tank."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Data Collection", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Figure 2 plots the heads and flow rates measured at the inflow and outflow ends of the sand box for the matrix and conduit for the seven experimental configurations.

At the outflow end, the head for the conduit becomes increasingly higher than the head for the matrix as the conduit head at the inflow end increases. For the flow rates, figure 2(b) shows that the flow rate in the conduit increases as the conduit head increases; however, the matrix inflow rate decreases at a similar rate.

A numerical model was developed using MODFLOW-CFP1 to simulate the measured heads and flow rates. The model consisted of 31 rows, 54 columns, and 31 layers, as shown on figure 3. The conduit is located in layer 16 and row 16, between columns 3 and 52, and the grid is finer close to the conduit. For the conduit layer, its height is 1.9 cm, the diameter of the conduit. In the numerical simulation, we used a critical Reynolds number between 2000 and 4000 because a straight stainless steel pipe was being used. The tortuosity for a straight pipe is 1, and 0.01 cm was used for the roughness. The roughness for new stainless steel has a range of 0.1 to 0.015 cm, depending on the surface finish (Albright, 2009). The measured water temperature was 12 o C. The boundary conditions are constant head at the inflow and outflow for the matrix and the conduit, using the values measured in the laboratory. The experimental values used for case 5 are listed in table 1. Before model calibration, the response surfaces of the measurements were plotted for matrix hydraulic conductivity and the matrixconduit flow exchange coefficient ( ). These two variables were chosen as calibration parameters, because they are unknown. Although matrix hydraulic conductivity of the sand was measured in a Darcy column, the value may have changed when packing the sand into the tank. When evaluating the response surface, the matrix hydraulic conductivity (K) varied in the range 0.5 to 1.7 cm/s, and the exchange coefficient ( ) ranged from 0.001 to 31. The range of the exchange coefficient is large, because its value is completely unknown. By visually checking the response surfaces we observed that it was possible to get a combination that may calibrate the matrix flow rates; however, the conduit flow rates were always overestimated by the model. During the manual model calibration, the roughness was increased from 0.01 cm to 0.1 cm to account for the extra roughness caused by the pipe holes. With this change, a closer match between measured and simulated conditions was obtained. Figure 4 shows a plot for the root mean square error (RMSE). From this plot, an evaluation can be made with regard to whether a pair of parameters can be used to calibrate the model. The minimum error is given at K = 1.5 cm/s and \u03b1 = 7 cm 2 /s, and the simulated flow rates for those parameters are shown on figure 5. There is a satisfactory match between measured and simulated values; however, simulated head values are overestimated."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "A MODFLOW-CFP1 model was developed to simulate groundwater flow in a confined karst aquifer.

Flow regimes generally present in karst systems include conduit, mixed, and diffuse (matrix) and are related to the effective porosity and permeability of the aquifer strata through which groundwater flows. Recession curve analysis looks at inflection points (or breaks) in the water level measured in a well as the water level is declining after a rise or in the recession limb of a springflow hydrograph. These inflection points, or breaks, in the slopes of the water level or springflow discharge hydrographs are indicative of a change in flow regime or a change within a particular flow regime. In general, higher coefficient values indicate a steeper slope in the recession curve associated with movement or release of groundwater through conduit-type features of a karst aquifer, whereas lower coefficient values indicate a gentler, less steep recession slope associated with movement or release of water from diffuse (matrix) features of a karst aquifer. Recession coefficients with moderate slopes may indicate mixed flow regime types. Recession coefficients (\u03b1) were calculated for each part of the groundwater-level hydrograph for the karstic Edwards aquifer system by using a previously published equation (Milanovi\u0107, 1976) related to the release or movement of water through an aquifer.

An integrated outcrop and subsurface study was conducted to refine the local stratigraphic architecture of the Austin Group in Bexar County. Selected outcrops were measured and described; in addition, hand-held gamma ray scintillometer profiles were obtained from the measured sections ( fig. 1). Key marker horizons, first identified by C.O. Durham (1957) at Cibolo Creek on the Bexar-Guadalupe County line, allowed for correlation of outcrops several miles apart. Geophysical logs of boreholes drilled through the Austin Group provided data to better link the subsurface with the surface outcrops (Pedraza and Shah, 2010). Outcrop and subsurface data illustrate lateral variations in thickness of stratigraphic units within the Austin Group that are truncated at multiple discontinuity surfaces with some beds completely pinching out. There are three distinct oyster horizons in the uppermost 60 feet of the Austin Group in Bexar County: a 2-footthick layer of tightly packed Gryphaea wratheri and Inoceramid fragments within a glauconitic matrix occurring 50 feet below the top of the Austin Group, a 2-foot-thick layer of tightly packed Exogyra laevuiscula occurring 30 feet below the top, and a 5-foot-thick layer rich in Gryphaea aucella with abundant glauconite that is overlain by a bored hardground representing the Austin-Taylor Group contact. The Austin Group in Bexar County can be divided into lower, middle, and upper units that are distinct lithologic units bounded by laterally extensive discontinuity surfaces ( fig. 1). The lower and middle units together compose the Coniacian-age Atco Formation, recognizable at the type section in Travis County. The upper unit comprises the Santonian to Campanian-age Vinson and Dessau Formations, also recognized in Travis County. The Atco Formation thins toward the San Marcos Arch to the northeast. The Vinson and Dessau Formations, which are thin in Bexar County, thicken toward the San Marcos Arch to the northeast.

The Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas is a highly productive fractured karst aquifer that responds rapidly to changes in hydrologic conditions in a region characterized by cyclic periods of drought and wet conditions. An ongoing study by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Project in the Edwards aquifer-to better understand how groundwater quality changes over short (daily to monthly) and long (seasonal to decadal) timescales-provides a framework ideal for also assessing the variability of microbiological constituents, including aerobic endospores and pathogens. Three groundwater wells in the Edwards aquifer have been instrumented to provide near-continuous (subhourly) water-quality data (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen). To augment these data, discrete samples were collected and analyzed for a range of geochemical constituents. Some of these constituents are useful for describing microbial groundwater quality: the presence of E. coli, total coliforms, coliphage, and enterococci might be indicative of fecal contamination; aerobic endospores are non-fecal indicators of groundwater under the influence of surface water. Additionally, pathogenic microorganisms (Cryptosporidium and Giardia) and viruses were analyzed in a subset of samples. The wells are near San Antonio, Texas, along an updip-todowndip aquifer transect, and consist of one monitoring well in the unconfined (recharge) zone and two public-supply wells in the confined zone of the aquifer. Microbiological constituents were commonly detected in the updip recharge zone, but were infrequently detected in the deeper confined wells. Aerobic endospores were detected throughout the aquifer, but concentrations and detections generally decreased downdip. These results are consistent with other geochemical indicators that indicate updipto-downdip patterns in groundwater geochemistry with respect to water-rock interactions and groundwater residence time, and provide insight into the vulnerability of karst groundwater resources to contamination."}, {"section_title": "Onset, Development, and Demise of a Rudist Patch Reef in the Albian Glen Rose Formation of Central Texas", "text": "By Alexis Godet and J.

Its evolution during the Cretaceous is marked by periods of carbonate production punctuated by the deposition of more siliciclastic and organic-rich sediments (for example, Phelps and others, 2014). During the Albian (Early Cretaceous), rudist biostromes developed in the shallow marine environments that occupied the northern margin of the Gulf of Mexico (Perkins, , 1985. Such bioconstructions are preserved in the subsurface of Maverick County in Texas (Loucks and Kerans, 2003). Although the geometry and facies of these patch reefs are well constrained, the reasons for their initiation, unfolding, and demise has yet to be investigated. We hypothesize that nutrient supply and oxygenation of seawater, in addition to sea-level changes, played an important role in their development. This assumption was tested by investigating a rudist patch reef outcropping at the Cibolo Preserve in the city of Boerne, Texas ( fig. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Field description of the patch reef defines its core, which consists of caprinid rudist bivalves that are capped by a thin layer of monopleurid and toucasid rudists ( fig. 1).

This stratigraphic evolution of the stacking pattern of microfacies mirrors changes in sea levels and thus helps constrain the sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the sedimentary succession. Carbon stable isotope analysis is used to refine the age interpretation of the succession at Cibolo Preserve to the middle Albian by correlating its \u03b4 13 C curve with well-dated ones, such as the reference \u03b4 13 C curve for the Comanche platform proposed by others (2014, 2015), as well as identify subaerial exposure surfaces.

This is confirmed by the occurrence of miliolid-rich facies directly on top of the rudist patch reef, prior to a sequence boundary and an associated period of subaerial exposure indicated by a negative shift in both the carbon and oxygen stable isotope composition of whole rock samples. Moreover, the switch from capriniddominated to monopleurid-and toucasid-rich facies corresponds to a slight increase in the phosphorus content, from 25 to 35 ppm. Phosphorus is a biophile element that usually constitutes a proxy for trophic level (F\u00f6llmi, 1996); its content in the ocean influences the type of carbonate ecosystems that develop (Hallock, 1988;. On the other hand, the V/(V+Ni) ratio reflects redox conditions (Hatch and Leventhal, 1992;Riquier and others, 2006); reported values indicate the installation of suboxic conditions during the subsequent phase of sea-level rise that follows sequence boundary (SB) 2 ( fig. 1). We conclude that the monopleurid-toucasid association is adapted to slightly more mesotrophic conditions, but that the lack of well-oxygenated bottom seawater prevents their resilience and induces the demise of this rudist patch reef that eventually became subaerially exposed. Meteoric diagenesis induced dissolution of the aragonitic part of the rudist shells and the development of a fabric selective porosity, similar to that associated with rudist biostromes in the upper Glen Rose Formation. There, the moldic porosity is associated with nonfabric selective porosity that enhances the overall permeability of the biostrome and makes it one of the most permeable intervals in these carbonate rocks Pantea and others, 2014).

The slight increase in the phosphorus content in the upper part (24 to 35 ppm) and directly above the rudist patch reef (35 to 48 ppm) may reflect the onset of slightly more mesotrophic conditions.

Belonging to the Trinity Group, the Glen Rose Formation is a thick shallow marine carbonate succession deposited during the Albian Stage (Early Cretaceous) in south-central and north-central Texas Phelps and others, 2014). The Glen Rose Formation is known for its dinosaur tracks and trackways , which can be observed in numerous locations, such as Canyon Lake Gorge in Comal County . Recently, Adams and others (2015) described well-preserved tracks and trackways (theropod and sauropod) at Government Canyon State Natural Area (GCSNA), located northwest of San Antonio, Texas. This is a significant discovery as this outcrop represents the first Glen Rose track site to be identified within Bexar County. However, its precise stratigraphic location and depositional environment have yet to be determined in detail.

An analysis of the carbon stable isotope composition of carbonate samples helped refine correlation of the stratigraphic succession at GCSNA by comparing the \u03b4 13 C curve with well-dated isotope records, such as the reference \u03b4 13 C curve for the Comanche platform proposed by others (2014, 2015). This chemostratigraphic correlation is supported by the correlation of the total natural radioactivity with the gamma-ray curve of a water well located northeast of San Antonio that penetrates the upper Glen Rose Formation.

The evolution of carbon isotopic composition within the section and the outcrop gamma-ray profile will hopefully help precisely date this location. Bulk-rock geochemical data indicate that dinosaurs responsible for the tracks were living under warm and humid conditions characteristic of intertropical regions where strong weathering occurred, as deduced from the CIA values between about 78 and 98, as shown on figure 1 (Nesbitt and Young, 1982). Based on the beds stacking pattern and evolution of microfacies, we developed a sequence stratigraphic framework for the studied section. A third-order sequence boundary is identified at the top of a shallowing-upward trend that corresponds to the transition from fine crystalline dolomite with quartz (shallow subtidal, restricted environment), to limestones with miliolids (shallow subtidal environment). This sequence boundary separates a late highstand systems tract from an early transgressive systems tract. Dinosaur tracks and trackways are preserved at the tops of parasequences belonging to this late highstand systems tract. Depositional environments correspond to shallow subtidal settings affected by a warm and humid climate that promoted strong weathering on land. This high-resolution study of facies, including diagenesis, of part of the upper Glen Rose Formation highlights the localized development of secondary vuggy porosity linked to meteoric diagenesis directly below the sequence boundary. Such enhanced porosity horizons may serve as discrete carrier beds and may play a role in the recharge mechanisms of the upper Trinity aquifer. Figure 1.

It has a surveyed depth of 78 meters (m) (Texas Speleological Survey, 2016) and continues deeper. Genesis is the deepest cave known in the recharge zone in the Edwards aquifer (Balcones Fault Zone) ( fig. 1). The aquifer's water table often rises to flood the cave's lower portions. The cave can be described as having three main sections ( fig. 4). The upper section, from the surface to a depth of 44 m, is a series of short drops and steep-floored passages over a horizontal length of about 70 m. The middle section is \"The Crawl,\" a 47-m long horizontal passage that averages 1 m wide by 0.5 m high. The Crawl ends at the top of the cave's lower section, which begins with \"The Drain,\" a 22.8-m deep pit, and continues steeply 10 m deeper to the cave's surveyed end in a small room. The floor of the room was excavated a short distance to reveal a clean-washed pit estimated to be 6 m deep. This pit has not been explored due to high levels of carbon dioxide in the cave's atmosphere that often occur through the cave and increase with depth. Genesis Cave was discovered in early June 1985 and surveyed over the next couple of months. A year after the map was completed, the Mud Pit in the lower section was explored to a muddy bottom but was not surveyed. The cave was named after a plot subject in a Star Trek movie and not for any religious reason. When named, the cavers who discovered it did not know a church would be built on the property a year later. The 6-m deep pit at the bottom was opened in the early 1990s. The cave provides valuable insight into the karst hydrogeology of the Edwards aquifer. It is also biologically important, containing the federally listed endangered carabid beetle, Rhadine infernalis infernalis (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2011). A stygobitic salamander was reported in an isolated pool in the cave, but this has not been confirmed with collected specimens. If accurate, it would represent the stranding of a salamander following high aquifer levels. More importantly, it may indicate the presence of groundwater flow paths from the aquifer in the adjacent Glen Rose Limestone (figs. 2 and 3) where some of these salamanders are known. For more details about the cave and its early history, see Veni (1988)."}, {"section_title": "Hydrogeology", "text": "The first and most important thing to do when examining the cave's geology is to ignore the stratigraphy shown on the popularly used maps. The mapped stratigraphy in 1985 was inaccurate as there was no detailed mapping of the Edwards Group ( fig. 3) and its members. Admittedly, the general morphology of the cave ( fig. 4) fit well with the stratigraphy that was interpreted. The interpretation was that the upper part of the cave was in the Person Formation of the Edwards Group, \"The Crawl\" was perched on the regional dense member of the Person Formation, and the lower portion of the cave was in the Kainer Formation of the Edwards Group (figs. 3 and 5).  (Veni, 1988). Ten years later, Stein and Ozuna (1995) published the first detailed map of the geology in the Bexar County portion of the Edwards aquifer recharge zone. They identified the surface as the dolomitic member (figs. 3 and 5) of the Kainer Formation, which is near the bottom of the Edwards Group. Their mapping also placed the cave in the middle of a 360-m-wide horst that strikes northeast-southwest, the major trend of faults in that area. Caves in the Edwards aquifer recharge zone are most often formed along joints (Veni, 1988). Faults rarely guide passage development but one passage in Genesis Cave is formed along two parallel faults that strike N30\u00b0E and have a combined 1-m throw down to the east. In 2004, the cave was verified (by the author) that its roughly upper 23 m occurred in the dolomitic member and that the Kainer's basal nodular member (figs. 3 and 5) was below. However, the situation became complicated in \"The Crawl,\" which based on this new interpretation as shown on figure 5, should be located well within the cavernous hydrostratigraphic unit ( fig. 3) of the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The brecciated to highly disrupted beds in the walls and ceiling of \"The Crawl,\" that led the author 19 years earlier to conclude it was in the collapsed member of the Person Formation and perched on the regional dense member ( fig. 3), left the stratigraphic position uncertain. The walls of the first 10 m of \"The Crawl\" are probably within a fault breccia. At the end of \"The Crawl\" the beds are not disrupted, but the mud covering the walls and high levels of carbon dioxide prevented identification of the unit, and from there extrapolating the stratigraphy to the bottom of the cave. It is believed that they are in the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone, but a careful study of \"The Crawl\" and deeper portions of the cave are still needed to verify the stratigraphy and explain the origin of the disrupted beds. The sinkhole near the cave's entrance drained an area of over 10,000 m 2 prior to urbanization; runoff from only about a third of that area is now captured. Based on morphology, recharge through the sinkhole was the primary driving force in the cave's development. As the sinkhole filled with sediment, its permeability diminished, resulting in increased overland flow, which probably enlarged a jointcontrolled dome in the cave's first room to create its present entrance. Considerable, but unquantified recharge enters the cave through other permeable fractures. Genesis is one of many caves in the Edwards aquifer recharge zone where water is observed dripping to gushing (as is the case with Bear Cave, seen at the next field trip stop) from solutionally enlarged fractures into passages within 10 to 30 minutes of rainfall. The combined flow from these fractures and the cave's sinkhole result in a stream that reaches the water table within minutes. This behavior is especially prevalent in the dolomitic member of the Kainer Formation because of its high fracture permeability, which also limits overland flow resulting in predominantly small sinkholes and many barely-enterable cave entrances (Veni, 2005). The size of the drainage area for the Genesis sinkhole is a rare exception. Aquifers levels are known to fluctuate at least 26 m in the cave, with the highest level observed on December 8, 2004 (fig. 5). These levels have not been correlated with monitoring wells in the area, but at least a small amount of groundwater mounding in the cave is possible. Such rises could have also stranded the reported stygobitic salamander in the vadose zone. The only recharge zone cave known in Bexar County to contain such salamanders is Elm Springs Cave, located in the Person Formation about 7 kilometers (km) to the southwest. Sweet (1978) identified them as Eurycea tridentifera, which are otherwise mostly known from the caves in the lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone (the uppermost unit of the Middle Trinity aquifer) with most localities occurring along Cibolo Creek about 20 km to the north. However, a recent genetic study of Eurycea tridentifera discovered them in Stealth Cave (Bendik and others, 2013), located almost halfway between Cibolo Creek and Elm Springs Cave and at the top of the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone (fossiliferous hydrostratigraphic unit) (Clark and others, 2009). This locality suggests that fault juxtaposition of permeable limestone units has allowed the migration of the salamanders through conduits, as well as potential direct lateral recharge of the Edwards aquifer from the Glen Rose. Unfortunately, although the salamander is on the Texas list of threatened species, Elm Springs Cave was sealed in the middle to late 1990s, and its salamanders cannot be accessed for genetic study. If a stygobitic salamander is found again in Genesis Cave, it should be collected and genetically assessed for DNA evidence of this potential Cibolo/Glen Rose flow path into the Edwards aquifer. In the meantime, Johnson and others (2010) conducted a series of more conventional tracer tests with fluorescent dyes at Genesis and caves as much as 4 km west and northwest in the Panther Springs Creek drainage basin. When eosine dye was injected during the aforementioned high conditions on December 8, 2004, it was detected in low concentrations at two wells, 1.75 km and 1.89 km to the southwest about a month later, demonstrating groundwater velocities of about 50 m/day. In contrast, dye injected at another cave during the same period yielded groundwater velocities of nearly 5,000 m/day. The main mass of dye injected into Genesis Cave was not found. These and other results indicate that Genesis Cave may straddle the divide between the groundwater drainage basin below Panther Springs Creek and groundwater to the east. Potentially, the eosine dye from Genesis may not have appeared in the Panther Springs Creek basin wells except for the high aquifer levels at the time. Additional tracer work is needed to find the major groundwater flow path fed by Genesis Cave."}, {"section_title": "Cave and Aquifer Management", "text": "The church, which owns the cave, has long been an active partner in its protection and has supported access for its study, although there were a couple of early missteps. In 1987, the church's parking lot proved smaller than anticipated.

This was a violation of the church's water pollution abatement plan for the original parking lot's design. The Edwards Underground Water District (EUWD), predecessor agency to the current Edwards Aquifer Authority, worked with the church and the asphalt was removed, land surface restored, and the parking lot moved to 30-40 m from the entrance. However, two factors were not adequately considered: the low gradient topography and that the expanded parking area still extended over nearly half of the cave. A curb was installed this time, but for several years water flowed to the ends of the curb and again into the cave. Some of this water never reached the cave entrance, presumably recharging the cave via many of the permeable fractures in the intervening area. In the late 1990s, the parking lot was moved back 80-90 m from the cave and curbed so that no parking lot runoff now reaches the entrance or flows over the known parts of the cave. Also in the late 1990s, the road Sonterra Place was constructed, cutting off about two-thirds of the runoff into the cave. Construction of Sonterra Place, which is not owned by the church, encountered another cave. Like Genesis Cave 180 m to the west, Godchildren's Sink was not named for religious reasons. This pit was a trash dump when the property was a ranch. Excavation of the trash by cavers reached a depth of 6 m in October 1985 without finding the end to the trash or cave (a mangled baby doll pulled out of the trash was placed where it could \"watch\" the excavations and it became known as \"the godchild,\" hence the cave's name). Road construction did not remove the trash but preserved the cave within a 90-m long by 7-to 15-m-wide vegetated median in the middle of the road. The cave's entrance was filled with rocks and a storm water detention and filtration basin occupies the eastern half of the median. Genesis Cave extends a third of the way and directly toward Godchildren's Sink. Unexplored domes in Genesis could lead to passages that drain Godchildren's, or the caves may connect in the aquifer below the currently explored levels in Genesis Cave. In any case, their proximity suggests they are similarly related hydrologically to the Edwards aquifer. It is not known what effects the unexcavated trash and the storm water basin are having on the quality of water transmitted through these caves. While access to Godchildren's Sink was blocked by rocks, in 1988, the EUWD contracted my consulting firm, George Veni and Associates, to gate Genesis Cave. EUWD did not approve the gate design that was recommended but insisted on a different design. The EUWD designed gate was installed and it was breached within a month as predicted by George Veni and Associates. The gate was then chained shut and the church built two fences around the cave a few years later. A decorative fence was put around the entrance and sinkhole, and a chain-link fence was constructed along the edge of the parking lot.  3 ) of water that drains from its 28.95square kilometer (km 2 ) drainage basin. Total volume of fill to create the dam was approximately 310,000 m 3 . During record flooding in October 1998, following 46 centimeters (cm) of rainfall in a 24hour period (mean annual precipitation is only 76 cm), the spillway for the dam overflowed for the first time. The overflow was so forceful that it carried a 20-m-long by 10-m-wide slab of concrete for a few meters downstream until stopped by a tree. Some of the flood control dams have also served to enhance recharge into the Edwards aquifer. The Site 8 dam is particularly notable in this regard to the presence of three caves within the reservoir area. The most significant cave is Bear Cave, which is a transitional cave originally formed as a large chamber by previous hydrologic regimes. The cave is most likely of hypogenic origin and may represent a paleo spring site ( fig. 6). The collapse of its roof by valley downcutting modified it into an important recharge site. Prior to the construction of the dam, water had never been observed to flow into the cave's entrance. However, parts of the cave extend under the creek bed and capture substantial volumes of water when the stream flows. At such times, water pours into the cave through numerous fractures, including one \"fire-hydrant\" sized downspout. These inflows carry sediment, which demonstrate no filtration of the water. Examination of the surface stream has thus far found no single eddy or site of recharge to account for the flow found in the cave, indicating rapid combined recharge through the many solutionally enlarged fractures in the limestone. Flow into the cave and overall recharge into the aquifer behind the Site 8 dam has not been gauged. Increased urbanization of the drainage basin has raised concern about the quality of the impounded water recharging the aquifer. During the October 1998 and July 2002 flood events, water levels formed by the dam were as much as 4.5 m above the entrance to Bear Cave. Since the construction of the dam and semi-regular flooding of the cave, the bat population that once inhabited Bear Cave has now been displaced. Flooding has also modified the cave, washing open sediment plugs that had once blocked exploration and study. The map also shows the cave as having two entrances, but the natural bridge separating them was broken in an attempt to fill the cave in 1984. Flooding a year later washed away the fill. The next most notable cave behind the Site 8 dam is Cub Cave ( fig. 7). At 18 m wide by 5.5 m high, it has the largest cave entrance known in the county. Cub Cave is also an old chamber truncated by valley incision. However, it does not appear to have developed a pathway to the aquifer as permeable as at Bear Cave. New interpretations of the genesis of Cub Cave indicate that it might have formed as a mixing chamber from ascending water and represent a paleo spring site. The roof of the cave contains a number of cupolas and rise tubes from bedding enlarged conduits. A third smaller cave, a pit about 6 m deep, is located in the middle of the reservoir. Although this cave appears to be formed by vadose action to recharge the aquifer, sedimentation behind the dam is filling the cave faster than the sediments can be transported into the aquifer. The cave was last seen in 1985. Recent attempts to relocate it have failed. Both Bear Cave and Cub Cave entrances do not appear to be related to the current topography as they have not captured the nearby surface stream even though both caves lie below the level of the valley bottom. The urbanization of the basin and construction of the flood control structure resulted in more frequent flooding of both caves. In addition, both caves exhibit some structures that indicate they may have been formed by ascending water. Both Bear Cave and Cub Cave contain a number of cupolas and wall channels that indicate upward flow. Do these caves represent the abandoned conduit of a paleo spring complex and are now being overprinted by epigenic processes? Stone Oak Park is also an excellent location to view the rapid and dense urbanization of the recharge zone of the Edwards aquifer in northern Bexar County. Note the presence of large houses and apartment complexes along the parameter of the park as well as along the roadways leading to the park. San Antonio is experiencing a growth rate of fewer than 3 percent. The City of New Braunfels and City of San Marcos have approached 7 percent. The Austin-San Antonio growth corridor continues to expand and development over the recharge zone appears to be accelerating. Urbanization of the recharge and contributing zone creates the potential for water-quality degradation in the aquifer from sanitary effluent, application of landscaping products, hazardous materials spills, increased sedimentation and erosion, and urban non-point runoff, among other things. The area around the cave today is completely built out in residential neighborhoods and minimarket gas stations. The once sprawling ranchland is now lost to San Antonio's appetite for suburban housing. A tiny preserve, around 3 acres, surrounds the cave and provides a sliver of habitat for wildlife. It is covered with a mix of vegetation common to the area such as juniper, oak, and mesquite as well as various grasses and understory growth. The full extent of the cave system has not been defined because of rock and sediment filling the lower portions of the cave making them inaccessible without further excavation. It has been known for some time however, that substantial volumes of water drain into the cave and flow through it to parts unknown. Recent 3-D resistivity research has revealed substantially more cave than is currently known. Research done by Muhlestein and Green in 2010 shows the cave extending deeper and substantially farther than previously thought. This evidence substantiates the dynamic recharge observations made by Meissner as well. The Pleistocene cave entrance has collapsed and is currently inaccessible; however, the present day entrance consists of a 9-meter (m)-deep vertical shaft formed by solution and collapse. It is currently rigged with a ladder for easy access to the cave pit. This current entrance passes through the lower part of the Edwards Group and is a conduit to the Edwards aquifer. The known cave dimensions are roughly 10 m measured horizontally from east to west, and 20 m north to south. The 3-D electrical resistivity survey was designed to characterize the subsurface features using a dipole-dipole array. Four overlapping grids were laid out on the site with the corner of each of the four grids meeting directly over the vertical entrance of the cave. Each grid was set to 5-m intervals for a total grid dimension of 35 m by 55 m. With an electrode overlap in both the X and Y directions, the dimensions of the four joined grids are 70 m by 110 m. AGI Earth Imager software was used for visualization of the 3-D survey data and to statistically validate the 3-D data set. This arrangement provided a depth resolution of just over 12 m. The survey indicates additional void space associated with Friesenhahn and indicates that the cave is substantially greater in horizontal and vertical extent."}, {"section_title": "Field Trip Stop 4: Lunch Presentation: Cretaceous Sedimentation in Central Texas", "text": "By Alexis Godet"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Cretaceous Period (ca. 66-145 Ma, Gradstein and others, 2012; fig. 8) was a time of heightened plate tectonics, rifting, and volcanism associated with the rapid breakup of the supercontinent Pangea (fig 8). These transformations affected ecological, climatic, and oceanic conditions across the planet (see F\u00f6llmi, 2012, and references therein), and resulted in a warmer climate directly related to increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gasses including carbon dioxide. In particular during the Early Cretaceous, major volcanic pulses and increased mid-ocean ridge activity pumped vast amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere (four times present-day concentrations) (Larson, 1991;Barron and others, 1995), triggering a climate that oscillated from \"normal\" greenhouse conditions coupled with widespread aridity, to intensified greenhouse conditions causing widespread humidity (Hay, 2008;F\u00f6llmi, 2012;Mill\u00e1n and others, 2014;Phelps and others, 2014). During this time multiple Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) occurred (Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976;Weissert and Erba, 2004;F\u00f6llmi, 2012;Phelps and others, 2014). They are commonly identified in the rock record by pronounced carbon isotope excursions (Arthur and others, 1990;Erbacher and Thurow, 1997;Leckie and others, 2002;Trabucho and others, 2010), significant marine extinctions (Erbacher and others, 2001), and a widespread (interoceanic/interbasinal) occurrence of well-preserved sedimentary organic matter in open marine deposits (Wilson and others, 1998;Erbacher and others, 2001;Leckie and others, 2002;Mill\u00e1n and others, 2014). The North American continent has been affected by the aforementioned sea-level changes and environmental perturbation. A direct consequence is the inundation of North America that resulted in the development of the Western Interior Seaway (Schr\u00f6der-Adams, 2014) ( fig. 9). This large interior sea existed between Laramida and Appalachia, and was estimated to be 980 feet deep (Kaufmann, 1977). The fragmentation of Pangea also greatly increased the length of available coastline for passive margin and thus, epicontinental seas ( fig. 9) development, where carbonate ecosystems thrived (Philip, 2003). In such a contrasted world, carbonate platforms represent ideal recorders of environmental changes, such as enhanced greenhouse conditions, rise in global temperature, and strengthened nutrient supply into the oceans (F\u00f6llmi and others, 1994;Weissert and Erba, 2004). These parameters may have had profound impacts on the development of these passive margin platforms in terms of their general morphology and their facies distributions (F\u00f6llmi and others, 2006). Central Texas presently encompasses the Hill County (mostly Cretaceous limestones) and the Coastal Plains (Cenozoic siliciclastics). The Hill County is affected by the Balcones Fault Zone, which formed following downwarping near the Gulf Coast and moderate uplift inland during the Tertiary. The transition between these two regions corresponds to the lower Cretaceous shelf break, where the Stuart City Reef developed.  "}, {"section_title": "From Pangea to the Comanche Platform", "text": "The Comanche platform formed along the northern border of the present-day Gulf of Mexico, at a paleolatitude between 20 and 30\u00b0 north of the equator (Scotese and others, 1988;Winker and Buffler, 1988), and provides an almost complete reference section for the Cretaceous Period in this part of the world (Phelps and others, 2014). The thick platform sequence shows very little influence from regional tectonic events as it was deposited on a passive shelf margin. The Late Paleozoic Ouachita collision and the subsequent rifting during the Early-Mid Mesozoic ( fig. 9) resulted in (1) a seaward shelf edge, (2) the San Marcos Arch, and (3) the Maverick Basin (Montgomery, 1990). After the breakup of Pangea and rifting in the Late Permian and Triassic ( fig. 10), arid conditions during the Jurassic promoted deposition of the thick Louann salt ( fig. 10) in basins within and around the Gulf of Mexico ( fig. 9). These basins became zones of increased subsidence and sedimentation during the Cretaceous Period Phelps and others, 2014). During the late Jurassic, the transitional continental crust was attenuated and later became the foundation for the Comanche platform (Buffler and Sawyer, 1985;Winker and Buffler, 1988;Phelps and others, 2014). The San Marcos Arch was a high point between the Maverick Basin in south-central Texas and the East Texas Basin, and separated these two basins from each other during the Late Cretaceous (Luttrell, 1977). The Rio Grande Embayment is bounded by the Balcones Fault Zone to the north with abundant volcanic ash in the Austin and Taylor Groups, and the Salado-Tamaulipas Arch as well. Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments accumulated in the rapidly subsiding Rio Grande Embayment (Luttrell, 1977), where upper Cretaceous deposits reached a maximum thickness, whereas they are the thinnest over the San Marcos Arch (Montgomery, 1990).

The carbonate ramp subsequently began to rebuild and prograde outward into the basin during the early Aptian (124-119 Ma), before the subsequent OAE1b ( fig. 10) stalled carbonate production and triggered another episode of platform inundation. This second inundation episode resulted in the widespread deposition of black sediments, the Bexar Shale (119-110 Ma;Forgotson, 1957) (fig. 8). The Pine Island and Bexar Shales exhibit high organic carbon content (up to 1.86 and 1.73 weight percent total organic carbon, respectively), and decreased bioturbation as a result of deposition under anoxic conditions (Hull, 2011). Bexar Shale deposition ceased with a marine transgression during the Albian (110-104 Ma). The transgression marked the beginning of a gradual return to normal marine conditions as the platform began to recover from the damaging environmental impacts of the preceding OAE1a and 1b. The platform developed a distinct progradational shelf margin profile with the installation of abundant reef buildups along an emerging shelf margin. A marine transgression in the late Albian (104-101 Ma) prompted a shift from shelf progradation to aggradation (Phelps and others, 2014). Although erosion has removed the majority of upper Cretaceous strata within the Comanche platform, Aptian-Albian carbonates are well preserved because of early cementation (Galloway and others, 1982;Fullmer and Lucia, 2005;Phelps and others, 2014). These Albian units of the Comanche platform include, from oldest to youngest, the Glen Rose Limestone , the Walnut Formation (Loeblich and Tappan, 1949), the Edwards Group (Hill and Vaughan, 1898;Adkins, 1932;Rose, 1972), the Georgetown Formation, and the Stuart City Formation of the Atascosa Group ( fig. 9)."}, {"section_title": "Glen Rose Limestone", "text": "The Glen Rose Limestone is a thick shallow-marine carbonate succession deposited above the Bexar Shale during a series of minor marine transgressions and regressions (Phelps and others, 2014). Evolution of the Glen Rose tracks the recovery of the platform following the disruptive OAE1b. The Glen Rose Limestone is part of the Upper Trinity sequence and is divided into lower and upper members (Mb; Hazzard, 1939;Scott and others, 2007) by a thin, laterally continuous accumulation of shells of the small bivalve Corbula martinae, known as the Corbula bed (Whitney, 1952;). The lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone primarily comprises alternating layers of limestone, dolomite, and thin shale. The carbonate layers consist of shell fragments with micritic sparry calcite or dolomite matrices (Stricklin and others, 1971). Deposition of the lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone occurred along a carbonate ramp as sea level transgressed. Dinosaur tracks are preserved in intertidal to supratidal environmental facies of the lower Glen Rose. Although less common, some dinosaur footprints and trackways have been identified in shallow subtidal environments within the lower member of the Glen Rose (Hawthorne, 1990). The upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone comprises layers of evaporites, dolomite, and marl with evidence of periodic subaerial exposure (Stricklin and others, 1971).

These beds are horizontal, and some thin carbonate mudstone beds are present. These beds are overlain by a laminated carbonate mudstone bed that contains some shell fragments.

Its main purpose is to provide flood protection for the 157,250 acres of land downstream from the dam. The Canyon Lake Dam was begun in 1958 and completed in 1964; the lake was filled to capacity by 1968 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, http://www.swf-wc.usace.army.mil/canyon/Information/History.asp). It is an earthen dam 4,410 feet (ft) in length and at its maximum is 224 ft above the Guadalupe River, so it is a rather significant structure. None the less, if the lake levels were to rise enough to overtop the dam it would likely result in catastrophic flooding in downstream areas of the Guadalupe River. As a result, the Corps of Engineers have used rain and weather data to predict the worst flood that might reasonably occur in this region. This is called a \"probable maximum flood.\" During such a flood, the reservoir would completely fill, and water would continue exiting through the dam. The existing concrete spillway was designed to pass all that water without allowing the dam to be overtopped. As evidenced during the flooding in the summer of 2002, the spillway was effective in performing its job. During the 2002 event Canyon Lake received 8 in. of rain in 24 hours. While a significant amount, it was not a record; in flooding during 1998 there were 19 in. reported in a 24-hour period. What made the 2002 flooding so severe was not the short-term amount of precipitation, but the fact that it was a steady rainfall that continued for days. The average rainfall between June 29 and July 6 was around 22 in. (some areas received 40 in.). Not only did rainfall over the surface of the lake contribute to the pool level rising, but also the rainfall in the 1,432 square miles of drainage basin above the dam. A short calculation reveals that approximately 700,000 acre-feet of water entered Canyon Lake that week. The conservation pool level of Canyon Lake is listed by the Corps as 908.62 ft. This number represents the elevation of the water surface in the lake above mean sea level, and the level that the Corps maintains by regulating the outflow from the lake. The top of the Canyon Lake Dam is 973 ft and the spillway is at an elevation of 943 ft, roughly 34 ft above the conservation level of the lake and 30 ft below the top of the dam. The previous record pool level was 942.67 ft on June 19, 1987; the 2002 event on July 6 had a flooding maximum of 950.32 ft or 7 ft 4 inches (in.) above the spillway. Several numbers have been listed as the maximum flow rate; most common is 66,800 cubic feet per second (ft 3 /s) and the highest is 73,000 ft 3 /s. In New Braunfels peak flow reached about 70,000 ft 3 /s. Had the Canyon Lake Dam not been constructed, it is estimated that the flow would have been greater than 126,000 ft 3 /s (Comal County Engineer's Office, http://www.cceo.org/flood/flood2002.asp). Farther downstream recorded peak flows at Cuero reached 64,700 ft 3 /s and at Victoria reached 72,600 ft 3 /s. Without Canyon Dam, flows at Cuero would have been about 103,000 ft 3 /s and about 113,000 ft 3 /s at Victoria. All of this water created the spectacular Canyon Lake Gorge in a short period of time. Prior to 2002, the valley below the spillway had a small intermittent stream and some small springs, and it was thickly wooded with gently sloping topography. If you look at the sides of the gorge, observe the soil horizons on either side and imagine a more or less straight line connecting them, place similar vegetation that you see on either side across your imagined horizon and that is pretty much how the valley looked prior to the flood event. The entire gorge was formed during the 2002 event; the bulk of the erosion took place during the time around the maximum flow rate (July 6 th ), but water continued to flow over the spillway for weeks. At the end of July there was just under a foot of water still flowing over the spillway, or about 2,000 ft 3 /s. This reduced flow was not strong enough to move any boulders or cause significant erosion, but would have been effective at moving sand size and smaller sediments. The Southwest Texas State University Geography Department has mapped the new eroded surface of the gorge, and based on a comparison with old data from topographic maps and digital orthoquads has estimated that the volume of material (rock) removed during the flooding was approximately 500,000 cubic yards.

The dolomitic member of the Kainer Formation ( fig. 3) extends from the surface down 9 m to the dripline of the cave's entrance ( fig. 16). This thick-bedded, structurally competent unit forms the roof of many large cave chambers in the area, as well as the namesake bridge of Natural Bridge Caverns 1.1 km to the northeast. The humanly accessible portion of Bracken Bat Cave is mostly within the 15-m thick basal nodular member of the Kainer Formation ( fig. 16), previously designated as the Walnut Formation when figure 16 was drafted. Large solutionally formed chambers and passages are often present in the basal nodular member in Bexar County and southern Comal County, but the large passage of Bracken Bat Cave is not formed by solution (see Veni (2005) for a review of lithology as it affects cave morphologies in this area). The deepest 7 m of Bracken Bat Cave are formed in the cavernous hydrostratigraphic unit (HSU) ( fig. 3) of the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone, described by Clark and others (2013). This unit is 37 m thick and contains most of the largest solutionally formed cave chambers and passages in Bexar and southern Comal Counties. Like the basal nodular member exposure in the cave, its humanly accessible section in the upper Glen Rose Limestone is not formed by solution. The entire known cave is formed by collapse. Kastning (1983) was the first to conduct a detailed study of speleogenesis in the Bracken Bat Cave-Natural Bridge Caverns area. He found that the caves were likely formed by the same process, except that guano blocks access to most of the likely extent of Bracken Bat Cave and so the mechanism of its origin is best seen in Natural Bridge Caverns, which is much more extensive with a surveyed length of 3,354 m and vertical extent of 70 m, inclusive of sections physically separated by collapse (Fieseler and others, 1978). He attributed the origin of the caves to the development of early solutional porosity of the Glen Rose Limestone during late Cretaceous (post-Albian) time and later guidance of fractures on groundwater flow. Much of his sequence chronology of solutional enlargement, collapse, and speleothem development fits current thought. The jagged up-and-down profile of Natural Bridge Caverns shows the effect of multiple collapses along a large, deep solutionally formed passage, with its largest collapse breaching the surface to create the entrance. Similarly, the entrance and exposed portion of Bracken Bat Cave are at the top of a large collapse into a much deeper solutionally formed passage, which is currently inaccessible due to the thick deposits of bat guano. For many years following its discovery, Natural Bridge Caverns posed a conundrum for local hydrogeologists. It was clearly formed in the upper Glen Rose, but conventional wisdom held that the Glen Rose was the impermeable basal confining unit for the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) aquifer (hereafter referred to as the \"Edwards aquifer\"). Veni (1995) first proposed hydrologic continuity between the Edwards aquifer and what was later described as the cavernous HSU of the upper Glen Rose Limestone (Clark and others, 2009) in Bexar County and portions of adjacent Comal and Medina Counties. This conclusion was based on caves that extend between the units, allowing recharge to enter the Glen Rose Limestone through the Edwards and with no likely discharge points for that water except transformational flow across faults back into the Edwards. This theory was demonstrated through dyetracing studies (Johnson and others, 2010) and the hydrologic relationship is now generally accepted. One problematic issue remains. Natural Bridge Caverns extends at least 18 m below the cavernous HSU into the upper Glen Rose Camp Bullis unit (Clark and others, 2013), which is otherwise a poor to minor cave-forming unit but has the most springs in neighboring Bexar County due to groundwater-perching horizons (Clark and others, 2013). Part of this problem may be resolved by the U.S. Geological Survey's soon-to-be-published hydrostratigraphic mapping that includes the Bracken Bat-Natural Bridge study area, if it reveals more extensive zones for cave development in that part of the Glen Rose than in Bexar County. Our report proposes that the two caves formed as tapoff passages. They are located across a meander of Cibolo Creek, which reverses its west-to-east flow by flowing south, then west 1.6 km north of the caves, then south 2.2 km west of Bracken Bat Cave. Where the seasonally active creek turns west, north of the caves, it forms a steep hydraulic gradient with the Edwards aquifer to the south; tapoff passages form along such gradients. They typical have no side passages, or few and under-fit side passages as seen in Natural Bridge Caverns. The cave's large size is consistent with the large volume of chemically aggressive water recharging Cibolo Creek to the north, which appears in the cave soon after the creek floods."}, {"section_title": "Surface Geophysics", "text": "Surface electrical resistivity surveys were conducted at the Bracken Bat Cave property during the past 10 years by staff from Southwest Research Institute and Raba-Kistner Environmental Services, with assistance by BCI, and the Bexar Grotto, the San Antonio chapter of the National Speleological Society. The objective of the surveys was to discern the possible presence of additional, yet undiscovered caves in the vicinity of Bracken Bat Cave. The electrical resistivity surveys were conducted using a 96electrode, 10-channel Syscal Pro electrical resistivity system (IRIS Instruments, Orleans, France). Dipole spacing was 5 m in all surveys. The measured resistivity data were inverted to provide an interpretation of the subsurface using Advanced Geosciences, Inc. EarthImager\u2122 software. Electrical resistivity surveys were conducted along four two-dimensional transects and one threedimensional array. The four two-dimensional transects were aligned approximately perpendicular to the line bisecting Bracken Bat Cave ( fig. 17). All four transects were located on the collapsed side (north) of Bracken Bat Cave in the hope that any continuation of the cave that extends beyond the collapse would be detected. Locations of the northernmost two-dimensional transect and the three-dimensional survey are shown on figure 18. The remaining three two-dimensional transects were aligned between Bracken Bat Cave and the northernmost two-dimensional transect. Composite results from the four twodimensional transects are overlain on an aerial photograph of the site of Bracken Bat Cave ( fig. 17). Results from the three-dimensional survey are illustrated on figure 19. The geoelectrical properties of the subsurface provided by the inverted data are illustrated on figures 17 and 19. More electrically resistive media are represented by warm colors (i.e., yellow, orange, red) and more electrically conductive media are represented by cooler colors (i.e., blue, green). In general, media with silts, clays, and possibly the presence of water are electrically conductive. On figures 17 and 19, the electrically conductive zones at depth are interpreted as the Glen Rose Limestone, which contains a greater content of clay than the electrically resistive Edwards Group. In addition, vertically oriented zones in the cross sections are interpreted as fault zones that contain water and possibly weathering products, both of which are less resistive than intact rock of the Edwards Group.   Electrically resistive zones in the cross sections are interpreted as intact rock. It is possible these resistive zones are indicative of open voids, such as a cave, because both intact rock and air-filled voids can have electrically resistive signatures. As illustrated on figure 17, there is substantial coverage of highly resistive zones in the cross sections. The highly resistivity zones are too pervasive to infer whether a particular highly resistive zone in one transect is aligned with a particular highly resistive zone in an adjoining transect, which could be an indication of a horizontal cave. Survey results would need to be corroborated with boreholes or trenches to be able to ascertain which high resistivity zone, if any, represents a cave feature. Results from the three-dimensional resistivity survey conducted immediately north of the collapsed end of Bracken Bat Cave ( fig. 18) are illustrated using different graphics on figure 19. By removing those media that are less resistive from the image, zones with higher resistivity are exhibited. This survey result indicates that a continuation of the cave may be present to the north of the collapsed entrance. Similar to the results of the two-dimensional surveys, this interpretation would need to be corroborated with boreholes or trenches to ascertain whether a cave is actually present to the north of the collapse."}, {"section_title": "Cave Geophysics", "text": "In 2013, a drilling company offered its services to BCI. Upon consideration, BCI contacted the National Cave and Karst Research Institute (NCKRI) to use the drilling services to core the guano in Bracken Bat Cave and analyze it for paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data. NCKRI organized a team of specialists to work on the study. Staff at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio had previously worked at the cave conducting the surface geophysics described in the previous section. Dr. Bogdan Onac, of the University of South Florida, brought practical experience from his published research on coring guano in other caves and also had access to his university's lab facilities for additional analyses. Dr. Rick Toomey, of the Mammoth Cave International Center for Science and Learning at Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky, is a vertebrate paleontologist who is highly knowledgeable about both bat and Texas cave faunal remains. He would identify the bones recovered to determine what changes in species, if any, occurred over time. But the first step was to determine where to drill inside the cave. BCI organized a team of volunteers to assist NCKRI in conducting four electrical resistivity surveys in the cave in January 2014. The wintertime study period coincided with the time when most of the bats would be in Mexico, resulting in minimal disturbance but also better working conditions. NCKRI used its SuperSting R8/IP electrical resistivity equipment, manufactured by Advanced Geosciences, Inc., to collect the resistivity data. The data were later processed using EarthImager\u2122 software. Three two-dimensional surveys were conducted. Resistivity Line 1 began about 40 m from the cave's entrance and ran south, close to the cave's west wall, 56 m to a corner at the widest part of the entrance. Line 2 began approximately 25 m south of the entrance and ran south down the middle of the passage 56 m to a large breakdown pile. Lines 1 and 2 used 56 electrodes spaced at 1-m intervals. Line 3 followed the cave's east wall, beginning 45 m from the entrance and extending 80 m southeast to the end of the cave. Its 84 electrodes were placed at 0.95-m intervals ( fig. 20). One three-dimensional survey was conducted at the back of the cave below the mine shaft. The electrodes were placed at 2-m intervals in a 14-by 12-m grid; a larger grid with 1-m spacing was initially planned but abandoned due to damage to some of the resistivity cables. The powdery nature of the guano cast some concern on the feasibility of conducting an effective resistivity survey. The contact resistance could have been too high to yield meaningful results. To maximize electrical transmission into the guano, the 46-cm long electrodes were pushed as deep into the guano as possible, some of them to their full lengths. Saline water was poured onto electrodes showing high contact resistance during testing prior to starting the survey, which reduced contact resistance for most but not all such electrodes. In the end, the results proved acceptable and better than expected. The purpose of the close electrode spacing was to maximize the resolution of the survey to detect breakdown hidden in the guano that could interfere with coring. The expected stratigraphic sequence was guano, interlaced with breakdown, underlain by a thick section of breakdown. Although the thickness of the breakdown could be estimated, using Natural Bridge Caverns as an analogue, there was no model to estimate the depth of the guano. Line 2 was imaged to a depth of about 15 m and was interpreted to show a considerable mix of breakdown and guano. Lines 1 and 3 were imaged to depths of about 18 m and showed areas with less breakdown, more conducive to coring. Figure 20 shows the results of the Line 3 survey. (The results of the other surveys are not shown in this report because the research is ongoing.) The warmer colors correlate to buried breakdown; the cooler colors indicate guano. As guano decomposes, it develops a clay-like composition with lower resistivity. The lowest resistivity values occur under the mine shaft where water drips regularly, lowering the resistivity even further. While this location seems optimal for coring, it is also the area excavated by guano miners to an estimated depth of 9-18 m, so most or all of the guano in that area is recent and probably of little paleoenvironmental value. The abrupt transitions in resistivity at that location likely reflect the excavated pit. The area about 48 m from the start of the Line 3 survey was identified as a better coring location. The results that the guano was at least 18 m deep left the main question unanswered-how deep is the guano? NCKRI returned to the cave 2 years later, in January 2016, and conducted two additional surveys. The 2014 surveys were focused on trying to find buried breakdown to avoid, as well as establishing the guano's depth. The 2016 survey focused on depth. The goal was to see through the guano and breakdown, and continue deeper through the sediment that probably underlies the breakdown to the floor of the original solutionally formed cave passage. Natural Bridge Caverns again served as a model to estimate target depths, except that the elevation and stratigraphic position of its solutionally formed bedrock floor are unknown. The deepest levels of that cave are covered in thick mud of unknown depth. The 2016 surveys consisted of two lines. Both used 112 electrodes at 2-m spacing. Both lines were surveyed twice, once in a dipole-dipole configuration and then again in a pole-dipole configuration with the infinity electrode placed about 700 m to the north along BCI's property line to increase the depth of penetration. The results were merged for a more complete and detailed image and interpretation. The first 56 m of Line 5 used the even-numbered electrode positions of Line 1 and then continued out of the east side of the cave's entrance and onto the surface. Line 6 could not overlap Line 3, due to the curvature of the cave wall, but ran subparallel to that line from the back of the cave and out of the west side of the entrance. These surveys indicated the guano reaches a maximum depth of about 35 m to breakdown, which continues at least 20 m deeper. The original cave floor was not apparent, but this is based on a morphologic interpretation of the resistivity values. Presumably due to rainfall only a few days before the 2016 surveys, the resistivity values were similar for areas of known bedrock and breakdown and the two could not be distinguished. A return trip is planned when conditions are drier to provide more contrasts in the data, and with the resistivity array deployed to \"see\" deeper into the cave floor."}, {"section_title": "Guano Sampling", "text": "A guano sampling project currently underway at Southwest Research Institute aims to collect and examine bat guano cores from Bracken Bat Cave, and test the guano for chemical and other constituents that could be used to indicate the frequency, duration, and intensity of historical drought periods. Sampling campaigns into Bracken Bat Cave using hand-coring methods yielded over 2.7 vertical meters of guano sample material. Guano sample tubes are currently being sub-sampled and analyzed in the laboratory. Analysis of data collected will be correlated to established climatic variations to assess frequency, duration, and intensity of drought in south-central Texas. If determination of the regional paleoclimate is successful, historical groundwater recharge could be estimated using empirical relationships between precipitation and recharge. Future precipitation and drought cycles would then be predicted using historical climate frequency, duration, and intensity estimates, and future recharge estimates could be calculated using the predicted climatic conditions and the newly developed precipitation/recharge relationships."}]
