We controlled the level of subtyping using \u03b3 regularization parameter 8 , similarly to the hierarchical clustering method that chooses a cutoff value of similarity to control the number of clusters. With smaller value of the regularization parameter we can obtain less number of subtypes. In our experiments, we controlled it to obtain three subtypes based on the previous post-mortem study 9 . Since effects of the parameter depend on the number of subjects, the values were differently chosen for two datasets (the SMC dataset: 0.9, the ADNI validation dataset: 0.93). In the ADNI validation dataset, the unknown subtype existed consistently with variable \u03b3 values. This unknown group shows very low cortical atrophy level which is also distinguishable to the other types in the ADNI validation dataset (Supplementary Figure S4) . Though we excluded this group in this study, further investigation of this group is also an intriguing issue."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Method", "text": "Subject recruitment and MR image acquisition of the SMC dataset.

In order to minimize the effect of factors contributing to cortical atrophy other than Alzheimer etiology, we limited the participants to those with minimal white matter T1 weighted MRI data was recorded using the following imaging parameters: 1 mm sagittal slice thickness, over-contiguous slices with 50% overlap; no gap; repetition time (TR) of 9.9 ms; echo time (TE) of 4.6 ms; flip angle of 8\u02da; and matrix size of 240\u00d7240 pixels, reconstructed to 480\u00d7480 over a 240 mm field-ofview.\nSubjects and MR image acquisition of the ADNI validation dataset.

Further subject selection strategies applied to the ADNI validation dataset was similar to the aforementioned criteria used in the SMC dataset. Among those diagnosed as probable AD dementia fulfilling the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria 10 , we included the patients with CDR-SB\u22644 (very mild AD) and those with MMSE<27 [11] [12] [13] [14] . To exclude patients with cortical atrophy affected by non-AD pathology such as vascular factors, we further limited to patients with the volume of WMH<1.5mL. As a result, a total of 131 probable AD patients were included in this study. Moreover, 158 age, gender, and education level matched normal elderly were used as a control group.\nT1-weighted MR images were obtained using a standardized 1.

We corrected for age, gender and education level in this analysis; those measures differed between subtypes ( Table   1 & Supplementary Table S1 ). Since our subtyping methods clustered subjects based on the cortical atrophy pattern not the level of overall cortical thinning, the distribution of cortical atrophy of each vertice did not follow the normal distribution. Thus we visualized the median of cortical atrophy as a cortical atrophy map in Permutation-based ANCOVA. We employed permutation-based ANCOVA for three groups, controlling for the effects of age, gender and education years. Specifically, we re-populated the dataset N-1 times using random reassignment (permutation) of all subjects into one of three groups under the assumption of full exchangeability, keeping the number of subjects in each group, where N is the number of permutations. We then computed Fvalues for the original assignment and N-1 permuted sets through a simple ANCOVA, which forms a null distribution of F-values. Finally, we estimated the significance level of group difference by a fraction of the occurrence whose F-values were not less than the F-value of the original assignment. We used 10,000 as N. We also performed the pairwise comparisons using the permutation based ANCOVA and the FDR procedure.\nPermutation testing for similarity matrix. We used permutation testing for similarity matrix to assert how the current modular organization is significant. It is based on the fact that the average within-group similarity is larger than the average between-group similarity if the distinction between groups were clear enough 35 .\nSpecifically, we re-populated the dataset N-1 times using random re-assignment (permutation) of all subjects into one of groups, where N is the number of permutations. We used the average within-group similarity subtracted by average between-group similarity as a representative statistics. Thus we computed this value for the original assignment and N-1 permuted sets, which forms a null distribution of the representative statistics.\nThen we estimated the significance level by a fraction of the occurrence whose representative statistics were not less than the representative statistics of the original assignment. We used 10,000 as N.\nWe also used this method to evaluate how the clustering was similar between datasets. We computed the similarity matrix between subjects in the SMC dataset and subjects in the ADNI validation dataset. Then we computed a representative statistics as the average similarity between subjects of a certain subtype in the SMC dataset and subjects of the same subtype in the ADNI validation dataset subtracted by average similarity of the Abbreviations -AD= Alzheimer's disease; MT subtype = medial temporal-predominant subtype; P subtype = parietal-predominant subtype; D subtype = diffuse atrophy subtype; K-MMSE = Korean Version of mini-mental state examination (scored out of 30); CDR = Clinical dementia rating; CDR-SB = CDR sum of boxes (scored out of 18).
