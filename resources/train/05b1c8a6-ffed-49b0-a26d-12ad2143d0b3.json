[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In November, 2008, eight-year-old Christian Romero was charged with the shooting deaths of his father and another man, Tim Romans, at the Romero home in rural Apache County, Arizona. 1 These shocking events drew national and worldwide attention, 2 primarily because of the child's age. Another attentiongetting angle was the rural locale: St. Johns, Arizona, a town of about 3500 residents 3 and the county seat of Apache County, a vast, sparsely populated county of 70,000. 4 A New York Times reporter described St. Johns as \"a windy hamlet of horse ranches, low-slung houses and double-wide trailers about 170 miles eastnortheast of Phoenix. The largest buildings are a few churches and schools along the single main road, which has no stoplights.\" 5 Not discussed in the media, however, was the strain that trying the case against young Christian Romero would put on the local government budget. Indeed, that strain may have influenced the case's disposition. In an early hearing, the juvenile court judge expressed dismay at the high cost of providing professional mental health services for the boy. 6 Just three months after the killings, Christian Romero pled guilty to negligent homicide in the death of Tim Romans, and the State dropped the charges against him for his father's death. 7 The financial challenge facing Apache County if it tried a double-murder case-particularly one against a juvenile-is not unique among Arizona counties. In Arizona, the primary funding source for the local court system, the County  2009), available at http://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/docs/Default.aspx (reporting a request was for purely therapeutic services that would be confidential and could not be used in the proceedings against Romero). 7.

The judge who accepted the plea was subsequently removed from the sentencing phase of the Romero matter when he indicated that that he would revoke the plea deal. Both the judge's comments and media coverage of the matter included many references to the expense of keeping the boy in Apache County, where costs associated with the case would have continued to be borne by the county. from state to state and even from county to county within a given state, a wide array of problems has been identified. Among these are underfunding; failure to limit caseloads; insufficient attorney autonomy; lack of ancillary services such as investigators and experts; and lawyers who are ill-prepared and unsupervised. 16 This Article explores legal remedies for spatial inequalities in the provision of indigent defense with particular attention to differences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties. We first address whether an equal protection challenge may be viable when a state's indigent defense system is adequate in some places, but not in others. We then consider ways in which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause might provide a remedy for inferior indigent defense systems in Arizona's more rural counties. We thus present the legal basis for a claim that, where spatial inequality in the provision of indigent defense services creates a likelihood of inadequate counsel, the result may be a violation of either or both the Sixth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. 17 Courts have rarely considered place-to-place variability in access to indigent defense services, 18 and they have not analyzed indigent defense systems through the critical lens of spatial inequality or, in particular, in relation to the rural-urban axis. Courts have focused exclusively on adequacy, ignoring parity or relative equality. We assert, however, that an equal protection violation should be a viable claim in response to significant place-to-place variability in expenditures for these services when underfunding puts delivery of constitutionally adequate representation at serious risk."}, {"section_title": "16.", "text": "See infra Part II.C (detailing these problems)."}, {"section_title": "17.", "text": "Spatial inequality in the provision of indigent services creating a likelihood of inadequate counsel could also run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Arizona Constitution, titled \"Equal privileges and immunities.\" That provision states: \"No law shall be enacted granting to any citizen, class of citizens, or corporation other than municipal, privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens or corporations.\" ARIZ. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 13. Alternatively, a provision of the Arizona Constitution that prohibits \"local or special laws\" might be relevant. It applies to a number of matters including \"Regulating the practice of courts of justice\"; \"punishment of crimes and misdemeanors\"; and \"assessment and collection of taxes\". ARIZ. CONST. art.

See infra notes 89-104, 414-29 and accompanying text (discussing Smith). As this Article goes to press in April 2010, however, the New York Supreme Court is considering a class action challenge to the constitutionality of its indigent defense system. Equal protection lawsuits that challenge county-to-county variations in indigent defense have generally been successful where plaintiffs are attorneys conscripted into serving as defense counsel. In addition, counsel who have sought relief from very heavy caseloads have succeeded on Sixth Amendment grounds. 20 A class challenge brought by indigent defendants seeking prospective injunctive relief, rather than reversal of individual case outcomes can also achieve systemic change. 21 Individual indigent defendants challenging their representation have typically been less successful. 22 Where they have succeeded, decisions have been based on findings of inadequacy of a particular defendant's representation. 23 We illustrate how a case challenging the constitutionality of some counties' indigent defense systems might be argued and established. Our analysis could be applied to the public defender systems of any of the eighteen states that finance indigent defense solely or primarily at the county level, and perhaps to other states' systems as well. We use specific data from Arizona to demonstrate how and why nonmetropolitan counties are disadvantaged in their quest to provide legal assistance to indigent criminal defendants. Our analysis illustrates how financing indigent defense systems at the county level leaves less affluent and/or more sparsely populated counties less able to afford the costs associated with sound and vigorous defense. This is evident when cases require extended trials and significant ancillary services, although underfunding has consequences for the handling of more mundane criminal matters, too. In the context of this analysis, we also consider briefly how rural spatiality can complicate and increase the cost of providing indigent defense services. We are unable to provide a complete data portrait because of differences in accounting, reporting, and availability of information among Arizona counties. Nevertheless, the county-level data we present suggest dramatic disparities among counties, particularly across the rural-urban axis. This data could be the basis for an equal protection claim. It shows how nonmetropolitan counties can become justice deserts 24 -places where justice is inferior or hard to come by-because of inadequate funding of indigent defense. As an alternative or companion to an equal protection claim, we argue that Sixth Amendment focus on adequacy could also provide a remedy based on a comparison among indigent defense systems. That is, when metropolitan indigent 19. See infra Part I."}, {"section_title": "20.", "text": "See, e.g., Zarabia v.

When nonmetropolitan indigent defense systems fall far short of those funding levels and lack critical institutional safeguards present in metropolitan systems, the nonmetropolitan schemes are necessarily inadequate. By focusing on the potential and actual structural problems of indigent defense in rural areas, our intention is not to say that metropolitan counties are performing as well as they should with respect to the provision of indigent defense, or even that they meet the Sixth Amendment adequacy standard. 25 Rather, we look for ways in which metropolitan public defense systems feature safeguardsincluding higher levels of funding-that better protect the rights of indigent defendants. We do so to inform how nonmetropolitan systems might be improved. We envision county-based, legislative and judicial remedies to the problems we identify. Such remedies might respond to litigation, initiated by criminal defense counsel and/or civil rights litigators, that identifies inadequacies and inequalities among county-based systems. The data we present indicate gross disparities in funding for indigent defense among counties. This data could be the basis for finding a constitutional violation in some nonmetropolitan jurisdictions. 26 In Part I, we explore the relationships among uneven development and spatial inequality concepts, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and equal protection law. Part II illustrates the consequences of uneven development and local funding on delivery of indigent defense. This Part demonstrates how Arizona's scheme for financing local government creates inequalities among counties-inequalities that enormously influence the funding of indigent defense services and result in significant variations from county to county. We illustrate these inequalities by examining the demographic and economic situations of two metropolitan counties (Maricopa and Coconino) and three nonmetropolitan counties (Navajo, Apache, and Greenlee). 27 Here we compare relative levels of"}, {"section_title": "25.", "text": "A claim based solely on the fact that the specific form by which indigent defense is provided in one area is different from another is also unlikely to be a basis for a challenge.

As a general matter, none of these systems is necessarily deficient. See generally Floyd F. Feeney & Patrick G.

Part III details proposed reform of Arizona's system for funding indigent defense. In particular, we advocate centralized funding that would allow Arizona's less affluent counties to provide the caliber of defense that the U.S. Constitution requires-a defense system funded in a way that levels the playing field among indigent defendants across the metro-nonmetro divide by raising it through increased state funding overall.

As explained in more detail in Part II.B, we also use the USDA's Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to express more precisely the degree of a place's urbanicity or rurality. Regarding the time period examined, we have, to the extent possible, looked at county and caseload data for FY 2009, which in Arizona runs from July 2008 to June 2009. For the most part, we have matched this fiscal data with 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data, the most recent demographic and economic data available. In some instances, however, the most recent economic data available is for a different period. For example, the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data for retail sales is from 2002, so we have relied on that data as the best indicator we have of retail economic activity during the period we examine. 28.

As a result of uneven development, location dictates employment and other market-related opportunities. 33 Depending on the level or scale of financing, uneven development can also result in spatial inequality in terms of access to government services. 34 The capacity of local governments to deliver services varies across the nation, as well as within any given state. Rural areas face particular challenges in this regard, 35 challenges that stem in part from a relative absence of development 36 and a consequent lack of private wealth. 37 The fiscal capacity of a local government to generate tax revenue is indicated by residents' per capita income, 38 making the local labor market a key predictor of a county's or municipality's fiscal capacity. 39 Limited local labor markets translate into small public coffers for local 31.

Further, state and local governments historically have not been as vigilant as the federal government in protecting civil liberties. 44 To make matters worse, spatial inequalities at the county level have been aggravated in recent years due to devolution-the shifting of governmental responsibility from the federal to the state level. 45 Higher levels of government have a greater capacity to smooth out economic inequalities by collecting taxes from both highly developed and relatively undeveloped places-often affluent and relatively impoverished, respectively. 46 States may ameliorate the public spending consequences of uneven"}, {"section_title": "40.", "text": "See COONS ET AL., supra note 34 (linking private wealth with the quality of public education when funding for the latter is based on local tax revenue); Robert P.

In San Antonio Independent Schools v. Rodriguez, for example, the Court held that children whose schools received less funding than others because of a school finance scheme that relied heavily on local property tax revenue-essentially children living in poor neighborhoods-were not a discrete and insular minority such that strict scrutiny should be applied in considering the constitutionality of the funding scheme. 55 In spite of a lack of judicial concern regarding equal protection as it relates to spatiality, courts have occasionally considered whether differences in rural and urban places justify different laws, legal treatment, or legal institutions. 56 Some cases grappling with equal protection and the rural-urban axis have involved administration of justice issues. Courts have typically been deferential to state and local governments by holding that differences between rural and urban places justify different justice systems. 57 In North v. Russell, the Supreme Court held that equal protection was not violated by a state law that created two types of police court, depending on the population of the area served. 58 The law required police when the city boundaries of Tuskegee, Alabama were redrawn to exclude them); White v.

The North Court thus did not require equality at the municipal court level because it permitted municipalities to provide different judicial services based on city size and resources. In this sense, the North decision is similar to that judges in larger cities to be lawyers, while those in less populous areas need not be. 59 Police court decisions were subject to de novo review by a circuit court as a matter of right. 60 The Court engaged in an apparent rational basis analysis of the equal protection question, reasoning that \"all people within a given city and within cities of the same size are treated equally.\" 61 The rational basis for the distinction between rural and urban appeared to be that larger cities had greater financial resources and/or more ready availability of lawyers to serve as police judges. 62 Another group of rural-urban axis equal protection cases also involved the administration of justice-in particular, the provision of indigent defense. In these cases, one group of rural residents-individual indigent defense attorneyshad considerable success in eliciting court solicitude and obtaining a remedy. By attacking systems that conscripted attorneys to provide indigent defense in less populous counties while using Public Defenders' Offices in urban counties, rural attorneys prevailed by convincing courts that the greater burden they carried for providing indigent defense-as compared to their metropolitan/urban counterparts-constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 63 in Rodriguez, which also did not require spatial equality among government services and, indeed, expressly sanctioned different quality of services based on variations in private wealth.

Indeed, some commentators have suggested that equal protection violations should be recognized when the violation stems from place-to-place variation in provision of services that implicate fundamental rights. 64 In particular, Gerald L. Neuman calls for what he labels \"fundamental rights equal protection,\" 65 and he provides a framework for equal protection analysis of \"territorial discrimination\" involving fundamental rights. Professor Neuman argues for heightened scrutiny of state revenue schemes that rely heavily on local tax structures to finance public services that implicate fundamental rights. 66 \"If there is a fundamental right in the equal protection sense to receive some government benefit or service,\" Professor Neuman asserts, \"then to the extent that substantial inequalities going to the essence of the right would result from unequal constraints on the revenue-raising abilities of local government units,\" heightened scrutiny should apply. 67 Among fundamental rights to which this analysis could apply, Professor Neuman specifically mentions \"rights to counsel.\" 68 Indeed, various U.S. Supreme Court decisions have discussed the links between equal protection and the operation of the criminal justice system.

Both equal protection and due process emphasize the central aim of our entire judicial system-all people charged with crime must, so far as the law is concerned, \"stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court.\" 70 The importance of the Equal Protection Clause in the Sixth Amendment context first came to the fore in Griffin in relation to indigent defendants' access to appellate review. 71 The Griffin Court held that \"the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses protect persons like petitioners from invidious discriminations\" throughout all stages of a criminal proceeding. 72 The Court reasoned that \"[t]here can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has.\" 73 Three years later, in Burns v. Ohio, the Court held that a state law requiring the payment of a filing fee in order to perfect a criminal appeal also had \"no place in our heritage of Equal Justice Under Law.\" 74 In 1961, in Smith v. Bennett, the Court relied on the equal protection principles articulated in Griffin and Burns to strike down a law denying the writ of habeas corpus to defendants who could not pay a $4.00 filing fee. 75 In determining that imposition of the fee violated equal protection, the Smith Court noted that \"the Fourteenth Amendment weighs the interests of rich and poor criminals in equal scale, and its hand extends as far to each.\" 76"}, {"section_title": "69.", "text": "Coppedge v.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees that in \"all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . Together, these four cases place the right to counsel squarely within the realm of cases involving fundamental rights, which merit heightened scrutiny when an equal protection violation is alleged. 80 At first glance, this protection is inferior to that established by the Sixth Amendment itself, given that the Court has ruled that denying the poor access to the courts or to counsel in situations where the Sixth Amendment attaches is a per se constitutional violation. For example, the Court undertook no review of the interests of the state in Griffin or Gideon, finding that the denial of Sixth Amendment protections were in and of themselves invidious discrimination. 81 As the Court summarized in Mayer v. City of Chicago, which extended Griffin to petty offenses: Griffin does not represent a balance between the needs of the accused and the interests of society; its principle is a flat prohibition against pricing indigent defendants out of as effective [a criminal process] as would be available to others able to pay their own way. The invidiousness of the discrimination that exists when criminal procedures are made available only to those who can pay is not erased by any differences in the sentence that may be imposed. that provided free transcripts to indigent defendants only in cases where a defendant could be subject to incarceration, reasoning that the state could not justifiably deny an indigent person an adequate record from which to appeal a conviction); see also M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 110-11, 124 (explaining that its \"cases solidly establish\" an \"exception[] to that general rule\" that rational basis review be applied, so that \"access to judicial processes in cases Nevertheless, employing an equal protection challenge-in addition to one based on the Sixth Amendment-may allow a broader attack than that based solely on a Sixth Amendment claim. 83 For example, in a class action challenging an entire defense system-which is largely our focus here-an equal protection challenge is not just complementary to the Sixth Amendment; it may also justify the plaintiffs' reliance on a wider array of precedent than would a challenge based entirely on the Sixth Amendment. 84 The Court has viewed the question of equal protection in the Sixth Amendment context as one comparing rich and poor individuals. 85 More precisely, cases compare individuals with sufficient funds to pay for their own defense with indigent defendants who must rely on the state to provide that service. Our analysis similarly compares the rich and poor, but at a scale higher than that of the individual. We compare degrees of affluence and their consequences for indigent defense at the county level. We recognize that the Court has rejected this analysis in some contexts. In Salsburg v. Maryland, for example, the Court applied the rational basis test in upholding territorial variations in whether illegally seized evidence was admissible. The Court wrote, \"[T]he Equal Protection Clause relates to equality between persons as such rather than between areas.\" 86 Professor Neuman criticizes Salsburg as resting on an outdated notion. He refers to the \"equality between persons \u2026 rather than between areas\" language as a \"popular new epigram\" that is not well grounded. 87 Our argument that heightened scrutiny should apply to spatial inequality when the fundamental right to counsel is at stake similarly discounts decisions such as Salsburg. We assert that examining inequality at the county level is appropriate because it is the county level of government that is charged with providing indigent defense services, in terms of both funding and means of delivery. Some counties' tax bases generate more income than others, leaving poor counties with far inferior capacities to provide this service. A claim based on the disparity between the quality of public defense services provided to poor people in rural counties and the quality of those services provided to poor people in urban counties is thus appropriate. Cases such as Salsburg fail to acknowledge extreme income inequality among areas, which can easily doom any approximation of parity-let alone literal equality-among individuals receiving locally funded services in and from local government units. In short, the fiscal capacity of the county to provide services has consequences for individual residents. As Professor Neuman has argued, the \"state should not be able to escape responsibility for its unequal fiscal endowment of its\" local government units. 88 At first blush, the Arizona Supreme Court appears to have rejected equal protection as the basis for challenging the provision of rural indigent defense due to significant variations among counties. In State v. Smith, 89 the court examined an individual defendant's equal protection challenge regarding the adequacy of rural indigent defense. It compared Mohave County's system of contracting for indigent defense services with the systems used by other Arizona counties. 90 At the time, Mohave County awarded public defense contracts to the lowest bidders without limiting caseloads or considering access, qualification, or complexity issues. 91 The Smith court did not grant relief to the individual defendant, determining that there was not a sufficient showing that his counsel was ineffective. 92 The court held, however, that Mohave's public defense system was troubling enough to warrant an inference that \"the adequacy of representation is adversely affected by the system.\" 93 The court also observed that Mohave's system was \"the least desirable [among the counties] and can result in inadequate representation by counsel.\" 94 But the court stopped short of holding that Mohave County's deficiencies violated equal protection principles. 95 The court reasoned: As long as there is adequate representation for each defendant it is immaterial whether the system in one county is better or worse than the system in another, and we know of no case in which the variance in quality of representation from county to county within a state has been held to constitute a violation of equal protection of law. 96 In reaching this conclusion, the Smith court relied on the notion that the Equal Protection Clause does not require territorial uniformity. 97 It relied on Salsburg's \"popular new epigram,\" in a particularly uncritical fashion. Instead of acknowledging the links between equal protection and cases such as Gideon, Griffin, and their progeny, the Smith court relied on McGowan v. Maryland, a case upholding Sunday closure laws that applied in some parts of the state but not in others. 98 The Smith court appeared not to recognize that the Sixth Amendment issues are far weightier than the implications of laws which limit what people can buy on a given day of the week. The court apparently did not consider the argument for heightened scrutiny when territorial discrimination implicates a fundamental right. 99 Putting aside for a moment the shaky foundation of the Smith court's equal protection analysis, the opinion nevertheless does not foreclose an equal protection challenge that compares the quality of indigent defense systems from one territorial unit to another. Even if the court was correct that being the least effective system was in and of itself an insufficient basis for an equal protection finding, 100 an equal protection challenge is tenable when a state's system for providing indigent defense results in constitutionally inadequate representation in some jurisdictions. Local funding of representation, which can result in county-tocounty variability is one cause of such inadequacies. Further, Smith provides strategic guidance for future challenges to Arizona's indigent defense system. The plaintiff in Smith challenged his individual conviction, requiring him to meet the onerous two-prong standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington: (1) that the attorney's \"performance was deficient\" and (2) \"that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" 101 In contrast, a class action that seeks prospective relief rather than the overturning of a conviction need not meet the Strickland test. 102 [The Strickland] standard is inappropriate for a civil suit seeking prospective relief. The sixth amendment protects rights that do not affect the outcome of a trial. Thus, deficiencies that do not meet the \"ineffectiveness\" standard may nonetheless violate a defendant's rights under the sixth amendment. In the post-trial context, such errors may be deemed harmless because they did not affect the outcome of the trial. Whether an accused has been prejudiced by the denial of a right is an issue that relates to relief-whether the defendant is entitled to have his or her conviction overturned-rather than to the question of whether such a right exists and can be protected prospectively. 103 Therefore, to successfully challenge the provision of rural indigent defense resulting from county-based underfunding, plaintiffs would have the burden of showing \"the likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury and the inadequacy of remedies at law\" 104 as a result of the deficiency in funding. Given the Smith court's willingness to order prospective, systemic relief, an equal protection challenge (likely in conjunction with a Sixth Amendment challenge) would be viable upon a showing that the expenditure of significantly less money on indigent defense in some Arizona counties than in others will result in a likelihood of ineffective assistance of counsel."}, {"section_title": "II. JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY IN ARIZONA", "text": "As Stephen Holmes and Cass Sunstein wrote in The Cost of Rights, \"A legal right exists, in reality, only when and if it has budgetary costs.\" 105 Certainly, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel creates real fiscal burdens. Indeed, it is widely accepted that the indigent defense crisis is caused by the failure of government at all levels-local, state, and federal-to ensure adequate funding for public defense systems. 106 This crisis is particularly dire in states where counties bear the burden of paying for indigent defense from limited county coffers. In its 2009 Justice Denied report, the Constitution Project observed: As numerous statewide indigent defense studies have shown, when counties primarily fund indigent defense, there are certain to be inequities among the locally funded systems. Inevitably, urban counties have far more cases than rural counties and are often overburdened. At the same time, a rural county, with fewer resources, may be financially crippled by the need to fund the defense of a single serious homicide case. 107 In Arizona, the vast majority of revenue used to provide indigent defense comes from counties, with the state paying little more than the proverbial drop in the bucket. 108 In fiscal year 2005, for example, the total cost of indigent defense in Arizona was nearly $104 million. 109 County budgets contributed more than 99% of this sum (about $103 million), while the State paid only about three-quarters of a percent ($802,900). 110 Arizona is one of the states hardest hit financially when it comes to providing indigent defense services. 111 The heavy burden placed on counties to fund indigent services is no doubt one very significant aspect of that problem. When a higher scale of government levies taxes, it can rely on a broader range \"of progressive tax instruments across all regions and economic sectors\" to generate revenue and then distribute it according to need. 112 By leaving the funding of indigent defense to counties, the State of Arizona can essentially ignore the revenue and cost implications of the federal constitutional mandate to provide this service. Instead of drawing on the State's considerable tax base-much of it concentrated in urban areas-to ensure that indigent defense is adequately funded across the entire state, 113 Arizona leaves counties to rely on their own tax bases, which are sometimes quite small. In this Part, we explain Arizona's local and state funding mechanisms for indigent defense in order to set the stage for our spatial inequality analysis. We then closely examine indigent defense funding and services in five Arizona counties that run the gamut from most urban to most rural to illustrate the consequences of spatial inequality by considering several deficiencies in the provision of indigent defense-deficiencies that could be cured with a higher level of funding. While these deficiencies have been litigated on some basis in Arizona in the past, we assert they have the potential to arise again due to Arizona's reliance on local funding and the increasing place-based economic stratification in the State. Finally, we consider how funding disparities might form the basis for an equal protection claim related to the provision of indigent defense services. We model a claim based on funding that varies dramatically from county to county."}, {"section_title": "A. The Funding and Provision of Indigent Defense in Arizona", "text": "The State of Arizona confers on each county the authority to decide how it will provide indigent defense services. 114 As a result, counties varyingly use Public Defenders, appointed counsel, and/or contract counsel, either solely or in some combination. 115 The state authorizes each county to establish a Public Defender's Office and appoint a Public Defender, 116 but only ten of Arizona's fifteen counties do so. 117 Many of these counties also have an \"alternative to the Public Defender's office\"-usually called the Legal Defender-for cases with multiple defendants and others in which a conflict of interest may exist. 118 Counties with high volumes of indigent defense cases may also have institutions such as Maricopa  sometimes employing attorneys on a case-by-case basis, and sometimes both. 121 The Arizona Criminal Justice Commission (ACJC) observes that the counties without a Public Defender are \"generally the smaller rural counties,\" and that hiring attorneys on a contract basis \"may save on overhead costs.\" 122 Five counties currently use contract attorneys exclusively to provide indigent defense: Apache, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, and Santa Cruz. 123 Arizona law makes a couple of key distinctions between counties with Public Defenders and those without. First, counties with Public Defenders receive training funds from the state, while those using other means of delivering indigent defense services do not. 124 Second, the state imposes certain reporting requirements on Public Defenders that it does not impose on any equivalent or related individuals or institutions in counties without Public Defenders. 125 These include a requirement to track the cost per case defended, which necessarily requires an accurate count of cases handled. Counties with Public Defenders are thus both better supported by the State and, at least in theory, better monitored by the State. While these laws help explain some of the differences among counties' indigent defense delivery systems, the more significant source of spatial inequalities lies in the nature and value of various county government funding sources. These sources include the tax revenue streams by which county governments raise general fund revenues, from which some 99% of indigent defense costs are paid. They also include funds earmarked for indigent defense, most prominently a type of special fund called \"Fill the Gap\" (FTG), which is comprised primarily of fine and fee revenue levied on court filings at both the appellate (state) and superior (local) court level."}, {"section_title": "County Funding", "text": "Most funding for indigent defense comes from a given county's primary operating fund, 126 typically called the general fund. 127 The greatest portion of the revenue stream for a county's general fund comes, in turn, from local property 127.

Nonmetropolitan counties also tend to have lower retail sales per capita, in part because their residents are typically less affluent and, in part, because some types of economically significant retail transactions, e.g., auto sales, are concentrated in metropolitan counties. Finally, nonmetropolitan places tend to have lower property tax valuations than metropolitan counties because of the lack of private wealth that accompanies the low level of development in rural areas. In addition to distributing a share of the state sales tax revenue to the counties, the state also distributes to county governments a share of auto licensing fees, the amount determined by a formula indexed to county population. 134  fees from various licenses and permits, including those associated with buildings, businesses, and zoning, constitute significant revenues in some counties. In addition, Arizona counties receive various federal transfers, including some earmarked funds for health and human services and law enforcement initiatives. These transfers also include Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT), which are a type of general fund revenue intended to compensate counties for the presence of public lands, which are not subject to local property tax. 136 Each county's general fund is used to pay for a wide array of services. These include public safety, probation services, parks and recreation, planning and development, public health, elections, and environmental services. 137 They also include the County Attorney, the Superior Court, and indigent defense. Some earmarked funding for indigent defense is also generated locally, through court fees. Specifically, Arizona Revised Statute section 41-2421(C) provides that \"five per cent of any monies collected by the Superior Court, including the clerk of the court and the justice courts in each county for the payment of filing fees, including clerk fees, diversion fees, adult and juvenile probation fees, juvenile monetary assessments, fines, penalties, surcharges, sanctions and forfeitures\" go to the county treasurer. 138 By statute, the county treasurer allocates 20.53% of these monies to indigent defense. 139 In theory, then, the greater the level of court activity, the greater the pool of local FTG fine revenue available for use by indigent defense and other functions."}, {"section_title": "135.", "text": "These vary from about $243,000 in Apache County to more than $43 million in Maricopa Coconino County is the only county among the five we examined to show a line item in its budget for this levy on fines and local court filings.

In fiscal year 2009, the legislature appropriated slightly more than $150,000 for this \"rural\" funding stream. 165 Even though these funds are paid only to Arizona's less densely populated counties, the amounts disbursed are de minimis. For example, Greenlee County, the state's least populous county with about 8000 residents, 166 received approximately 0.5% of the total RSAID appropriation-only $870-for fiscal year 2009. 167 The ACJC distributes SAIDF and RSAID funds to the various counties according to a composite index formula set forth by statute. 168 The amount of SAIDF funding that each county gets is a function of (1) felony caseload, in particular a given county's percentage of the state's total felony filings, and (2) population or, more specifically, the percentage of the state's population residing in the particular county. 169 Under the FTG distribution formula, the higher the total percentage (or index) for the population and felony filing metrics, the greater the amount of money the county receives.

The population figure is a clear proxy for urbanicity, at least as defined by the ecological metric of population size. To some extent, the felony caseload figure is also a proxy for urbanicity. This is because more populous counties are likely to experience more felonies in terms of raw numbers, even if their per capita crime rates are lower than nonmetropolitan counties. 170 In fact, felony filings per 1000 residents are as high or higher in several of Arizona's nonmetropolitan counties as in urban Maricopa County, 171 but this does not lead to a significant increase in the FTG funds that flow to the high-crime nonmetropolitan counties. Further, the FTG funding formula's reliance on felony counts, to the neglect of misdemeanors, also appears to disserve nonmetropolitan counties because a great deal of any county's indigent defense budget goes to defense of misdemeanor charges. 172 In particular, the ratio of misdemeanors to felonies appears to be higher in counties with significant American Indian populations, and these counties tend to be nonmetropolitan. It is apparent from looking at the fiscal year 2009 appropriations that the FTG funding formula favors more populous counties. Maricopa County received the greatest amount of FTG indigent defense funding that year, about $540,000, which was entirely from SAIDF, generated by state fine revenue. 173 Greenlee County received the least: $2019, comprised of $870 in RSAID and $1149 in SAIDF. 174 While the FTG formula seems fair in the sense of being proportionate to apparent need, it does not respond to several problems facing many nonmetropolitan counties. These problems include poor tax bases for raising revenue generally; high crime rates and potentially high use of indigent defense services among defendants because of high poverty rates; 175 and increased costs associated with rural spatiality and the markets for professional services.

Spatial Inequality and Indigent Defense: A Comparison of Five Counties", "text": "According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) system for characterizing counties, six Arizona counties are metropolitan, and nine are nonmetropolitan. 176 Among the latter nine, six are micropolitan, 177 a label for a category at the cusp of the metro/nonmetro divide. 178 Just less than 12% of Arizona's residents-about 600,000 persons-live in places that are \"nonmetropolitan\" under the OMB's definition. 179 About the same number reside in places that are \"rural\" according to the U.S. Census Bureau standard: population clusters with 2500 or fewer residents or are in open space. 180 The broad metro-nonmetro binary aside, Arizona's counties also run a more nuanced gamut from highly urban to very rural. 181  178. Micropolitan counties are nonmetro counties with a population cluster between 10,000 and 50,000 and a surrounding, economically interdependent population of 100,000 or more. See U.S. Dep't of Agric., Econ. Research Serv., Briefing Rooms, Measuring Rurality: What is a Micropolitan Area?, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/ Rurality/MicropolitanAreas (last visited Apr. 12, 2010). The OMB classification scheme further includes six categories within the broad \"nonmetro\" category and three subclassifications within the broad category of \"metro.\" The nonmetro subcategories vary according to the presence and size of urban populations within a given nonmetro county and the county's proximity to a metropolitan area. See U.S. Dep't of Agric. called \"degree of urbanization\") and the proximity to a metropolitan area. 182 At the most urban end are metropolitan counties with populations of one million or more, which are designated \"one.\" At the other end are \"completely rural\" counties, designated \"nine,\" which means they have fewer than 2500 residents in any given population cluster and are not adjacent to a metropolitan county. 183 Because Arizona has relatively few counties and most cover vast areas, many sparsely populated counties are nevertheless contiguous to metropolitan counties, leaving Arizona with no counties at the most rural end of the spectrum as defined by the USDA. As of 2003, only Maricopa County and contiguous Pinal County were designated \"one\" on the Rural-Urban Continuum, as counties \"in a metro area with one million population or more.\" 184 Pima County, home of Tucson, would presumably also now be so categorized based on its 2008 population estimate, which exceeds 1 million. 185 Among Arizona counties, Greenlee is the most rural with a designation of \"seven,\" which is defined as a nonmetropolitan county with an urban population between 2500 and 19,999, which is not adjacent to a To illustrate the phenomenon of spatial inequality with respect to the provision of indigent defense services in Arizona, we compare five counties. 190 We selected counties that represent different points on the Rural-Urban Continuum and feature differing degrees of affluence. In some cases, the selected counties are demographically and economically similar but employ different systems for delivering indigent defense services. We examine Maricopa County, the most urban jurisdiction, and Coconino County, a metropolitan county that until the 2000 census was nonmetropolitan. 191 We also look in detail at three nonmetropolitan counties: Navajo, Apache, and Greenlee. Navajo and Apache counties are economically and demographically similar (with significant American Indian populations and high poverty rates), 192 but we considered both because they use different systems for delivering indigent defense services. Apache and Greenlee were selected because, while they both provide counsel to indigent defendants with contract counsel, Greenlee has a far smaller yet far more affluent population than Apache. We explore whether and how Greenlee's relative affluence might lead it to dedicate greater resources to indigent defense, even as it appears to face greater challenges from an economy-of-scale perspective."}, {"section_title": "Map 1: Arizona Rural-Urban Continuum Codes", "text": "By looking closely at these five counties' financing and provision of indigent defense services, we are in a better position to assess the adequacy of and relative parity among their efforts. This also permits us to assess the best options for nonmetropolitan counties, which are challenged by both spatiality and impediments to achieving economies of scale, to respond to the constitutional requirement that they provide adequate and vigorous defense to indigents charged with crimes. The following sections detail the five counties' demographic and economic profiles. These sections also provide a sense of each county's degree and type of development. In addition to textual descriptions, A caveat regarding these comparisons is necessary. Comparing \"apples to apples\" among Arizona counties is extremely challenging for several reasons. First, counties track and report budgetary and crime data in varying degrees of detail. As a general rule, the more urbanized the county, the greater the detail. For example, Maricopa County is the only county among the five studied that tracks and reports misdemeanor caseloads to the Arizona Supreme Court. 193 Like Maricopa County, Coconino and Navajo counties were also able to provide information about misdemeanor and juvenile caseloads for their Public Defender's and Legal Defenders' Offices. Maricopa County's budget is also far more detailed than, for example, those of Apache or Greenlee counties. designation is three. U.S. Dep't of Agric., Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, supra note 178 (reporting that its 1993 code was five; the 2003 code of three is a county \"in a metropolitan area with fewer than 250,000 population\"). 192. Another challenge to county-to-county comparisons is the significant tribal lands and American Indian populations in several of the counties. The sovereignty of American Indian tribes is a complicating factor in relation to both counties' fiscal circumstances and their criminal justice systems. American Indian lands are not taxed by the state or county, which diminishes the tax bases of counties whose territory overlaps with tribal lands. 194 At the same time, American Indian populations may not be served by county government in all of the ways that non-Indians are served. Tribes provide services to their members, and the federal government also provides supplemental services for American Indian populations. 195 American Indian defendants do not use the services of state justice systems at the same rate as their non-Indian counterparts. American Indians charged with crimes in Indian Country are not subject to the jurisdiction of state courts except in extremely rare circumstances. 196  195. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services directly or through various grants and contracts to the 562 federally recognized tribes. Although tribal self-governance has recently been emphasized, the Bureau still provides an array of services on which Tribes rely. These include training, social services, Indian education, and economic development. The Bureau provides funds directly to tribes to operate schools, empower Indian school boards, and permit local hiring of teachers and staff. In regards to economic development, the Bureau provides funds to assist tribes in accessing energy and mineral resources help tribes stimulate job creation, increase tribal business knowledge, increase business, increase capital investment, and economic development. federal jurisdiction outside Indian Country. 201 Because the Navajo reservation is vast and monolithic, unlike the territorial checkerboards that typically exist where smaller pockets of Indian Country meet state territory elsewhere in the United States, Navajo may come under state court jurisdiction very rarely because they have more opportunities to work as well as to live in Indian Country. Accordingly, when they commit crimes, they are also more likely to do so in Indian Country. Thus, while we initially calculate per capita costs of county government generally and indigent defense systems in particular using counties' entire populations, the presence of significant American Indian populations-as in Coconino, Navajo and Apache Counties-skews both revenue and service consumption data in ways that are impossible to untangle or identify with precision. In an effort to better compare \"apples to apples\" in terms of populations served by state justice systems, we also provide and analyze per capita calculations for some counties based entirely on those counties' non-Indian populations. 202 Just as it is not possible to identify the extent to which American Indians utilize state justice system services, it is also not possible to identify the poverty and unemployment rates among discrete populations in these counties. It would not, in any event, be appropriate to separate Indian and non-Indian populations because they are somewhat enmeshed in terms of funding and service delivery. The counties deliver some services in Indian Country to American Indians, though these services are often financed by the federal government. Apache County, for example, has two administrative service centers on the Navajo Reservation. 203 In addition, both Navajo and Apache counties have justice courts deep in the Navajo Reservation. 204"}, {"section_title": "201.", "text": "The state also has jurisdiction over crimes committed against American Indians when those crimes occur outside Indian Country.

This uneven development produces great disparities in private wealth from place to place. Counties, in turn, experience corresponding spatial inequalities in their capacities to raise revenue and provide services. Retail sales volume, in particular, is highly significant because most counties impose a local sales tax and because a great deal of the revenue that states turn back to the counties is in the form of a shared portion of the state sales tax. 361 Retail sales are higher in metropolitan places because of greater affluence and a wider availability of goods, including big-ticket items. This is reflected in Figure  6, which shows that Maricopa County's 2002 retail sales were $11,370 per person, 362 while Apache County's figure was barely a quarter of that ($2886) and Greenlee County's was only about one-fifth of it ($2203). 363 As reflected in Figure 7, local property tax revenue is similarly likely to be much higher in metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan counties. Counties like Maricopa County tend to have higher property values because metropolitan counties are, by definition, developed, and feature more commercial and residential improvements to land. This is illustrated by reference to the five counties' property tax revenues. While Maricopa, Navajo, and Apache counties all cover similarly vast amounts of territory (between 9000 and 11,000 square miles), Maricopa County levied $456 million in property taxes, while Navajo County levied just $12 million and Apache County only $10.8 million. 364 Even assuming that half of each Navajo and Apache County is untaxed tribal land, property values in Maricopa County nevertheless far exceed those in these relatively undeveloped counties. 365 To add insult to injury for nonmetropolitan counties, property tax revenues are not only a pillar of county general fund revenue, they also influence the distribution of the state sales tax to the counties. 366 Inequalities among Arizona counties' fiscal capacities are thus created and aggravated because of the significance of retail sales and property values, in addition to population, in determining county government funding. Both metrics reflect biases that disserve nonmetropolitan areas, particularly those that are most remote or that have especially low levels of development. Further, the funding formulas do not consider particular challenges to rural service delivery, including spatially dispersed populations and the difficulty of achieving economies of scale. While this property-and sales-tax oriented scheme for funding county government is particularly detrimental to less developed counties, the funding system's links to population make sense at first blush in that counties with high populations need greater revenue to serve more residents. What population-based funding fails to take into account, however, is that every county must provide certain services to its residents. All counties face certain fixed costs, such as those"}, {"section_title": "359.", "text": "See supra notes 132-33 and accompanying text."}, {"section_title": "360.", "text": "See Figures 1, 7."}, {"section_title": "361.", "text": "See supra notes 130-34 and accompanying text."}, {"section_title": "362.", "text": "See Figure 6 (data from U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts)."}, {"section_title": "363.", "text": "Id."}, {"section_title": "364.", "text": "See Figure 7."}, {"section_title": "365.", "text": "See supra note 129 (detailing assessed values of property in various counties). 366.

Because nonmetropolitan counties are often unable to achieve economies of scale in relation to service delivery-and because they are additionally challenged by the spatially dispersed character of their populations-the cost per person of service delivery tends to be much higher than in metropolitan counties. These factors are reflected in the higher per capita costs of county government for those in Arizona's sparsely populated counties. Highly urbanized Maricopa County has by far the largest operating budget of any Arizona county, 368 but as depicted in Figure 10, its per capita expenditures are significantly lower than any of the other four counties studied. While Maricopa County spends $571 per person, tiny Greenlee County spends more than three times that amount, $2056. 369 Between these is Coconino County, which spends twice as much per capita ($1272) as Maricopa, while Navajo ($1072) and Apache ($911) each spends nearly double per capita what Maricopa spends. 370 The per capita spending from each county's general fund varies from a low of $333 in Apache County to a high of $1068 in Greenlee County. Between them are Coconino at $557, Navajo at $420, and Maricopa at $365. 371 The relatively low general fund expenditures in the counties with the greatest American Indian populations-low particularly in relation to their per capita total operating budget expenditures-may reflect the extent to which Apache and Navajo counties' total operating budgets are greatly enhanced by special revenue funding streams from the federal government, funds associated primarily with the American Indian populations. 372 The opportunity for discretionary spending in these counties-spending, for example, on indigent defense services-is thus especially low. In short, the formula by which Arizona finances county government re-creates any given county's private wealth-typically a function of urbanization or some other type of development (e.g., the tourism infrastructure to accompany natural attractions, as in Coconino County)-in that county's public coffers. The funding scheme similarly replicates lack of affluence, as indicated by low incomes and high poverty among the populace, in the public coffers of nonmetropolitan counties. Because funding for county government is not centralized at the state level and therefore not redistributive, rich counties remain rich while poor counties remain poor. It is in the context of these fiscal and structural challenges-not least poor tax bases-that nonmetropolitan counties must provide indigent defense.

The data presented in the prior Sections illustrate the enormously varied capacities of Arizona counties to generate revenue. In light of these structural realities, it is perhaps not surprising that Arizona's nonmetropolitan counties tend to spend significantly less than their metropolitan counterparts on indigent defense. That is, among the nonmetropolitan counties we considered, most spend less on indigent defense as a percentage of their general fund and as a percentage of their entire operating budgets. Most also spend less than their metropolitan counterparts on a per capita basis. Figure 13 shows two calculations for each county: (1) total indigent defense spending as a percentage of total operating budget and (2) indigent defense spending from the general fund as a percentage of the entire general fund. 374 Both calculations show Maricopa County spending the greatest portion of its budget on indigent defense, with Apache County spending the lowest portion. Maricopa County's general fund indigent defense expenditure is 5.2% of its total general fund, while Apache County spends just 2.5% of its general fund on indigent defense. 375 The gap between rich/metro and poor/nonmetro is even more dramatic when considering all indigent defense expenditures as a percentage of the total operating budget. This metric ranges from a high of 3.5% in Maricopa County to a low of 0.91% in Apache County. 376 Indeed, the proportion of the general fund that is spent on indigent defense declines with population among the counties studied until we reach tiny Greenlee County. Greenlee County devotes to indigent defense a level of spending commensurate with that of Navajo County and exceeding that of Apache County. 377 Some might presume that this disparity in level of expenditure is attributable to lower crime rates, which are popularly associated with rural places, but this is probably not the case. As measured by the rate of felonies filed in state courts per 1000 persons, most nonmetropolitan counties are on par with the rate for 373. AM. BAR ASS'N, supra note 15, at 9. 374. We believe the latter figure is a better indication of the county's spending because it excludes special revenues that are earmarked for particular purposes such that the county has no discretion to divert them to indigent defense or any other use. While these special revenues include FTG funds that are earmarked for indigent defense, FTG revenue represents a pittance in relation to total indigent defense expenditures and so its presence amidst other special revenue funds has little impact. 375. See Figure 13. If adjusted for the additional funds that the Superior Court of Apache County diverted to indigent defense in Fiscal Year 2009, see infra note 552-53 and accompanying text, this percentage would increase to 2.8%. 376.

Maricopa County. 378 Indeed, if American Indian populations are excluded from the population counts of Coconino, Navajo, and Apache County on the assumption that charges against them will more likely be brought in federal or tribal courts, all of these sparsely populated counties show rates of felonies that exceed Maricopa Counties. 379 Navajo County's non-Indian crime rate is almost double that of Maricopa. The metric of per capita spending on indigent defense, depicted in Figure  17, also shows a trend for spending levels to decline as degree of rurality increases. This trend is especially striking in light of the contrary trend for overall per capita spending levels (reflecting spending on all services) to increase with degree of rurality. 380 So, even as nonmetropolitan counties tend to spend more per capita on delivery for all services, they tend to spend less per capita than their metropolitan counterparts on delivery of indigent defense in particular. Thus, indigent defense looks like a particularly low budget priority in more rural counties. The counties that defy the trend to spend less on indigent defense as degree of rurality increases are Coconino and Greenlee counties. At $29, Greenlee's per capita expenditure on indigent defense is the highest among the counties studied, with Coconino County following at $25. 381 The high per capita cost of providing indigent defense in Coconino County may be related to the fact that the county bears certain fixed costs associated with having both Public Defender's and Legal Defenders' Offices, and these costs are spread among a relatively low and sparse population. Its rate of indigent felony cases is also the highest among the counties studied. 382 By these very measures, however, Coconino County is quite similar to Navajo County in terms of population density, indigent defense infrastructure, and felony case volume. It is possible, therefore, that Coconino's higher per capita cost is due to an appropriately greater investment in this service, reflected perhaps with higher staffing levels in the Public Defenders' and Legal Defenders' Offices. As a related matter, the greater costs might be 378. According to felony filings per county as reported to the Arizona Supreme Court, the rate of felonies per 1000 residents was as follows: Maricopa, 9.4; Coconino, 7.8; Navajo, 9.4; Apache, 3.3; Greenlee, 12.5. SUPERIOR COURT CASE ACTIVITY FY 2009, ARIZONA SUPREME COURT (2009) (on file with author).

This high per capita cost is also not explained by an unusually high rate of felonies requiring indigent defense. 385 As with the high per capita cost of delivering other services to its sparse and small population, 386 the high cost of indigent defense in Greenlee County suggests the inability to achieve any economy of scale by, for example, retaining a single lawyer to provide indigent defense services on an ongoing basis in the way that Apache County engages several under ongoing contracts. 387 Instead, Greenlee County retains six attorneys or firms and pays each a flat fee per case. 388 Further, Greenlee County's fees are among the highest paid by Arizona's counties. This may reflect the fact that Greenlee County is in a better position to afford these fees than are less affluent nonmetro counties. More likely, however, the high fee rate is a function of the local or regional market for attorneys; that is, given a shortage of local attorneys, Greenlee County may have to pay more to entice Graham County Attorneys to provide services. 389 Indeed, the higher fee might implicitly include compensation for travel costs. 390 Of course, expenditure level-however parsed-is a highly imperfect proxy for quality of the service delivered.

Some Consequences of Local Funding", "text": "The analysis that follows illustrates that leaving the funding and design of indigent defense in the hands of Arizona's counties puts defense systems in nonmetropolitan counties at particular risk for four deficiencies. Each of these deficiencies can be linked to inadequate funding. 396 The first is the feasibility of providing meaningful representation where excessive caseloads exist or attorney competency is lacking. The second is the creation of financial disincentives for zealous representation, which occurs when attorneys are forced to choose between their own financial well-being and expenses necessary for the defense. The third is the manner in which the adversarial nature of the criminal justice system is undermined by a lack of parity between resources afforded to defense counsel and those of the prosecution. And the fourth is the risk of deprivation of the right to counsel where a single major case overwhelms a county's indigent defense budget and system. All four problems undermine the adversarial system 397 contemplated in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence by, in turn, impairing defense counsel from engaging in an adversarial contest, compelling defense counsel to choose disengagement from the adversarial contest, skewing the adversarial playing field, or overwhelming the adversarial system in its entirety. Each of these issues has arisen in Arizona litigation in the past three decades. The data we have been able to gather suggest they could arise again. As already noted, however, our data are incomplete and one reason for this is the State of Arizona's failure to require counties to collect and report some of the very data, e.g., misdemeanor caseloads, that could prevent overburdening counsel for indigent defendants. 398 If available, that same data could be used to establish when and if counsel are, in fact, overburdened. 398.

Smith 412 and again in Zarabia v. Bradshaw. 413 In Smith, the court considered the caseload of a public defense attorney to determine whether an individual defendant had received effective assistance of counsel in then-nonmetropolitan Mohave County. 414 The defense counsel at issue was one of four attorneys who contracted with Mohave County to provide indigent defense for one quarter of the County's cases, regardless of the number of total cases. 415 In the course of eleven months, the attorney had handled 149 felony cases, 160 misdemeanors, 21 juvenile adjudications, and 33 other cases. 416 He had also handled appointed cases from a municipal court and his own civil private practice. 417 The court contrasted this caseload with national standards set out by the ABA and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA), which suggested that the maximum allowable total caseload for an attorney should not exceed 150 felonies per year, or 300 misdemeanors per year, or 200 juvenile cases per year, or 200 mental commitment cases per year, or 25 appeals per year. 418 Under the standards, attorneys who handle a mix of cases-like the attorney at issue in Smith-are to  446 (1940) (affirming denial of continuance where appointment of counsel occurred three days before a murder trial, even while recognizing \"the denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to consult with the accused and to prepare his defense, could convert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal compliance\" with the Constitution) (footnote omitted). 410. 466 U.S. 668, 685 (1984); see also Polk County v.

One Zarabia plaintiff was a Yuma County contract attorney who had requested that the Yuma Superior Court cease assigning cases to her due to her excessive caseload. 430 The court refused. 431 On appeal the Zarabia court declined to determine whether the lawyer's caseload was in fact excessive, commenting upon a dearth of information in the record. The Arizona Supreme Court determined, however, that the lower court should not have denied her request to avoid future assignments absent a hearing to determine whether her caseload exceeded the standards outlined in Smith. 432 The court further ordered that evidentiary hearings be held for other attorneys who allege that excessive caseloads would prevent competent representation in assigned criminal cases. 433"}, {"section_title": "424.", "text": "Zarabia v.

Smith are adhered to in Arizona's counties is unknown, due largely to the fact that the state does not require counties to maintain data on felony caseload per attorney or any case count of misdemeanors. 434 As such, several nonmetropolitan counties track neither the number of misdemeanors filed nor the number of misdemeanants who use indigent defense services. 435 Yet we know that significant indigent defense services are consumed by misdemeanor cases. 436 The ratio of misdemeanors to felonies appears to be particularly high in counties with significant American Indian populations. 437 County-level data regarding the number of felonies filed for fiscal year 2009 is available both from the Arizona Supreme Court and in the Annual FTG Report produced by the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission. However, the data reported to these two entities is inconsistent, and it rarely indicates how many of those charged with felonies use indigent defense services. 438 Further, that data typically varies from the data some county Public Defenders' Offices supplied to us regarding use of indigent defense services. 439 Finally, Apache County was unable to supply any data regarding the number of cases or defendants using indigent defense services, 440 and Greenlee County was able to supply only the number of felony cases for which it supplied such services. 441 In light of these data gaps and inconsistencies, we offer a limited comparison among counties that track use of indigent defense services by several categories of cases: felony, misdemeanors, and juvenile. This data is reflected in Figure 14. Absent discovery to determine caseload figures per attorney, the best indicators of whether a caseload problem exists in Arizona are the contracts by which indigent defense services are procured. A review of the defense contracts provided by the five counties considered raises concerns regarding the potential for For example, in Maricopa County, the ratio of felonies to misdemeanors using indigent defense services was 15.24 to 1, while in Coconino County it was 6.36 to 1 and in Navajo County it was 4.72 to 1. Coconino and Navajo counties have significant American Indian populations. These calculations are made based on the case data presented in Figure 14. 438. See Appendix, Table 2. 439.

Telephone Interview with Cristina O'Coyne, supra note 346. caseload crises, particularly in rural locales. For example, the Greenlee County contract requires the contracting attorney to accept all appointments made by the court with no upward limit. 442 The Apache County contract states that an attorney may not be required to violate the caseload limitations set out in State v. Smith, but it does not prohibit such a violation. 443 Neither the Superior Court nor any other agency of the County tracks caseloads to monitor compliance with this provision. 444 Navajo County, which contracts with three attorneys to cover cases that cannot be assigned to the Public Defenders' or Legal Defenders' Offices due to conflicts, 445 does set a strict caseload limit for its contractors at 75 cases per year. 446 However, Navajo County's contract does not in any way limit practice outside of cases assigned by Navajo County; 447 as a result, one of its contractors serves as indigent defense counsel in Greenlee and Apache County as well. 448 While there is no reason to assume from available records that the contractor is violating the caseload limits mandated by State v. Smith and endorsed by the NLADA, the absence of any limitation regarding cases outside of those assigned pursuant to the contract creates an opportunity for such a violation. In contrast, both metropolitan counties that we considered in detail, Maricopa and Coconino, utilize Public Defenders' Offices to provide indigent defense services, with separate Legal Defenders' Offices to handle conflict and overflow cases. 449 While exact caseload figures per attorney were not available, defense counsel staffed in the Public Defenders' and Legal Defenders' Offices in these metropolitan counties presumably operate within the caseload limits established in State v. Smith because the counties provide backup entities and contract counsel for overflow and conflict cases. 450 Any remaining cases-likely a very small fraction of overall filings-are assigned to contract attorneys. 451 For contract attorneys who handle overflow and conflict cases, Maricopa boasts the strongest contract, as it explicitly limits contract attorney caseloads and bars the contractor from holding more than one contract. 452 Coconino County is not as restrictive regarding caseloads as Maricopa County's contract, nor is its contract as deficient as the contracts utilized in the nonmetropolitan counties. Coconino County takes the step of utilizing case equivalents, with the value of the cases assigned weighed more heavily for complex cases. 453 The contract pays a flat fee for up to 80 case equivalents, which may be more or less than 80 cases, depending on the nature and complexity of the cases assigned. 454 However, the contract also allows the attorney to accept more than 80 case equivalents for a negotiated additional payment, and it sets no maximum limit to the total number of cases an attorney could take. 455 It is also worth noting that the remote nature of many rural counties may exacerbate caseload problems. In Apache County, for example, each contract attorney is required to be available in court in St. Johns three days a week as well as one day a week each in Sanders and Chinle. 456 Attending the required hearings allows an opportunity for attorneys to meet with clients in each locale, but it also requires significant travel time. This pulls the attorney away from other important matters, such as case investigation, legal research, and motion preparation. As a result, attorneys must choose between opportunities for meaningful client communication on the one hand, and other important forms of advocacy on the other. The nonmetropolitan counties are also at significant risk that cases will be assigned to attorneys who are not competent to handle a given matter. Despite the Zarabia court's warning against use of rotational schedules where assignments are made without consideration of competency, Apache County and Greenlee County utilize rotational schedules for the assignment of all cases. 457 Navajo County utilizes a rotational schedule for overflow and conflicts cases that cannot be sent to the Public Defenders' or Legal Defenders' Offices. 458 Exacerbating this problem is a shortage of attorneys and a dearth of criminal law specialists in particular. Greenlee County has only one resident attorney who does not work for the County Attorney's Office, and it draws on neighboring Graham County for attorneys to represent indigent defendants. 459 Apache County has only six resident attorneys in private practice, and it draws on neighboring Navajo County for some of its indigent defense counsel. 460 None of these counties has a single attorney who is registered as a criminal law specialist. 461 While rotational assignment of attorneys is endorsed by the ABA, the organization's Standards for Criminal Justice: Providing Defense Services indicate that \"where the nature of the charges or other circumstances require, a lawyer may be selected because of his or her special qualifications to serve in the case.\" 462 Further, the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that when a private attorney is appointed to handle a case, the appointments should be made \"in a manner fair and equitable to the members of the bar, taking into account the skill likely to be required in handling a particular case.\" 463 This principle was relied on in Zarabia, yet counties using a strict rotational basis are not in compliance with it. The Christian Romero case illustrates the point. It is hard to imagine a more sensitive or complex case than that in which an eight-year-old was charged in a double homicide. Yet the lawyer initially assigned to Christian Romero based on a strict rotation system had no particular experience handling juvenile matters. Because the assigned lawyer was on vacation at the time, the case was soon re-assigned to Ron Wood, another of the four attorneys who contracts with the county to provide indigent defense services. 464 Wood is Apache County's most experienced contract counsel, and also the only one who is death certified, 465 but his representation of Romero came about by chance, not design. In contrast, cases in Maricopa County are assigned to contract counsel through the Office of Public Defense Services, which independently oversees defense contracts and may therefore assign cases based on the skill and experience of a given contract attorney. 466 13,2009). In fiscal year 2008, the Office of Public Defense Services assigned over 23,000 cases to contract attorneys. Another way in which Maricopa County addresses qualifications in a manner that may result in superior services is by utilizing a specialized office for juvenile representation. See E-mail from Christina Phillis, Maricopa Juvenile Pub. Defenders Office, to Lisa R. Pruitt, Professor, Univ. of Cal., Davis Sch. of Law (Feb. 1, 2010) (describing in details the years of experience of attorneys in the office). In some jurisdictions, juvenile cases are seen as a training ground before public defenders move up to felony representation in adult courts. However, representation of juveniles is extremely complex, as it requires an understanding of scientific evidence related to adolescent brain and psychosocial development which may both complicate the attorney-client relationship and relate to a number of issues regarding culpability including the unique susceptibility of youth to give false confessions. See, e.g., ROBIN WALKER STERLING, ROLE OF JUVENILE DEFENSE COUNSEL IN DELINQUENCY COURT, NATIONAL JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER 4 (Spring 2009) (\"juvenile defenders must: understand child and adolescent development to be able to communicate effectively with their clients, and to evaluate the client's level of maturity and competency and its relevancy to the delinquency case\"); ABA JUVENILE JUSTICE CTR., supra note 406, at In sum, the lack of detailed data impedes us from determining conclusively whether Arizona's nonmetropolitan counties are experiencing a caseload crisis. Indeed, the dearth of caseload data both proves and disproves the very problem we identify. Failure to track caseloads-or even the number of cases handled by the indigent defense system-makes it impossible to prove either that attorneys are overburdened or that their caseloads are reasonable. The failure to track this data should create an inference of inadequate assistance of counsel. The failure to restrict caseloads reveals significant potential for such a crisis, particularly in Apache and Greenlee Counties, where indigent defense is provided entirely by contract or appointed counsel. Likewise, the rotational assignment systems utilized in the three most rural counties-where there is a shortage of lawyers with significant criminal experience-are at a much higher risk than their urban counterparts of allowing cases to be assigned to counsel who are not competent to handle a given matter."}, {"section_title": "Financial Disincentives to Providing Zealous Representation", "text": "Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's dictate that defense counsel \"owes a client a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of interest,\" 470 conflicts in  indigent defense cases may arise where the financial or personal interest of the attorney is at odds with the defense needs of the indigent client. 471 Financial conflicts \"threaten the adversarial process by creating an unacceptable tension between adherence to professional standards and the financial burden an attorney assumes when\" representing indigent defendants. 472 At worst, this may push attorneys to neglect an indigent client's most basic rights in the criminal process, including the right to maintain one's innocence through trial. 473 A typical manner in which financial disincentives may arise occurs where a defense attorney is forced to choose between using the money provided for defense services for his or her own salary or for the retention of expert witnesses or investigators. 474 For example, if an attorney is paid the same flat fee regardless of whether the client pleads guilty on the day a case is charged or goes through trial, there is a financial disincentive to spend the time and resources necessary to take a case to trial. 475 Financial disincentives can also occur where flat-fee contracts require an indigent defense attorney to pay for litigation expenses such as experts and investigators from his or her own salary. 476 The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the command that defense counsel be effective to mean that indigent defendants must have \"access to the raw materials integral to the building of an 473.

Smith, 747 P.2d 816, 831 (Kan. 1987) (noting that funding systems in rural counties forced attorneys to \"subsidize the defense of those accused of crime, and to do so at the risk of losing their regular or potential paying clients.

See, e.g., A.N.J., 2010 WL 314512, at *9 (determining that a flat fee contract contributed to the rendering of ineffective assistance of counsel and stating that such a system \"effectively paid a bounty for every guilty plea delivered by assigned defense counsel to the county prosecutor\"). 476. Id. effective defense,\" 477 such as access to investigators and experts. 478 Indeed, a thorough investigation of facts or engaging an expert witness may well make or break a criminal defense. 479 In some jurisdictions, however, appointed counsel or contract counsel are required to pay for experts, investigators, conflicts counsel, and other defense costs from a flat rate or contract amount received from the local government entity, thereby creating a conflict between the attorney's financial interest and the client's interest in a zealous defense. 480 The Arizona Supreme Court addressed this issue in State v. Smith, where Mohave County public defense contracts required attorneys to pay for investigators out of their own flat fee. 481 Additionally, attorneys were required to pay from their flat fee the costs of reassigning the case, if necessary, to a noncontract attorney. 482 While flat fees appeal to counties because they help manage the cost of providing indigent defense, they also \"reduce the likelihood that an attorney will seek outside help when needed.\" 483 As a result of this litigation, Mohave County switched from a flat-fee system to payment on an hourly basis. 484 Despite the warning provided by State v. Smith about the use of flat-fee payment structures, Greenlee County pays contract counsel on a per case, flat fee basis. Attorneys receive $850 per felony, $600 per misdemeanor or juvenile delinquency matter, $500 per probation revocation, $1000 per post-conviction challenge, and $1200 per direct appeal. 485 While additional funds will be granted under some circumstances, the contract provides no guaranteed financial incentive 477.

Conflicts also exist where compensation schemes provide reduced funding for work performed outside of the courtroom, such as investigation and motion preparation. See, e.g to take a case through trial. 486 Likewise, Apache County pays its contract attorneys a flat annual amount, with no guaranteed additional monetary incentives to take cases to trial. 487 Both Greenlee and Apache County contractors are expected to pay for administrative and overhead costs from the flat fee provided. 488 As a result, attorneys may not earn enough on a flat fee to cover administrative costs. Navajo County includes a set base salary for its contract attorneys, and it also allows for payment of some routine administrative expenses. 489 Each of these contracts allow the contract attorneys to seek additional funds for \"extraordinary\" expenses-investigators, experts, and in Navajo County additional compensation-by petitioning the trial judge. 490 It also should be noted that in two recent high profile cases in Apache County, one of which is the Christian Romero case, the contract attorney was paid on an hourly basis rather than a flat fee basis. 491 However, the payment of such extraordinary expenses is entirely dependent upon approval by the trial court, with the possible exception of Navajo County, where the Public Defender's Office maintains a fund that can be used to pay extraordinary expenses if the court denies a request. 492 Conflicts may arise where courts control the purse strings for attorney compensation and reimbursement of litigation costs because the necessity of making such a request may put an attorney in the untenable position of having to decide between expending his or her own resources for such costs or revealing case strategy by making the request. 493  492.

While the extent to which the cost of living is lower in rural places than in urban ones is debatable, 495 little evidence exists that professional services such as those offered by experts and investigators cost less in the former. Indeed, there is reason to believe that costs may be greater in nonmetropolitan counties, given the additional expense of bringing in service providers from metropolitan locales. 496 Services such as psychiatric evaluations and mitigation services will not necessarily be lower in rural areas because the firms engaged to provide them are often urban-based, charging the same fees regardless of county. 497 As such, flat-fee contracts that either require or allow payment of those services to come out of the flat fee create an unacceptable financial disincentive to zealous advocacy. In comparison, the financial disincentives that exist for all indigent defense counsel in Apache and Greenlee Counties and for contract counsel in Navajo County are not present in most Public Defenders' Offices where defender salaries do not decrease per hour spent on the case or dollar spent on expenses.

The disincentive to challenge the court may be particularly strong in counties such as Apache County where the court awards indigent defense contracts. See Email from Betty Smith, Adm'r, Superior Court of Ariz., Apache County, to Erin Murphy, Librarian, Univ. of Cal., Davis Sch. of Law (Oct. 26, 2009 felonies tried in Superior Court. 498 A flat rate or cap in such cases would create a disincentive for attorneys to spend the time needed to zealously litigate such cases. However, that disincentive does exist for juvenile delinquency matters and less serious adult offenses, ranging from low level felonies (flat rate of $900 to $1250 for adult court, $500 for juvenile court) to misdemeanors (flat rate of $400 for adult court, $350 in juvenile court). 499 Appeals are also paid on a flat rate as follows: $20,000 for capital appeals; $2000 for adult felony appeals; $1000 for juvenile felony appeals; and $1250 for misdemeanor appeals. 500 And while Maricopa's contract attorneys are also expected to pay administrative costs from the rates listed above, 501 requests for extraordinary compensation for certain necessary expenses, including expert and investigative services, are made to an administrator in the Office of Public Defense Services. Those requests get elevated to the Superior Court only if the administrator does not approve payment. 502 In Coconino County, contract attorneys receive a total annual lump sum of $52,000 for coverage of 80 weighted case equivalents in 2009. 503 However, the risk that the flat fee could create a disincentive to invest necessary time in a given case is lessened by a contractual incentive to take cases to trial; attorneys are eligible to receive up to an additional $1600 for trial preparation and an additional $1600 for a full trial week. 504 Additional funds are also available for extraordinary expenditures, including expert and investigator fees. As in Maricopa County, requests for such funds are first made to the Legal Defender's Office. 505 And for homicide cases or other cases not contemplated by the agreement, the contract attorney is provided an opportunity to negotiate a separate fee apart from the lump sum payment. 506 However, a risk of conflict is created by a contractual provision requiring the contract attorney to pay for substitute counsel should the need arise-a problem at issue in State v. Smith-which may result in contract counsel being less likely to withdraw from a case even where doing so is in the client's best interest. 507 Each of the payment structures described above allows for the possibility of financial conflicts of interest, but the likelihood of such conflicts occurring is greater in rural counties than urban. For Apache and Greenlee, the fact that all indigent defense cases are paid on a flat fee absent approval of additional fees or costs from the court puts those counties at the greatest risk. Navajo, Coconino, and Maricopa utilize public defense offices, the design of which insulates attorneys from financial conflicts, for the majority of their cases. For those cases assigned to contract counsel, the number of potential conflicts decreases as the counties become more urban. Navajo County surpasses its nonmetropolitan peers by using a side fund maintained by the Public Defender to accommodate some extraordinary cost requests denied by the court, which provides some cushion for indigent counsel. Coconino County's guaranteed monetary incentives for taking matters to trial and use of an independent administrator for extraordinary expense requests, rather than the court, decreases the risk of conflict even further. Two features of the Maricopa County system make it the system where financial conflicts are least likely to occur: (1) use of hourly rates, rather than flat fees, for its most timeconsuming cases, and (2) use of an independent administrator for extraordinary expense requests."}, {"section_title": "Lack of Parity Between Defense and Prosecution", "text": "The adversarial nature of criminal justice is a critical component of indigent defense services. 508 Indeed, the link between funding parity and the adversarial quality of the criminal defense system was a foundational principle for the Sixth Amendment right to counsel granted in Gideon v.

That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend, are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. 509 Yet in many jurisdictions, funding for the prosecutor is significantly greater than that for indigent defense. 510 Under some indigent defense systems,"}, {"section_title": "507.", "text": "See id. \u00a7 1.R."}, {"section_title": "508.", "text": "In Herring v.

This is because all cases filed are handled by the prosecuting body, whereas some percentage of those cases will be handled by retained counsel. Given, however, estimates in at least one county that approximately 95% of all cases require indigent defense representation, 525 this likely would skew a comparison to only a small degree. Third, for each of the counties, including Maricopa, the figures may not account for differences in resources available without cost to the prosecution (e.g., investigative support by law enforcement) that must be paid for from the indigent defense budget. As such, the cost ratio in even Maricopa County may be more skewed in favor of the prosecution than the publicly available data utilized here reveals. However, even without exact data, the figures reveal distinctions among the counties that raise concern. For example, in Apache County, the per capita budget for the County Attorney is four and a half times higher than the indigent defense budget, with only $8 per capita spent on indigent defense and $36 per capita spent on the County Attorney. 526 Navajo County is nearly as unbalanced, with the County Attorney's ($63 per capita) budget at nearly three and a half times the amount spent on indigent defense ($19 per capita). 527 Greenlee County ranks just slightly higher on the parity continuum, with the County Attorney's budget nonmetropolitan Cochise County 531 was the site of a violent confrontation between \"a contingent of Cochise County sheriff deputies and a large number of black members of a religious sect,\" resulting in numerous injuries and the shooting of two church members. 532 The resulting case, State v. Hanger, was removed from Cochise County to Pima County, although the burden of paying defense costs remained with the former after the state legislature rejected a special appropriation to cover those expenses. 533 Cochise County paid in excess of $225,000 in defenserelated fees and costs in the run up to trial. 534 At jury selection, however, with an anticipated three-to-four month trial looming, the county balked at paying any further expenses. When Cochise County announced it would not provide any additional funds for defense services, 535 the trial court dismissed the cases with prejudice. 536 The Arizona Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, reasoning that a continuation of the case until funds were made available would result in a violation of the defendants' right to a speedy trial. 537 In doing so, the Court of Appeals expressed regret at the result and \"recognize[d] that extraordinarily complicated cases, such as this one, can severely strain resources in rural counties.\" 538 While not approving of it, the court expressed understanding of \"Cochise County's decision that other county needs had to take precedence over the provision of defense services in this case,\" as well as the \"trial judge's decision to defer to the judgment of the county on the utilization of county resources.\" 539 The court further observed that the circumstances of Hanger could be avoided if the state were to pay defense costs or supply a Public Defender for \"those cases beyond the means of rural counties to fund.\" 540 Indeed, in a strongly worded opinion, the court expressed obvious frustration at the failure of the state to pay for public defense: [W]e must respond to the intimation that the trial judge thwarted the public's interest in resolution of the charges against the defendants. It was not the judge that thwarted resolution of the case. Rather, it was the state. The state is constitutionally obligated to fund defense services. It has chosen to fulfill that obligation by imposing it on counties within the state. Such devolution does not, however, end responsibility. The state cannot disclaim its constitutional obligation. That stricture applies with particular force on the facts of this case where the state legislature voted against a special appropriate to cover defense fees and costs. 541 Recent events in Apache County illustrate the ongoing risk of a nonmetropolitan county being overwhelmed by one or more complex cases. In September of 2006, the Apache County prosecutor filed capital charges against Steven Licon in Apache County. Given that the death penalty is a possible outcome of the charges, the Apache County Superior Court has authorized hourly payment for indigent defense counsel, as well as significant expenditures for mitigation services. 542 As of January 2010, the County had spent more than $111,000 in indigent defense related expenditures on pre-trial matters related to that single case. 543 Adding to the strain on Apache County's indigent defense budget since 2008 have been the defense and guardian ad litem costs for Christian Romero. As discussed in the Introduction, the boy pled guilty to one count of negligent homicide in February 2009, after the prosecution and defense agreed that he should not be incarcerated but instead should be subject to intensive probation, including treatment programs and parole through the age of eighteen. 544 The parties then spent eight months searching for an affordable treatment facility, estimating that the costs of the treatment contemplated in the plea would reach $100,000. 545 Those costs only added to the tens of thousands of dollars the county spent for indigent defense services, including the defense attorney's hourly rate, the cost of a guardian ad litem, and expenses related to psychiatric evaluations of the boy. 546 Then, in October 2009, the Apache County judge who accepted the plea announced that he had decided belatedly to reject the plea and send Christian to a state run (and financed) juvenile correctional facility, despite an Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections official's testimony that state facilities were not equipped to incarcerate a child so young. 547 In an unusual twist, the prosecutor joined in a defense motion to have the judge removed, with the prosecutor arguing that the judge's change of heart was directly related to funding. 548 The joint motion was granted, the judge was removed, and the Greenlee County presiding judge was assigned to determine the sentence. 549 Ultimately, Christian was sentenced to the terms of the plea agreement, 550 after expenditures of over $70,000 from the Apache County indigent defense budget. 551 As a result of the Licon and Romero cases, Apache County exceeded its indigent defense budget in 2009 by about $75,000. 552 About $39,000 of the shortfall was transferred from the budget for the Apache County Superior Court, and another $34,000 came from grant funds. 553 Such expenditures-which will likely continue and even increase until the capital case against Licon is tried-presumably affect the County's ability to provide discretionary public services, putting pressure on the Board of Supervisors when they set the annual indigent defense budget. 554 The funding problems that Apache County has experienced are by no means unique to Arizona, 555 but in light of its poor tax base, the County simply does not have the revenue cushion to absorb extraordinary case expenditures as would a county with deeper pockets and more funding flexibility. 556 Comparing the experience of Apache County in funding these two cases to the ability of Maricopa County to undertake similar expenditures illustrates that metropolitan counties have a far superior capacity to absorb extraordinary case costs than do their nonmetropolitan counterparts. As observed in Part II.B.3, Maricopa County's total indigent defense expenditure is 5.2% of its total general fund, while that of Apache County represents less than half that proportion of its general fund-just 2.5%. 557 With an indigent defense budget of more than $79 million, Maricopa County is in a much better position to handle major cases without a significant redistribution of county funds. 558 In contrast, when faced with the Licon and Romero cases, Apache County was forced to transfer large sums of money from the county's Superior Court budget to supplement the indigent defense allocation. 559 The good news is that the Superior Court has been willing to do this. The court also does not appear to have cut corners in responding to the needs of the defendants in these two high-profile cases, 560 although the attempt to rescind Romero's plea agreement may have reflected financial concerns by the judge who was removed from the case."}, {"section_title": "III. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM", "text": "The data we present indicate that Arizona's county-level funding scheme of indigent defense leaves the state susceptible to both Sixth Amendment and equal protection challenges. Our analysis reveals that metropolitan counties tend to fund indigent defense more generously than their nonmetropolitan counterparts and that more urbanized counties also have in place certain safeguards to protect the interests of indigent defendants. These safeguards include institutional arrangements that separate oversight of indigent defense funds from the judicial"}, {"section_title": "555.", "text": "See, e.g., State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d 1338 (Miss. 1990), discussed in Everett, supra note 403 (describing how the trials of two men accused of a quadruple homicide necessitated an increase in county taxes); Corenevsky v. Superior Court of Imperial County, 36 Cal. 3d 307 (1984) (lack of county funding to pay for more experienced counsel for an indigent defendant charged with capital murder resulted in reduction of charges; state supreme court ultimately ordered county auditor to pay for expert witnesses, law clerks, and investigators over protests by the county Board of Supervisors that doing so would bankrupt the county). 556. Further, one or more extraordinary cases can exacerbate existing problems in a county's indigent defense system. For example, despite assignment of such a complex matter to a given attorney, the use of a strict rotational system in which attorney caseloads and prior assignments are not considered may cause the assigned attorney to become overloaded with work. 557. See supra Figure 13. 558. See supra Figure 11 (showing Maricopa's indigent defense budget to be more than 130 times that of Apache County's, which was less than $600,000 function. Metropolitan counties are also more likely to use an entity separate from the court to assign cases to contract attorneys, administer the contracts, and monitor caseloads. The absence of such safeguards in nonmetropolitan counties, coupled with low levels of funding and acute disparities between prosecution and defense spending in several such counties, signals a constitutional problem. The State should not \"assign operational and fiscal responsibility to local units without giving them comparably adequate revenue sources.\" 561 We therefore propose that Arizona's legislature centralize primary funding for defense services at the state level. Further, in order to assure that funding levels account for the varying practical realities of providing defense services in metro and nonmetro locales, we recommend that funding be based on weighted caseload counts reflecting all cases handled through indigent defense offices and weighting each based on case complexity. This would include-but not be limited to-felonies, misdemeanors, and juvenile delinquencies. Funding determinations should also be responsive to higher costs that rural jurisdictions may encounter in seeking to provide services that are comparable to those of their metropolitan counterparts. 562 That is, funding levels need to respond to certain antecedent inequalities associated with rurality. Among these are expenses associated with rural spatiality, including markets for professional services that increase fees, as well as higher transportation costs. Finally, state budgeting for indigent defense should plan for the contingency of extraordinary cases in order to ensure sufficient funding for any county faced with such a need. We acknowledge that the centralization of primary funding carries risks. First, it makes the bulk of indigent defense funding vulnerable to political whim at a higher scale. That is, funding would become vulnerable in the hands of the state legislature, even as it is now vulnerable in the hands of county Boards of Supervisors. This could be especially dangerous during economic downturns. Second, centralized funding risks the unintended consequence of lowering the standard of indigent defense services in counties that are currently better funded instead of raising the bar in counties with a shortage of defense dollars and the necessary services and infrastructure they could buy. In order to protect against those possibilities, we recommend that legislation centralizing funds include a requirement that state funding may not be reduced in a manner that would decrease funds available in the county with the highest level of funding at the time of enactment. 563 Also, periodic increases should adjust for inflation."}, {"section_title": "561.", "text": "Neuman, supra note 54, at 379."}, {"section_title": "562.", "text": "See supra Part II.C.2 (noting cost of attorneys in nonmetropolitan counties, as well as of ancillary services such as mitigation and investigation); Appendix, Table 1. Greater travel costs associated with rural spatiality may also be a component of this, as reflected in Navajo County's report that it used part of its FTG state funding to pay for \"travel to the courthouse in Kayenta.\" FILL THE GAP FY 2009 REPORT, supra note 161, at 46."}, {"section_title": "563.", "text": "The highest level of current funding might be assessed by several measures, taking into account county population and case volume among other factors. One of the most probative metrics for setting a funding floor is likely to be cost per case. However, Greenlee County's cost per felony defended is twice as high as that of Maricopa County, In Arizona, this will most likely set the floor for funding indigent defense at a level reflective of spending by metropolitan counties. Under this proposal, metropolitan counties may be seen as manifesting the standard of adequacy required by the Sixth Amendment. 564 To be clear, we do not have sufficient evidence to establish that all metropolitan systems (in Arizona or elsewhere) are adequate-in either some or all regards-and we have not set out to establish that they are. But if metropolitan systems are not adequate, then surely nonmetropolitan systems which labor under lower funding levels and an absence of institutional safeguards are also inadequate. 565 The metrocentrism inherent in this funding proposal is reflected in many aspects of the American legal landscape. The United States has become an essentially urban nation, 566 and our laws are often assessed based solely on how they operate in urban settings. 567 In the indigent defense context, this metrocentrism could be used to the benefit of rural justice systems because it would provide funding to nonmetro counties that would permit them to provide indigent defense services that are at least roughly on par with those of their metropolitan counterparts. Even if enhanced state funding is achieved, policymakers and the defense bar should be diligent in assessing the funding and provision of counsel in both rural and urban areas to ensure that the standard is not set too low. We therefore and so using solely this metric might be inappropriate. That is, the cost per felony defended may be particularly high in Greenlee County for reasons discussed above; it would thus not necessarily be the best indication of an appropriate funding floor. More case volume data from the individual counties-including counts of all categories of cases, not only felonies-would be needed to inform any calculation of a minimum of level of funding."}, {"section_title": "564.", "text": "A similar argument could be made in the context of litigation. Even if a court refuses to compare counties' systems for providing indigent defense under an equal protection theory, a comparative analysis could come in by the back door if the levels of funding and safeguards associated with metropolitan systems are seen as setting the standard of adequacy under the Sixth Amendment. Whenever a nonmetropolitan system falls short of that metropolitan adequacy standard, it would signal a presumptive Sixth Amendment violation. After all, county Boards of Supervisors are unlikely to allocate more funding for indigent defense than is constitutionally required, given that these are not politically popular expenditures. Thus, the county with the highest level of fundingassuming that it is in fact an adequate standard-can be said to have essentially set the minimum adequacy threshold. 565. An exception, of course, would be a situation where a particular public defender's office fails to monitor caseloads, permitting individual attorneys to be overloaded. See Eckholm, supra note 450. In other words, metropolitan systems could still experience particular failures within fundamentally well-designed systems. This would not establish similar infirmities within the context of nonmetropolitan systems. 566. According to the 2000 Census, 79% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas and 21% lived in rural areas. Along the metro/nonmetro divide, 80.3% lived in the former, while 19.7% lived in the latter. U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, GCT recommend that the legislature create a task force to undertake a review of indigent defense systems to identify deficiencies and establish meaningful standards. Again, this will require accurate and detailed case volume (for the entire county) and caseload (per attorney) counts. Further, this review should include an analysis of the manner in which cases are assigned, how defense counsel are supervised, the likelihood that funding mechanisms could create financial conflicts of interest, and relative parity in resources afforded to the prosecution and the defense. It is also important to note that centralized funding and state oversight need not eliminate local autonomy, which is often articulated as a justification for local funding of services. Fiscal policy is distinguishable from the substantive policy related to that which it finances, for example, administration of justice or education. 568 We acknowledge the value in permitting states to delegate local affairs to political subdivisions, 569 and our proposal to centralize funding would not limit county autonomy to determine how to provide indigent defense services-so long as those services are consistent with constitutional mandates. Indeed, we invite counties to remedy the structural shortcomings we have identified. Although making the necessary changes ultimately may require additional state funding, counties can take steps to reduce systemic deficiencies. For example, counties could modify their contracts with indigent defense counsel to explicitly restrict caseloads, including private practice caseloads. Counties could employ an independent administrator-perhaps by pooling funds with adjacent nonmetropolitan counties-who could oversee case assignments. This would eliminate the strict rotational system in favor of one that takes into account attorney qualifications and competencies. The same administrator could also be authorized to approve expenditures for necessary costs such as experts and investigators, thereby insulating those funding decisions from the Superior Court and ensuring that attorneys do not have to choose between seeking such services on the one hand and personal financial interests or disclosure of case strategy on the other. Counties could further reduce financial disincentives to vigorous defense by eliminating flat-fee payments and creating financial incentives to go to trial. Finally, with very little financial strain, counties could ensure meaningful parity between prosecutors and defense attorneys by adjusting existing budgets to provide commensurate salaries, as well as administrative and other necessary expenses."}, {"section_title": "568.", "text": "Professor Neuman observes that, even in San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), where the Supreme Court applied the rational basis test, it \"upheld the Texas finance scheme on the grounds that local fiscal control was rationally related to fostering local autonomy in setting educational policy, not fiscal policy,\" and that it found the scheme \"not necessary to achieving any compelling government interest.\" Id. at 378 (emphasis original); see also supra notes 65-68 and accompanying text. 569. Neuman acknowledges that Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 22 (1880) and decisions relying on it reflect the Court's concern that states have sufficient flexibility \"to regulate local affairs by creating political subdivisions.\" Neuman, supra note 54, at 268; see also, e.g., Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 445, 447 (1940) (noting the Court's reluctance to \"interfere with the State's determination of local social policy,\" consistent \"with the preservation of constitutional balance between State and Federal sovereignty\"). Until the Arizona legislature and counties act to remedy the infirmities we have identified, litigators and the Arizona courts have the power and duty to play a critical role in reforming indigent defense funding and delivery. At the individual case level, defense counsel should take care to establish a record of funding and service deficiencies that may be useful on appeal. Upon a more detailed showing that the problems suggested herein exist, the Arizona courts should follow the lead of State v. Smith and adopt an inference in individual cases that \"the adequacy of representation is adversely affected by the system,\" 570 and a Sixth Amendment violation is thus presumed. 571 Likewise, where funds are essentially unavailable, courts should follow State v. Hanger and dismiss the pending charges. 572 Finally, Arizona courts should consider amending the state's rules of professional conduct to prohibit the use of flat-fee contracts that require counsel to pay for experts and investigators out of their own pockets, thereby creating disincentives to take cases to trial. 573 At a systemic level, counsel-whether representing a class of indigent defendants or a class of underfunded counties-should analyze whether the lack of funding in certain counties has created a likelihood that ineffective assistance of counsel will be rendered, making viable a class action that seeks prospective relief under the Sixth Amendment and/or Equal Protection Clause. 574 Courts should apply heightened scrutiny to equal protection claims that allege significant spatial or territorial disparities in the provision of counsel because the right to counsel is a fundamental right. Such disparities have been found to be tantamount to the invidious discrimination prohibited by Gideon, Griffin, and their progeny. 575 Sixth Amendment claims should also be considered, given the infirmities discussed in Parts II.C.1-4 and other problems that may be identified through discovery. Ultimately, the expense of litigating individual appeals and defending against class actions may provide the greatest incentive for the legislative and county-level reforms we advocate. 576 [VOL. 52:219"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Nonmetropolitan counties across the nation face particular challenges to funding and delivering justice-challenges that stem from characteristics such as sparse populations and the related inability to achieve economies of scale in service delivery. In states like Arizona, those problems are aggravated by the vast territory that many counties cover. These challenges can be met only with adequate funding, yet the State of Arizona effectively turns a blind eye to this problem by requiring counties to finance their own justice systems-from public safety (including jails and probation services) to County Attorneys and indigent defense. Low levels of funding for these and other services in some nonmetropolitan counties result largely from Arizona's scheme for funding county government, which is heavily skewed to population size (for example, distribution of state sales tax and auto licensing fee revenue) and to private wealth (as reflected in property value and retail sales). The funding strain on nonmetropolitan counties is aggravated when counties face increased responsibility for delivering myriad discretionary and mandatory services. Because nearly all funding for indigent defense is from county general funds, the funding biases carry over to indigent defense. While per capita-based funding of county government generally (e.g., state sales tax distribution) and of indigent defense specifically (e.g., FTG) may seem instinctively fair and equitable, it does not respond to the particular challenges that face nonmetropolitan counties. These often include the inability to achieve economies of scale to justify establishing a separate institution to assign, monitor, and supervise counsel for indigent defendants, which leaves these functions to the Superior Court. Nonmetropolitan challenges may also include higher costs associated with rural spatiality and limited markets for professional services. Our analysis has demonstrated that Arizona's nonmetropolitan counties are at greater risk of systematic deprivation of adequate counsel than their urban counterparts. Our review of contracts for indigent defense in five counties reveals the potential for a significant caseload crisis, particularly in Apache and Greenlee Counties where indigent defense is provided entirely by contract or appointed counsel. Those counties, along with Navajo County, are also at greater risk of providing incompetent counsel given the use of strict rotational assignment systems that do not take into account the nature and complexity of the case. The contracts also illuminate the risk of financial conflicts of interest arising in the indigent defense context, given the use of flat-fee payments and primary reliance on the Superior Court's approval of additional expenditures. Financial data from the counties also show a decided lack of parity between expenditures on indigent defense and prosecution in rural counties, which upsets the balance required in the adversarial process. Finally, the inability of counties with limited tax bases to absorb the financial consequences of extraordinary cases exacerbates problems in the indigent defense systems. Pinal counties. 582 Some less populous counties like Coconino, Mohave, and Yuma have also seen growth-growth that has put some of them over the metropolitan threshold. 583 That population growth has been accompanied by economic growth which, by and large, has enabled their county governments to raise revenues sufficient to meet their residents' needs. Yet other counties-such as nonmetropolitan Greenlee and Apache-have experienced population stasis or loss. 584 Their tax bases are not expanding and the demand for indigent defense services is not contracting. Thus Arizona itself has become an inequality hot spot, with some counties increasingly able to better fund government services and others decreasingly able to provide a minimal level of services, including a constitutionally adequate system for administration of justice functions such as indigent defense. Persistent poverty counties such as Apache and Navajo are another component of Arizona's story of uneven development and spatial inequality. High and enduring poverty in these counties greatly inhibits their ability to generate sufficient revenue to meet the service needs of residents. While some revenue deficits are met by federal transfers aimed at assisting their significant American Indian populations, these counties struggle to provide even rudimentary services. They also lack the depth of resources necessary to absorb significant indigent defense costs, including those associated with a single major case. Finally, what we can see in Arizona-as a consequence of devolution and a heavy reliance on local funding for all sorts of services-are \"important spatial outcomes\" that result from a \"seemingly aspatial government policy.\" 585 That is, the policy of requiring counties to pay for indigent defense may appear \"aspatial\" at first glance, but it creates gross inequalities among the counties and their residents in terms of service provision. In short, it makes county boundaries the arbitrary lines that determine the caliber of a constitutionally mandated service. This is surely an \"important spatial outcome,\" and it is one with legal significance. Given the critical character of the constitutional right to counsel, Arizona's legislative and judicial bodies-as well as its defense counsel and the civil rights bar-should act to ensure both adequacy and relative equality in the provision of indigent defense services."}]
