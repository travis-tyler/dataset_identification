The associations of these components with vascular risk factors, cortical atrophy, Alzheimer disease (AD) genetics, and cognition were then investigated using linear regression.\nWMH were found to occur nonuniformly, with higher frequency within spatially heterogeneous patterns encoded by 4 components, which were consistent with common categorizations of deep and periventricular WMH, while further dividing the latter into posterior, frontal, and dorsal components. Temporal trends of the components differed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Frontal periventricular WMH were most distinctive as they appeared in the fifth decade of life, whereas the other components appeared later in life during the sixth decade. Furthermore, frontal WMH were associated with systolic blood pressure and with pronounced atrophy including AD-related regions. AD polygenic risk score was associated with the dorsal periventricular component in the elderly. Cognitive decline was associated with the dorsal component.\nThese results support the hypothesis that the appearance of WMH follows age and diseasedependent regional distribution patterns, potentially influenced by differential underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and possibly with a differential link to vascular and neurodegenerative changes. \u2021These authors contributed equally to this work."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "White matter lesions or hyperintensities (WMH) are common findings in older adults, characterized by a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted MRIs.

BLSA participants are a volunteer sample of community-dwelling individuals. Specific recruitment strategies have varied over time, but all participants meet health criteria at entry. The neuroimaging substudy of the BLSA has been described previously. 21 We included in this study 307 cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment participants with 747 observations to examine longitudinal associations with cognition in an independent aging cohort. Participants of the BLSA have received MRI and cognitive testing at the same visit. Every participant had at least 2 observations of WMH and complete cognition information, including diagnostic designation based on cognitive status. Table 2 presents the characteristics of BLSA at baseline. We included the following neuropsychological scores for the BLSA sample: (1) the Benton Visual Retention Test for visual memory assessment; (2) Trail Making Test, Parts A and B, assessing attention and executive function, respectively; and (3) the California Verbal Learning Test.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents The ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Greifswald approved the SHIP study. All participants provided written informed consent. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences institutional review board approved the BLSA protocol, and written informed consent was obtained at each study visit.\nImage acquisition and preprocessing Imaging parameters were described by Hegenscheid et al. 22 for SHIP and by Venkatraman et al. 23 for BLSA; additional details are given in data available from Dryad (section e-4, doi. org/10.5061/dryad.k6k42cq). Image analysis was performed using T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRIs, described in more detail in data available from Dryad (section e-5). Briefly, an automated multimodal method was used to segment WMH, which were then aligned to a common template space. Structural T1-weighted MRIs for SHIP were processed using the protocols of the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta Analysis) consortium for the calculation of cortical thickness (data available from Dryad, section e-5).\nIdentifying covariance components WMH components (WMHCs) were identified using a nonnegative matrix factorization method, which summarizes complex multivariate patterns of covariation in the data with a predefined number of nonnegative components 17 (data available from Dryad, section e-6, doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.k6k42cq). The method was applied to the whole SHIP sample (n = 1,836) to derive a set of WMHCs.

We examined relationships of the identified components with age in SHIP using linear regression models independently for each component, with age categorized in decades. In SHIP, cross-sectional WMHC trend lines were computed independently for each component using a linear regression model that included age and age 2 as predictors. For longitudinal temporal trends in BLSA, we used linear mixedeffects models with similar predictors. Significance of the differences between trend lines was assessed through permutation testing (data available from Dryad, section e-8). To assess possible staging of the WMH progression, we estimated a model of regional WMH progression based on the frequency of regional WMH presence across participants, similar to the method by Grothe et al. 24 In this analysis, each WMHC for each participant was categorized as WMH \"present\" or \"absent,\" according to a fixed threshold estimated from the total WMH volume for the complete sample.\nWe performed vertex-wise analysis of the cortical thickness in SHIP (n = 1,836) to inspect the relationship to each component. Results were considered significant if they survived clusterwise correction for multiple comparisons at p < 0.05. We assessed the cross-sectional association between risk factors and WMHCs in the whole SHIP sample (n = 1,836) using a linear regression model for each component as outcome (resulting in 4 models). Similarly, we investigated cross-sectional associations of the 4 WMHCs with the AD polygenic risk score in the whole SHIP sample with available genotyping (n = 985) and in those older than 65 years (n = 189). All regression models using the whole age range SHIP sample were adjusted for age, age 2 , sex, education, and SHIP subcohort. 25 Models were Bonferronicorrected by factor 4. Finally, we used independent linear mixed-effect models to investigate associations of longitudinal change in WMHCs with cognitive scores as outcome and WMHCs as predictors (one model at a time, resulting in 16 models) in BLSA (n = 307 and 747 observations). All models were adjusted for age, age 2 , sex, educational level, and scanner type. Random slopes with age effect were included in the models in addition to random intercepts. Models were Bonferroni-corrected by factor 16 . In all models, we applied a cubic root transformation on the WMHC values to normalize their distribution.

We quantified the overlap in cortical atrophy regions associated with each of the 4 WMHCs. The amount of overlap between 2 regions is measured using their Dice coefficient (data available from Dryad, table e-4).\nAssociations with vascular risk factors, AD polygenic risk score, and cognition We found significant cross-sectional associations of WMHCs with vascular risk factors in the SHIP sample (n = 1,836, table 4).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current study expands on previous studies that have used total WMH measures by investigating spatial heterogeneity of WMH in large aging cohorts. We identified spatially heterogeneous components of WMH and demonstrated that these components displayed differential associations with age, risk of neurodegeneration, and vascular risk factors. Of note, WMHC-fron. was evident about 2 decades earlier than the remaining components. WMHC-fron. also showed stronger association with blood pressure and cortical atrophy. Only WMHC-dors. showed associations with AD genetic risk and with longitudinal cognitive decline. The observed spatial heterogeneity is potentially related, in part, to underlying normal heterogeneity in brain anatomy and physiology, as well as heterogeneity of pathophysiologic processes that drive the appearance of these WMH and may have different implications for cognitive outcomes.\nWMH have been commonly subdivided into deep and periventricular WMH subclasses. 27, 28 However, the definition of these subdivisions has been inconsistent with a generally poor overlap in WMH subclass ratings. 29 It has been suggested that shape provides complementary information for distinguishing WMH subcomponents. 30 Another suggestion was to use a simple \"distance from the ventricles\" measure for the classification into deep and periventricular WMH, but the definition of this distance was variable, arbitrary, and without consensus. 6, 31 Capitalizing on a large sample from the general population and a datadriven method, we systematically categorized WMH without use of prior arbitrary knowledge for defining regional boundaries; rather, those boundaries were detected through clusters of high covariation of WMH occurrence across individuals.\nOur data-driven approach separated the deep WMH from the periventricular ones (WMHC-deep vs others) in agreement with suggestions in the literature. Of note, the periventricular WMH were also partitioned into posterior and frontal components (WMHC-post. and WMHC-fron.), as well as a more dorsal component (WMHC-dors.). Therefore, we found higher variation in periventricular WMH compared to the deep WMH, a finding not reported in the literature before.\nWith the nonnegative matrix factorization approach, we assume that the WMH occurrence can be decomposed into highly nonoverlapping parts, where each part groups elements that change in a coordinated fashion across the population. As typical for all factorization methods, it is important to specify the number of components to be extracted. This is the only decision that we have imposed. We determined this number by rigorously examining the coverage of total WMH load and by choosing the largest coverage (data available from Dryad, section e-6, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6k42cq). Assessment of the robustness of the final components through reproducibility experiments, using random half-splits of the SHIP sample, showed that the covariance approach would perform consistently in similar populations. The components derived from the BLSA baseline sample (n = 307) were reproducible to a lesser extent, with 66% overlap between components derived from SHIP vs BLSA (data available from Dryad, table e-2). The highest overlap was obtained for the frontal component (91%), maybe because of the existence of similar factors deriving its appearance in both cohorts. However, differences in population characteristics between SHIP and BLSA such as mean age or education and other deriving factors would yield modest overlap in other components.\nWe observed differential cross-sectional trend lines and longitudinal trajectories, with statistically significant pairwise differences between components, supported by permutation tests. Of note, WMHC-fron. appeared at an earlier age (significant from the fifth decade of life [table 3 ]) compared to the other components (significant from the sixth decade of life). Prefrontal white matter is most susceptible to the influence of age, 32 which might explain why WMHC-fron. was present at earlier age. WMHC-fron. also had a less exponential growth or acceleration with age compared to WMHC-post. and WMHC-dors.; perhaps this result can be reflected with stronger associations between posterior WMH with neurodegenerative processes that tend to accelerate later in life. Although some insights can be taken from our findings regarding AD polygenic risk score and cognition, unfortunately our data cannot provide causal evidence for this result, and further studies are required.\nOur results showed that the data-driven components are representing staging as well as different etiologies in WMH appearance. These results are largely expected. The fact that these components were derived from SHIP, which is sampled from the general population with a wide age range (22-84 years), hints to the heterogeneous nature of WMH. Previous research has shown involvement of inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegenerative diseases in the appearance of WMH. Such conditions are expected to contribute to WMH volume in our sample, according to their prevalence in the general population from the region.\nTo our knowledge, only one study showed any differential association between regional WMH volume and gray matter atrophy. 33 An interesting finding of our analysis was that the WMHC-fron. component displayed considerably more widespread associations with cortical thinning, in particular in AD-related regions such as the anterior temporal lobe, compared to the other 3 components, especially WMHC-deep and WMHC-post. (figure 1). One explanation could be that WMHC-fron. appeared earlier in life and also showed strong association with blood pressure (tables 3 and 4) . It has been demonstrated that frontal WMH were more likely to be present in patients with poststroke vascular dementia compared to healthy controls, and the frontal white matter was more affected than the temporal white matter. 34 Our finding of early association of WMHC-fron. with age, increased blood pressure, and more pronounced atrophy is further suggestive of the importance of frontal WMH with respect to neurodegeneration and possibly vascular cognitive dysfunction. Further research is needed to determine whether the WMHC-fron. differentially predicts future vascular dementia.\nThe posterior periventricular, dorsal, and deep white matter components were associated with smoking. The mechanisms for the association between smoking and posterior periventricular WMH and deep WMH can be potentially explained by different nicotine receptor distribution in the brain. 35 The link between intima-media thickness and WMH may primarily reflect shared risk factors such as smoking. 36 While associations between these risk factors and regional WMH have been reported previously, 37, 38 a contribution of our analysis lies in the application of a data-driven method, which \"categorizes\" those changes across the population together. Few MRI studies have such statistical power, with a population-based sample and a very high standardization protocol.\nA recent study showed that WMH volume is significantly elevated among individuals with autosomal dominant genetic mutations for AD. These changes are most pronounced in posterior periventricular regions. 39 In our study, only the periventricular dorsal component showed a significant association with the AD polygenic risk score in individuals older than 65 years that survived Bonferroni correction (table 4) . Because the prevalence of sporadic AD increases rapidly after the age of 65, our findings might reflect a contribution of AD pathology to the development of WMH.\nA very striking result in our analysis was that WMH-dors., which showed a significant association with the AD polygenic risk score after the age of 65 years, was also significantly associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in the validation sample BLSA. This finding is further suggestive of a potential role of impairment in cognitive abilities and dementia-related degeneration with focal appearance of WMH in periventricular dorsal regions.\nStudies utilizing advanced structural covariance analysis for systematically investigating spatial heterogeneity of WMH are rare. A few recent studies used a similar methodology for examining regional structural covariance in aging populations. 16 However, these studies were limited to analysis of gray matter. Another strength of our work is the rich cohorts included. The large population-based sample in SHIP, which spans a wide age range, allowed us to reliably define WMH patterns and to study their correlates. The BLSA cohort provided a valuable longitudinal sample to examine trajectories of WMHCs.\nDespite the above strengths, certain limitations should be noted. First, some modifiable risk factors, such as dietary factors (e.g., salt or sugar intake) and inflammation, were not included in the study. Second, our analysis did not include periventricular spaces, or further small vessel disease subtype assessment, and those should be considered in future research. Third, although associations between WMHCs and risk factors or AD polygenic risk score are suggestive and reasonable, such correlational analyses do not establish causality and are potentially limited by the high correlation between the components and total WMH volume (data available from Dryad, table e-8 and figure e-5, doi.org/10. 5061/dryad.k6k42cq). Fourth, The SHIP participants did not have complete cognitive testing. Therefore, some brain changes in the SHIP sample are more specific to aging, but also others might be driven by unrecognized changes and that might represent the initial impairment in people with vascular cognitive disorder. Fifth, several of the findings were not robust to exclusion of relatively few participants with (possible) cognitive impairment; as a result, a small proportion of participants may be primarily deriving some of the observed associations. Sixth, our strict quality control criteria resulted in a high number of scans excluded in SHIP, which might lead to potential bias and less generalizability of our results. Finally, The BLSA sample with available T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scans that we used for studying longitudinal associations was rather small. Repeated assessments continue in BLSA, and future studies should consider larger samples with longer follow-up intervals.\nOur study indicates that WMH appearance follows systematic and co-occurring regional patterns. We found an early involvement of the periventricular frontal regions, with strong associations with blood pressure and more pronounced cortical atrophy through the adult lifespan. The periventricular dorsal component showed associations with AD polygenic risk score and cognitive decline, as well as later appearance in the aging brain. Our findings support the hypothesis that the appearance of WMH follows age-and disease-dependent regional distribution patterns, potentially influenced by differential underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and possibly with different implications for vascular risk factors as well as neurodegenerative and cognitive outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "M.H.: drafting the manuscript for content, including medical writing for content, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data, acquisition of data, statistical analysis, study supervision or coordination, obtaining funding, and final approval.
