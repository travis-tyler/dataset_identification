[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL-40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are newly discovered markers indicating neuronal damage and microglial activation, respectively. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflects the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is useful as diagnostic markers for AD. However, it is unknown whether these biomarkers have similar or complementary information in AD. Methods: We stratified 121 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), progressive MCI (pMCI), and dementia due to AD. Analysis of covariance (ANOVA) and chi-square analyses, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression models were performed to test the demographic, associations between biomarkers, and diagnostic accuracies, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of CSF amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) on above biomarkers within diagnostic groups, the combination of diagnostic group and A\u03b2 status as predictor, and CSF biomarkers as predictors of AD features, including cognition measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and brain structure and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by extracellular depositions of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuronal loss [1, 2] . The pathophysiological abnormalities that characterize AD precede clinical symptoms by many years and can be quantified in vivo using biomarkers. Based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures, the \"A/T/N\" system for biomarkers has been proposed, and A\u03b2 is first, followed by tau, then neurodegeneration [3] . Over the past decade, inflammatory factors and other proteins have been proposed to further characterize the AD pathophysiological process [4] . It is important to study the ability of these biomarkers to make accurate diagnoses, which can permit for population enrichment of clinical trials [5] .\nVisinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), a calcium-mediated neuronal injury biomarker, has been shown to have diagnostic and prognostic value in distinguishing individuals with symptomatic AD from controls [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, these studies suggest that VILIP-1 may be useful for AD pathophysiology, but evidence is limited. Finding an association between VILIP-1 and AD pathophysiology may offer another important neurodegeneration biomarker specific for early diagnosis of AD.\nA growing body of research suggests that the immune system is involved early in the pathogenesis of AD [11] [12] [13] , with cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma of AD patients. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL-40), a 39 kDa glycoprotein homologue to chitinase, is one of the proteins that has been frequently measured in body fluids as a surrogate marker of neuroinflammation in AD [14, 15] . Furthermore, many studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , but not all [22] , have found increased levels of CSF YKL-40 in AD patients.\nHowever, it is not clear whether p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 provide independent or complementary information about AD and whether combinations of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 increase the diagnostic accuracy for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here, in a prospective longitudinal study, we aim to test the hypotheses that (1) combinations of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 increase the diagnostic accuracy for AD and MCI; (2) p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 have different correlations with A\u03b2 pathology and with different clinical stages of AD; and (3) p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 have different correlations with other AD features, including cognitive decline, cerebral atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database description and study participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nFor the present study, we selected 121 ADNI-GO/2 participants who met the criteria for AD (n = 18), amnestic MCI (n = 71), and cognitively normal (CN, n = 32). Participants with MCI were divided into stable MCI (sMCI, n = 24) and progressive MCI (pMCI, n = 47) based on whether they converted to AD during follow-up.

We defined MCI as those who had a MMSE score of 20-26, a clinical dementia rating of 0.5, subjective and objective memory loss, and absence of other neuropsychiatric disorders. We further stratified the MCI participants into sMCI if they did not progress to AD during at least 2 year of follow-up, and pMCI if they progress to AD at any time during the follow-up.

Secondly, VILIP-1 and YKL-40 were significant predictors of AD, while p-tau had higher accuracy for single predictors.

Combination of biomarkers did not have higher diagnostic accuracy than the model using p-tau alone for CN versus AD and for In different combinations of clinical diagnosis and A\u03b2 pathology, data are are estimates from linear mixed-effects models evaluating effects of A\u03b2 within diagnostic groups (top 3 rows), and differences between A\u03b2 \u2212 CN and other combinations of diagnosis and A\u03b2 pathology (bottom 6 rows).

Our third main finding is that P-tau and VILIP-1 were highly associated with A\u03b2 pathology across clinical stages of AD, while YKL-40 was correlated with A\u03b2 pathology in CN and AD groups. Finally, baseline P-tau was only associated with worsening WMH (in A\u03b2-). VILIP-1 was associated with acceleration of cognitive decline (in A\u03b2+), hippocampal atrophy (in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2+), and expansion of ventricles (in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2+) in longitudinal analyses. YKL-40 was associated with hippocampal atrophy at baseline and follow-up (in A\u03b2+).\nThe disorder of calcium homeostasis is considered to be one of the main characteristics of the pathophysiology of AD, and the pathogenesis of AD is closely related to the calcium signaling pathway [27] . Therefore, VILIP-1, as a neuronal calcium sensor protein, might have a connection to the etiology of AD [27] . VILIP-1 is associated with calcium mediated neuronal damage and also participates in the changes in the pathological mechanism of homeostasis, which leads to the loss of neurons [27] . In the present study, the finding of higher levels of VILIP-1 in pMCI and AD compared with CN and sMCI is consistent with previous studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, another report has found that there is no significant increase of CSF VILIP-1 in patients with AD and MCI [16] . The reasons may be the cognitively normal group (n = 37) in that study was biased towards patients who showed decline (6 participants progressed to MCI and 4 participants to dementia) over 4 years, and the rate of APOE \u03b54 carriership (42%) in cognitively normal group was higher than reported in the previous studies (17-29%) [7, 9] . However, in the current study, we excluded the subjects who were diagnosed as CN at baseline, but converted to MCI or AD during follow-up, and the percentage of APOE \u03b54 carriership in CN is 15.6%. The increased CSF levels of pMCI and AD patients confirm the utility of VILIP-1 as a useful biomarker of neuronal injury. In this study, we found that the levels of CSF YKL-40 were not significantly increased in MCI and AD compared with CN. This is not consistent with some previous studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The possible reasons are: (1) Levels of YKL-40 in CSF are increased in stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other neurological disorders [28] [29] [30] [31] , indicating that it is not specific to AD but instead seems to be a more common marker for inflammation; (2) the sample size of this study is small, especially in the AD group.\nA previous study indicated that the diagnostic sensitivity of CSF VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/A\u03b242 to AD is comparable to CSF tau, p-tau, A\u03b242, and tau/A\u03b242 or p-tau/ A\u03b242, respectively [8] . We found that the three biomarkers identified AD versus CN after adjustment for age, gender, and education, while CSF p-tau had higher accuracy than VILIP-1 and YKL-40. Furthermore, combination of biomarkers did not improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to using p-tau alone. Although the triple combination of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 had the highest AUC, there were not statistically significant differences compared to p-tau, combination of p-tau and VILIP-1, and combination of p-tau and YKL-40. The combinations of biomarkers also did not increase the proportion of correctly classified people, but it was significantly improved when adjusting the models for demographics and CSF A\u03b242, especially only VILIP-1 or For sMCI versus pMCI, P-tau and VILIP-1 (but not YKL-40) were significant predictors, while the accuracies of sMCI were less than that of pMCI. Similarly, combination wasn't significantly better than p-tau alone. We speculate biomarkers to be less accurate in sMCI than in pMCI and AD because some sMCI patients may have non-AD disease that reduces biomarker specificity. As shown in Table 3 of this article, unadjusted age, gender, and education, p-tau and VILIP-1 still have diagnostic value for AD and pMCI. After adjusting for age, gender, and education, YKL-40 had diagnostic value for AD, but did not significantly improve the diagnostic value of p-tau and VILIP-1 for AD and pMCI (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Therefore, p-tau and VILIP-1 may have clinical value for AD and pMCI individuals.\nThe onset of AD is a dynamic pathophysiological process, starting from the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques, continuing with tau pathology, then structural changes in the brain, followed by memory loss, and clinical deterioration [32] . We found that p-tau and VILIP-1 were strongly associated with A\u03b2 pathology and the clinical stage of AD. Biomarkers and outcomes were standardized to z-scores. Abbreviations: VILIP-1, Visinin-like protein-1; YKL-40, Chitinase-3-like protein 1; AD, Alzheimer's disease P-tau was associated with A\u03b2 pathology within all diagnostic groups and had increased levels in CN A\u03b2+, sMCI A\u03b2+, pMCI A\u03b2+, and AD A\u03b2 + compared to CN A\u03b2-. VILIP-1 was associated with A\u03b2 pathology within pMCI group and had increased levels in pMCI A\u03b2 + and AD A\u03b2 + compared to CN A\u03b2-. However, YKL-40 was only associated with A\u03b2-pathology in CN group, and had increased levels in AD A\u03b2 + participants compared to CN A\u03b2-. All biomarkers were not associated with increased levels in sMCI A\u03b2-and pMCI A\u03b2-participants compared to CN A\u03b2-participants. It is interesting that VILIP-1 was not increased in the CN A\u03b2 + versus CN A\u03b2-, whereas p-tau and YKL-40 were. Among the correlations between CSF p-tau, VILIP-1, YKL-40, and A\u03b242, p-tau has the strongest correlation with VILP-1, therefore, we speculate VILIP-1 may be a disease marker that is downstream to tau pathology. Our results also demonstrated different relationships between biomarkers and different outcomes. In two longitudinal studies, results suggest that CSF VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/A\u03b242 ratio predict future cognitive impairment similarly to tau and tau/A\u03b242 ratio [8, 9] . The relationship between YKL-40 and cognitive function is controversial [16, 20] . To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study of the association of VILIP-1 and YKL-40 with structural MRI and WMH. In this study, VILIP-1 but not YKL-40 was associated with worsening MMSE over time. VILIP-1 primarily had negative associations with ventricle size in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2 + individuals, which was seen in longitudinal analyses of cognition (in A\u03b2+), hippocampal atrophy (in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2+), and expansion of ventricles (in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2+). YKL-40 was associated with hippocampal atrophy (in A\u03b2+) at baseline and follow-up and negatively associated with ventricle size in A\u03b2-at baseline. The above results suggest that VILIP-1 and YKL-40 may respond to neurodegeneration in AD. Unexpectedly, p-tau was hardly associated with cognition, hippocampal atrophy, and ventricular expansion at baseline and over time, except for a negative correlation with ventricular size and a correlation with worsening WMH at baseline. The reason for this is unknown, but further studies will be important to clarify the role of p-tau. We found negative correlations between p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 and ventricle size at baseline. A possible explanation for this is that p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 not only reflect neuronal damage, but also may be related to the function or transmission of normal neurons, which may lead to the relationship between high biomarker levels and small ventricle volume.\nThere are limitations to our study. This study did not include non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and did not have metabolism and neuropathology data. For the sMCI, this study only included participants who were stable for at least 2 years, and this may reduce the number of participants erroneously classified as stable because some participants would have progressed to AD with longer follow-up [33] . In addition, the ADNI database was volunteered by highly educated individuals for research focused on AD research. This may give rise to bias in choice because the study population is a self-selected individual who may have concerns about their cognition. Finally, the self-selectivity of our research population and the relatively small sample size of our research limit the generality of our findings to the wider community. Therefore, our findings will need to be validated in a larger population-based cohort."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, our results show that VILIP-1 or YKL-40 is not better than P-tau in the diagnostic accuracy for AD and MCI, and combinations of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 do not increase the diagnostic accuracy for CN versus AD and for sMCI versus pMCI, while p-tau and VILIP-1 have correlations to A\u03b2 pathology and the clinical stages of AD, and VILIP-1 and YKL-40 may respond to neurodegeneration in AD."}, {"section_title": "Additional file", "text": "Additional file 1: Table S1 .
