[{"section_title": "", "text": "www.balticsportscience.com introduction Among children and adolescents, obesity has substantially increased worldwide. A recent systematic review indicated that between 1980 and 2013, the prevalence of overweight or obese children and adolescents (ages 2-19 years) increased by nearly 50%. In 2013, approximately 23% of girls and 24% of boys living in developed countries and 13% of girls and 8% of boys in developing countries were found to be overweight or obese [1] . Obesity is associated with multiple physical and psychological health problems already in childhood as well as with co-morbidities later in life [2] . Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge [1] .\nThe observed increase in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity is a likely consequence of a change in physical activity (PA) and nutrition patterns over time [3] . Adequate PA, together with healthy weight, is a protective factor against many health problems. PA has beneficial effects on adiposity, musculoskeletal health and fitness, and several components of cardiovascular health in children and adolescents [4] . Moreover, data from observational studies indicate dose-response relationships -the more PA, the greater the health benefits, and results from intervention trials show that even modest amounts of PA can have health benefits in obese youth [4] .\nOverall, low levels of PA are a potential cause and consequence of obesity, and it has been hypothesized that poor competence in fundamental movement skills (FMS) may be an important factor in this process. Low levels of PA lead to weight gain and a further reduction in PA because obesity may restrain the development of FMS and further decrease the motivation to participate in physical activities, which in turn increases weight gain [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nFMS are an important part of human life, and they are interrelated with a child's physical, cognitive and social development [9] . FMS are considered to be the building blocks for movement and provide the foundation for specialized and sport-specific motor skills required for participation in a variety of physical activities. FMS are categorized as locomotor (e.g. run, hop, jump, leap), object-control (e.g. throw, catch, kick, strike), and stability (dynamic and static balance) skills [6] . Although motor development is a process continuing throughout life, early childhood is the optimal phase to learn and develop FMS [6] . This development is established through an interactive process of aspects related to the individual, the task and the environment. These aspects include biological and demographic factors, behavioral attributes and skills, cognitive, emotional and psychological factors, cultural and social factors and physical environmental factors [10] .\nDespite increasing interest in recent years in childhood overweight and obesity and their relationship to health-related fitness and motor competence, the association between weight status and FMS has not been comprehensively examined. Earlier reviews have examined associations of FMS competency with potential psychological, physiological and behavioral health benefits [11] , between motor competence and health-related physical fitness [12] , and motor competence and its effect on positive developmental trajectories of health [7] . In those reviews, assessments describing and defining motor skills varied and fitness components other than solely FMS were also measured.\nThe purpose of this systematic review was to give an overview of studies providing evidence for a relationship between FMS performance and weight status (healthy weight, overweight and obesity) in children."}, {"section_title": "material and methods identification of studies", "text": "A systematic search of five electronic databases (MEDLINE (PubMed), SportDiscus, ERIC, PsycInfo and SCOPUS) was conducted in January 2015 by an experienced informatician.

The searches were conducted using single and combined terms. Only articles published in English in reviewed journals were considered for review."}, {"section_title": "criteria for inclusion and exclusion", "text": "Titles and abstracts of the potentially relevant references were checked after removal of duplicates and then the full-text copies of potentially relevant citations were obtained. Then the two authors (SS and AS) independently reviewed the full-text articles and assessed the eligibility of the studies for inclusion ( Figure  1 ). The inclusion criteria were the following: (a) participants were aged 3-12 years; (b) at least two FMS were assessed and the FMS measurement used was identified as a process-or product-oriented measurement; (c) a summary of FMS performance (reported as a total FMS score, object control score or locomotor score) was included in the analysis; (d) a quantitative analysis of the relationship between FMS and weight status were found; (e) only gross motor skills were assessed and a fine motor skills score was not included in analyses; and (f) the study was published in peer-reviewed journals in English. This review did not include studies with special populations or subjects with underweight, intervention studies or studies that evaluated only overweight/ obese children/adolescents, fine motor skills, health-related fitness or motor abilities. If there was uncertainty about including an article, the article in question was reviewed again together by two of the authors (SS and AS) until a final decision was made. Ultimately, 14 unique citations met the eligibility criteria (Table 1) . Table 2 ). The criteria for assessing the quality of the studies were adopted from Lubans et al. [11] based on the STROBE [13] and CONSORT [14] statements. A quality score for each study was completed on a six-point scale by assigning a value of 0 (absent or inadequately described) or 1 (explicitly described and present) to each of the following questions listed: (a) Did the study describe the participants' eligibility criteria? (b) Were the participants randomly selected? (c) Did the study report the details of FMS assessment and did the instruments have acceptable reliability for the specific age group? (d) Did all of the methods have acceptable reliability? (e) Did the study report a power calculation and was the study adequately powered to detect hypothesized relationships? (f) Did the study report the numbers of individuals who completed each of the different measures and complete at least 80% of them? Studies that scored 0-2 were classified as low quality, 3-4 as medium quality and 5-6 as high quality. The relationship between FMS performance and weight status was determined by examining the percentage of studies that reported a statistically significant relationship (Table 3) . Results were coded using the method earlier used by Lubans et al.

FMS and weight status Balt J Health Phys Act 2017;9(2):115-127 discussion FMS are natural part of human life and important for a child's physical, cognitive and social development. In addition, experiences support learning and development of FMS and the foundations of these skills are created in early childhood. It has been hypothesized that better FMS performance is essential to encourage a physically active lifestyle, which for its part leads to healthy weight status [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nThe purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between FMS performance and weight status (healthy weight, overweight and obesity) in children aged 3-12 years. Overall there was an inverse but weak association between FMS and weight status. Seven (58%) of the studies found a statistically significant inverse association between FMS total score and BMI, and five (42%) studies found no association. In those studies using WC for establishing weight status, an inverse association was found in two of the three studies (67%) and in the one study, which used skinfolds, found no significant association. In one study DXA was used and a statistically significant inverse association was found between FMS performance and weight status.\nEight studies used process-oriented tests and four studies used product-oriented tests for assessing FMS. Half of the studies, which used process oriented tests and three of four studies which used product-oriented tests, found significant inverse association between FMS and weight status (BMI). Product-oriented (quantitative) assessment techniques evaluate the outcome of the movement skills and are based on the time, distance or number of successful attempts resulting from the performance of the skill but process-oriented (qualitative) assessment techniques evaluate the form of the movement skills [31] . Processoriented assessments may be more suitable when assessing overweight and obese children because they more accurately identify specific characteristics of the movement, reflecting the developmental skill level instead of maturational levels and physical growth of children.\nIn those studies where FMS was partitioned into locomotor skills, objectcontrol skills or stability, inverse associations between FMS proficiency and weight status were mostly found in locomotor skills rather than object-control skills or stability. It has been suggested that biomechanical factors associated with high body mass, such as lower limb problems, may be one reason that overweight and obese children have greater difficulty in performing locomotor skills [32, 33] .\nBased on this systematic review, the relationship between FMS and weight status in children is still unclear. This is contrary to the conclusions of the two earlier reviews [11, 12] . The explanation may be that assessment methods describing and defining motor skills varied and also components of healthrelated fitness (e.g. cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness) and motor ability (e.g. speed, power, explosive strength) were measured in those reviews. Motor skills are sometimes confused with fitness abilities but are different. In our review we wanted to restrict to FMS, which are the foundation movements for more complex and specialized skills required in various physical activities and everyday life from childhood years to later in life.\nIn all the studies body weight status was established using BMI. In addition, skinfold thickness was measured in one study [22] , WC in three studies [22] [23] [24] and only in one study [23] DXA was used to measure abdominal fat percentage and total body fat percentage. As body fatness and specifically abdominal fatness are associated with less favorable cardiovascular risk factor status in children and adolescents [34] , it is important to assess weight status using more accurate methods than only BMI in order to obtain more precise evidence for a relationship between FMS performance and weight status in children. BMI is based on weight and does not differentiate between fat mass (adipose tissue) and lean mass (mostly muscle tissue) and, therefore, it is an imperfect measure of either fatness or thinness. In children BMI correlates with fat mass more strongly among heavy (where fat mass makes up a larger proportion of weight) than among thin children [35] . So in thin children BMI is a better predictor of lean mass than fat mass. Both BMI and WC are proxy measures and should not be considered as accurate measures of total body or abdominal fat [36] comparable with the measurement of body composition by more sophisticated methods such as DXA. DXA can be used to evaluate childhood obesity and determine fat mass [37] , and it has increasingly been suggested and used as a criterion or a reference method for comparing other measurements of body composition [38] . In most of the studies included, obese or overweight children were compared to those with healthy weight, while potential differences between healthy weight and underweight were not taken into consideration. There is lack of studies in underweight children and adolescents, and incomplete understanding of health consequences of underweight [39] and, therefore, a need for studies where underweight is included."}, {"section_title": "limitations", "text": "This review has limitations. Longitudinal and intervention studies were not included in this review. The limitations of cross-sectional study designs prevent making definitive conclusions regarding causality relating to the development of FMS and weight status. The use of BMI as a measure of body weight status in all the studies in this review limits our understanding of the contributory effects of overall increased mass (i.e. body fat mass and lean mass) to FMS. One limitation is the fact that there were only 12 eligible studies on which our results are based on and the quality of the studies varied. Comparisons between studies were partly difficult due to the methodological heterogeneity and different methods used for assessing FMS performance and weight status.\nOur goal was to restrict the studies included to those, which clearly measured FMS, but some product-oriented tests likely evaluated motor abilities more than they did FMS."}, {"section_title": "conclusions", "text": "The results of this systematic review indicate that the relationship between overall FMS proficiency and weight status in children aged 3-12 years is still unclear. However, the significant inverse relationship found between FMS proficiency and WC and especially with objectively measured abdominal fat percentage and overall body fat percentage, suggest that competency in FMS may have important health consequences."}, {"section_title": "www.balticsportscience.com", "text": "There is a need for studies where body composition is more accurately measured with, for example, DXA. The use of BMI as an only measure of weight status limits the understanding of the contributory effects of overall increased mass (i.e. lean mass and body fat mass) to FMS. In addition, FMS should be assessed with qualitative tests, which focus on the technique of the movement. Also measurement of FMS needs more standardized and global methods. Research on FMS development and performance in developing children is scarce and rather dispersed and there is a shortage of updated information on movement skill development and performance especially in European children [40] . There are very few longitudinal studies in the area of childhood FMS, weight status and physical activity [41, 42] and longitudinal and long-term intervention studies from early childhood years would also better clarify the influence of FMS development on weight status. This kind of knowledge would help health care personnel and kindergarten and school physical education teachers to prevent development of overweight, and when needed, tailor intervention for individual needs.\nreferences"}]
