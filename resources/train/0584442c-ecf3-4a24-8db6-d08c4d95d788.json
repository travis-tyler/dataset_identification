Knowledge of age-related body composition and fat distribution changes will help us to better understand the relationships between obesity, morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Review of the literature supports that central fat and relative loss of fat-free mass may become relatively more important than BMI in determining the health risk associated with obesity in older ages. Weight gain or fat redistribution in older age may still confer adverse health risks (for earlier mortality, comorbidities conferring independent adverse health risks, or for functional decline). Evaluation of comorbidity and weight history should be performed in the elderly in order to generate a comprehensive assessment of the potential adverse health effects of overweight or obesity. The risks of obesity in the elderly have been underestimated by a number of confounders such as survival effect, competing mortalities, relatively shortened life expectancy in older persons, smoking, weight change and unintentional weight loss. Identification of elderly subjects with sarcopenic obesity is probably clinically relevant, but the definition of sarcopenic obesity, the benefits of its clinical identification, as well as its relation to clinical consequences require further study. Studies on the effect of voluntary weight loss in the elderly are scarce, but they suggest that even small amounts of weight loss (between 5-10% of initial body weight) may be beneficial.

Obesity prevalence is growing progressively even in old age. Great controversy exists about the harm of obesity in the elderly. Debate persists about the relation between obesity in old age and total or disease-specific mortality, the definition of obesity in the elderly, its clinical relevance and about the need for its treatment.\nThe aim of this review is to report and comment upon the findings of recent papers that have investigated the problem of obesity in the elderly, as well as to expand these findings in the light of common clinical implications of obesity in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence of obesity in the elderly", "text": "Elderly people, defined as persons 465 y of age, represent a large part of populations in developed countries, accounting for 15% of the population in Western European countries and USA; this proportion is projected to increase to 26% by 2025. 5 The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing among older age groups in developed countries, 3, 4, 11, 12 in both sexes, all ages, all races, all educational levels, both smokers and nonsmokers; 3, 13 an increase in BMI has been observed even among people with the highest levels of BMI. 14 In women aged 60-69 y, the highest prevalence in the period 1999-2000 was 42.5%, with an increase of 12.7% compared to the period 1988-1994 (NHANES III), 31 .9% in those aged 70-79 y and 19.5% in those aged 80 y or older. In men aged 60-69 y, the prevalence of obesity was 38.1%, with an increase of 13.3% compared to NHANES III, 28 .9% in those aged 70-79 y and 9.6% in those aged 80 y or older. 3 The prevalence of obesity in the elderly Americans in 2010 was also estimated using as data four consecutive, nationally representative surveys of US adults: from the most optimistic to the most pessimistic scenarios obesity prevalence in people aged 60 y or older could rise in 2010 by 33 .6% in the best-case estimate to 39.6% in the worst-case estimate. 15 Obesity prevalence among the elderly in Europe appears to be lower than in USA. In the United Kingdom, nearly 30% of women and 28% of men aged 55-65 y are obese; 25% of women and 18% of men aged 65-75 y, and 22% of women and 12% of men aged 75 y or older. 16 The decline in obesity prevalence in people older than 70 y may be due to selective mortality of people in their 50s and 60s, such that relatively fewer obese people survive until older ages. Because aging and obesity are two conditions that represent an important part of health-care spending, an increasingly obese elderly population will undoubtedly represent a growing financial problem in health-care systems in developed countries. 15 "}, {"section_title": "Effects of aging on body composition and fat distribution", "text": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that body composition changes with aging, with an increase in fat mass and a decrease in muscle mass. [17] [18] [19] Even without body weight changes, the amount of fat significantly increases with age. 20 It has been shown that in men and women, in normal weight and in obese subjects, body weight tends to increase, peaking at about age 65 y in men and later in women, and then decreasing with further aging. 21 Body fat distribution also changes with age. In a longitudinal analysis of 1302 Swedish women aged 38-66 y, Noppa et al 22 showed that waist circumference increased about 0.7 cm per year with no difference across agestrataFthat is, even the oldest continued to have progressive increases in waist circumference. Similar results were reported for US men and women cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 23, 24 In agreement with these findings, years ago, Borkan et al, 25 using computed tomography (CT) to compare body fat distribution in 21 middle-aged men with that of 20 older men, reported significantly higher amounts of visceral abdominal fat in the older men even though they weighed 8.2 kg less than the middle-aged men. Kotani et al, 26 also using CT to evaluate regional body fat distribution in 66 men and 96 women with BMI 425 kg/m 2 , observed that intraabdominal fat volume increased with age, while fat in the abdomen as well in thighs and calves decreased.\nUsing CT to evaluate body fat distribution in a wide sample of obese women, we have also observed an agedependent increase in visceral abdominal fat, and decrease in subcutaneous abdominal fat despite no significant BMI changes. 27 Recently, Goodpaster et al showed in a wide sample of subjects older than 70 y of the Health ABC study, using CT at the mid-thigh level, that aging also increases the amount of fat inside and around muscles. 28 In the same sample, they found that, in the older subjects and in those with higher BMI, a greater amount of fat was distributed inside the muscle tissue. 28 Thus, aging is associated with fat redistribution changes in the amount and deposition of body fat in several regions of the human body; visceral fat increases, while subcutaneous fat in other regions of the body (abdomen, thigh, calves) decreases. Accumulation of intra-abdominal fat even without body weight increase seems to persist even in old stable weight men and women. 29, 30 Obesity and aging are also associated with fat redistribution into muscle. Subcutaneous fat, however, increases with increasing BMI, but nonetheless decreases with aging. Table 1 summarizes these divergent effects of obesity and aging on fat subcompartments."}, {"section_title": "Matters of debate", "text": "Given the current increased prevalence of obesity at every age, as well as an increasing prevalence of older-aged persons in industrialized populations, the problem of obesity in the elderly is becoming of greater relevance and will require more attention by researchers and physicians.\nKnowledge of age-related body composition and fat distribution changes will help us to better understand the relationships between obesity, morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Application of technologies to evaluate body composition and fat distribution in clinical and epidemiological studies offers valuable tools to enable us to separate the effects of age-related changes in fat mass, visceral fat, lean body mass and bone on health risk in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Obesity and aging M Zamboni et al", "text": "However, US and World Health Organization guidelines for identification and treatment of obesity have not given any specific guidance about how to apply anthropometric or imaging data thresholds to define obesity in the elderly. 31, 32 In these guidelines, only a few sentences were addressed to the problem of obesity in the elderly, even though the elderly are increasingly prevalent, and simple use of BMI thresholds does not capture the true impact of excess body fat in the elderly. Current guidelines suggest to use BMI at all ages to define obesity, and recommend the same cutoff values of BMI in the elderly as in younger adults. 31 33 Clearly, the definition of obesity in the elderly is still a matter of debate. In the following sections, we focus on two major unresolved questions: the first concerning the definition of obesity in the elderly, and the second about which level of BMI is associated with lower mortality in older subjects. These unresolved questions give rise to two additional areas of debate: whether obesity is associated with comorbidity and disability in the elderly, and whether voluntary weight loss is beneficial to health in the elderly. In the following sections, we review recent literature to address these four unresolved questions.\nFirst question: What is an appropriate definition of obesity in the elderly? Obesity should be defined as the amount of excess fat storage associated with elevated health risk. For this practical definition, BMI has been largely used in younger adults as well in older ages.\nBMI is a well-accepted surrogate of body fat; 34 it is a composite index of total body weight accounting for height. However, body composition changes may influence its use in the elderly, as aging may modify both the numerator (weight) and denominator (height) of this index.\nAge-dependent denominator change. Several studies showed age-related decline in height, probably because of spinal deformity with thinning of the inter-vertebral discs as well as loss of vertebral body height due to osteoporosis. 17, [35] [36] [37] The cumulative height loss from age 30 to 70 y has been demonstrated to average about 3 cm for men and 5 cm for women; by the age 80 y it increased to 5 cm for men and 8 cm for women. 35 Substantial age-related height loss was also observed in a prospective study conducted in Elderly European born in 1913-1918. 36 Age-dependent height decrease may induce a false BMI increase of 1.5 kg/m 2 in men and 2.5 kg/m 2 in women across aging, despite minimal changes in body weight. 35 As a consequence of age-dependent height decrease, an incorrect overestimation of adiposity could be a consequence of using BMI to classify obesity in the elderly.\nAge-dependent numerator change. Body weight in old people reflects a higher amount of total fat because of agedependent loss of lean body mass. For example, a typical 25-y-old subject may increase his body fat percentage from 15 to 29% over the next 50 y at constant BMI. 20 As a consequence of age-dependent increase and redistribution of fat inside the body, BMI in the elderly could underestimate the adiposity. Thus, aging influences, in opposite directions, both the numerator and denominator of BMI.\nTo bypass the effect of age on height, as well as for the impossibility in some circumstances to obtain a measurement of height (ie in an elderly person lying in bed), the use of leg length as surrogate of height in order to calculate BMI has been proposed. 38 This method has not, however, gained widespread acceptance.\nTo better determine the degree of fat mass, and to better categorize obesity in the elderly, radiological measurements of fat compartments of the body have been suggested.\nEvaluation of fat mass using these techniques may not always be feasible in the clinical setting, and so indices of fat distribution may be the most appropriate fatness indices in the elderly.\nIn the past few years, waist circumference has been proposed as surrogate of regional distribution of fat. [39] [40] [41] [42] Waist circumference has been shown in the elderly to be easy to measure and strongly related to both visceral and total fat, as evaluated by CT. 43 Elevated waist circumference alone, or together with BMI, may be a better definition of obesity in the elderly. Waist circumference cutoff points of 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women have been suggested for adults to 44 However, these waist circumference cutoff points still need to be more thoroughly validated as predictors of morbility and mortality in older ages. 31, 32 Measurement of sagittal abdominal diameter (ie the largest supine abdominal antero-posterior diameter between xyphoid process and umbilicus as evaluated with supine subjects) may offer an alternative to waist circumference because of its potentially higher inter-and intra-observer precision 45 and because of its association with CVD risk factors, independently of BMI. 40 Second question: what level of BMI is associated with lower mortality in older subjects?\nThe criteria for identifying health-related weight ranges should be a function of a range of BMI associated with lower mortality. 46 However, the relationship between overweight and mortality in the elderly remains controversial. evaluating the relation between obesity and mortality in the elderly published, from 1966 to 1999. They searched Medline, and from 444 papers they presented data from 13 studies on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: subjects older than 65 y, age adjustment performed, inclusion of at least 100 subjects, adjustments for smoking, baseline health status, and selection of nonhospitalized subjects. From their summary of these data, Heiat et al 67 concluded that current data did not support mild to moderate overweight to be associated with higher mortality in the elderly. The majority of studies supported obesity as a risk factor for mortality in elderly subjects, but in Heiat et al's review 67 higher BMI values were consistent with a smaller relative mortality risk in elderly persons compared with young and middle-aged populations.\nIn Table 2 we have summarized the most recent studies (published from 1997 to 2004 with at least 4.5 y of followup) [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] that considered the relationship between BMI and mortality. Interpretation of these data is complicated by variation across studies in the outcome considered, confounders accounted for in the analysis (especially control for smoking and concurrent illness), the measure of obesity considered and the length of study follow-up.\n1FTotal mortality vs cause-specific mortality. The relation of obesity in old age with total mortality seems to be less clear than that between obesity and cardiovascular mortality and, in particular, coronary artery disease mortality. For example, in the IOWA Women's Study, significant positive relationships were observed between both BMI and WHR with coronary artery disease mortality, while a linear relation between WHR, but not BMI, and total mortality was observed. 55 Among the 20 papers listed in Table 2 , only eight evaluated cause-specific mortality in addition to or instead of total mortality.\n2FSmoking. Almost all the studies reported in Table 2 considered the importance of smoking. It is well known that smokers are thinner 68 and have an elevated mortality compared with nonsmokers. 69 This association could explain data presented in several studies demonstrating an association between lower body weight and increased mortality. Most studies have included some adjustment for smoking status. There is a debate concerning the correct methodology, with some advocating exclusion of smokers from the study and others supporting simply accounting for smoking history in the model or accounting for different patterns of smoking, including number of cigarettes, depth of inhalation or pack-years of smoking. As shown in Table 2 , even the studies that considered the smoking status as a confounding factor have reported different results. However, when only people who never smoked were studied, two studies out of three 48, 60, 63 observed linear relation between BMI and mortality among older subjects, suggesting that increased mortality associated with the lowest weights were a function of cigarette smoking, and that, among never-smokers, very low weights were associated with the greatest longevity.\n3FThe survival effect. It has been argued that the obesitymortality relationship gradually flattens with age because those susceptible to the effects of overweight have died. 70, 71 The group of overweight or obese older persons are said to be relatively 'resistant' survivors. 5 Although this has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds, it is unclear if this is the only explanation for the decline in the prevalence of obesity in older age. Cardiovascular mortality, an obesityrelated condition, is the leading cause of death in old age; overweight older persons have many symptoms consistent with weight-related diseases and ascribe disability to overweight. 72 In the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry Study, the proportion of subjects surviving to 65 y ranged from 80% (if obese) to 89% (if normal-weight) for men and from 91% (if obese) to 95% (if normal-weight) for women. 64, 73 These high proportions of subjects overweight or obese earlier in life who survive until old age may still live to experience deleterious consequences of obesity in older age. 73 Thus, these individuals are not completely resistant to the adverse health effects of obesity. In addition, overweight and obesity in young adulthood and middle age may have long-term adverse effects on heath-care costs in\nObesity and aging M Zamboni et al \nolder age (as evaluated by CVD, diabetes and total Medicare charges). 73 Thus, the putative 'survival effect' may contribute to an underestimate of the relation between obesity and mortality in the elderly, when populations of old 'survivors' are studied in which the relation between BMI and mortality may be partially lost. 4FShort lifespan. The higher the age, the shorter the remaining lifespan for persons regardless of degree of obesity. Since most obesity-related consequences take years to develop even among susceptible individuals, those who become obese in old age may die of non-obesity-related conditions before the adverse effects of obesity become apparent. Over short periods of follow-up, underweight, not obesity, is a predictor of mortality in frail hospitalized elderly. 74 However, it is probable that even recent onset of obesity in old age may worsen clinical conditions such as congestive heart failure or physical disability, and thus be associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, the age of onset of obesity, history of obesity, and number of years of overweight will have an impact on health risks of obesity in old age. None of the studies included in Table 2 was able to adequately take into account these variables, and thus further studies are needed to more accurately estimate the health effects of obesity in the elderly.\n5FPhysical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. It is well known that increased physical exercise is associated with decreased mortality risk in middle-aged as well as in older people. 75 Physical exercise is usually associated with lower body fat and better cardio-respiratory fitness. Lee et al 76 evaluated the joint and separate effects of fatness and cardio-respiratory fitness on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk in a large sample of middle-aged men followed for 8 y. They observed higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in obese unfit subjects than in lean fit subjects, as well as higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in lean unfit subjects than in obese fit subjects. The findings of the study seem to suggest that the level of cardio-respiratory fitness is more important than the amount of body fat in predicting the risk of mortality. This remains an area of controversy, but few studies have level of fitness data that would allow this to be adequately assessed, and none have provided data on health effects in the elderly.\n6FWeight change. It has been observed repeatedly that weight change, both weight loss and weight gain, is a strong predictor of mortality. 77 Peters et al, 78 in a prospective follow-up (15 y) study of 6441 men aged 40-59 y at baseline, found lower mortality in stable weight subjects than in those with weight fluctuations or weight increase. Newman et al 79 found that even a modest decline in body weight in old ages increases the risk of mortality, even accounting for baseline body weight.\nHarris et al, 80 in a large sample of men and women with mean age 77 y free of coronary artery disease in 1982-84, observed that thinner older people who lost weight between middle age to old age and heavier people who gained weight between middle age to old age had an increased risk of coronary artery disease, compared with thinner subjects with stable weight. The real significance of weight loss in the elderly is quite often unclear. The differentiation between intentional and unintentional weight loss may have some important implications in the evaluation of weight loss effects on mortality. Wannamethee et al 81 investigated the characteristics of older men who lost weight intentionally or unintentionally. They found a significantly greater prevalence of smoking, disability, cancer and respiratory disease, but less obesity and less physical activity in the group of men who lost weight unintentionally compared with those who lost weight intentionally.\nMore recently, it has been observed that even among middle-aged subjects involuntary weight loss was associated with higher than 8 y mortality, compared with weight stability; voluntary weight loss was not associated with higher mortality. 82 There is no doubt that in the majority of cases weight loss occurring in the elderly is not voluntary and reflects the presence of underlying disease. It is also true that most of these data are based on population-level epidemiological studies in which it may be very difficult to separate intentional and unintentional weight loss, even when people are asked specifically about reasons for weight loss. There are no clinical trials of the health effects of experimental weight loss that included older persons on which recommendations concerning voluntary versus involuntary weight loss can be based.\nSeven [48] [49] [50] 53, 54, 59, 66 out of 20 studies presented in Table 2 were able to take into account weight changes in the relation between obesity and mortality. However, six 48, 49, 53, 54, 59, 66 out of seven showed lower mortality in subjects with lower BMI, or at least a U-shaped relation between BMI and mortality. It is important to note that none of these studies were able to distinguish between intentional and unintentional weight loss.\n7FUnderlying diseases. Exclusion of people with a history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, or repeating analyses after exclusion of subjects who died within 1, 2 or more years of follow-up, is one methods that has been used to clarify the probable spurious inverse relation between low body weight and increased mortality ( Table 2) . Underlying diseases that can themselves increase the risk of early mortality may induce underestimation of the relation between obesity and mortality in the elderly. As some of these diseases may be induced by obesity (for instance, the association between obesity and cancer) or may induce weight loss (for instance, the association between obesity and poorly controlled Obesity and aging M Zamboni et al diabetes), interpretation of the effects of underlying disease with weight loss and risk of mortality may be difficult.\n8FLength of follow-up. Obesity even in younger ages requires many years to show its harmful effects on health. 83 Studies with short follow-up generally do not show associations between obesity and mortality in the elderly, while studies with longer follow-up show significant associations. The longer the follow-up, the greater the need to account for the effect of confounding factors and in particular the effect of voluntary vs involuntary weight loss: the majority of the studies reported in 9FFat distribution. Indices of fat distribution show a greater association with specific and total mortality in the elderly than BMI. 51, 55, 58, 60 Even in studies with short followup, larger waist and waist-to-hip ratio were significantly associated with mortality in older subjects, whilst BMI was not. 84 Unfortunately, all these studies used surrogates of fat distribution and no studies were able to evaluate prospectively the association between age-related visceral fat and increased mortality in the elderly. Recently a 4.6-y prospective analysis of the Health ABC study reported a strong association between the amount of visceral fat as evaluated by CT at the abdominal level and incident myocardial infarction in women, but not in men. 85 These findings are in line with that obtained in a younger population study with a 10-y follow-up, 86 thus confirming that even in old age visceral fat (more than total fat) is the main correlate of cardiovascular diseases. In summary, there are many confounding variables in the association between obesity and mortality in the elderly. Since confounding effects accumulate over the lifetime, it is difficult to accurately measure and account for these factors. Consequently, the interpretation of the relationship between BMI and mortality in the elderly is quite complex. It is possible to speculate that interpretation of the findings of current data and its application in clinical practice could mislead to an underestimate of the adverse health effects of obesity in older persons. Also, as obesity acts on cardiovascular mortality in part through high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, aggressive treatment of these consequences of obesity may further minimize the relationship between obesity and mortality in the elderly.\nAs a further consideration, it may be that characteristics of people becoming older now are different than those of years ago and could be even more different in the future. Life expectancy is increasing even in older ages and this fact itself could induce some difficulty when evaluating the relation between obesity and mortality in the elderly. Noteworthy, a 6-y lesser life expectancy in obese subjects aged 30-49 y has been observed 87 as well as a reduction of life expectancy free of disability compared with normal-weight subjects. 88 Thus, these findings suggest that the increased prevalence of obesity in middle-age as in older age may counteract the expected increase of life expectancy of normal-weight subjects.\nThird question: is obesity associated with comorbidity and disability in the elderly? Mortality is not the only end point that should be considered in the evaluation of the impact of overweight and obesity on health status in older people. Obesity has been recognized to be associated with several disorders that confer morbidity and may also be related to increased mortality. 6, 7 Metabolic syndrome. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that obesity, and more importantly body fat distribution, are associated with metabolic alterations even in old ages.\nSeidell et al 89 demonstrated in 981 male participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging that sagittal diameter, anthropometrically determined, was positively associated with fasting triglyceride and glucose levels, even after adjustment for age and BMI. showed that central fat distribution indices were positively correlated with lipid levels, independently of BMI and weight. We observed that both in women and in men waist or sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), independently of BMI, correlated with CVD risk factors; 10% of the variance in CVD risk factors in our older subjects was explained by using anthropometric indices of fat distribution. 40 Iwao et al 91 reported significant associations between waist and coronary risk factor abnormalities. 91 They found a significant correlation among BMI, waist circumference and the risk factors (blood pressure, glucose levels, dyslipidaemia) in young as well as in older people. 91 In the Iowa Women Health Study, a sample of over 30 000 women with age ranging from 55 to 69 y and a mean followup of 10 y, both BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, were significant predictors of incident diabetes and hypertension. 55 In addition, in younger as well as older subjects, obesity and fat distribution indices are linked not just to individual metabolic abnormalities but also to the co-occurrence of metabolic alterations, the so-called Metabolic Syndrome.\nThe Metabolic Syndrome (as defined by the concomitant presence of at least three of the following characteristics: waist greater than 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lower than 1 mmol/L in men and 1.3 in women, serum triglycerides greater than 1.7 mmol/L, blood pressure greater than 130/85 mmHg, and serum glucose greater than 6.1 mmol/L) 92 is more common Obesity and aging M Zamboni et al in older than in younger subjects; its prevalence increases with aging, raising from about 4% at the age of 20 y to almost 50% at the age of 60 y. 93 The age-related increase in fat and more importantly in visceral fat could be be the main causative factor of the increased prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in the elderly. Peptides produced by adipocytes, in addition to total visceral fat amount, might explain the high prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in older ages. 94 We recently observed that leptin in older ages is associated to several components of the metabolic syndrome and in particular is associated with insulin levels and insulin resistance independently of age and fat distribution. 95 Obesity and disability. In addition to metabolic risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, body weight and BMI play a significant role in non-fatal physical disability in the elderly. Galanos et al 96 reported a J-shape relation between BMI and disability, as evaluated by a battery of 26 items in a wide study sample of subjects with age ranging from 65 to 85 y; they observed greater disability for both low and high values of BMI in both sexes. 96 Launer et al, 97 in 698 young-old women (aged 45-59 y) and 426 old-old women (aged 60-74 y) with 2-14 y followup, showed that historically high values of BMI (evaluated at the beginning of follow-up) as well as recent high values of BMI (evaluated 4 y before the detection of disability) were strong predictors of disability and mortality both in youngold and in old-old women.\nThe relation between the two major components of body composition has been also examined, showing that agerelated loss of muscle mass may be responsible for disability independent of increased fat mass. 98, 99 In a sample of women and men aged 72-95 y the association between fat mass (as evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and overall disability and mobility disability was observed, while no relations were observed between fat-free (muscle) mass and disability. 100 We confirmed and expanded these findings, observing associations between fat mass and mobility disability even after adjusting for osteoarthritis (OA)."}, {"section_title": "101", "text": "High body fatness has also been shown to be a predictor of incident disability in a 3-y follow-up study of 2714 old women and 2095 men years without disability at the beginning of the study. 102 Vita et al 72 prospectively studied 1741 alumni of University of Pennsylvania, born from 1913 to 1925 over a period of 32 y. They evaluated each subject's cumulative physical disability risk in relation to three potential modifiable risk factors: smoking, BMI and physical exercise. 72 They observed that, in the group with the lowest level of risk, the onset of disability was postponed by about 5 y. In the highrisk group (BMI higher than 26 kg/m 2 , smoking more than 30 cigarettes a day, and without regular physical exercise), the onset of disability occurred 7 y earlier as compared with the low-risk group. These data must be interpreted with caution, as it was not possible to isolate the effect on disability of obesity independent of the other risk factors. However, it seems possible to speculate that stable or normal weight across ages may be associated with a lower risk of future disability.\nAssociation between overweight and obesity with disability in older age is further relevant, as it has been shown that disability itself is predictive of earlier mortality. 103 Osteoarthritis. The prevalence of OA, a typical disease of older persons, increases progressively with age in both sexes 104 in parallel with the increase in body weight and adipose tissue observed with aging. Several cross-sectional studies have consistently described an increased risk of knee OA in overweight and obese elderly subjects. [105] [106] [107] [108] In data from NHANES I, obese men and women had 4.8-and 4-fold increased risks, respectively, of OA compared to normalweight subjects. 105 Similarly, in the Baltimore Longitudinal\nStudy on Aging, subjects in the highest tertile of BMI showed an increased risk of both unilateral and bilateral knee OA. 106 Recently, in a population-based study of 525 men and women, with a mean age of 73, consecutively listed for surgical treatment of knee OA, and 525 controls, the relative risk of developing knee OA increased from 0.1 for a BMI lower than 20 kg/m 2 to 13.6 for a BMI of 36 kg/m 2 or higher. 108 Several longitudinal studies support a role for overweight and obesity in the onset of OA. [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] Being overweight at an average age of 37 y increased the risk of developing knee OA at a mean age of 73 y; 109 approximately 25% of subjects normal-weight at baseline developed OA against 50% of overweight subjects. 109 In another recent study, male medical students with a BMI higher than 25 kg/m 2 , between the ages of 20 and 29 y, had a three-fold increased risk of developing symptomatic knee OA by the time they reached age 60 y. 113 There are few studies that suggest that weight loss may prevent the development or worsening of knee OA in the elderly; [114] [115] most of these studies are not randomized controlled trials and do not provide data for control of potential confounding factors. In the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study, 114 overweight women who had lost an average of 11 lbs (about 5 kg or 2 U of BMI) decreased the risk of new symptomatic knee OA by 50% compared with overweight women whose weight was stable. The mechanisms linking overweight and obesity to OA are primarily an increased load across the joint during activity, increasing stress on cartilage and inducing tissue breakdown leading to OA. However this mechanism does not seem to explain the relation of weight and OA at non-weight-bearing sites."}, {"section_title": "116", "text": "In the obese or overweight elderly people, one of the main outcomes for OA management should be the prevention of pain, functional limitation and disability. In fact, OA itself is one of the main causes of disability in the elderly: 117 Obesity and aging M Zamboni et al however, in the elderly, the presence of both OA and obesity significantly increases the risk to develop disability.\nPulmonary complications and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Several studies have shown that the prevalence of OSAS increases with age. [118] [119] [120] [121] The prevalence of OSAS in subjects older than 65 y has been estimated to be 2-3-fold higher than that of middle-age subjects. 118 However this increase plateaus after age 65."}, {"section_title": "119", "text": "It is known that obesity is the strongest predictor of OSAS. 122 Compared to the other factors, BMI is twice as strong as gender and four-fold stronger than age in predicting OSAS. 122 However, it has been hypothesized that OSAS in the elderly is a condition distinct from that in middle age, 118 and thus it is not clear how and if obesity and aging interact to the increased risk of OSAS in old age. 123 High amount of fat located in the chest, in the neck, as well as in the abdomen, has been clearly shown to be associated with higher risk of OSAS:\n122 thus, age-related body composition changes (ie increase visceral adiposity, increase or constant chest adiposity, and not least decrease muscle mass and muscle strength) may be a determinant of the increased prevalence of OSAS in the elderly. Interestingly, in a 30-y follow-up, study age, baseline waist circumference, as well as waist changes, were the most powerful predictors of OSAS in old obese and normal-weight men. 124 It has been observed that a higher prevalence of both systemic and pulmonary hypertension and 125,126 a higher risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality 119, 127 occur in adults with OSAS, but it is not completely known if these associations are weaker in old age. 118 The interrelation between obesity, aging and OSAS is an area requiring further research."}, {"section_title": "Fourth question: is voluntary weight loss beneficial in the elderly?", "text": "The differentiation between intentional and unintentional weight-loss may have some important implications in the evaluation of weight loss effects on mortality in elderly people.\nThere are few studies on the effects of intentional weight loss in the elderly. At least four studies [128] [129] [130] [131] showed improvement in metabolic control with better glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity associated with intentional weight loss. Hypocaloric diets were effective with weight loss of up to 10 kg or more. Where studied, visceral fat decreased with weight loss. 131 Katzel et al 129 compared the effects on cardiovascular risk factors of a 9-month hypocaloric diet and 9-month aerobic exercise training program in 170 obese men, mean age 61 y. Hypocaloric diet induced a 9-kg weight loss and better improvement of cardiovascular risk factors than did an exercise program. 129 Weight loss has also been tested in older people as a mean to lower the intensity of treatment for hypertension. 132 In a sample of old overweight subjects, who underwent a hypocaloric diet with a weight loss goal of 4.5 kg, those participants who reached 75% of this goal reduced their use of antihypertensive drugs; thus, these results suggest that even a small weight loss (more or less 3.5 kg) induces a significant improvement of blood pressure in old age and thus may be clinically relevant. A few studies have evaluated the beneficial aspects of weight loss on functional alterations associated with obesity in the elderly. In a sample of obese old subjects, pulmonary function improved after a weight loss of up to 10 kg, but not after exercise alone, suggesting a role of excess of fat in pulmonary alterations of the elderly. 133 The beneficial effects of weight loss on appendicular joints could represent a particular advantage for elderly people, because of the important implications of joint disease on the development of disability. Moreover, the combined effect of diet and exercise has been demonstrated to improve pain, disability and performance in people aged 460 y with radiographic evidence of OA and self-reported physical disability. 114, 115 There have been relatively few studies of intentional weight loss to treat weight-related health problems in old age. The evidence that exists suggests that intentional weight loss may be of benefit in controlling cardiovascular risk factors, [128] [129] [130] [131] in reducing medications for weight-related health conditions, 132 and for amelioration of pulmonary disease 133 and OA. 114, 115 Even in the elderly, moderate weight loss (ranging in the different studies from few kilograms to as much as 10 kg) may significantly improve the consequences of obesity. However, there have been no large clinical trials of the effects of weight loss on health outcomes in old age, and older persons who decide to lose weight should do so in a supervised program in combination with physical exercise to help to maintain muscle and vitamin D and calcium to help to maintain bone. It is also important to remember that many chronic conditions of old age may be associated with a wasting period that signals transition to a more severe phase of the disease. Clinically, this worsening of the underlying condition may be difficult to detect and it is often unclear whether the weight loss that accompanies it is intentional or unintentional. Poorly controlled diabetes, for instance, has been associated with weight loss and bone loss in old age, and is associated with increased risk of poor health outcomes such as disability and death. Therefore, spontaneous, unintentional weight loss should be taken seriously and investigated to prevent further complications."}, {"section_title": "Sarcopenic obesity: a new category of obesity in the elderly", "text": "Even if body weight is maintained in old age, body composition changes, shifting to more fat and less muscle. The loss of muscle mass that occurs with aging is a process Obesity and aging M Zamboni et al called sarcopenia, 98 and is associated to an increased risk of physical functional decline and disability as well as to an increase in morbidity and mortality. 99 In normal aging, not only does muscle loss occur but also fat gain occurs over decades. [25] [26] [27] 134 Most previous research has focused separately on the role of each one of these body composition changes on disability. 100 ). An alternative definition of sarcopenic obesity has been suggested by Davison et al, 136 who defined sarcopenic-obese individuals as those in the upper two quintiles of body fat and in the lower three quintiles of muscle mass. Interestingly, the proposed mechanism involved in sarcopenic obesity could be an increased production from adipose tissue of different substances, such as TNF-a and leptin, known to influence insulin resistance, energy metabolism and growth hormone secretion, leading to progressive loss of muscle mass and gain in body fat. 137 The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity increases with age in each sex, from 13.5% in men younger than 70 y to 17.5% in those older than 80 y and from 5.3% in women younger than 70 y to 8.4% in those older than 80 y. 135 Subjects classified as sarcopenic obese showed significantly lower grip strength per kilogram body weight, independently of age, ethnicity, smoking and other comorbidities, and had a greater increase in the risk of functional impairment, disability and falls compared to that observed separately both in obese and sarcopenic elderly men and women. 135 Other cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the association between adverse health and functional outcomes and sarcopenic obesity, as well as to estimate the prevalence of this condition in different settings.\nWith aging the amount of triglycerides in muscle increases: 28, 138 mid-thigh low-density lean tissue, a surrogate of muscle fat infiltration, as evaluated by CT, has been observed to be directly associated with age and adiposity. 28 Age-related body composition changes with adipose tissue infiltration of muscle mass, and progressive loss of muscle has been shown in a 2-y follow-up study in healthy elderly African American women. 139 It is interesting to observe that muscle fat infiltration has been noted even in some forms of muscular dystrophy, and in disuse atrophy. 140 Muscle fat infiltration is associated with poorer strength, 28 with poor scores on performance tests, 28 as well with insulin resistance. 138 This is an exciting new area for research in aging.\nThe concept of sarcopenic obesity should help to understand the complexity of the relation between obesity, mortality and morbidity in the elderly. Shifts between the distribution of muscle and fat with age may be important determinants of health and may be difficult to recognize, particularly in the presence of obesity. Sarcopenic obesity may be not recognized with the use of BMI, and thus its effect on mortality and morbidity is likely underestimated."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Review of the literature supports the following conclusions:\n1. The prevalence of obesity increases up to 60-69 y in men and women, and then declines. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in older ages, comparing the period 1999-2000 with the period 1988-94. 2. Central fat and relative loss of fat-free mass may become relatively more important than BMI in determining the health risk associated with obesity in older ages. 3. The difficulty in easily measuring fat and fat distribution in the clinic makes it difficult to determine the most valid, practical definition of 'obesity' in the elderly. Indices of fat distribution such as waist circumference appear to be relatively more important than BMI. 4. Weight gain or fat redistribution in older age may still confer adverse health risks (for earlier mortality, comorbidities conferring independent adverse health risks, or for functional decline); evaluation of comorbidity and weight history should be performed in order to generate a comprehensive assessment of potential adverse health effects of overweight or obesity in the elderly patient. 5. The health risks of obesity in the elderly may be underestimated by the following: (a) elderly people represent 'survivors' in epidemiological studies; (b) competing mortalities and relatively shortened life expectancy in older persons make it that older obese people may die of non-obese-related disease before the adverse health effects of obesity or weight gain in older age become apparent; (c) longitudinal effects of confounding conditions (smoking, weight change, etc) are difficult to measure and to separate from the independent effects of obesity per se; (d) fat distribution may confer greater health risk than BMI. 6. In older as well as in younger adults, voluntary weight loss may have beneficial health effects. Studies on the effect of weight loss in the elderly are scarce, but they suggest that even small amounts of weight loss (between 5 to 10% of initial body weight) may be beneficial. Treatment should be judicious in order to avoid bone and fat-free mass loss. 7. Involuntary weight loss is always abnormal and merits careful clinical evaluation for the underlying cause. 8. Identification of elderly subjects with sarcopenic obesity is probably clinically relevant. However, clinical There is actually relatively little data directly addressing many of these points, all of which are important areas for future research."}]
