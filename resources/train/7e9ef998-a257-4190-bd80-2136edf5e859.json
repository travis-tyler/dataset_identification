To gain an overview of brain systems affected by neurodegeneration, we characterized the [18F]FDG-PET metabolic connectivity in 42 dementia with Lewy bodies patients, as compared to 42 healthy controls, using sparse inverse covariance estimation method and graph theory. We performed whole-brain and anatomically driven analyses, targeting cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways, and the a-synuclein spreading.

Namely, decreases in local metabolic connectivity within occipital cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum, and increases within frontal, temporal, parietal, and basal ganglia regions. There were also long-range disconnections among these brain regions, all supporting a disruption of the functional hierarchy characterizing the normal brain. The anatomically driven analysis revealed alterations within brain structures early affected by a-synuclein pathology, supporting Braak's early pathological staging in dementia with Lewy bodies. The dopaminergic striato-cortical pathway was severely affected, as well as the cholinergic networks, with an extensive decrease in connectivity in Ch1-Ch2, Ch5-Ch6 networks, and the lateral Ch4 capsular network significantly towards the occipital cortex.

[9] [10] [11] [12] In DLB there is consistent evidence for a specific dysfunctional pattern, characterized by widespread reductions of metabolism in occipital, parieto-temporal and, to a lesser extent, frontal cortex, supportive for clinical diagnosis. 1, 13 The neurodegeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems is a relevant aspect in DLB pathogenesis, as shown by post-mortem [14] [15] [16] and in vivo 17, 18 brain studies, and is the basis for the major clinical features. 1 The accumulation of a-synuclein is associated with cholinergic, 14, 19 and nigrostriatal dopaminergic 8, 20 deficits. Specific brain circuits, as shown in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, are disrupted in the different neurodegenerative conditions, in keeping with the principle of selective neuronal vulnerability, according to which specific neuronal populations die, whereas other are resistant to neurodegeneration. 21 Previous fMRI studies of brain connectomics in neurodegenerative diseases, showed a reduced connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), whereas the behavioral variant of fronto-temporal dementia has been associated to a disruption of the anterior salience network. An impairment of thalamo-cortical and cerebellarthalamo-cortical networks was also reported in PD and in progressive sopranuclear palsy, respectively. 22 A functional network perspective was also adopted in some fMRI studies in DLB showing mixed results regarding DLB connectivity profiles. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [18F] FDG-PET was recently applied to the study of metabolic connectivity (MC) identifying disease-specific patterns of alterations consistent with the underlying pathology. [29] [30] [31] [18F]FDG-PET is considered an index of integrated local synaptic activity, 12 and its signal has also been associated to synaptic density and function. 10, 11 It is thus considered a unique tool for capturing the heterogeneous events that contribute to synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, such as altered intracellular signaling cascades, impaired neurotransmitter release, spreading of proteinopathies, and long-distance disconnection. 9 Studying neurodegenerative diseases with a metabolic network perspective might thus provide important insights into the link between local vulnerabilities, long-range disconnection, and the effects of neuropathology.\nThe investigation of brain MC is based on the assumption that regions whose metabolism is correlated are functionally interconnected. 32 This assumption has its foundations in a pioneering study, in which Horwitz et al. 32 explored brain MC in healthy subjects, demonstrating that the results are largely consistent with known anatomo-functional data. Recent evidence indicates a close relationship between resting state functional brain connectivity (rs-fMRI), and glucose consumption, as measured by [18F] FDG-PET. 33, 34 Passow et al. 33 found spatial similarities between local glucose and BOLD signal fluctuations. Both fluctuations also correlated with DMN functional connectivity. Their findings suggest a close relationship between BOLD signal fluctuations, functional connectivity, and cerebral metabolism. 33 Riedl et al. 34 simultaneously acquired fMRI and [18F]FDG-PET data for obtaining a novel measure suitable to calculate brain state effective connectivity. The integrated brain metabolic [18F] FDG-PET with fMRI data provided directionality of brain signaling, since increases in local metabolism reflect an increase in afferent effective connectivity.\nThe above studies combining metabolic and functional connectivity approaches support the integrated value of the two modalities. 33, 34 Crucially, no study has hitherto characterized the whole-brain and anatomically oriented MC in DLB using [18F] FDG-PET. Although fMRI can incorporate the time series from individual subjects, thus increasing the statistical power over a single time point per subject as required for [18F] FDG-PET data, specific methods have been adopted for PET metabolic data. [35] [36] [37] Specifically, here we used the sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) method, allowing reliable estimation of inverse covariance for [18F] FDG-PET data with relatively small sample size. 35 Here, we aimed at identifying the brain MC changes in DLB that can shed light on the relationship between synaptic dysfunctions and the underlying pathology associated to DLB. 21, 38 We thus tested a comprehensive model for altered brain connectivity in DLB, by considering MC in the wholebrain and in neurotransmission pathways, following the increasing evidence that functional connectivity and network metabolic activity are sensible to changes in neurotransmission. 39, 40 We focused on the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in order to explore the effects on metabolic disconnections and connectivity reconfiguration in each of these pathways, which represent the major biochemical neuropathology. In addition, we analyzed MC of brain regions affected by a-synuclein spreading, with the aim to in vivo explore and support the Braak et al.'s 6,7 staging hypothesis to DLB condition."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

In this way, the uptake time of ADNI images was uniformed to that of San Raffaele images.\nIn this study, uniform reconstruction protocols were applied, in particular, the use of the ordered subsetexpectation maximization algorithm and CT attenuation correction procedures. A rigorous quality control process was performed to check for major artefacts in PET raw images, including defective image uniformity and orientation, or attenuation correction due to a mismatch between CT and PET images.\nMetabolic connectomics [18F] FDG-PET image pre-processing.

In details, each image was first normalized to a [18F]FDG-PET specific template registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space, developed by our group, 45 using the default SMP5 bounding-box, and with an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm. The specific [18F] FDG-PET template provides high levels of normalization accuracy, and it reduces random effects due to noise. 45 All the normalized PET images were spatially smoothed with an 8 mm isotropic 3D Gaussian FWHM kernel. Moreover, every image was proportionally scaled to its global mean, 46 in order to account for between-subject uptake variability, 47 thus obtaining higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to other available scaling methods (e.g. cerebellar reference area). 48 "}, {"section_title": "Node selection and ROIs definition", "text": "We created the whole-brain MC matrix (i.e. the fullmatrix), considering cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and brainstem regions (121 \u00c2 121 ROIs), with the objective to cover the whole-brain structures. These regions represented the basic units of the network, i.e. the nodes. There were 92 nodes for cortical and subcortical structures, 26 nodes for the cerebellum, and 3 nodes for brainstem ( Supplementary Table S1A ).\nMoreover, another analysis was performed according to Huang et al., 35 and subdividing the full-matrix into 12 sub-matrices, representative of larger brain regions (see Supplementary Table S1B ).\nIn addition, we performed a set of spatially anatomically driven connectivity analyses, addressing neural networks related to DLB pathology. These included the cholinergic [49] [50] [51] and dopaminergic 52, 53 neurotransmission systems, as well as the spreading of a-synuclein accumulation in the brain according to Braak et al.'s 6,7 stages progression.\nAs for the a-synuclein analysis, we considered Braak et al. 6 stages one to four. Braak et al.'s 7 staging was originally proposed for PD and subsequently also for DLB, supported by evidence showing consistent data in the spreading of a-synuclein pathology. 54, 55 We constructed the a-synuclein network considering medulla oblongata and pons, for stages one to two, midbrain, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, ventral striatum, and amygdala for stages three to four. 6 Medulla and pons contain gray matter nuclei early affected by a-synuclein pathology, i.e. the dorsal IX-X motor nuclei, intermediate reticular zone, caudal raphe nuclei, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and coeruleus/ subcoeruleus complex 6 ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Concerning the dopaminergic system anatomically driven analysis, we created two different networks representing the striato-cortical and meso-limbic pathways. The striato-cortical network consisted of dorsal caudate and dorsal putamen, frontal premotor, motor, executive dorsolateral frontal regions, and somatosensory cortex; the meso-limbic network consisted of ventral striatum, ventral and medial frontal areas, anterior and middle cingulate cortices, as well as the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex 52, 53 ( Supplementary Table S3 ). For the cholinergic system analysis, we considered six different cholinergic pathways. [49] [50] [51] The first network consisted of the brain regions innervated by Ch1 and Ch2 nuclei of the forebrain, namely the bilateral hippocampus and hypothalamus. The second network represented the pathway arising from Ch3 nucleus, that reach the olfactory and parahippocampal cortices. The third, fourth, and fifth cholinergic networks were represented by the pathways originating from Ch4 nuclei. Namely, the third Ch4 medial pathway reaches cingulate, retrosplenial, and orbitofrontal cortices; the fourth Ch4 lateral perisylvian division joints olfactory and superior temporal cortices, plus the insula and the fronto-parietal operculum; the fifth Ch4 lateral capsular division supplies the remaining frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as well as the amygdala. The cholinergic nuclei of the brainstem, i.e. the Ch5 pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the Ch6 laterodorsal tegmental gray of periventricular area, reach the thalamus, ventral and dorsal striatum, globus pallidus, and the brainstem reticular formation represented by pons, midbrain, and medulla oblongata ( Supplementary Table S4 ).\nIn all the aforementioned pathways, we excluded the small output nuclei from which each molecular network originates (i.e. substantia nigra, ventrotegmental area, and Ch1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 nuclei), due to the limited spatial resolution of PET method and the lack of reference atlases for these regions.\nAll the ROIs used for the connectivity analyses were derived from AAL atlas, 56 with the following exceptions: (i) for the hypothalamus, we created spherical ROIs with a 5-mm radius centered at [AE8 \u00c04 \u00c04] MNI coordinates, according to Kroemer et al.; 57 (ii) for the brainstem, we used ROIs available in WFUPickAtlas Tailarach Daemon Lobar Atlas; (iii) for the dorsal and ventral striatum, ROIs were manually drawn in MriCron (www.mricro.com), using a standard high-resolution MRI T1 image as anatomical template, in accordance to the structural subdivision of the basal ganglia proposed by Tziortzi et al. 58 Furthermore, prior to the analyses, we verified that the volume of each ROI included was not smaller than three times the FWHM of the scanner spatial resolution. This spatial resolution cut-off is considered to be the lower limit to avoid confounding effects such as blurring or spill-over (i.e. ROI partial volume effects). 59, 60 Construction of brain connectivity matrices. We created whole-brain, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and a-synuclein Subject-by-Node/ROI matrices for each group (HC, DLB). The matrices contained the regional cerebral metabolic values derived from each subject in each node/ROI. To obtain the MC matrices, we used the SICE method. 35 This method has been previously used in other [18F] FDG-PET studies, since it allows reliable estimation of inverse covariance even with sample sizes equal or even smaller than the number of nodes selected. This is crucial as in [18F] FDG-PET studies the sample size is the number of subjects and not the length of the time series, as in fMRI studies. 35 In order to apply SICE, we verified that data followed a multivariate normality distribution. Even though multivariate normality of cerebral metabolism data is usually assumed a priori, 35 we nevertheless verified it performing a Mardia test. Since the number of variables (i.e. nodes) was greater than the number of cases, we performed multiple multivariate normality tests on smaller random subsamples of nodes, so that the assumptions for the application of Mardia test were fulfilled. We found that both [18F] FDG-PET metabolic data of HC and DLB followed a multivariate normality distribution.\nUsing the GraphVar toolbox, 61 we obtained unweighted binary MC matrices from Subjectby-Node matrices. Unweighted binary MC matrices consist of zero and non-zero entries, respectively, indicating the presence and absence of a significant partial correlation between two nodes (i.e. a functional connection between the two nodes). 62 We computed MC matrices with different densities, representing different numbers of connections. As there is no gold standard for the number of connections to be selected, 63 we considered matrices with three different numbers of connections that were proportional to the total number of nodes. For the whole-brain and cholinergic analyses, we used matrices with 200-400-600 connections. Given the smaller total number of nodes in the other anatomically driven analyses, we set matrices with 60-120-180 connections for the dopaminergic system and matrices with 10-20-30 connections for the asynuclein network. Unweighted matrices were used for statistical testing, as reported below. Note that we set the number of connections to be the same for both groups. Setting a fixed threshold for both groups is a common strategy to compare the organization of connectivity between different groups, factoring out global connectivity differences (see Huang et al. 35 ).\nFor each group, a summary whole-brain semiweighted matrix was also obtained by summing up the three unweighted binary matrices with 200-400-600 connections. The same procedure was applied to the binary matrices for dopamine, acetylcholine, and a-synuclein, in order to obtain semi-weighted matrices for each atlas at the three different densities. Note that when SICE is applied, the weight of the connections has to be interpreted as an ordinal measure. 35 Therefore, a single semi-weighted matrix containing ''a-quasi measure'' of strength (from 1 \u00bc lowest strength to 3 \u00bc highest strength) was obtained for each DLB and HC group. Semi-weighted matrices do not provide numerical information on the strength of connections, but a useful visual representation of the distribution of connections according to their strength level. Semiweighted and unweighted MC matrices were represented in a 3D brain template using BrainNet toolbox (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/). 64 Graph theory analyses. For the whole-brain full-matrix, we performed both a complex brain network analysis and a nodal analysis, using a set of functional connectivity indices. 65 For these analyses, we only considered the highest density network with 600 connections, in order to extract the best characteristic indices of network organization (see Seo et al. 63 ). We computed average clustering coefficient (C) and modularity (Q) as measures of network segregation. A segregated network is characterized by the presence of densely interconnected groups of brain regions with specialized processing functions. 65, 66 Global efficiency (E) and characteristic path length (L) were calculated as measures of network integration, accounting for the coordinate activity of distributed brain regions. 65, 66 We also considered the small-worldness (S) index, representing the relationship between segregation and integration. 65 S was computed adopting the formula S \u00bc (C/C rand )/(L/ L rand ). 65 C rand and L rand correspond to the mean clustering coefficient and mean characteristic path length, which were calculated based on 5000 randomly generated networks, all with the same degree distribution as the actually observed whole-brain network. Furthermore, we applied a data-driven subdivision of the network into modules (i.e. separated and non-overlapping sets of regions that are strongly connected to each other, and for this reason form independent modules), using the Louvain method. 65 If single-region modules were obtained, they were excluded from further analysis.\nAs for the nodal analysis, we computed the participation coefficient of each node 65 (See Supplementary Figure S2 for results relative to further nodal measures). The most important nodes of the network, i.e. the hubs, were identified. Hubs were computed by selecting nodes whose participation coefficient was one standard deviation higher than the mean participation coefficient. The participation coefficient is an established index for hub identification and it has been proven to be more appropriate than other indices, as degree, at least for functional networks. 67 Considering the sub-matrix based analysis, we calculated the total number of within or short-distance connections (i.e. connections linking two nodes in the same sub-matrix) and the total number of between or longdistance connections (i.e. connections linking two nodes belonging to different sub-matrices).\nFor the anatomically driven networks, we computed the total number of connections and nodal degree within each network.\nIn order to rigorously test whether differences between DLB and HC were significant, we adopted a bootstrap procedure, 35 allowing hypothesis testing when the sample size is not so large to produce statistical inference. For each connectivity matrix, we extracted 5000 bootstrap samples of 42 subjects, with replacement, both for DLB and HC.\nFor each of the 5000 bootstrap samples, we calculated global and local MC indices and number of connections within and between sub-matrices or networks. We then performed multiple independent t-tests, using a Bonferroni correction. We tested global indices for each network and local indices for each node identified as a hub. We also compared the number of connections for each of the 10 sub-matrices in the whole-brain analysis, and for each network in the molecular network analyses.\nSince the main results were consistent across matrices with different numbers of connections, we only reported the results relative to the most conservative threshold (i.e. 200 connections for the whole-brain analysis, 10 for a-synuclein analysis, 60 for dopamine systems analysis, and 200 for cholinergic systems analysis)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Whole-brain connectivity", "text": "Global measures. Segregation measures, i.e. clustering coefficient and modularity, were significantly decreased in DLB versus HC groups. As for integration measures, global efficiency increased, whereas characteristic path length decreased. Small-worldness was higher than 1 for both DLB and HC.\nNumber of connections. DLB connectivity matrices showed a marked whole-brain MC reconfiguration, characterized by an increase of long-distance and a reduction of local connections (Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table S5 ).\nModularity. The Louvain modularity method identified six modules for HC and eight modules for DLB. In DLB, the nodes were sparsely relocated across modules with respect to HC, with extensive reconfigurations in frontal lobes, including the orbitofrontal cortex, in the parietal and occipital lobes, and in cerebellum (Figure 2(a) , for nodes and module reconfiguration).\nHubs. According to graph theory, we identified 21 hubs for the HC group and 9 hubs for DLB. In DLB compared to HC, the hubs were classified into three categories, i.e. lost, preserved, and reconfigured hubs. The hubs changes were consistent with the whole network reorganization, described above. Notably, the lost and reconfigured hubs were part of frontal, parietal, occipital, thalamic, and cerebellar regions (Figure 2(b) )."}, {"section_title": "Sub-matrix connectivity", "text": "Number of connections.

A diffuse reconfiguration, characterized by both increased and decreased connectivity, was found in cholinergic networks ( Figure 5 ). Specifically, Ch1-Ch2 and Ch5-Ch6 cholinergic networks showed decreases in the number of connections. Specifically, the Ch1-Ch2 network, hypothalamic regions were the most affected, together with the thalamic, midbrain, and pontine regions within the Ch5-Ch6 network.

The lateral Ch4 capsular division showed decreased connectivity to the occipital lobe and, to a lesser extent, to the frontal superior medial regions, and a strong increase in the number of connections to the parietal lobe, notably the angular gyri ( Supplementary Table S8 ).\nAll differences were statistically significant (p < 0.00001)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Novel insights about the possible presence of widespread neurodegeneration effects can be provided by the analysis of complex MC brain networks.\n[18F]FDG-PET might be considered an effective measure of energy consumption in neurons, and specifically in synapses. [10] [11] [12] 68 The fundamentals of [18F] FDG-PET are well established and are based on extensively explored molecular mechanisms. 69 With an estimated 25% of the total brain energy use being dedicated to housekeeping function, [18F] FDG-PET signal primarily reflects neural energy consumption related to: resting potentials (15%), action potentials (16%), and synaptic processes (44%). 70 In addition, astrocytes play also a central role in neurometabolic coupling, as supported experimentally by a large body of evidence, which provides a molecular and cellular basis for interpreting data obtained from functional brain imaging studies. 71 Figure 3 . Alpha-synuclein network analysis. Regions affected by a-synuclein at stages one to four. Greater impairment is found in regions corresponding to the earlier stages (i.e. 1-2), consistently with the short disease duration characterizing our sample. Therefore, even if neurons are the primary consumer of glucose, glia cells partially contribute to energy consumption, 72 and may contribute to [18F] FDG-PET signal. 68 All in all, we assume that the [18F]FDG-PET MC alterations we found are mainly due to the neuropathological events affecting DLB synaptic functions, such as neurodegenerative processes, 1 aggregates of a-synuclein at presynapses, 8 neurotransmitters alterations, 18, 73 and possibly neuroinflammatory process. 74 Accordingly, many pathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative conditions, such as intracellular oligomers, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, neurotoxic effect of neuroinflammation, calcium channel changes, besides the altered protein deposition, can induce neuronal and synaptic dysfunction captured by [18F] FDG-PET. 9 This is the first study assessing brain MC in DLB, using graph theory and SICE method. Previous reports investigated functional connectivity in DLB by using fMRI, applying seed-based and independent component analysis (ICA) methods. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Seed-based analysis relies on an a priori selection of brain regions that are used as seeds to perform correlation analysis. 23, 24 For this reason, seed-based studies might suffer by the choice of an a priori limited number of seed regions, preventing a more comprehensive assessment of functional connectivity. The ICA, on the other hand, allows the assessment of whole-brain resting state networks, which were found altered in DLB. 27, 28 All in all, the fMRI studies have provided mixed results, possibly related to the relatively small sample size (ranging from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 18 subjects), to the variable disease duration, to the clinical heterogeneity characterizing the sample, and to the different techniques used to assess functional connectivity. One of the less consistent finding reported in DLB fMRI connectivity studies concerns the occipital cortex connectivity. For example, a seed-based study showed n decreased functional connectivity between visual cortex and precuneus, 23 whereas Kenny et al. 24 reported no differences in connectivity between primary visual cortex and other regions, that, however, emerged when the same group used the ICA approach. 27 Following an innovative metabolic and molecular perspective, we investigated the MC in the wholebrain and in anatomically driven networks on the basis of DLB neuropathology, namely, the proposed progressive spreading of a-synuclein pathology, 6, 7 and according to the dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission alterations."}, {"section_title": "Whole-brain analysis", "text": "The analysis of whole-brain MC showed a widespread reconfiguration of brain functional architecture in DLB. Namely, graph theory measures revealed altered connectivity network properties, characterized by a reduction of small-scale and an increase of large-scale connectivity. The resulting imbalance, characterized by decreased segregation and increased integration, reflects a modular dissociation and a consequent functional disorganization of the brain connectome in DLB (Figure 1(a) ). The decreased network modularity suggests the presence of functionally less specialized communities of nodes (Figure 2(a) ). 65 Connectivity disorganization is also consistent with hub loss, since hubs play a key role in the global organization and efficiency of the brain connectome. 65 In spite of this global reconfiguration, the small-world network organization remained preserved, as previously found in other neurodegenerative diseases. 63, 75 The small-worldness, however, is a synthetic index and it may falsely report local integrity, particularly when one of the two reported measures (i.e. segregation and integration) is high enough to compensate for the impairment of the other. 65 Brain local connectivity Decreases. A severe disruption of local connectivity was found in the occipital cortex. Occipital lobe dysfunction is associated to simple hallucinations 76 and to the visuo-perceptual deficits observed in DLB. 77 Cerebellar, thalamic, and brainstem sub-matrices were also affected. Cerebellum is involved in the coordination and temporal organization of various motor and non-motor (e.g. executive and attentional) processes. 78 Recent findings suggest that it may contribute to some neuropsychological features of DLB, such as executive and working memory dysfunctions. 79 Thalamus has a central role in visual perception, attention, and alertness, 80, 81 functional domains impaired in DLB. 1 The loss of local connectivity in these structures is compatible with recent models of visual hallucinations, described as the consequence of the combined impairment of both visuo-perceptive and attentional systems. 76 Local connectivity was also reduced in the brainstem, a region widely affected by a-synuclein pathology. Neuronal losses in its neurotransmitters nuclei were reported in pathological studies of DLB 15, 16 and related to the presence of RBD. 82 Moreover, the integrity of brainstem connectivity, in particular of ascending reticular activating system nuclei, is critical for arousal maintenance, 80 which shows fluctuations in DLB. 1 Increases. Frontal, temporal, parietal, and striatal submatrices displayed increased local connectivity. A local reconfiguration, with residual nodes replacing functionally impaired nodes, was found in these regions. This increase in connectivity was reported in other dementia conditions and was related to compensatory mechanisms still possible in early disease phase, such as overrecruitment of partially spared neural function. 22 "}, {"section_title": "Long-range connectivity", "text": "Decreases. The analysis of long-range connectivity revealed functional disconnections between occipital, frontal, and cerebellar sub-matrices. Fronto-occipital metabolic and structural abnormalities were previously reported in DLB and related to depressive mood and visual hallucinations. 83, 84 Cerebello-occipital disconnections might explain DLB visual-attentional impairment, given the role of the cerebellum in modulating visual areas activity under attentional demands. 85 The here reported cerebello-frontal disconnection could be part of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which contributes to executive, attentional, and working memory processes. 78 Cerebellar MC was affected at both a small and large-scale level, in accordance to the reported widespread functional, anatomical, and pathological alterations in DLB. 79, 86, 87 Further studies are necessary to fully disclose the role of the cerebellum in DLB.\nWidespread long-range disconnections were crucially found between the thalamus, the superior parietal, occipital, and cingulate cortices. The thalamus is indeed a crucial rele\u00b4in circuits that are relevant for the motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. 88 Considering the a-syncleopathies, recent fMRI resting state studies reported the involvement of striato-thalamo-cortical in PD. 89 Increases. The same sub-matrices showing local increases of connectivity also displayed enhanced long-range connectivity, suggesting a more complex reorganization associated with disruption of the functional hierarchy characterizing the normal brain (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Anatomically driven networks", "text": "As a main contribution of the present study, we adopted a new prospective to analyze selective vulnerability of MC networks, by targeting wellknown molecular and neurotransmission alterations in DLB neuropathology.\nThe connectivity analysis within networks affected by a-synuclein pathology showed alterations in regions corresponding to a-synuclein Braak stages one to four, with a greater impairment of Braak stages one to two, consistent with the short disease duration characterizing our sample (mean AE SD \u00bc 2.14 AE 1.4 years) ( Figure 3 ). In particular, medulla oblongata (stage 1), pons (stage 2), and midbrain (stage 3) were characterized by the greatest MC impairment, followed by the impairment in the connected limbic structures (i.e. hippocampal structures, ventral striatum, amygdala), confirming the causal relationship between a-synuclein accumulation and synaptic dysfunction. Our connectomics analysis supports Braak et al.'s 6,7 staging for the spreading of a-synuclein neuropathology in DLB.\nThe assessment of MC within the dopaminergic networks showed a prevalent impairment of the striato-cortical pathway (Figure 4) . The striato-cortical pathway involvement is a hallmark in DLB disease processes, and the substantia nigra is one of the main sites of a-synuclein aggregation. 8 Alpha-synuclein accumulation interferes with neurotransmitter release at presynaptic sites, producing widespread effects on dopaminergic projections. 8 The meso-limbic pathway, assessed here for connectivity integrity, showed preserved functional configuration, consistently with the reported resistance of ventrotegmental area neurons to a-synuclein pathology. 90 The cholinergic networks also underwent important reconfigurations at different levels ( Figure 5 ). The Ch1-Ch2 and Ch5-Ch6 pathways had the most important reduction in connectivity, possibly suggesting an involvement of these nuclei as an early pathogenic event in DLB. Previous anatomo-pathological studies have shown neuronal loss in these regions, 15, 91 and cholinergic impairment was reported in vivo in the subcortical regions they supply. 18 The cholinergic system has been implicated as potential mechanism in the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations characterizing DLB. 92 The impairment of Ch5-Ch6 pathway here reported supports its involvement in the pathophysiology of DLB. In particular, the prevalent brainstemthalamic connectivity impairment is consistent with an involvement of peduncolopontine and thalamic regions in the genesis of visual hallucinations. 93 Furthermore, the brainstem-thalamic connectivity derangement may be also a fundamental basis in the clinical manifestation of cognitive fluctuations. 81 Moreover, the involvement of Ch4 projections from the nucleus basalis of Meynert to cortical structures, in particular to the frontal and occipital regions, is consistent with previous reports. 17, 18, 94 There is evidence of neuronal loss in nucleus basalis of Meynert and reduction of AchE activity in the neocortical regions supplied by this nucleus, as measured by [11C]-MP4A PET. 14, 18, 95 The presence of a-synuclein pathology in nucleus basalis of Meynert, in addition to neurodegeneration processes, may contribute to reduction of neocortical cholinergic activity in DLB. 94 This study has some possible limitations and strengths. The anatomically driven analyses were performed using anatomical regions not specifically constructed for the targeted brain systems. In the future, atlases based on neurotransmitter mapping and/or histopathology may become available, allowing this limitation to be overcome.\nIt must be acknowledged that in vivo [18F] FDG-PET imaging, although allowing the investigation of molecular and metabolic mechanisms at nanomolar levels, has the limit of spatial resolution. [18F] FDG-PET imaging is a unique tool for in vivo tracking of pathology in humans and future studies combining other microscopic and molecular methods may allow establishing more direct links between metabolic alterations and the underlying cellular and synaptic pathology."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This work focused on DLB at an early disease phase, showing the specific early vulnerability of different networks on a metabolic basis. These results allow for a more comprehensive neuro-functional picture in DLB, paving the way for new research perspectives. For example, assessing the global and local changes in whole-brain functional and molecular networks at later disease phases that could enhance the understanding of DLB progression; the relationship between DLB altered connectivity endophenotype and other synucleinopathies might be a future issue of researches, since diseases sharing the same molecular pathology might present similar vulnerabilities. 2, 21 Finally, the future integration of metabolic and functional measures, as provided by combined [18F] FDG-PET and fMRI methods, 34 might provide essential information on the directionality of connections, thus adding knowledge on the altered signaling hierarchies in DLB."}]
