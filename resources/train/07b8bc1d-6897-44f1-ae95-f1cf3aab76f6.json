Although her-bicide-tolerant and insect-resistant crops were only first commercially available in the U.S. d i~r i n g the mid1990s, their adoption progressed to about 25 percent of corn acreage and about half of soybean acreage by the end of the decade (USDA, NASS 2000) .\nCorn and soybeans are leading users of agrici~ltural pesticides at a substantial cost to U.S. farmers. These two crops comprised about 70 percent of the herbicide poundage and more than 20 percent of the insecticide poundage used on ~najol-U.S. field crops in I995 (Fernander-Cornrjo and Jans). Average chemical costs for corn. at $28 per acrc, are nearly 20 percent of operating costs. Chemical costs average about $25 pel-acre for soybeans, comprising about u third of total operatin2 costs (USDA, ERS).

These results were then used to evaluate possible reasons for observed GE crop adoption patterns."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Crops with herbicide-tolerant traits are clesigned to survive exposure to certain herbicides that previously would have destroyed the crop along with the targeted weeds. The most common herbicide-tolerant crops are Roundup Ready crops resistant to glyphosate, a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide. Roundup Ready crops are designed to allow farmers to limit herbicide treatments to as few as a single post-emergence application of glyphosate, while a conventional weed-control program can involve multiple applications of se\\:eral herbicides. Other advantages of glyphosate are its relatively low cost and fi~vorable environmental features. Glyphosate binds to the soil rapidly, preventing leaching: is biodegraded by soil bacteria; and has extremely low toxicity to mammals. birds, and fish (Malik, Barry, and Kishore) . Also. because herbicidetolerant crops d o not rely on preplant incorporated herbicides, they encourage the use of minimum tillage practices which reduce soil erosion and chemical runoff (Owen) . Corn and soybeans with herbicide-tolerant traits were first made commercially available in 1996. By 2000, herbicide-tolerant soybeans were planted on about half of U.S. soybean acreage, but only on about 7 percent of corn acreage (USDA. NASS 2000) . Bt crops contain a gene from a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that is toxic when ingested by certain Lepidopteran insects. The Bt technology is a novel approach to controlling insects because the insecticide is produced throughout the plant over its entire life. Therefore. the insecticide is more effective than conventional and biological insecticides b e c~~u s e it can't be washed off by rain or broken down by other environmental factors. Corn with the inserted Bt trait is designed for protection from the European Corn Borer (ECB). For this protection from ECB. farmers pay a premiu~n for Bt corn relative to traditional varieties. Therefore, the value of Bt corn relative to traditional varieties depends primarily upon the yield loss than can be attributed to the ECB.\nBt corn was first made comniercially available in 1996 and was planted o n 25 percent of U.S. corn acreage in 1999. However, planted Bt corn acreage fell to less than 20 percent in (USDA, NASS 2000 . Concerns about the safety of GE corn. especially in Europe and Japan, may be a factor in reduced Bt plantings. Also, farmers could have adopted more Bt corn in 1999 than was economical given the ECB pressure and then corrected for this in 2000."}, {"section_title": "Related Research", "text": "Published research about the financial impacts 1.1-cj~n using herbicide-tolel-al~t crops has been mixed. Data from field trials in West Il-nnessee were used in an economic analysis of Roundup Ready soybeans (Roberts, Pendel--g r x~ and Hayes). Conlparing per-acre net returns from 14 trials, the returns f~-om the Roundup system were 13 percent higher than the returns for the second most profitable system. Higher returns from the R O U I I~U~ system resulted from both higher yields and lower herbicide costs. Research results from experimental trials in Mississippi (Arnold, Shaw, and Medlin) also showed higher yields and net returns from Roundup Ready soybeans versus conventional varieties. Other partial budgeting results also showed higher returns from Roundup Ready versus conventional weed control for soybeans (Marl-a, Carlson, and Hubbell; Reddy and Whiting) . However, research using experimental data on Roundup Ready and conventional corn varieties in Kentucky did not show a significant difference in returns above \\eed, herbicide, and fixed co\\t\\ (Ferrell, Witt, and Slack) . While economic an;~lyses based on experimental data have mo\\tly favored herbicidetolerant crops over convention:~l varieties, results from producer surveys have not been as definitive. Research using data frorn 1997 and 1998 cost-of-production surveys in Mississippi suggesteel that pesticide costs were lower with Roi~nclup Ready soybeans, but lower pesticide costs were offset by the added technology fee (Couvillion et al.) . McBride and Brooks (2000) compared mean seed and pest control costs estimated from a I997 national survey of soybean proclucers. Results of the comparison did not indicate a cost advantage or disa~ivantage for herbicide-tolerant versus other soybean varieties. In extending the analysis of this data, Fernandez-Cornejo. Klotz-lngram. and Jans examined the impact of adoption on net returns after other factorsincluding cropping practices, azronomic conditions, and producer characteristicswere statistici~ll y controlled. Results of this study also did n o t show a significant change in net returns to soybean production from the :idoption of herbicide-tolerant soybeans. Siniilar results were obtained i n an analysis of the impacts frorn adopting herbicide-tolerant corn (Fernandez-Corne-jo and Klot~-lngram) .\nPublished research about the economic benefits from using Bt corn suggests that the value of Bt corn relative to traditional varieties depends primarily upon the yield loss that can be attributed to damage from the ECB. R e s~~l t s from field trials controlling the level of ECB infestation indicated that. at the highest ECB injury level, Bt corn hybrids yieldccl Inore than 10 bushels per acre more than conventional varieties (Grnebes. Nafziger, and Mies). The authors concluded that at $2.25 per bushel for corn and $12 per acre for the Bt technology. it takes about five bushels per acre more yield to pay for the ECB protection. Similar results were reported by Rice and Pilcher who showed how returns to Bt corn vary with the expected corn yield, the number of corn borers pel-plant, and the effectiveness of pest control. Because the economic benefits from Bt corn are tied to the level of ECB infestation, studies in some areas have found that the value of protection from Bt corn is not likely to exceed its cost. Hyde et al. ( 1999) found that the value of PI-otection offered by Bt corn under Indiana conditions is generally lower than the premium paid for Bt seed corn. Similal-ly. research under Wisconsin conditions suggests that Bt seed may not be worth the additional cost because of a low probability of infestation (Lauer and Wedberg) . Research by Hyde et al. (2000) suggests that the value of Bt corn relative to conventional varieties increases as one tnoves from east to west in the Corn Belt, because ECB infestations are niuch more frequent and severe in the western Corn Belt."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "Data u\\ed in thi\\ study are frorn USDA'\\ 1998 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS is a multi-frame, probability-based survey in which sample farms are randomly selected from groups of farms stratified by attributes such as economic size, type of production, and land use. Each selected farm represents a known number of fi~rnis with similar attributes. Weighting the data for each surveyed farm by the number of farms it represents is the basis for calculating estimates for all U.S. farms. The definition of a farm. and thus the target population of the ARMS. is any business that produces at least $1000 worth of agricultural production during the calendar year. The farm population of interest in this study includes those that grew corn or soybeans during 1998.\nThe ARMS data include information about the financial condition and management of the operation, demographic characteristics, and managetnent and marketing strategies used on the operation. Important to this study is that the sul-vey included questions about the extent to which GE technologies werc used in thc farm business. PI-oducers were asked I'or each crop grown whether they planted G E seed and. if so. what type of seed was planted and o n how Inany acres it was planted. The adoption of G E crops was defined in cases where herbicide-tolerant soybeans, herbicide-tolerant corn. and Bt corn were used. The analysis of the impact of the adoption of G E corn (soybeans) was conducted on two segments of the Sarni population: ( I ) operations that harvested one or more acres of corn (soybeans), and ( 2 ) operations that specialized in the production of corn (soybeans). Specialized corn (soybean) farrns were defined as those on which corn (soybeans) accounted for more than 50 percent o f t h e total value of Farm production. The pop~tlation o f speciali~ed farms was examined in addition to all gl-owers hecitusc the impact of GE technologies on farm financial perfhrmance is likely to be greatest on operations that specialize in the target commodities.\nSpatial variation in the impact of GE crop ndoptic~n was examined using the ERS farm resource regions (Fig. 1) . Because pest infcstations differ across the U.S.. one would expect that the impacts of pest control measures such us GE crops to be greatest where target pest pressures are most severe. Research suggest.; that the value o S Bt corn relative to conventional vasieties increases as one moves froni east to west in the Corn Belt because ECR infestations are much more frequent and severe in the western Corn Belt (Hyde et al. 2000) . Alho, weed pressure tends to be greatest in the eastern and southern U.S. because of the hot. moist clirnate and the longer growing season. Therefore, the expected value of herbicide-tolerant crops would be greater in these areas because of higher conventional wecd control costs. The farm resoul-ce regions are used to reflect agro-climatic variation across the U.S. and the differences i l l pest pressures this creates. One change to the regional delineation is that the Heartland is divided along the Mississippi River into the East Heartland and the West Heartland (Fig.  1 ). This change better reflects the difference in weed and ECB pressure between these 21s-eas."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework and Empirical Technique", "text": "At the nlost basic level. a farm business is faced with the task of selecting for each production period the combination of inputs and products that will maximize the difference between expected receipts and costs subject to the technical rules given by its productio~l function and to other production constraints. Under the assumption that the farm business is producing only one commodity while utilizing a yield darnage-control input (e.g., input to control pest or weed pressure), its planning problem may hence be stated as (see Maumbe and Swinton):l\nwhere is expected short-run net returns: Y\" and Y are expected and actual crop yields, respectively: p, is commodity price; p,, is purchase price of damage-control input Xi' which is designated here as a GE seed technology: 11, includes prices for variable inputs X (e.g.. conventional seed, labor, chemicals, fertilizel; credit, p t c . ) ; K is fixed physical capital such as land: C represents collditioning factors (e.g.. soil type; rainfall; operator's education, experience and managerial capacity); D ( . ) represents the pestlweed damage function (it expresses the relationship between pestlwced pressure and yield loss); N is the pestlwced pressure: and X(X0) is the \"kill I'unction\" and is used here to describe the efficacy of the introduced technology in controlling pestlweed infestation (i.e.. k(X(') = 1 denotes that the technology is completely effective, or Y = Y ; 0 otherwise): L is total effective labor requirement: L, is total family labor (paid and unpaid): L,, is total hired labor input; and I, denotes operator's knowledge about GE seed technology; A represents operator's access to information regarding GE seed technology (e.g., farm management consultant, input provider, extension servicelcounty agent, etc..); H is operator's human capital endowment as detined by age, education, and experience.\nUtilizing tirst-order conditions for a firm maximizing ( 1 ) allows for the derivation of a factor demand function for X u as in:\nEquation (2) specifies that the demand for the damage control agent depends on commodity and input prices. on farm resources (K, L), on conditioning characteristics including those of the farm business and of the operator (C), and GE crop awareness (I).\n'This conceptual framework. when genera l i~e d to include operator risk preferences and to cover a production process with ~n~~l t i p l e outputs, provides the basis for estimating farm financial performance with the adoption of GE technologies. The method entails first the specification of the following general model:' where n is a vector denoting net returns: X, a matrix of exogenous variables affecting farm's financial performance (as described by K and by the elements of C in ( 1 ). among others): G, a binary vector denoting the adoption of GE crop (i.e.. C; = I if technology adoption occurs, 0 otherwise); Z. a matrix of variables affecting the adoption of GE crop; and E , and E, are vectors of errors.\nSeveral sources of potential econometric concerns must be considel-ed if (3.a) and (3.b) are estimated separately. particularly i f EIE,E,I i : 0. First is the possibility that the decision to adopt the GE crop is determined jointly with net returns. which if left uncorrected would lead to simultaneous equation bias.

A farm operator will choose to adopt a G E crop if expected net returns (n~,) from doing so exceeds some threshold (n,,,,) , which is interprcted as the expected net returns of null-adoption plus a pr-eniiurn for risk or inconvenience in switching to a new technology (Burrows) . Although observations on both a;, and rr,,,, are not available. they nevertheless can be used to rcprcsent the act of adopting the GE crop. which itself is observable. Accordingly, the itli (i = I . . . .. n) operator would choose the GE crop if n, > rr,,, and would choose the traditional crop if n, < n,,,. This proce\\\\ may be modeletl by assuming that operator preference toward the GE technology i \\ a linear function of exogenous variables a \\ in: ( 4 ) . r r , , = x y , , Z , , + u , , and\nThe 11,'s in (4) denote unmeasured factors. approximation errors, andlor random aspect of' behavior (Aldrich and Nelson) .

Suppose w e let n, be this difference. then: Equation ( 5 ) can be simplified by letting y, = (y,, -y, ,,,,) and u, = (v,,,~, -v , , ) as in:\nThe connection between the ~riodel of GE crop adoption in (3.b) and equation (6) is obvious.\nFor example, G, = I if' n, > 0. = 0 otherwise.\nIn other words, the it11 farm operator chooses the G E crop over the convcntionnl crop if -i ,y,Z,, -u, > 0, i.e.. if u, < xy,Z,,. To the extent that n,,,,, varies randomly across individual operators. then n, is also random. which when expressed in terms of the probability of adopting GE crop ( P ( . ) ) , leads to the following representation:\nUnder-the assumption that 1 1 , is a contin~ro~ls random variable, estimation of P(G,) is as follows:\nwhere F ( z , ) is the cumulative distribution function, ,f'(cr,) is the probability density function of the random variable 14,. and where r., = Zy,Z,,. In the context of this study, and bccause of the large sample size in the ARMS. 14, is assumed to follow the nornial distribution. This allows for the specification of the model described in (6) as a probit. Because the prubit I-tlodel is associated with the standard cumulative distribution function a)(.). pararneler estimates for (6) which are obtained by LI maximum likelihood technique (MLT) allow for the estirnation of the probability ( p , ) that the ith fanner selects the G E crop nvcr the traditional crop as in the fc>llowing:' \"The objective of M1.T here is to tind the cstinlalor 9 that rn:~ui~-ni~es Ihc 1ikelihot)d o f obarrving thc pat tern of GE crop adoption ohsei-vccl in the sanjple. where q(.) is the probability density function of the standard norlnul. 11, is a random variable with mean Lero and unit variance, and i = ZThZh.\nWhat has been accomplished so far is to demonstrate that the model described i n (3.a) and in (3.b) is complex, as it requires estimation procedures for a probit within a sirnultaneous equation system. Although many studies have suggested techniques to deal with this difficulty (Amemiya; Heckrnan 1979: Nelson and Olson; Madalla), the fact remains that it may be impossible to obtain a ~inique solution for the endogenous variable w i t h o~~t placing restrictions on the model. Instead, Burrows suggested a way to circumvent this problem. First make (3.b) a reduced-form equation through the exclusion of 11 from Z Second, estimate (3. b) usin: its surrogate, namely the probit in (6). for the purpose of estimating the predicted probabilities (P,) of adopting a GE crop as in (9).

As was discussed earlier, the primary motive for adoption considered here is the perception by adopters that expected net returns from adoption (T',) exceed that of non-adoption (T,,:,). Accor-dingly, and because of this self-selection. farm operators are not assigned randomly to the two groups: GE crop adopters and non-nclopters. A consequence of this is that the two groups Lire systelnatically different. These differences may manifest thelnselves in farm financial performance and could be confounded with differences due to GE crop adoption (see Fernandez-Cornejo). If this self-selectivity problem is left uncorrected, results from estimating net returns using regression procedures could be biased. Heckman (1979) proposed a twostage estimation method to test and t o correct for self-selectivity i n linear regression models.\nIn this study the first stage of Heckman's techniclue involves the estimation of a GE cl-op-adoption model using the probit analysis (see equation (6) The model presented in ( I I ) allows for the estimation of net returns using least squares when the technology adoption decision involves only one choice. In the case when multiple and independent technology choices are involved, equation ( I l ) can be extended to reflect these additional choices by appending both thc sepalate preclicted probabilities reflecting these choices ~uid their corresponding IMRs."}, {"section_title": "Model Specification and Estimation", "text": "The impact of the adoption of GE crops on farm financial performance is assessed by statisticall y controlling for several other factors that may also affect financial performance. That is. the effect of economic and environtnental conditions, nianagernent practices. and operator characteristics are accounted for in order to isolate the effect of GE crop adoption on farm financial perti)rmance. To control for factors other than GE crop adoption, multipleregression is used in a two-stage econometric model of adoption and the adoption impact. The first stage of the rnodel consists of an adoption-clecision model that describes what factors influence the likelihood of adopting GE crops. Results of the first stage provide input for the second stage nlodel that is used to estimate the impact 01' G E crops on farm financial performance.\nThe adoption-decision rnodel was estimated by a probit analysis of GE crop adoption for each of the corn and soybean farm populations (i.e. all gl-owers and specialized operations). Separate lnodels were estimated for ( 1 ) herbicide-tolerant corn, (2) Bt corn. and (3) herhicide-tolerant soybeans. The models were specified using variables that have shown to be related to technology choice in the previous literature (Feder, Just. and Zilbel-man; Feder and Umali) . Variables I-egressed against the decision to adopt each technology included operator education, age. primary occupation. risk preference. managernent level, farm size, specialization in the target co~nmodity. and land tenure (Table I ) . Operator preference toward risk was specified sing a risk index constructed according to farmers' answers to a serles of \\ur\\ey que\\tion\\ about how they react toward risk, including the use of ri\\k-management tool\\ (Bard ~und Barry). The operator's management level was specified ah higher if the operator reported the use of. budgeting or other record keeping methods to manage cash Rows or control costs. Variables for geographic location were also included in the model to account for the impact that differences in soil, climate, production practices, and pest pressures would have o n adoption.\nThe adoption-impact model was next estimated for each of the farm populations by regressing the set of explanatory variables, plus information obtained frorn the decision model, on alternative measures of farm financial pel--formance obtained from the decision model. Several measures of farm financial performance were examined. but results are reported for only two measures: rnodified net farm income per tillable acre and crop operating margin per tillable acre.4 Modified net farm income (NINFI) was measured from the ARMS data as: Grws value of crop production = the production of each crop commodity produced o n the farm operation valued at the \\tate-average price received by farmers (USDA. NASS 1999).\n' Other tin:lncial performarice measures cxanlinrcl in this stl~dy were an estimate o f operator labor and management incornc (net farm income less cllarpes for unpaid label-and capital) pel-tillable acre and rate ot' return to assets. These 1.e5ults were very similar to thosc obtaincd for the net firr111 income measure. MNFl is a comprehensive measure of financial performance that can be infl~~enced by many aspects of the farm business other-than the adoption of GE crops. The impact o n MNFI from livestock production or farni-related income activities (e.g. custom work, government payments) could easily overshadow the influence of GE crop adoption ~~n l e s s the influence was very strong. Therefore, crop operating margin was also i~seci to measure tinancial performance in this s t~~d y because it more closely isolates the limited impact that GE crop adoption has on tinancial performance. Most of the tinancial impacts of adopting G E crops result from changed crop yields, reduced chemical costs, and/or increased seed costs. COM is a component of net farm income that tilters the impact that other farm activities such as livestock production. custom work. and government program participation have on financial performance. Other studie4 on the relative econo~nies of GE ancl conventional crops have used returns above seed and chemical costs as the benchmark for comparison (e.g. Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride; Couvillion et al.; Rice and Pilcher). However, results from models specitied with COM, compared to those using MNFI, provide a weaker test of the influence that GE crop adoption has had on farm financial performance.\nTo ascertain the impact of GE crop adoptlon on financial performance, the predicted probabilities of adoption estimated from the adoption-decision model were a l w included in the adoption-impact model. Because technology adoption and farm financial perfc>rniancc are jointly determined, the predicted probability of adoption for each technology provided an instrument for the adoption-decision that mitigates bias due to simultaneity concerns (Zepeda). The predicted PI-obabilities were also specified as interaction terrns with the geographic location variables. These interaction terms provided a means by which re&' 71on-a1 differences in the financial impact of adoption could be evaluated. A hypothesis is that regions with greater pcst pressures would henefit more from GE crops than other re&' 'ions. Selectivity variables for each technology were also estimated and added to the adoption-impact model to allow for unbiased ancl consistent parameter estimates (Lee). Heckman's two-step procedure (1976) was used to estimate the two-equation model, using weightedregression procedul-es and a jackknife variance estimator designed to be used with the ARMS data (Dubman)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Probit parameter estimates for the herbicidetolerant and the Bt corn adoption-decision ~nodels are presented in Table 2 , while parameter estimates for the herbicide-tolerant soybean adoption-decision models are shown in Table 3 . The higher log-likelihood value (less negative) and greater McFadden R-squared o f each model for the population of specialized corn and soybean producers indicate that the overall model fit was better than it was for the pop~~lation of all proclucers of each crop. The adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn among all corn growers was signiticantly impacted by many operator characteristics, including age, education. ancl farm occupation (Table 2 ). Greater education, higher age, and having farming as a major occupation were associated with a higher likelihood of adopting herbicide-tolerant corn. These results are consistent with adoption literature, except that older farm operators generally have a lower likelihood of adopting new technologies. The adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn was also more likely among growers in the western Heartland region relative to those in the eastern Heartland (the deleted group). However.

Operator characteristics were less important in explaining the adoption of Bt corn. but farm s i~e . specialization, operator risk pcrception. and region were signiticant ( Table 2 ). The likelihood of adopting Bt corn increased as farm ircl-eage increased at a decreasing rate. This relationship between farm size and technology adoption is consistent with most adoption literature. Also, increasing a farm's specialization in corn production increased its likelihood of adopting Bt corn. Coefficients on the risk perception variable indicate that more risk-adverse producel-s were more likely t o adopt the Bt technology. Whilc this result is counter to the common protile o f technology adoptel-s as more risk taking. the niol-e risk-averse producers may be attracted to the Bt corn technology because of the insurance it offers against the threat of ECB infestations. Producers in the western Heartland I-egion were also found to be more likely to adopt Bt corn than were proc1ucr1-s in the eastern Heartland. This result was expected due to the higher incidence and severity of ECB infestations in portions of the western Heartland.\nIn contrast to corn, very few of the variables in either the model for all soybean prowers or the model for specialized soybean growers were significant (Table 3 ) . A possible reason for this lack of explanatory power is the significant diffusion of this technology across the population. The farrn adoption rates for herbicide-tolerant soybeans in this study, 37 percent of all soybean farms and 35 percent of specialized soybean farms, were significantly greater than fcx-the other technologies. Thus the adoption of herbicide-tolerant soybeans has progressed past innovator and early adopter stages into the realm where adopting farmers are much more like the majority of farmers (Rogers). Parameter estimates for the adoption-impact models for corn are presented in Table 4 , while those for soybeans are shown in Table  5 . The overall model tit was very poor for both corn arid soybean populations that included all producers, with an R-squared ranging from 0.003 to 0.10 among these models. Goodness of fit improved among the specialized corn and soybean populations, but was substantially lower for MNFI than for COM. This result was not surprising since MNFI accounted for the costs and returns of all farm enterprises, while C O M included only crop returns and the costs that would be most impacted by the adoption of GE crops. Overall, the rnodel fit was the best for the C O M model estimated on the populations of specialized corn farnms and specialized soybean farms (Rsquared of 0.36 and 0.33, respectively) .\nNearly all of the explanatory variables were insignificant in both adoption-impact ~n o d e l s estirnated on the population of all corn producers and on the model using MNFl among specialized corn producers (Table 4 ). The impact of GE crop adoption was not significantly different from zero in any of these ~n o d e l s .~ However, several factors, including G E crop adoption, were found to affect C O M on specialized corn farms.

Farm location was significant and indicated that the COM was lower among specialized corn farms in regions outside of the Heartland. Very few explanatory variables were significant in any of the adoption-impact models for soybeans ( Table 5 ) .\nThe impact of GE crops on the COM of specialized corn farms varied by regions. To illustrate the impacts, elasticities were estimated to show the percentage change in COM from a change in the probability of adoption (Table 6 ). The elasticity of 0.27 for the adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn on all specialized corn farms indicates that as adoption increases by 10 percent, COM increases 2.7 percent. The greatest impact of the adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn was in the eastern Heartland, where 1 1 10-percent increase in adoption increases COM by 4.1 percent. significantl y greater than in most other re&' 710n~. This result was not unexpected due to relatively high weed pressures in the east. In contrast to herbicide-tolerant corn, the adoption of Bt corn resulted in a decrease in COM among the specialized corn farms.

Moreover, the model was specified to estimate the spatial variation of adoption impacts due to regional differences in pest pressures. Elasticities of financial performance with respect to GE crop adoption were estimated where possible in order to quantify and compare the impacts among regions.\nResults of the analysis using broad financial perfol-mance measures, such as net farm income. to evaluate the effects of GE crop adoption showed little impact. GE crop technologies do not require a capital-intensive investnlent and thus have an impact on farrn tinances that is mainly limited to changes in variable costs and returns. This is most likely why the acloption-impact models explained much less of the variation in net farm income than the variation in the crop operating margin. Previous studies have had much more success in explaining the variation in net farm income (Mishra, El-Osta. and Johnson; ElOsta and Johnson; Haden and Johnson). However. these studies generally did not attempt to isolate the impact of specific technologies. or they focused on technology adoption for enterprises that comprised a substantial portion of whole-farm business activity (e.g. dairy). Business activity horn enterprises unrelated to the GE crops. such as livestock. could have interfered with the measurement of any impact that GE crop adoption had on net farm income.\nPerhaps the biggest issue raised by the results of this study is how to explain the rapid adoption of GE crops when the evidence about farm financial impacts is not clear or counterintuitive. Results of this study suggest that the adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn improved farm financial perfor~nance among specialized corn farms, but farm adoption of herbicidetolerant corn is relatively low. In contrast, the adoption of herbicide-tolerant soybeans and Bt corn has been rapid even though positive financial impacts could not be demonstrated. The positive tinancial impacts of adopting herbicide-tolerant corn may be due in part to seed companies setting low premiums relative to conventional varieties in an attempt to expand market share. Also, the limited acreage on ,ri.c,rl Crops I89 which herbicide-tolerant corn has been used is likely acreage with the greatest comparative advantage for this technology. In the case of herbicide-tolerant soybeans, the results of this study are not inconsistent with findings from studies using other producer surveys. This suggests that at the current state of adoption, about 50 percent of acreage, factors other than economics may be driving adoption. Other research has suggested that the simplicity and flexibility of the herbicide-tolerant program have been the primary reasons that growers are adopting (Carpenter and Gianessi) . Also, growers may have initially responded to the potential for savings from herbicide-tolerant soybeans that have since been diminished by price cuts on conventional herbicides.\nThe economic potential of Bt corn on an individual farm is more difficult to evaluate because returns to Bt corn are realized only if the density of ECBs is large enough to cause economic losses greater than the premium paid for the Bt seed. This requires farmers to have knowledge about past infestations because the adoption decision must be made before planting, prior to observing an infestation. Indicators of ECB infestations suggest that only about 25 percent of corn acreage was infested at a treatable level in 1997 (Pike) , while Bt corn adoption rates were 20 pel-cent in 1998 and 25 percent in 1999 (USDA. NASS 2000) . Results of this study show that the adoption of Bt corn had a negative impact on the f;arm financial performance of specialized corn farms in 1998. This suggests that Bt corn may have been used on some acreage where the value of ECB protection was lower than the Bt seed premium. Possible reasons for this \"over-adoption\" are annual variations in ECB infestations. lack of knowledge about infestation level5 and the yield 105s due to infe\\ta-tions, and the desire to insure against losses due to the ECB. A reduction in the Bt corn adoption rate for 2000, to 18 percent, may be due in part to producers gaining experience with determining how this technology can be used profitably.\nFinally, the implications of this study should be regarded carefully and only within the constraints of the analysis.
