[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 plays a critical role in microglial activation, survival, and phagocytosis; however, the pathophysiological role of sTREM2 in AD is not well understood. Understanding the role of sTREM2 in AD may reveal new pathological mechanisms and lead to the identification of therapeutic targets. We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2 obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Common variants in the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A (MS4A) gene region were associated with CSF sTREM2 concentrations (rs1582763; P = 1.15 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ); this was replicated in independent datasets. The variants associated with increased CSF sTREM2 concentrations were associated with reduced AD risk and delayed age at onset of disease. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1582763 modified expression of the MS4A4A and MS4A6A genes in multiple tissues, suggesting that one or both of these genes are important for modulating sTREM2 production. Using human macrophages as a proxy for microglia, we found that MS4A4A and TREM2 colocalized on lipid rafts at the plasma membrane, that sTREM2 increased with MS4A4A overexpression, and that silencing of MS4A4A reduced sTREM2 production. These genetic, molecular, and cellular findings suggest that MS4A4A modulates sTREM2. These findings also provide a mechanistic explanation for the original GWAS signal in the MS4A locus for AD risk and indicate that TREM2 may be involved in AD pathogenesis not only in TREM2 risk-variant carriers but also in those with sporadic disease."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 2013, two groups independently identified a rare variant in TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) (p.R47H) that increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) almost threefold, making TREM2 the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD since the identification of APOE \uf0654 30 years earlier (1, 2) . TREM2 p.R47H is also associated with clinical, imaging, and neuropathological AD phenotypes, including advanced behavioral symptoms, gray matter atrophy, and Braak staging (3, 4) . Additional rare variants in TREM2 have also been associated with AD risk including p.R62H, p.H157Y, p.R98W, p.D87N, p.T66M, p.Y38C, and p.Q33X (1, (5) (6) (7) .\nTREM2 encodes a protein that is part of a transmembrane receptor signaling complex essential for the immune response of myeloid cells such as microglia. TREM2 is highly and specifically expressed in microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) where it plays a key role in microglial activation, survival, and phagocytosis (8) (9) (10) (11) . Recent evidence from AD animal models suggests that TREM2 has a complex relationship with the key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis, amyloid-\uf062 (A\uf062) and tau (12) . In studies suggesting that TREM2 may be protective in AD, TREM2 has been associated with phagocytosis in the presence of A\uf062 (13) . The introduction of the human TREM2 transgene reduced pathology and rescued cognitive function in amyloidbearing mice (14) . A common phenotype across mouse models of amyloidosis is that reduction or loss of Trem2 leads to fewer amyloid plaque-associated microglia, resulting in more diffuse plaques and enhanced neuritic damage (15) (16) (17) . In contrast, studies of tau pathology indicate that Trem2 deficiency protects against neurodegeneration, suggesting a detrimental role for TREM2 in the presence of tau pathology (18, 19) . Together, these studies demonstrate that TREM2 plays an important, yet complex, role in AD pathology.\nIn addition to the full-length TREM2, which makes up part of a transmembrane receptor, a soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) is produced by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage of the full-length TREM2 protein (6, 13, 20) . Three distinct transcripts for TREM2 are found in human brain tissue, including a short alternatively spliced transcript that excludes exon 4 (encoding the transmembrane domain) to produce a soluble isoform of TREM2 (6) . Recently, a cleavage site was identified in TREM2, which can be targeted by proteases such as ADAM10, ADAM17, and \uf067-secretase to generate sTREM2 (21, 22) . sTREM2 is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where it can be quantified (13, (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . CSF sTREM2 is hypothesized to increase in response to microglial activation due to neurodegenerative processes (24, 27) . Our group and others have demonstrated that CSF sTREM2 is elevated in AD (23, 24, 26) . Changes in CSF sTREM2 appear to occur after amyloid accumulation, beginning about 5 years before clinical symptom onset in autosomal dominant forms of AD (25) . In addition, CSF sTREM2 positively correlates with CSF tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau), but not with CSF A\uf062 42 , suggesting that sTREM2 may be associated with pathological processes occurring after the accumulation of A\uf062 (23, 24, 26) . Thus, CSF sTREM2 has emerged as an important and dynamic biomarker of disease processes throughout AD pathogenesis.\nOur group and others have shown that using CSF biomarkers of complex diseases as quantitative endophenotypes can help identify genes that contribute to key biological pathways involved in disease (29) (30) (31) . In this study, we aimed to identify genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF sTREM2 from more than 1390 individuals and detected a locus within the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A (MS4A) gene region (11q12.2) that displayed genome-wide significant association with CSF sTREM2. We then used bioinformatic, transcriptomic, and cellular approaches to examine correlations between MS4A genes and TREM2."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The goal of this study was to identify genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2 and to better understand the role of sTREM2 in biological pathways relevant to AD. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed genetic data and CSF sTREM2 from 813 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We then sought to replicate our findings in independent datasets (n = 580).\nCSF sTREM2 concentrations correlate with age, sex, and AD biomarkers Our discovery cohort was obtained from ADNI (n = 813), the largest dataset for CSF sTREM2 samples to date. The analyzed dataset included samples from 172 AD, 169 cognitively normal, 183 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 221 late MCI (LMCI), and 68 significant memory concern (SMC) individuals (Table 1) . We excluded participants with MCI due to non-AD causes and participants carrying previously identified risk mutations in TREM2 (Table 2 and table S1 ). CSF sTREM2 concentrations in our analyses approximated a normal distribution without transformation; therefore, we analyzed the raw values, unless otherwise stated.\nWe tested the correlation between age at the time of lumbar puncture and CSF sTREM2 concentrations and found a positive correlation, consistent with our previous reports (Pearson r = 0.270, P = 4.66 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ; fig. S1 ) (24) . We also evaluated whether CSF sTREM2 was associated with sex, as previously reported (24) (25) (26) 32) . There was no significant difference between CSF sTREM2 concentrations in males (3926 \u00b1 1969 pg/ml) versus females (3873 \u00b1 1856 pg/ml; one-tailed P = 0.694; fig. S1 ). CSF sTREM2 concentrations positively correlated with CSF tau (r = 0.377, P = 9.59 \u00d7 10 \u221229 ) and ptau (r = 0.348, P = 2.08 \u00d7 10 \u221224 ; fig. S1 ). Consistent with our previous findings, there was no significant correlation between CSF sTREM2 concentrations and CSF A\uf062 42 concentrations (r = 0.074, P = 0.052; fig. S1 ). CSF sTREM2 concentrations did significantly correlate with the tau/A\uf062 42 and ptau/A\uf062 42 ratios (r = 0.171, P = 5.71 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and r = 0.176, P = 3.18 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , respectively). However, the correlations were not as strong as those observed between CSF sTREM2 and tau or ptau, suggesting that the correlations may be driven by the associations with CSF tau and ptau ( fig. S1 ).\nWe also measured CSF sTREM2 concentrations in 38 individuals who were heterozygous for TREM2 risk variants and were not included in the GWAS: p.D87N, p.L211P, p.R47H, p.R62H, and p.H157Y (Table 2 ). There was a significant difference in CSF sTREM2 concentrations among TREM2 risk variant carriers (P = 0.042), as reported previously (24) . We also observed variant-specific effects on CSF sTREM2 concentrations. CSF sTREM2 concentrations were significantly lower in p.L211P carriers (2578 \u00b1 1444 pg/ml) compared to noncarriers (3903 \u00b1 1919 pg/ml; P = 0.026; fig. S2 ). CSF sTREM2 concentrations were significantly elevated in p.R47H carriers (4852 \u00b1 1172 pg/ml) compared to p.L211P carriers (P = 0.029) and p.D87N carriers (2082 \u00b1 239 pg/ml; P = 0.041), but were not significantly different from noncarriers (P = 0.223; fig. S2 ).\nThe MS4A gene region is associated with CSF sTREM2 concentrations To identify genetic variants that modify CSF sTREM2 concentrations, we tested for association between CSF sTREM2 concentrations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of >0.02 using an additive linear regression model with age, sex, and two principal components as covariates. A total of 7,320,475 genotyped and imputed SNPs passed strict quality control (QC) as described in Materials and Methods. TREM2 risk-variant carriers were excluded from the GWAS analyses.\nA genome-wide significant genetic association with CSF sTREM2 was identified on chromosome 11 within the MS4A gene region (Fig. 1,  fig. S3 , and table S2). The top SNP was rs1582763, an intergenic variant nearest MS4A4A (located 26 kb 5\u2032 of MS4A4A; 11q12.2). This common variant (A allele, MAF = 0.368, genotyped) produced a genome-wide significant association with CSF sTREM2 concentrations (n = 807, \uf062 = 735.1, P = 1.15 \u00d7 10 ; fig. S5 ). To determine whether there was more than one independent signal within the MS4A locus, we performed conditional analyses including rs1582763 in the regression model. In these analyses, we included rs1582763 in the model to determine whether there were independent signals beyond rs1582763. After conditioning for rs1582763 by adding the SNP genotype to the linear model as a covariate, the most significant variant was rs6591561 (G allele, MAF = 0.316, genotyped), a missense variant within MS4A4A (NP_076926.2:p.M159V), which was not in linkage disequilibrium with rs1582763 (r 2 = 0.112, D\u2032 = 0.646). Rs6591561 (MS4A4A p.M159V) was associated with CSF sTREM2 concentrations but in the opposite direction to the main signal (rs1582763). The minor allele of rs6591561 was associated with reduced CSF sTREM2 concentrations, and this association was independent of rs1582763 (before conditioning: \uf062 = \u2212783.7, P = 1.47 \u00d7 10 ; Fig. 1 ), providing further evidence that these were independent signals."}, {"section_title": "Replication in independent datasets and meta-analysis", "text": "To replicate the associations of rs1582763 and rs6591561(MS4A4A p.M159V) in an independent dataset, we analyzed an additional 580 CSF sTREM2 samples along with associated genetic data that were obtained from six different studies: the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), two studies from the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg [GHDEM study (Growth Hormone, and related hormones, and Dementia study) and GHPH], the Memory Unit and Alzheimer's laboratory at the Hospital of Sant Pau in Barcelona [Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN)], and the ICN Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS in Barcelona. These datasets have been described previously (table S3) (24) (25) (26) 32) .\nAnalysis of CSF samples from these six datasets replicated the association of rs1582763 with CSF sTREM2 (z = 5.743, P = 9.28 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ; Fig. 2 ). In these independent datasets, the association of the MS4A4A coding variant rs6591561, p.M159V, with CSF sTREM2 concentrations was also replicated (z = \u22123.715, P = 2.03 \u00d7 10 \u22124\n; Fig. 2 ). Further meta-analysis combining ADNI CSF samples and CSF samples from the replication datasets showed a strong association between rs1582763 and elevated CSF sTREM2 (P meta = 4.48 \u00d7 10 \u221221 ; Fig. 2 ). In the meta-analysis, rs6591561 also showed a genome-wide significant association (P meta = 1.65 \u00d7 10 \u221211 ; Fig. 2 ). Individual results for each dataset are shown in table S4.\nVariance in CSF sTREM2 concentrations explained by an MS4A GWAS signal The genetic effect of rs1582763 explained more than 6% of the variance in CSF sTREM2 concentrations (adjusted r 2 = 0.064). Because rs6591561 may tag an independent signal within the MS4A locus, we added rs6591561 to the model. Both rs6591561 (\uf062 = \u22120.174, P = 1.59 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) and rs1582763 (\uf062 = 0.318, P = 1.50 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) were significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 concentrations, and the added genetic effect explained another 1% of the variance in CSF sTREM2 concentrations (combined SNP adjusted r 2 = 0.075)."}, {"section_title": "Association of MS4A SNPs and APOE genotype with CSF sTREM2 and A\uf062 42 concentrations", "text": "The APOE genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD (33) , and APOE\uf0654 is the strongest genetic association for increased A\uf062 42 and tau in CSF (31, 34) . To determine whether the APOE genotype is associated with CSF sTREM2, we created a variable representing APOE-mediated AD risk by recoding APOE genotype for each individual as 0 for \uf0652/\uf0652, 1 for \uf0652/\uf0653, 2 for \uf0653/\uf0653, 3 for \uf0652/\uf0654, 4 for \uf0653/\uf0654, and 5 for \uf0654/\uf0654. We added this APOE genotype risk variable to a regression model, adjusting for age, sex, and two principal components for population stratification, and found that APOE genotype was not significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 (\uf062 = \u221226.5, P = 0.613). The SNP commonly used as a proxy for APOE \uf0654, rs769449, was also not associated with CSF sTREM2 (\uf062 = \u2212106.9, P = 0.308). The influence of APOE genotype on A\uf062 pathology, including CSF A\uf062 42 concentration, has been a consistent finding (31, 35) . Of the 813 individuals in this study, we had data for CSF A\uf062 42 concentrations available for 695 individuals. To compare CSF A\uf062 42 and sTREM2 concentrations on the same scale, we converted A\uf062 42 and sTREM2 values to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD for each respective protein. After conversion, we verified the association between APOE genotype and CSF A\uf062 42 . As expected, there was a strong negative effect of APOE genotype on CSF A\uf062 42 (\uf062 = \u22120.361, P = 1.69 \u00d7 10 \u221234 ). We also stratified the CSF A\uf062 42 ]. Within the same subset of individuals, the effect size of rs1582763 on CSF sTREM2 concentration was similar (\uf062 = 0.366, P = 7.53 \u00d7 10 \u221213 ) to that of APOE on CSF A\uf062 42 "}, {"section_title": "Additional genes associated with CSF sTREM2 concentrations", "text": "To identify genes associated with CSF sTREM2 concentration, we used MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation), which maps every SNP to the nearest gene, takes into account linkage disequilibrium structure, and uses multiple regression analyses to provide a P value for the association of each gene with the tested phenotype. There were four genes associated with CSF sTREM2 concentration that passed multiple test correction (P < 2.75 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). All of these genes belonged to the MS4A gene family: MS4A4A (P = 3.15 \u00d7 10 ; Fig. 3 ). The gene encoding the TREM-like transcript 2 (TREML2), which is structurally similar to TREM2 but does not associate with DAP12, approached gene-wide significance with 89 mapped variants (P = 3.23 \u00d7 10 ; Fig. 3 ), suggesting that there may be additional genes contributing to changes in CSF sTREM2 concentration.\nShared genetic architecture between sTREM2, AD risk, and age at onset To determine the extent to which genetic architecture is shared between AD risk and CSF sTREM2, we used PRSice to calculate the polygenic risk score (PRS) from summary statistics obtained from the IGAP (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project) AD risk meta-analysis (36), after calculating the optimum P value threshold and regressing the PRS against CSF sTREM2. After testing >6 million SNPs that were found in both the IGAP summary statistics and the genetic data from ADNI, less than 0.5% of the variability of CSF sTREM2 was explained by AD risk variants with P < 6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (r 2 = 4.97 \u00d7 10 \u22123\n, P = 0.034). To determine how much of this was explained by the shared signal in the MS4A region, we removed SNPs located between the 59.5-and 60.5-base pair region on chromosome 11 and repeated the analyses. The results were similar with <0.4% of the variability explained by AD risk variants with P < 6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (r 2 = 3.92 \u00d7 10 \u22123\n, P = 0.060), suggesting that although the shared association between the MS4A region, AD risk, and sTREM2 explained approximately 0.1% of the variance of CSF sTREM2 concentration, there may be some other AD risk variants associated with CSF sTREM2 as well. "}, {"section_title": "Determining whether sTREM2 is involved in AD pathogenesis", "text": "Next, we used Mendelian randomization to determine whether CSF sTREM2 is involved in AD pathogenesis or whether it is just associated with disease due to either a confounding factor or reverse causality. Mendelian randomization is a method that uses genetic variation to estimate a causal effect from observational data, in this case CSF sTREM2 concentrations, in the presence of confounding factors. We used the two independent genome-wide SNPs in chromosome 11 (rs1582763 and rs6591561) as instrumental factors. We also used the top SNP in chromosome 6 (rs28385608), given that this locus was marginally significant in both the single-variant and gene-based analyses. Summary statistics from the largest AD risk GWAS published to date (36) were used as input data. We ran multiple Mendelian randomization models to take into account any potential heterogeneity in the data and to obtain robust estimates. For example, the penalized MR-Egger method downweights the variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. In all Mendelian randomization models, the analyses yielded a significant association (P \u2264 2.14 \u00d7 10 \u22123\n; Fig. 4 ), suggesting that CSF sTREM2 may be involved in AD pathogenesis."}, {"section_title": "Functional annotation of the MS4A gene region", "text": "The genome-wide significant association with CSF sTREM2 was located in a gene-rich region including at least 15 genes, most of which are members of the MS4A gene family. These genes include OOSP2, OOSP4B, OOSP1, MS4A2, MS4A6A, MS4A4E, MS4A4A, MS4A6E, MS4A7, MS4A14, MS4A5, MS4A1, MS4A12, MS4A13, and MS4A8. To determine the functional variants and specific genes that modulate CSF sTREM2, we performed additional bioinformatic analyses.\nWe first examined whether any of the genome-wide significant variants were located within exonic regions. We identified two coding variants: the missense variant within MS4A4A rs6591561 (p.M159V; MAF = 0.316, \uf062 = \u2212593.6, P = 1.47 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ), which is reported above, and a synonymous variant within MS4A6A rs12453 (p.L137L; MAF = 0.392,"}, {"section_title": "A B", "text": "GHDEM (72) Clinic-IDIBAPS (80) SPIN (137) GHPH ( (72) Clinic-IDIBAPS (80) SPIN (137) GHPH (55) ADRC (149 GHDEM (72) Clinic-IDIBAPS (80) SPIN (137) GHPH (55) ADRC (149) DIAN (87) ADNI ( Because the top signal, rs1582763, was independent of the MS4A4A coding variant, we examined whether this top variant showed evidence of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effects on MS4A genes. We queried the Blood eQTL browser from Westra (www. genenetwork.nl/bloodeqtlbrowser/), eQTL data from the GenotypeTissue Expression (GTEx) project (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/), and eQTL data from the Brain eQTL Almanac (Braineac) (www. braineac.org). In human whole blood, rs1582763 was associated with reduced expression of MS4A6A (GTEx: \uf062 = \u22120.089, P = 3.90 \u00d7 10 ). To verify these findings, we analyzed gene expression data from blood obtained from 365 individuals in the ADNI dataset. We found that rs1582763 produced a cis-eQTL effect with reduced MS4A4A expression (\uf062 = \u22120.226, P = 1.04 \u00d7 10 ), suggesting that the cis-eQTL effect was independent of disease status.\nWe further analyzed whether rs1582763 produced an eQTL effect in human brain tissue using GTEx and Braineac data. The GTEx project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 53 nondiseased tissue sites, including brain, across nearly 1000 individuals (https://gtexportal.org/home/). Braineac is a database that includes gene expression and genetic data in 10 dif- ; tables S5 and S6). However, the direction of the eQTL effect in brain was opposite to the effect in blood. Similarly, rs1582763 produced a nominal cis-eQTL effect on MS4A6A expression in GTEx (frontal cortex: \uf062 = 0.183, P = 0.04; cortex: \uf062 = 0.165, P = 0.05) and Braineac (medulla: \uf062 = 0.337, P = 4.50 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) human brain tissue samples. These data suggest that there may be tissue-specific effects of rs1582763 on the expression of MS4A genes. These results also suggest that MS4A4A and MS4A6A genes modulate CSF sTREM2 concentrations.\nTo determine whether rs1582763 produced a trans-eQTL effect on TREM2 expression in brain tissue, we analyzed genetic and expression data in the Knight ADRC and Mount Sinai Brain Bank human brain tissue samples (37) . Rs1582763 was not associated with TREM2 gene expression (Knight ADRC: parietal lobe, P = 0.610; Mount Sinai Brain Bank: Brodmann area 10, P = 0.251; Brodmann area 22, P = 0.635; Brodmann area 36, P = 0.269; and Brodmann area 44, P = 0.999). These findings suggest that the association between rs1582763 and CSF sTREM2 is driven by the cis-eQTL effect on MS4A4A and MS4A6A rather than directly affecting TREM2 expression.\nMS4A gene expression and TREM2 gene expression are highly correlated To begin to understand the relationship between MS4A genes and TREM2, we examined the correlation between expression of TREM2 and expression of genes within the MS4A cluster using brain RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Among the 16 genes tested from the MS4A gene cluster, the expression of three genes (MS4A4A, MS4A6A, and MS4A7) was consistently positively correlated with TREM2 gene expression in human brain tissue. In autopsy-confirmed late-onset AD cases and controls (from the Knight ADRC dataset), TREM2 ; MS4A6A: r = 0.52, P = 7.90 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ; fig. S8 and table S9). These data further support that MS4A4A and MS4A6A may modulate CSF sTREM2.\nTargeting MS4A4A on human macrophages decreases soluble TREM2 in vitro MS4A4A and MS4A6A are both highly expressed in microglia (38) . The mouse ortholog for MS4A6A is Ms4a6e; however, there is no mouse ortholog for MS4A4A (39, 40) . Thus, to understand the role of MS4A genes in TREM2 function, we used human cell models. To begin evaluating the functional connection between TREM2 and MS4A4A and MS4A6A, we used human macrophages because they express TREM2, MS4A4A, and MS4A6A and are frequently used as a model of microglia (41) . Human macrophages were derived in vitro from blood monocytes obtained from healthy individuals.\nThe macrophage culture medium was tested for the presence of sTREM2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Given that stimulation of macro phages with interleukin-4 (IL-4) results in up-regulation of TREM2 and MS4A4A (42, 43) , we measured sTREM2 in the presence or absence of IL-4 as previously described (27) . We detected sTREM2 in the macrophage culture media beginning at day 3 after isolation of monocytes, and sTREM2 increased progressively with time of macrophages in culture, consist ent with previous reports (P < 0.0001; fig. S9A ) (27) . By day 7 after isolation of monocytes, stimulation with IL-4 had significantly increased sTREM2 in the culture media compared to untreated cells (P = 0.015; fig. S9B ).\nTo examine the therapeutic potential of targeting these MS4A proteins, we next evaluated whether antibody-mediated targeting of MS4A4A or MS4A6A expression modulated extracellular sTREM2. Human macrophages were treated on day 7 after isolation of human monocytes with commercially available antibodies to MS4A4A or MS4A6A or were treated with an isotype antibody as control, and then sTREM2 was measured in culture media 48 hours after treatment. We found that an antibody directed against MS4A4A was sufficient to significantly reduce sTREM2 concentrations in macrophage cultures (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A ). However, treatment with an anti-MS4A6A antibody failed to alter sTREM2 concentrations in macrophage cultures (Fig. 5A) . We observed similar results when macrophages were stimulated with IL-4 before antibody treatment (P < 0.0001; fig. S9C ). The effect of the MS4A4A antibody on sTREM2 concentrations in human macrophage cultures was dose-dependent. Treatment of macrophages with MS4A4A antibody (1, 5, or 10 \uf06dg/ml) produced a dose-dependent decrease in sTREM2 (P = 9.63 \u00d7 10 The slope for the anti-MS4A4A antibody was significantly different from that for the control antibody (P = 0.0018; Fig. 5B ). These results suggest that specifically targeting MS4A4A reduced sTREM2 concentrations in human macrophages in vitro.\nTo determine whether MS4A4A expression was sufficient to alter release by macrophages of sTREM2 into culture media, we either overexpressed or knocked down human MS4A4A using a lentiviral system in human macrophages. For the overexpression experiments, human macrophages were transduced with lentiviral particles containing MS4A4A or green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 24 hours. Cells and culture media were collected 48 hours after transduction. Overexpression of wild-type MS4A4A was sufficient to significantly increase MS4A4A mRNA (P = 0.0043; Fig. 5C ) and MS4A4A protein (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5D and fig. S9D) MS4A4A also produced significantly more sTREM2 compared to GFP control-treated cells (P = 0.028; Fig. 5E ). These results were replicated in four independent experiments and demonstrate that targeting MS4A4A at the molecular or protein level was sufficient to alter sTREM2 concentrations in macrophage culture media. Conversely, transduction of human macrophages with lentiviral particles containing MS4A4A-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased MS4A4A expression by 75% (P = 0.01; fig. S10 ) and was sufficient to reduce sTREM2 concentrations compared to macrophages treated with scrambled shRNA as a control (P = 0.0001; fig. S10 )."}, {"section_title": "MS4A4A colocalizes with TREM2 in human macrophages", "text": "We performed immunocytochemistry studies in human macrophages to determine the cellular localization of MS4A4A and TREM2. ) within the area of interest. ****P < 0.0001.

Scale bar, 10 \uf06dm.\nMS4A4A is reportedly expressed on the macrophage plasma membrane (42) and on the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles in human mast cells, where it may play a role in protein trafficking (44) . Consistent with these reports, we found MS4A4A primarily expressed on the plasma membrane of human macrophages in vitro and also intracellularly (Fig. 5F , white arrows). Intense staining for TREM2 was detected in areas surrounding the nucleus and in discrete regions on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5F, yellow arrows) . To determine specific colocalization of MS4A4A and TREM2, we stained human macrophages with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL), Golgi (giantin), and lipid rafts (caveolin-1) (Fig. 5G and  fig. S9G ). MS4A4A and TREM2 colocalized with caveolin-1-positive lipid-enriched structures on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5G, white  arrowheads) . We also detected partial colocalization of TREM2 with both endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) and Golgi (Giantin). In contrast, MS4A4A did not colocalize with these intracellular markers ( fig. S9G ). IL-4-mediated stimulation of human macrophages increased expression of both MS4A4A and TREM2 ( fig. S9, E, F and H) , which is consistent with previous reports (41, 42) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis for genetic modifiers of sTREM2 in CSF. We observed two independent signals in the MS4A gene region that passed genome-wide significance thresholds for association with CSF sTREM2 concentrations: rs1582763 and rs6591561 (MS4A4A p.M159V). Rs1582763 is associated with elevated CSF sTREM2, reduced AD risk (36) , and delayed age at onset (40) . Conversely, rs6591561 (MS4A4A p.M159V) is associated with reduced CSF sTREM2, increased AD risk (36) , and accelerated age at onset of AD (40) . We show here that these SNPs modified expression of MS4A4A and MS4A6A in human peripheral blood cells and brain tissue. The expression of both these genes was highly correlated with TREM2 gene expression. In human macrophages, MS4A4A and TREM2 colocalized on lipid rafts, and pharmacological or genetic modification of MS4A4A resulted in altered sTREM2 concentrations in macrophage culture media. Thus, we present genetic, molecular, and functional evidence suggesting that MS4A genes, particularly MS4A4A, may be key modulators of sTREM2.\nOur findings that variants in the MS4A gene region are associated with CSF sTREM2 provide a putative biological connection between the MS4A family, TREM2, and AD risk. Before this study, TREM2 was directly implicated in AD through the identification of rare variants that increase AD risk (1, 2) . Thus, TREM2 was thought to only affect a small percentage of AD cases. The putative role of TREM2 in sporadic AD was less clear. Common variants in the MS4A locus, including the top SNP we found associated with CSF sTREM2, were reported to be associated with AD risk (rs1582763; OR, 0.898; P = 1.81 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ) (36) and age at onset [hazards ratio (HR) = 0.929, P = 9.26 \u00d7 10\n\u22129 ] (40), but the functional variant and mechanism of action were unknown. Here, we show that variants within this AD risk locus modify CSF sTREM2 concentrations. More specifically, our data indicate that AD risk variants are associated with lower CSF sTREM2 concentrations and that the protective AD variants are associated with elevated CSF sTREM2 concentrations. This relationship between CSF sTREM2 and AD risk is supported by previous studies suggesting that TREM2 variants associated with AD risk or causal for Nasu-Hakola disease are loss-of-function mutations. Our findings and previous studies indicate that increasing TREM2 or activating the TREM2 signaling pathway could offer a new therapeutic approach for treating AD (45) .\nWe present multiple lines of evidence that genes within the MS4A cluster modulate sTREM2 concentrations. First, we observed a strong and consistent association across multiple independent datasets (P meta = 4.48 \u00d7 10 \u221221\n; Fig. 2 ). For comparison, the effect size of rs1582763 on CSF sTREM2 (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 2.37 to 4.82) is similar to that of the APOE genotype on CSF A\uf062 42 (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.30 to 3.50). Second, the MS4A association with CSF sTREM2 represents a trans effect: TREM2 is located on chromosome 9, and this MS4A locus is on chromosome 11. As our group and others have reported, it is not common to find trans-protein QTLs (pQTLs) with large effect sizes and most trans-pQTLs occur in genes that encode receptors or that have other regulatory influences on the protein studied (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . Thus, we hypothesize that one or more genes within the MS4A locus may be key modulators of sTREM2. Third, our functional studies support a relationship between MS4A4A and sTREM2. Using pharmacological (antibody) or genetic (lentivirus-mediated overexpression and knockdown) approaches, we targeted MS4A4A and observed changes in sTREM2 concentrations in human macrophage cultures. Overexpression of MS4A4A resulted in elevated extracellular sTREM2 in human macrophage cultures compared to macrophages overexpressing GFP. Antibodies targeting MS4A4A that resulted in MS4A4A reduction led to a dose-dependent reduction in sTREM2 concentrations.\nThese results suggest that MS4A4A may be a therapeutic target for AD. MS4A4A colocalized with TREM2 in human macrophages, and both proteins were up-regulated in response to IL-4-mediated stimulation. TREM2 and MS4A4A are both highly and specifically expressed in human microglia (38) . Whereas the function of MS4A4A in the brain is poorly understood, it may be involved in protein trafficking and clathrin-dependent endocytosis (44) . The finding that modifying MS4A4A affects sTREM2 in human macrophages in vitro supports a putative relationship between these two proteins. Compounds that induce overexpression of MS4A4A or increase MS4A4A activity could modify AD risk through regulation of sTREM2.\nThe origin and function of sTREM2 is still poorly understood. Most studies investigating the role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis have focused on characterizing the impact of TREM2 loss-of-function mutations or rare TREM2 risk variants. These studies have evaluated the impact of TREM2 deficiency (18, 52) or haploinsufficiency (15) , but they are unable to draw any conclusions about a potential role for sTREM2 specifically. Some evidence suggests that sTREM2 binds to and sequesters TREM2 ligands, such as apolipoproteins, thus preventing these ligands from activating the TREM2 receptor (53, 54) . Others propose that sTREM2 works independently of the TREM2 receptor. Treatment with sTREM2 enhanced microglial survival and cytokine release in both wild-type and Trem2 \u2212/\u2212 microglia in culture (55) . In both wild-type and Trem2 \u2212/\u2212 primary microglia, the introduction of sTREM2 increased mRNA expression of IL-1\uf062, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner, further suggesting that sTREM2 may trigger microglial activation independently of the TREM2 receptor (55) . These findings demonstrate that further research is necessary to determine the role of sTREM2 in AD. The correlations between CSF sTREM2 and CSF tau (r = 0.377, P = 9.59 \u00d7 10 \u221229 ) and CSF ptau (r = 0.348, P = 2.08 \u00d7 10 \u221224 ), which have been reported consistently in independent studies (23, 24, 26) , may provide some clue. There is increasing evidence that microglia play a key role in tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD and similar tauopathies (56) . Considering that TREM2, MS4A4A, and MS4A6A are exclusively expressed in microglia in the CNS, our findings add further support to this putative role for microglia in tau-mediated pathogenic mechanisms.\nOur Mendelian randomization analyses provide additional support that sTREM2 may be involved in AD pathogenesis. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variation as instrumental variables to analyze whether a specific variable, which can be a treatment or a protein (57) , is associated with a specific outcome (AD risk in this case) independently of reverse causation or confounding effects. We used as instrumental variables the three independent SNPs that showed strong association with sTREM2 and found significant associations for CSF sTREM2 with AD risk, demonstrating that sTREM2 may be involved in AD pathogenesis and not merely a product of the disease process. In this study, we did not analyze the association of sTREM2 with AD clinical status because previous studies (24, 25) have recently demonstrated that sTREM2 is associated with AD risk. Although case-control studies are informative, they do not account for longitudinal changes in biomarkers, which may change as a function of disease stage. Additional analyses demonstrating the longitudinal changes in CSF sTREM2 concentrations using the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) classification will be helpful for understanding the dynamic changes in CSF sTREM2 during the course of AD.\nThere are some limitations to the present study. The first limitation is that this study only included common variants (MAF > 2%); therefore, we were unable to determine the effect of genes that only harbor low frequency or rare functional variants. Although some studies have linked APOE with TREM2 (58), we did not observe an association between APOE genotype and CSF sTREM2 concentrations. Thus, APOE does not play a role in modulating sTREM2. However, we cannot yet conclude whether other genes such TYROBP, ADAM10, or ADAM17 play a role in modulating CSF sTREM2. These genes were reported to be involved in TREM2 cleavage (21, 22) ; therefore, we would expect to find a strong association with CSF sTREM2 in these gene regions. However, the risk variants in TYROBP are all rare (59, 60) , and although there are variants in ADAM10 known to affect the function or expression of ADAM10, these variants also occur infrequently (61) . By excluding low frequency and rare variants, this analysis was not able to identify genetic signals in these genes. Additional studies of sequence data in a larger sample size will be necessary to determine the role of TYROBP, ADAM10, or ADAM17 in CSF sTREM2 modulation. A second limitation of this study is that we cannot conclude whether other genes in the MS4A locus also modulate sTREM2. Our data indicate that MS4A4A modulates CSF sTREM2. This is supported by the eQTL analyses, the correlation of MS4A4A and TREM2 mRNA, the identification of a nonsynonymous MS4A4A variant associated with CSF sTREM2, and our functional studies. Our preliminary functional studies suggest that MS4A6A does not modify sTREM2, but due to limited availability of MS4A6A reagents, we cannot definitively rule out a relationship between MS4A6A and sTREM2. Given that the GWAS and bioinformatics analyses only consistently supported a putative functional role for MS4A4A and MS4A6A, we did not investigate the other MS4A gene family members; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that other genes in the MS4A region modulate sTREM2. Another limitation of this study is that we are only beginning to uncover the functional relationship between MS4A4A and sTREM2. The importance of this study resides in the identification and functional validation associating MS4A4A with sTREM2. This study also begins to provide a functional explanation for the original AD risk association identified in the MS4A gene region. Our functional data support the genetic association between MS4A4A and sTREM2 because we were able to modify extracellular sTREM2 by modulating MS4A4A expression or targeting MS4A4A with specific antibodies in human macrophages in vitro. MS4A4A may modify sTREM2 as part of the machinery needed for TREM2 cleavage, through intracellular TREM2 trafficking, or by binding to extracellular sTREM2. Additional functional studies interrogating all of the possible mechanisms by which MS4A4A regulates sTREM2 concentrations will be necessary to address these important questions. In summary, this study identified MS4A4A as an important player in TREM2 biology, provided a mechanistic explanation of the MS4A genetic association with AD risk, and demonstrated that sTREM2 may be involved in AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "The goal of this study was to identify common genetic variants and genes associated with CSF sTREM2. To do this, we used a threestage GWAS: discovery, replication, and meta-analyses. The discovery phase included 813 individuals from the ADNI cohort, and the replication phase included 580 independent CSF samples obtained from AD cases and elderly healthy individuals (Table 1) from six different studies. Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. Genetic loci that passed the multiple test correction for GWAS (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) were functionally annotated using bioinformatics tools to identify variants and genes most likely driving the GWAS signal.\nTo validate the genetic findings, we performed cell-based studies modeling the most likely functional genes identified by the functional annotation. Our analyses identified MS4A4A and MS4A6A as putative functional genes. Our hypothesis was that changes in concentrations or function of the proteins encoded by these genes should also result in changes in sTREM2. These genes, as well as TREM2, are primarily expressed in microglia in the brain. In addition, MS4A4A does not have a mouse ortholog. For this reason, we decided to use primary human macrophages cultured in vitro. Transfecting/transducing primary human macrophages is challenging; therefore, we decided to first use antibodies against MS4A4A and MS4A6A as a quick screening method. Primary human macrophages were treated with specific anti-MS4A antibodies, and sTREM2 was measured in the culture medium by ELISA. Then, we transduced primary human macrophages using lentivirus to overexpress MS4A4A. ELISA was used to measure sTREM2 in the culture medium.\nThe Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions approved the study, and research was carried out in accordance with the approved protocols.

The Olympus FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus-America Inc., Waltham, MA) was equipped with five detectors: two spectral and one filter-based and two gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). Images were captured using an Olympus PlanApoN 60\u00d7, 1.4 NA super corrected oil objective. The 405-, 488-, and 559-nm diode lasers and 635-nm HeNe (helium neon) lasers were used with an optimal pinhole of 1 airy unit to acquire images. Images were finally processed with ImageJ software. DF ZEN 2.1 black edition software was used to obtain Z-stacks through the entire height of the cells with confocal Z-slices of 1.5 \uf06dm (63\u00d7) and an interval of 0.5 \uf06dm. Some of the images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 90i fluorescent and bright-field microscope and analyzed for quantitation with the MetaMorph 7.7 software."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "Statistical analyses and data visualization were performed in R v3.4.0 (74), PLINK v1.9 (75) , and LocusZoom v1.3 (76) . Corrected raw values for CSF sTREM2 concentrations were normally distributed, so two-sample t tests were used to compare CSF concentrations between males and females. Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn's test was used for multiple-group comparisons of the TREM2 mutation carriers and noncarriers. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient was used for correlation analyses. Single-variant associations with CSF sTREM2 concentrations were tested using the additive linear regression model in PLINK v1.9 (75). Covariates included age at time of lumbar puncture, sex, and the first two principal component factors to account for population structure. To determine whether there were spurious associations due to differences in the assay, we tested the CSF sTREM2 measurements from WashU and LMU, and in both cases, a genome-wide signal in the MS4A cluster was found ( Fig. 1 and fig. S3 ). The genomic inflation factor was \uf06c < 1.008 for all of the genetic analyses. Statistical significance for single-variant analyses was selected based on the commonly used threshold estimated from Bonferroni correction of the likely number of independent tests in genome-wide analyses (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed effect model in METAL (77) .\nTo identify additional independent genetic signals, conditional analyses were conducted by adding the SNP with the smallest P value as a covariate into the default regression model and testing all remaining regional SNPs for association. The dataset was stratified by the most recently reported case status, and the genetic signals from the joint dataset were tested to determine whether the genetic associations were driven by cases or controls. To determine whether the identified genetic association within the joint dataset was sex specific, the dataset was stratified by sex and each sex was tested for the association. Results from the sex-specific analyses were verified in a subset of age-matched samples (n = 367 each for males and females; table S1).\nGene expression was inferred using Salmon v0.7.2 (78) transcript expression quantification of the coding transcripts of H. sapiens included in the GENCODE reference genome (GRCh37.75). Gene counts data were transformed to stabilize expression variances along the range of mean values and normalized according to library size using the variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) function in DESeq2 (79) . Correlations between expression of TREM2 and each member of the MS4A gene family, with an average TPM > 1, were tested in each independent RNA-seq cohort. Differences in mRNA expression and sTREM2 production for the cell-based studies were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test or KruskalWallis H test for multigroup comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Mendelian randomization", "text": "We used the R package MendelianRandomization (80), which includes three primary methods: inverse-variance weighted, median-based (simple or weighted), and MR-Egger. The MR-Egger method has an option to use robust regression instead of standard regression or a penalized option that downweights the contribution of genetic variants with outlying (heterogeneous) causal estimates. We tested all three primary methods and the different options for the MR-Egger method.\nThe SNPs selected for the analysis were the two independent SNPs (rs1582763 and rs659156) from chromosome 11 and the top SNP in chromosome 6 (rs28385608). This SNP was included because the locus was near significant in the gene-based analyses, and this SNP had the smallest P value within the region in the single-variant analysis. The beta-coefficients and SEs for the three selected SNPs from this study were used as input with summary statistics from a large GWAS for AD risk (36) ."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatics annotation", "text": "All variants below the threshold for suggestive significance (P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) were taken forward for functional annotation using ANNOVAR version 2015-06-17 (81) and examined for potential regulatory functions using HaploReg v4.1 (82) and RegulomeDB v1.1 (83) . Search tools from publicly available databases, GTEx Analysis V7 (84), the Braineac (85), and the Westra Blood eQTL browser (48) , were used to determine whether significant SNPs were reported eQTLs. The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE; www.encodeproject.org/) was queried, filtering for brain tissue in H. sapiens, to examine DNA elements affected by the associated SNPs.
