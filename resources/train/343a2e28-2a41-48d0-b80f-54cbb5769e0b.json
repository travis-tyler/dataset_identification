These data sets have been passed through the real-time quality control procedures detailed by the ADMT to be implemented by each Data Acquisition Center. All eligible profiles are passed through delayed mode quality control [2] . To test the proposed method, real time quality controlled profiles were considered.\nThe proposed method is based on the observation that temperature and salinity when plotted against longitude and latitude represent a certain pattern of the parameter variability for that region. Fig. 2 shows the salinity patterns for the Indian Ocean when plotted against the longitude (Fig. 2a) and latitude ( Fig. 2b) corresponding to the 0 m depths obtained from the World Ocean Database 2013. From the patterns one can clearly demarcate different types of waters viz., the Red Sea and Bay of Bengal. Using this patterns a n-sided polygon is derived which is used for performing outlier analysis.\nIn the proposed method the principle of convex hull and Point-In-Polygon (PIP) together are used to identify anomalous Argo T/S profiles for a specified depth. The steps for application of the proposed method are as follows:\n1. Observed Argo temperature and salinity profiles are interpolated using Akima spline [8] to the Levitus standard depths [9] . 2. Using the World Ocean Database 2013 [10, 11] temperature and salinity data corresponding to each standard depth, an n-sided polygon (convex hull) is constructed with the least area encompassing the temperature and salinity fields with vertices of (latitude, temperature/salinity), (longitude, temperature/salinity). A Sample polygon (convex hull) for the 0 m depth of salinity is shown in Fig. 3 .\nSubsequently the Point-In-Polygon (PIP) algorithm is used to check if the observed Argo temperature and salinity data (obtained in step 1) falls within or outside the n-sided polygon. 4. The quality flags of good(anomalous) data falling within(outside) the polygon are set, there by identifying wrong profile data (See Fig. 3 ). 5. Using the polygon (convex hull) corresponding to the deepest depth (2000 m) a check is made to discern if the Argo float sensors have any degradation etc.\nIt is worth mentioning that the method proposed here is applicable to two dimensions, however this can be extended to higher dimensions as well, where in a m-dimensional n-sided polyhedrons of figure) for a ray passing from the exterior of the polygon to any point; if odd, it shows that the point lies inside the polygon. If it is even, the point lies outside the polygon [12] . latitude/longitude and temperature/salinity can be built and the observed profiles from Argo floats can be checked for outliers. However in this work we restrict the application of the proposed method to two dimensions only. The quality controlled climatology data used for the proposed method are temperature and salinity from World Ocean Database 2013 of the US National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). These quality controlled data are used to build polygons (convex hulls) for each standard depth. Since T/S profiles data from Argo floats are not available at regular depths, they are first uniformly interpolated to the standard depths represented in [9] using Akima spline [8] . The scattered observations thus obtained from Argo floats are checked to see if they are falling within the corresponding polygon (obtained from climatological data for that standard depth) using PIP algorithm. Jarvis March [13] algorithm also famously called as gift wrapping algorithm was used for constructing polygon (convex hull). This method is based on the principle of building a convex hull given a set of points and has a complexity of O(nh) where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull. Fig. 3 shows a sample n-sided polygon (convex hull) built from WOD13 data at the ocean surface (0 m depth). Similar n-sided polygons for each standard depths are generated and used for qualifying the Argo temperature and salinity data. Once an n-sided polygon is constructed, the PIP algorithm is used to check if the observed Argo temperature and salinity data fall inside or outside the polygon."}, {"section_title": "Point-in-polygon (PIP) implementation", "text": "In computational geometry, the PIP problem asks whether a given point in the plane lies inside, outside, or on the boundary of a polygon. It is a special case of point location problems and finds applications in areas that deal with processing geometrical data, such as computer graphics, computer vision, geographical information systems (GIS), motion planning, and Computer Aided Design.\nThere are many algorithms available to check whether the given point lies inside the polygon or not, like Crossing Test [14] , Angle summation test, Triangle test [15] and Ray Casting Algorithm. In the present work the \"Ray Casting Algorithm\" was chosen for the purpose of identifying whether a given point lies inside or outside the algorithm. Fig. 3 shows a sample test for identifying whether a point is inside or outside the polygon. The Ray Casting Algorithm checks how many times a ray, starting from the point and going in ANY fixed direction, intersects the edges of the polygon. The number of intersections is an even number if the point is outside, and it is odd if inside. This algorithm is also known as the crossing number algorithm or the even-odd rule algorithm, and was known as early as 1962 [14] .\nThe algorithm is based on a simple observation that if a point moves along a ray from infinity to the probe point and if it crosses the boundary of a polygon, possibly several times, then it alternately goes from the outside to inside, then from the inside to the outside, etc. As a result, after every two \"border crossings\" the moving point goes outside. This observation may be mathematically proved using the Jordan curve theorem [16] . In topology, a Jordan curve (simple closed curve) is a non-self-intersecting continuous loop in the plane. The Jordan curve theorem asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an \"interior\" region bounded by the curve and an \"exterior\" region containing all of the nearby and far away exterior points, so that any continuous path connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects with that loop somewhere. Fig. 3 explains a sample scenario of how to determine whether a given data is good (bad) by virtue of it lying within (outside) the n-sided polygon. The biggest advantage of this proposed method is that large number of profiles data can be checked for their quality without manual intervention."}, {"section_title": "Validation of the proposed method", "text": "In general temperature and pressure sensors are found to be robust and salinity sensors on Argo floats are susceptible to changes, degradation owing to bio-fouling [3] . Some of the recorded problems with salinity sensors are, offsets, freshening due to Tri-Butyl Tin Oxide (TBTO), drift after a set of cycles etc. Hence the importance in checking the quality of salinity data. Here we will check the Indian Ocean Argo salinity data using the proposed method. Quality controlled climatological data of salinity corresponding to the profiling depth of the floats under consideration are obtained from WOD13. An n-sided polygon (convex hull) is constructed using Jarvis March algorithm. Argo float time series for the profiling depth values are then obtained and checked against this n-sided polygon using PIP algorithm. If the points fall outside the polygon, the Argo time series is suspected to have a problem (drift, bias, spike etc) or represent anomalous oceanic condition. Because the climatology incorporates a large number of observations spanning decades, a float is suspected to have a problem if the profiling depth salinity points fall outside the n-sided polygon.\nTo demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, 5 typical floats are chosen which represent different problems like drift, offset, grey listed etc. The details of the floats chosen for the validation are given in Table 1 . These examples include good and anomalous floats, together with their positions and n-sided polygons for their respective profiling depth. The first float, identified as WMO 2900782 travelling southward in the Arabian Sea, is a typical example of a good float. All the profiles are observed to be good with the salinities corresponding to the profiling depth falling within the n-sided polygon built from the WOD13 climatological data (Fig. 4) . The second example (WMO 2900877) is contaminated by TBTO fouling which is evident from the initial fresher salinity profiles. The conductivity cell drifts because of the possible change in the dimension of the conductivity cell due to fouling. TBTO is used to improve the anti-fouling in the conductivity cell [17] . Sometime this causes erroneous freshening in the initial profiles until the coating is washed off. Clearly one can see all the initial profiles falling outside the n-sided polygon (Fig. 5) , thereby indicating the case of the TBTO contamination. Also one can see the few profiles (cycle 33, 43) which are spikes in the time series of the float which are observed to fall outside the polygon.\nThe third example is a float which is observed to have drift in the salinity sensor only for few cycles. This float is observed to have salinity drift between cycles 16-22. This can sometime happen due to some biological matter entering into the conductivity pipe. When the biological matter is washed out, the salinity sensor tends to come back to normalcy. This is clearly observed by the corresponding salinity values at profiling depth of 2000 m falling outside the n-sided polygon (Fig. 6 ). This floats seems to have recovered to normalcy after cycle 22. The float with WMO 2900783 in the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 7 shows a typical case of a float whose salinity at profiling depth (2000 m) is completely offset to that of the climatology. All the salinity values corresponding to this float are observed to be falling well outside the n-sided polygon right from the cycle 1. This is typical case of a greylisted float. Greylisting is used for real-time operations of Argo floats, to detect a sensor The last example is that of a float with WMO 2900554 in the Arabian Sea (Fig. 8 ) whose salinity started to drift starting from cycle 200. All the salinity values fall outside the n-sided polygon from this cycle onwards. The examples discussed above are only an illustration of the possible cases among which the anomalous floats fall including spikes, offsets, and drift. These examples demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for identifying bad profiles. The biggest advantage of the proposed method is its applicability to suite of float data in a single test which can easily detect good against anomalous profiles. For better results this methods can be augmented with other methods in use by the Argo community like altimetry based QC and objectively analyzed based QC."}, {"section_title": "Additional information", "text": "The number of profiles obtained annually by Argo floats in the world oceans was more than are used in studies related to climate change, sea level rise, ocean heat content, mixed layer processes, assimilation into ocean models (GODAS), generation of better analysis products etc. However some of the studies require that the data from these instruments be of high quality as the results might be sensitive to biases or instrument errors. These anomalous data are to be identified and eliminated or flagged before the data is put to use.\nOver the past decade or more, geographic distribution of oceanographic T/S profile data has become more uniform owing to the deployment of Argo profiling floats. From running the ocean models operationally to the preparation of climatologies, oceanographic data is widely put to use. Argo floats deployed by various countries are deployed by different groups who use different types of pressure and CTD sensors. Each country has their own choice of setting the measurement resolution for obtaining the T/S samples. Owing to different methods of measurements, different instruments and differences in handling the data, there is the possibility of leaving some anomalous data unnoticed. Even though the Argo Data Management Team (ADMT) has implemented a system of quality checks [2] , as different organizations/institutions employ additional methods for performing quality checks on data, there can be scope for existence of erroneous data. It would be a cumbersome process to individually pin point these anomalous data even though various methods of handling these datasets are developed.\n[ ( F i g . _ 7 ) T D $ F I G ] "}]
