[{"section_title": "", "text": "Since the inception of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) in 1964 with programs at three medical schools, 1 the number of MD-PhD programs, both MSTP funded and non-MSTP funded, has steadily increased. In 2011, MD-PhD dual-degree programs were offered at 111 of the 131 medical schools in the United States. 2 In the 2012-2013 fiscal year, there were 43 MSTP-funded programs, 3 and about two-thirds of MD-PhD graduates of U.S. medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) were graduates of schools with MSTP-funded MD-PhD programs. 4 Longitudinal studies of MD-PhD programs have demonstrated that many MD-PhD graduates pursue biomedical research careers. 1, 5 The number of students enrolled in MD-PhD programs has steadily increased over the past decade, 6 and MD-PhD graduates made up 3.2% (547/16,838) of all LCMEaccredited U.S. medical school graduates in 2009. 7 The Biomedical Workforce Working Group of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Advisory Council to the Director estimated that, on the basis of National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates data, about 9,000 individuals graduated with biomedical sciences doctoral degrees in the United States in 2009. 8 Of those, 6.1% (547) graduated with an MD-PhD. 7 Thus, MD-PhD program graduates in the United States still make up only a small proportion of all MD degree graduates and of all biomedical PhD-degree graduates.\nMD-PhD dual degree holders (MD-PhDs), including some individuals who obtained their MD and PhD degrees from separate programs (i.e., not MD-PhD dual-degree programs), have been overrepresented among grant applicants and among successful applicants for NIH individual research awards. 9, 10 MD-PhDs also are relatively overrepresented in academic medicine and have particularly favorable career trajectories in this setting. 11, 12 As MD-PhDs make up a particularly successful group of biomedical researchers, identifying the characteristics associated with MD-PhD program enrollment may help address current concerns about the size and composition of the biomedical research workforce. 13, 14 Thus, we sought to identify demographic, academic preparation, research experience, and attitudinal variables associated with MD-PhD program enrollment at medical school matriculation. We hypothesized that, among students who considered careers in medicine, as evidenced by their completion of the Association of American Medical Colleges' (AAMCs') Pre-Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) Questionnaire (PMQ), 15 those students who enrolled in MD-PhD dual-degree programs would have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to biomedical research through their participation in research opportunities at multiple points along the Abstract Purpose MD-PhD scientists are a successful, but small and fairly homogenous group of biomedical researchers. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of MD-PhD program enrollment to inform evidence-based strategies to increase the size and diversity of the biomedical research workforce."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Using deidentified data from all 2001-2006 Pre-Medical College Admission Test Questionnaire (PMQ) respondents, they developed multivariate logistic regression models to identify demographic, experiential, and attitudinal variables associated with MD-PhD program enrollment at matriculation compared with all other MD program enrollment at matriculation and with not enrolling in medical school by August 2012.\nThe institutional review board at Washington University School of Medicine determined this study to be non-humansubjects research, as all data provided to the researchers were completely deidentified. We created a database with individually linked records for all firsttime PMQ respondents from 2001 to 2006. Since 2013, this questionnaire has been administered after the MCAT and renamed the Post-MCAT Questionnaire. The PMQ is administered on a confidential and voluntary basis to MCAT examinees to better understand their experiences and future career plans. 15 As some MCAT examinees might matriculate in medical school (in both MD-PhD and other MD degree programs) many years after they first take the MCAT, we limited our examination of PMQ respondents to those who initially took the MCAT prior to 2007. Thus, with follow-up data through August 2012, we had a minimum follow-up period of five years for all PMQ respondents in our sample. The AAMC provided us with examinees' initial MCAT scores as well as data for selected items from the PMQ, Student Record System (SRS), and Data Warehouse (see below for a description of the variables)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Of 207,436 PMQ respondents with complete data for all variables of interest, 2,575 (1.2%) were MD-PhD program enrollees, 80,856 (39.0%) were other MD program enrollees, and 124,005 (59.8%) were non-medicalschool matriculants. Respondents who were black (versus white), were high school and college laboratory research apprenticeship participants, and highly endorsed the importance of research/finding cures as reasons to study medicine were more likely to be MD-PhD program enrollees, whereas respondents who highly endorsed the status of medicine as a reason to study medicine were less likely to be MD-PhD program enrollees than either other MD program enrollees or non-medical-school matriculants.\nFrom 2001 to 2006, 262,813 individuals completed the PMQ prior to taking the MCAT for the first time. We excluded 141 individuals (0.1%) whose records indicated that they had initially enrolled in medical school prior to the 2002-2003 academic year. Of the remaining 262,672 PMQ respondents, 3,196 (1.2%) had enrolled in MD-PhD programs; 96,776 (36.8%) had matriculated in medical school but not as MD-PhD program enrollees, and 162,700 (61.9%) had not matriculated in medical school by August 2012. Our final study sample of 207,436 PMQ respondents with complete data for all measures of interest (79.0% of 262,672) included 2,575 (80.6% of 3,196) who had enrolled in MD-PhD programs; 80,856 (83.5% of 96,776) who had matriculated in medical school but not in MD-PhD programs; and 124,005 (76.2% of 162,700) who had not enrolled in medical school by August 2012.\nThree factors emerged from our principal components analysis of 15 attitudinal items measuring the importance of reasons for studying medicine; five items that loaded > .400 on two factors were dropped. Thus, we computed the mean of items loading on each factor to create three variables for subsequent analysis, measuring the importance of: (1) status, (2) altruism, and (3) research/finding cures as reasons to study medicine. Factor loadings and the internal consistency of items on each factor (Cronbach alpha) are shown in Table 1 .

We then created a five-category variable (quintiles) based on the composite MCAT scores of all MCAT examinees in our database.\nThe AAMC provided the Carnegie Classification of the undergraduate institution 20 that each PMQ respondent reported attending.

Using these NIGMS data and data from the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools, 21 we categorized all LCME-accredited U.S. medical schools as having received MSTP funding for some or all years of the study period or as never having received MSTP funding during the study period. We reviewed the MSTP-funding records for the preceding 20 years (1993-2012) and classified the 47 LCME-accredited U.S. medical schools that had received MSTP funding for some or all of these years as MSTP-funded schools; schools that had never received MSTP funding during this period were classified as non-MSTP-funded schools.

This hypothesis was not supported, suggesting that continued efforts to increase diversity among MD-PhD enrollees are warranted. We discuss our results in the context of (1) the roles of formal high school and college laboratory research apprenticeships in participants' career goals and graduate education, (2) academic preparation for students who may aspire to physician-scientist careers, (3) enrollment of students strongly committed to biomedical research in MD-PhD programs, and (4) the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the emerging MD-PhD workforce."}, {"section_title": "High school and college laboratory research apprenticeships", "text": "Participants in both high school summer and college laboratory research apprenticeships were more likely to be MD-PhD program enrollees (compared with other MD program enrollees and with non-medical-school matriculants), which speaks to the positive impact that participating in research programs at multiple points along the educational continuum has on promoting students' pursuit of researchrelated careers. Previous research has shown that college research programs may play an important role in a student's decision to pursue doctoral studies in the biomedical sciences. 22 23 Historically, a substantial percentage of college graduates who participated in some undergraduate programs designed to promote students' entry into PhD programs (e.g., the Minority Access to Research Careers program) ultimately pursued careers in medicine. 24 Our results indicate that large numbers of students seriously consider pursuing careers in medicine after participating in college laboratory research apprenticeships and that such participation played a significant, positive role in their continued involvement in a biomedical research career path-many enrolled in MD-PhD rather than other MD degree programs. We speculate that, if any participants in the current NIH Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) initiative 25 ultimately decide to pursue careers in medicine, they also will be more likely to matriculate as MD-PhD program enrollees than as other MD program enrollees."}, {"section_title": "Academic preparation", "text": "As expected on the basis of available data, 26 students with MCAT scores < 31 were less likely to be MD-PhD program enrollees than other MD program enrollees or non-medical-school matriculants.

On average, the percentage of female PhD students in all biomedical fields (except biomedical engineering and bioengineering) exceeds or approaches 50%, 23 and, in recent years, the percentage of women among all medical school matriculants has approached gender parity (47%). Although the percentage of women among active MD-PhD program enrollees increased from 35% in 2004 to 38% in 2013, 6 the percentage of female MD-PhD matriculants started to decline from 43% in 2004 to 36% in 2012. 28 Thus, women remain relatively underrepresented in MD-PhD programs compared with their representation among all medical school matriculants 7 and among all biomedical sciences PhD program enrollees. 23 We observed that women were neither more nor less likely to enroll in MD-PhD programs compared with other MD programs or with not enrolling in medical school in models that controlled for academic preparation, research interests, and research experiences, which were independently associated with MD-PhD program enrollment. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether the underrepresentation of women among MD-PhD program enrollees is mediated by other factors, such as women's concerns about the challenges of combining successful physician-scientist careers with childbearing and family life, lack of encouragement for women to pursue the MD-PhD program pathway to a physician-scientist career, and lack of compelling role models for doing so. 29 Individuals from historically URM groups, including blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans/Alaska Natives, remain underrepresented among NIH-supported trainees and among all science and engineering faculty nationally compared with their representation in the U.S. population at large. 16 The associations we observed between race/ethnicity and MD-PhD program enrollment differed somewhat for each of the three URM groups that we examined. Black students were significantly more likely than white students to enroll in MD-PhD programs compared with other MD degree programs and with not enrolling in medical school (see Table 3 ). Although the numbers of MD-PhD program graduates have increased at U.S. medical schools over the past decade, from 327 in 2002 to 564 in 2011, 7 the numbers of black MD-PhD program graduates and the proportion of black graduates among all MD-PhD program graduates both have remained low over the past 10 years, from 4.0% (13/327) in 2002 to 4.6% (26/564) in 2011. 7 The significant positive association we observed between black race/ethnicity and MD-PhD program enrollment suggests that programmatic efforts to promote the enrollment of URM students in MD-PhD programs (a particular focus for those MD-PhD programs that receive NIGMS funding) 16 may have had some success among black students.\nAlthough low, the percentage of Hispanic MD-PhD program graduates has increased from 3.1% (10/327) in 2002 to 5.5% (31/564) in 2011. 7 Hispanic students were neither more nor less likely than white students to enroll in MD-PhD programs compared with other MD programs, but they were twice as likely to enroll in MD-PhD programs as they were to not matriculate in medical school. Finally, Native Americans/ Alaska Natives were neither more nor less likely than white students to enroll in MD-PhD programs compared with other MD programs, and the percentage of Native American/Alaska Native MD-PhD program graduates remains low, increasing only from 0.6% (2/327) in 2002 to 1.1% (6/564) in 2011. 7 Continued efforts are warranted to identify and address possible barriers to the recruitment of Native American/Alaska Native students to MD-PhD programs; the Society for the Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science 30 may be particularly well positioned to make substantive contributions to such efforts because its mission is to promote success among Hispanic and Native American scientists. Notably, the observed percentages of black, Hispanic, and Native American/Alaska Native students enrolled in MD-PhD programs were still quite low compared with their representation in the population of U.S. medical students enrolled in LCMEaccredited medical schools after 2001. 7 Additional research is needed to examine gender and race/ethnicity in association with MD-PhD program graduates' career paths. Previous work indicates that there is a progressive loss of female MD-PhD grant applicants and a lower percentage of female than male grant applicants who are successful in obtaining some (e.g., K01 and R01-equivalent), but not all, types of awards. 9 The probability of being awarded R01 funding for new proposals differs by race/ethnicity, with black applicants being less successful than white applicants (including both MD and MD-PhD applicants). 31 Further research is warranted to fill the gap in knowledge about the physician-scientist career paths of female and URM MD-PhD program graduates specifically."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "Our study had several strengths, including the use of data from and about a national cohort of all PMQ respondents from 2001 to 2006 and the receipt of primary source data from the AAMC for the outcome of interest, with a minimum of five years of followup available for all PMQ respondents. This database was sufficiently large to permit disaggregation of data by race/ ethnicity among students from groups historically underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce and to use multivariable models to identify independent associations between our outcome and predictors of interest.\nOur study also has some limitations. After completing the PMQ, students in the non-medical-school matriculant group in our study sample could have pursued a variety of educational paths, about which we lacked data. Future research in this area includes determining the educational and/or employment outcomes for those students who did not matriculate in LCME-accredited U.S. medical schools by August 2012. We also lacked information about the particular types of high school and college laboratory research apprenticeships in which students in our sample may have participated. College-level programs in particular vary widely in design, intent, and scope. 23, 32, 33 Thus, associations between participation in specific types of college-level research apprenticeships and MD-PhD program enrollment may differ from the associations we observed in this national cohort.\nNonetheless, our results may be of interest to federal agencies that sponsor an extensive array of high school 30 and college-level 34, 35 programs intended to promote interest in biomedical research careers among diverse populations of students.
