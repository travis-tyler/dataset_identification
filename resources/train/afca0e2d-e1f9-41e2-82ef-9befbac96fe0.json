Nevertheless, no study reported interactions of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for APOE with APOE genotype. In present study, we included 9286 unrelated AD patients and 8479 normal controls from 12 cohorts of NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 34 unrelated brain eQTLs for APOE were compiled from BRAINEAC and GTEx. We used multi-covariate logistic regression analysis to identify eQTLs interacted with APOE \u03b54. Adjusted for age and gender, substantia nigra eQTL rs438811 for APOE showed significantly strong interaction with APOE \u03b54 status (OR, 1.448; CI, 1.124-1.430; P-value = 7.94 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). APOE \u03b54-based sub-group analyses revealed that carrying one minor allele T of rs438811 can increase the opportunity of developing to AD by 26.75% in APOE \u03b54 carriers but not in non-carriers. We revealed substantia nigra eQTL rs438811 for APOE can interact with APOE \u03b54 and confers risk in APOE \u03b54 carriers only.\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with strong genetic etiology. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele has been universally confirmed as a strong risk factor for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) 1,2 . APOE4, the isoform of APOE determined by \u03b54 allele, differs with other two isoforms APOE2 and APOE3 at protein structure, lipid association and receptor binding 3 . In most, if not all, putative AD pathogenic pathways, APOE4 either diminishes neuroprotection or augments neurotoxicity when compared with other two isoforms. These evidences which could explain the AD pathogenic nature of APOE4 include: APOE4 impairs synaptic repair and plasticity 4,5 ; might be less efficient in transporting brain cholesterol 6,7 ; increases A\u03b2 aggregation and impairs clearance 8, 9 ; increases formation of neurofibrillary tangles 10 ; decreases metabolic activity of neurons 11 . Although APOE4 is neurotoxic remarkably and miscellaneously, not all APOE \u03b54 carriers developed to AD in a population, even for carriers of APOE \u03b54 homozygotes 12 . Likewise, not all APOE \u03b54 non-carriers are intact from AD. Except for APOE \u03b54, other genes were also identified to be associated with AD by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in recent years [13] [14] [15] . Interestingly, Jun et al. revealed interaction of one of these susceptible genes PICALM with APOE \u03b54 on AD risk-genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers 16 . In addition, GAB2 and some other genes can also modify AD risk by interacting with APOE \u03b54 [17] [18] [19] .

We speculate that some brain eQTLs can be related to AD by potentially regulating expression level of APOE \u03b54.\nBrain tissue-specific eQTLs for APOE and determination of proxy SNPs. We collected 73 brain tissue-specific eQTLs from BRAINEAC (http://www.braineac.org/) and GTEx (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/). 34 out of the 73 eQTLs were determined by LDproxy (https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/?tab = ldproxy) as proxy eQTLs.\nAfter excluding low-quality imputed eQTLs with imputation info score less than 0.9, all 34 proxy eQTLs were retained for further analysis. For the detailed information of the 34 proxy eQTLs, please refer to ; Table 3 ), which indicates carrying one minor allele T of rs438811 can increase the opportunity of developing to AD by 26.75% in APOE \u03b54 carriers. As shown in BRAINEAC, minor allele T of rs438811 was associated with increased APOE expression level in substantia nigra. The APOE eQTL P-values of rs438811 across the ten different brain regions were shown in Table S2 . By querying Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), rs438811 was found to be target of transcription factors POLR2A and RPC155. rs483082, a brain eQTL for APOE which is in complete linkage with rs438811 and was also identified can interact with APOE \u03b54 status to confer AD risk in this study, was the target of multiple transcription factors: HNF4G, CEBPB, MXI1, HDAC2, SP1, RFX5, MAX, EP300, JUND, FOSL2, ZBTB7A and CEBPD. rs483082 was also found be to located in a DNase I hypersensitivity cluster."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "APOE has long been a widely-investigated gene since the identification of its association with AD. Many studies have reported the relations between APOE genotypes and AD-related traits, such as cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers [20] [21] [22] , brain morphology changes [23] [24] [25] , and particular cognitive measures 23, 26, 27 . However, except for APOE \u03b54, no locus encompassing the APOE region, including brain eQTLs for APOE, were identified as a conferring risk for AD or AD-related traits. This study identified AD risk-associated brain eQTL for APOE by incorporating multiple GWAS cohorts.\nThe susceptibility locus rs438811 identified is in complete linkage with another brain eQTL for APOErs483082-which was associated with AD in summary statistics of International Genomics of Alzheimer's project (IGAP) and was reported to associate with AD in a Japanese population 15, 28 . rs483082 was also associated with AD and confer AD risk in APOE \u03b54 carriers only in this study (data not shown). Furthermore, rs483082 was also reported to associate with lipid level 29 . Abnormal lipid metabolism has long been demonstrated to as being involved in AD pathology [30] [31] [32] . Our results revealed that the eQTL may influence the progression of AD APOE \u03b54 carriers by increasing the expression level of APOE. -491A/T, or rs449647, a polymorphism located in APOE transcriptional regulatory region, is the earliestly-reported APOE expression-associated variant by luciferase/\u03b2-galactosidase activity assay related to AD independent of APOE \u03b54 dosage 33 . In contrast to the earliest AD-associated APOE eQTL, the APOE eQTL identified in this study affect APOE expression in a brain region-specific manner. We also analyzed the association of -491A/T with AD (Table S3 ) and its interactive effect with APOE \u03b54 status on AD risk (Table S4 ). In consistent with the result from the study applied luciferase/\u03b2-galactosidase activity assay 33 , \u2212491A/T confer AD risk independent of APOE \u03b54 status. rs438811 is a substantia nigra-specific APOE eQTL. As a brain substructure dysfunction of which contributes to extrapyramidal signs (EPS), pathological changes of substantia nigra are responsible for EPS and aggravated EPS in AD patients 34 .\nAs to how the brain APOE eQTL influence the progression of AD, one most probable explanation is the neurotoxic effect of increased APOE4 expression level in substantia nigra. Nevertheless, pathological mechanism of the brain APOE eQTL still needs to be unveiled by molecular biological experiments.\nIn summary, this is a pilot study associating brain APOE eQTLs to AD risk. It identified a novel SNPs associated with AD by interacting with APOE \u03b54 status and potentially regulating expression level of APOE."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Compiling of brain APOE eQTLs. Brain APOE eQTLs studied in this multi-cohort gene-wide association study were collected by querying BRAINEAC (http://www.braineac.org/) and GTEx (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) databases. BRAINEAC provides the gene expression across ten brain tissues (cerebellar cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, medulla, occipital cortex, putamen, substantia nigra, thalamus, temporal cortex and intralobular white matter) from 134 healthy control individuals. GTEx provides the gene expression across thirteen brain tissues (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, spinal cord and substantia nigra) with the sample sizes ranged from 80 to 154. The cis brain eQTLs with P-values less than 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and located within up-or down-stream 10 Mb boundary of the APOE gene were retrieved from the two eQTL databases. To reduce redundant computation for the AD association analysis, brain eQTLs within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block were pruned and one eQTL was chosen to serve as the proxy for the LD block.

An imputation info score cutoff of 0.9 was applied to exclude low-quality imputed SNPs. After imputation, collected eQTLs from the two databases for brain tissues were extracted.\nIdentification of population substructure. To adjust for confounding effect of population substructure in our data, we calculated eigenvectors of individuals through whole genome-wide principal component analysis (PCA) before chromosome 19 SNPs were extracted using Plink 1.9 37 . All Principal components (PCs, from PC1 to PC20) were used for confounding adjustment.\nCombination of genotyped and imputed data. In this study, the genotyped and imputed brain eQTLs for APOE were inconsistent among different datasets. In order to combine all the GWAS datasets for AD association analysis, imputed high-quality brain eQTL with high confidence (genotype probability greater than 0.8) were converted to be simulated genotype data by fcGENE for each individual 40 . Simulated genotype data were then combined with originally genotyped data.\nStatistical analysis. After adjusting for age, gender and all PCs, these proxy brain eQTLs were tested for associations with AD with or without adjustment for APOE \u03b54 status through multivariate logistic regression analysis. eQTLs were coded as 0, 1, or 2 according to their number of minor alleles. APOE \u03b54 status was coded as 0 or 1 according to absence (APOE \u03b52/2, \u03b52/3 and \u03b53/3 subjects) or presence (APOE \u03b52/4, \u03b53/4 and \u03b54/4 subjects) of APOE \u03b54.
