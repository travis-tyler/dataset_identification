[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Previous studies have examined the effect of educational productivity factors on achievement outcomes. Most of these analyses have however focused on a single subject area for which the productivity factors are associated. Very few studies have attempted to examine the relationships between the factors and multiple dependent measures. To consider the association between multiple dependent variables and a set of independent variables, multivariate statistical techniques such as canonical correlation analysis, discriminant analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) can be applied. In this particular study, an attempt was made to determine the \"best\" models to evaluate the linear relationships between educational productivity factors and proficiency in three academic subject areas: mathematics, reading, and science. The proficiency scores are not explicitly continuous, however previous studies have suggested that they perform similarly to raw or standardized scores or more traditional continuous measures of achievement (U.S. Department of Education, 1994)."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "The purpose of the current study is to determine the nature of the relationship between educational productivity factors and achievement in three academic subject areas: reading, math, and science. The first part of the study uses canonical correlation analysis to determine maximally correlated linear combinations of productivity factors and the proficiency levels in the three subject areas, respectively. The second part of the analysis uses discriminant analysis to determine the most appropriate model consisting of educational productivity factors to distinguish between proficiency and non-proficiency for the 3 subject areas. The third part of the analysis attempts to reduce the dimension of the model or set of productivity factors in order to gain a better understanding of the interrelationships among the variables via principle component analysis and principle factor analysis. The latent factors determined from this part of the analysis were utilized in the final part of the analysis. In particular, based on the results of the factor analysis procedures, certain subsets of variables were combined to form scales for underlying latent variables. The fourth part of the analysis uses MANOVA to determine whether there are differences in mean achievement in reading, mathematics, and science relative to different levels of the \"new\" scales as well as between gender and race."}, {"section_title": "Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A.

A pool of 1.032 schools was selected through stratified sampling with probability of selection proportional to eighth-grade size and with over sampling of private schools. A pool of 1,032 replacement schools was selected by the same method. Of the 1,032 initial selections, 30 wereconsidered ineligible. Of the 1,002 eligible schools, 698 participated. An additional 359 schools (supplied by alternative selections from the replacement pool) also participated, for a total sample of 1,057 cooperating schools, of which 1,052 schools (815 public schools and 237 private schools) contributed usable student data. In addition, to the selection process described above, over-sampling of schools with very large percentages of African-American or Hispanic students or both was conducted based on information provided to the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), a subcontractor for the NELS: 88 base-year study, and by the Office of Civil Rights (ORC) and other sources. The second stage of the base-year selection process produced a random selection of 26,435 students among the sampled schools, resulting in participation by 24,323 eighth-grade students (an average of 23 students per school). For the current study, the sample was reduced to approximately 10,000 after eliminating those who had incomplete transcript information or either non-response or multiple responses for items used in the current research. Using random sampling procedures, a sub-sample of approximately 450 students was selected for the present study.

The cognitive test battery included a multiple choice mathematics test, which consisted of quantitative comparisons and other questions assessing mathematical knowledge. The student questionnaire asked students about such topics as academic achievement; student perceptions of their curriculum and school, family structure and environment; social relations; and aspirations, attitudes, and values, particularly as they relate to high school and occupational or post-secondary educational plans (U.S. Department of Education, 1994)."}, {"section_title": "D.

The proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing total scores and score gains, as measured by overall IRT-Estimated Number Right scores and the normreferenced t-scores, from criterion-referenced measurements of specific skills. At several points along the score scale of the reading test, four-item clusters of test questions having similar content and difficulty were identified. A student was assumed to have mastered a particular level of proficiency if at least three of the four items in the cluster were answered correctly, and to have failed at this level if two or more items were wrong. Clusters of items provide a more reliable test of proficiency than do single items because of the possibility of guessing in a multiple-choice test. Additionally, the proficiency levels followed a Gutman model, that is, a student passing at a particular skill level was expected to have mastered all lower levels. Conversely, failure at a given level indicated non-mastery at higher levels (U.S. Department of Education, 1994). Scoring for both reading and science proficiency was 1 = below level 1, 2 = level 1, but not level 2, and 3 = level 2. Higher scores indicate greater reading and science proficiency. Overall math proficiency was similarly partitioned. However, this variable was partitioned into 4 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories, below level 1, level 1, level 2, and level 3. Three dichotomously coded response variables that represent whether or not the student exhibited math proficiency, reading proficiency, and science proficiency, respectively at the highest level were included in the in the discriminant analyses.

Each of the items was standardized separately to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The composite represents the sum of the standardized scores. Some of the items had to be reverse coded so that lower scores corresponded to lower self-concept and higher scores corresponded to higher selfconcept.

The items were standardized and recoded so that lower scores corresponded to lower control. Socio-economic status (SES) was constructed using the following items: father's education level, mother's education level, father's occupation, mother's occupation, and family income. The items were summed and then standardized to form the composite measure of SES. The other predicators were either derived from transcript data or the self-administered questionnaire.

Factor Analysis", "text": "Again, before considering the results of the factor analysis explicitly, it is noteworthy to observe the partial correlations between the independent variables. The partial correlations among the variables, particularly, the variables representing \"grades\" and those representing family/background, shows that math, English, and science grades have relatively high correlations among one another, and the family/background variables have similarly high correlations among one another. The partial correlations between these subgroups were much smaller. Using exploratory techniques, with no preset number of factors, the procedure retained 3 factors based on the proportion criterion. The eigenvalues for the first three factors were 2.77, 1.46, and .89. The first factor extracts 61% of the variance from the total common variance of the variables. The second factor extracts 32% and the third factor extracts 19% of the common variance. Many of the eigenvalues are negative. This explains why the sum of the variance extracted by the first three factors exceeds 100% of the common variance. The factor pattern suggests that SES, parent's education, post-secondary education plans, science grades, English grades, math grades, and locus of control have high loadings on the first factor. Advanced English, science, and math have high loadings on the second factor. Finally, locus of control and self-concept have high loadings on the third variable. Varimax rotation was applied to further reduce the ambiguity associated with the factor loadings. The loadings on the factors after the varimax rotation were as follows: locus of control, science grades, self-concept, English grades, math grades, and postsecondary education plans had relatively high loadings on factor 1. SES and parent's education had high loadings on factor 2. Finally, advanced course work in English, science, and math had high loadings on the third factor. Homework hours did not have a notably high loading on any of these three factors. Not surprisingly, homework had a very small final communality estimate, .07. This estimate indicates that 7% of the variance of the variable homework was extracted by the common factors. Thus, 93% of the variance of this variable must be attributed to the unique factor corresponding to the homework variable. From these analyses, it is clear that certain subsets of the original 12 variables may represent separate dimensions as predictors of academic achievement. Based on the results of the factor analyses and the correlations among the variables, 4 \"new\" composite variables were created. The new variables were: \"motivation\", \"grades\", \"advanced course Work\", and \"family background\". Motivation was created by adding the scores of the variables locus of control and self-concept, grades represented the sum of the scores from English, math, and science grades, advanced course work was the sum of the scores of the variables representing advanced course work in math, English, and science, and family background was the sum of the scores on the variables SES, post-secondary education plans, and parent's education.

MANOVA", "text": "Before conducting multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), the new variables were scaled into mutually exclusive and exhaustive levels. In addition, a resealed version of the variable representing the number of hours of homework done per week, \"homework\", was created having only 3 levels. The new scale for the variable homework was as follows: 1 = 0 to 1.99 hours, 2 = 2 to 10.49 hours, and 3 = 10.50 hours and up. Motivation and family background were set up with only two levels: 0 = low and 1 = high. These levels were determined by finding the mean of the variables, then reassigning the observations to \"low\" if the score was below the mean and \"high\" if the score was above the mean. For the variables grades and advanced course work, a somewhat different procedure was applied to assign levels for these variables. Recall, a new variable was created to represent the sum of the variables English, math, and science grades. The coding scheme for the original subject grade variables was as follows: 5 = Mostly A's, 4 = Mostly B's, 3 = Mostly C's, 2 = Mostly D's, and 1 = Mostly below D. So, a score of 15 on the new variable (sum of the three subject-grade scales) represented mostly A's for all three-subject areas and a score of 3 represented mostly below D for all three subject areas. Thus, the levels of the variable grades were determined as follows: 0 = factor score of 3; 1 = factor score less than or equal to 6 and greater than 3; 2 = factor score less than or equal to 9 and greater than 6; 3 = factor score less than or equal to 12 and greater than 9; and 4 = factor score greater than 12, where factor score represents the values of the factor representing the sum of the three original subject-grade variables. For advanced course work a similar procedure was used to determine its levels. For the three original advanced course work variables, 1 = yes, advanced course work and 0 = no advanced course work. Thus, the values for the new variable representing the sum of advanced course work in the three subject areas ranged from 0 = no advanced course work to 3 = advanced course work in all three subjects. The, levels for the variable advanced course work were assigned as follows: 0 = factor score equal 0; 1 = factor score equal 1; 2 = factor score equal 2; and 3 = factor score equal 3, where factor score represents the values of the factor representing the sum of the three original course work variables.

The Wilks' Lambda statistic A, is defined as the ratio of the determinant for the within-group variations W, to the determinant of the total variation and covariation matrix T (T = W + B). Specifically, A = IWI +B , where W = matrix of with-group variations and B = matrix of betweengroup variations and covariations.

The average reading scores of group 4 differed from groups 3 and 2 and group 3 differed from group 2. The mean for science scores differed between group 4 and groups 3 and 2. These results suggest that the centroid difference between the groups is primarily due to the difference between group 4 and the other groups. In particular, the results indicate that students receiving higher grades in math, English, and science perform better on cognitive tests in these subject areas."}, {"section_title": "2) Family", "text": "There were differences between the high and low levels of family background for all three dependent measures, with the mean scores for those in the high group outperforming students in the low group."}, {"section_title": "3) Homework", "text": "A comparison of the levels of the amount of homework done during the week indicates that math scores differ between those who do at least 10.50 hours and those who do 2 to 10.49 hours of homework per week as well as those who do 0 to 1.99 hours. Student's who do more than 10.50 hours have high mean reading scores than those who do between 2 and 10.49 hours. The mean science score for those who do at least 10.50 hours of homework is greater than those who do between 2 and 10.49 hours as well as those who do less than 1.99 hours of homework per week. These results suggest that students who do more homework tended to do better on the subject tests than those who did less homework."}, {"section_title": "4) Race", "text": "Comparisons of the average cognitive test scores by race indicate that Asian-Pacific Islanders (API) out-performed Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics in math, and API's out-performed Hispanics and African Americans in reading and science. Whites had higher average scores on all three tests than both African Americans and Hispanics. On the other hand, Native Americans, African American, and Hispanics all did relatively equal on the three subject tests."}, {"section_title": "5) Gender", "text": "Males out-performed females in science, but females out-performed males in reading. There was no difference between males and females in math."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current investigation examined the relationship between several educational productivity variables and achievement outcomes in three separate subject areas, math, reading, and science. Specifically, the study made use of various multivariate statistical technique to determine the nature and magnitude of the relationship between advanced and enriched course work, grades, future education plans, parental education, socioeconomic status, self-concept, locus of control, and homework time and achievement in reading, math, and science. The results indicated that many of the variables were intercorrelated with one another but some subsets of the predictor variables exerted more influence on the achievement outcomes than others. Overall, the productivity factors explained over 50% of the variance of the achievement outcomes. In particular, the results of the canonical correlation analysis suggest that the achievement outcomes in the three subject areas are most related to advanced course work in English, math, and science, grades in science classes, post-secondary education plans, parent's education, and socio-economic status. Yet, it appears that the relationship between math achievement and these predictor variables had the greatest influence on the overall association between the two sets of variables. Three separate discriminant analysis were conducted to determine which subsets of the Productivity factors were,most influential in distinguishing between proficiency and non-proficiency in the three subject areas. For math proficiency, advanced math course work discriminated best between proficient and non-proficient. Results of the stepwise discriminant procedure agreed with the previous outcome. Because math is a cumulative subject, it is not surprising that exposure to higher level or advanced course work in math has the most impact on determining whether or not a student will exhibit proficiency. Analysis of the coefficients of the discriminant function for reading proficiency suggests that parent's education followed by grades in English classes discriminated best between proficiency and non-proficiency. The stepwise procedure supported this finding, indicating that English grades, followed by parent's education had the greatest impact on the reading proficiency variable. These results reveal that more educated parent's are more inclined to encourage their children to read and thus these student may show greater proficiency in reading. Students' grades in English also seem to reflect their potential for proficiency in reading. For science proficiency, parent's education had the greatest impact on distinguishing between proficiency and nonproficiency. This result shows that more educated parents tend to encourage their children to perform better in science. This is probably manifested through parents' encouragement to read and devote more time to science projects and class work. Principal component and factor analyses were applied to the data to explore the interrelationships among the productivity variables. During the course of the procedures, it was revealed that combining some of the variables could reduce the dimension of the Productivity model. In particular, four new variables were created based on the loadings of the variables on certain common factors. These included motivation, which represented the sum of the variables locus of control and self-concept; grades, representing the sum of the grades in English, math, and science; advanced course work, comprised of the sum of the responses to advanced course work in the three subject areas; and family background, which was the sum of parent's education, post-secondary education plans, and SES. The \"new\" variables were then rescaled into distinct levels for use in the subsequent multivariate analysis of variance procedure. The MANOVA procedure revealed that average math achievement differed according to grades, family background, homework, and race. Reading achievement differed according to grades, family background, and gender. Science achievement varied according to grades, family background, homework, race, and gender. Multivariate tests suggested that the average achievement in all three subject areas under study differed for different levels of grades, family background, homework, race, and gender. Both of these analyses indicate that differences in achievement in reading, math, and science are primarily due to differences in levels of course grades, family background variables, and time spent on homework. It should also be pointed out that the effect of the individual variables, particularly advanced course work in the different subject areas, on achievement outcomes may have been compromised by combining these variables into a single factor. Pair-wise analyses suggested that student's receiving higher grades tended to do better in the three subject areas than those who did not. Student's having more educated parents, higher aspirations for future education, and from more socio-economically advantaged backgrounds tended to also do better in the three subject areas. Student's who spent the maximum number of hours on homework out-performed those who spent much less time on homework across all three subject areas. As for race, API's and Whites out-performed African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in reading, math, and science. There were however, no significant differences in performance between API's and Whites, or between African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Finally, males tended to out-perform females in science, but females did better than males in reading. There was no gender difference in math achievement. In conclusion, the current study indicates that several factors are related to achievement outcomes. Furthermore, certain variables more related to particular subject areas than others. Math achievement seems to be effected by advanced math course work than the other variables. Reading appears to be more effected by previous grades in English and parent's education. Finally, science achievement seems to be influenced most by parent's education level. On the other hand, certain common factors seem to have a significant influence on academic achievement. These factors include grades, family background, and homework, as well as race and gender. Although gender, race, and education of parent's represent preexisting conditions, grades and homework are alterable conditions, that if maximized appear to increase the likelihood of higher performance in all three subject areas."}]
