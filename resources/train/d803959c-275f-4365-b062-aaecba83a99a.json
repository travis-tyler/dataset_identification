[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases is a key confound to disease understanding and treatment development, as study cohorts typically include multiple phenotypes on distinct disease trajectories. Here we present a new machine learning technique -Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) -able to uncover data--driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal new subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes, and characterises within-group heterogeneity for the first time. In Alzheimer's disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely revealing their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine--grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p=7.18\u00d710 --4 ) or temporal stage (p=3.96\u00d710 --5 ). SuStaIn thus offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.\nNeurodegenerative disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are biologically heterogeneous, producing high variance in in vivo disease biomarkers, such as volumetric measurements from imaging, protein measurements from lumbar puncture, or behavioural measurements from psychometrics, which reduces their utility in disease studies and management. Key contributors to this heterogeneity are that individuals belong to a range of disease subtypes (giving rise to phenotypic heterogeneity) and are at different stages of a dynamic disease process (producing temporal heterogeneity). Previous studies aiming to explain biomarker variance typically focus on a single aspect of this heterogeneity: phenotypic heterogeneity at a coarse, typically late, disease stage, or temporal heterogeneity in a broad population. However, the inability to disentangle the range of subtypes from the development and progression of each over time limits the biological insight these techniques can provide, as well as their utility for patient stratification. Constructing a comprehensive picture separating phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity, i.e. identifying distinct subtypes and characterising the development and progression of each remains a major current challenge. However, such a picture would provide novel insights into underlying disease mechanisms, and enable accurate fine--grained patient stratification and prognostication, facilitating precision medicine in clinical trials and healthcare. Both FTD and AD exhibit substantial pathologic, genetic, and clinical heterogeneity. In FTD a large proportion of cases (around a third) are inherited on an autosomal dominant basis, with mutations in progranulin (GRN), microtubule--associated protein tau (MAPT) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) being the most common causes. Of the major genetic groups, GRN mutations are associated with TDP--43 type A pathology, MAPT mutations with tau inclusions, and expansions in C9orf72 with type A or type B TDP--43 pathology 1 . AD instead has a single pathological characterisation: the presence of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and the proportion of autosomal dominant cases is much smaller, accounting for between 1% and 6% of cases 2 . The pathological heterogeneity observed in AD consists of variation in the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles, with 25% of patients having an atypical distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (described as hippocampal--sparing or limbic--predominant) on autopsy at the time of death 3 . Both FTD and AD exhibit a diverse range of clinical syndromes. FTD has both behavioural and language presentations, and in genetic FTD the clinical syndromes can further include atypical parkinsonism and amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In AD, the major clinical syndrome is broadly divided into amnestic and rarer non--amnestic variants, with non--amnestic variants including language variant AD, lopogenic progressive aphasia, visuoperceptive variant AD, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and frontal variant AD 4 . Previous studies of neurodegenerative disease heterogeneity have focussed on either temporal heterogeneity (i.e. subjects appear different at different disease stages) or phenotypic heterogeneity (i.e. distinct groups of subjects appear different even at the same disease stage), but rarely both. We refer to these two approaches as stages--only models, which account for temporal heterogeneity but not phenotypic heterogeneity, and subtypes--only models, which account for phenotypic heterogeneity but not temporal heterogeneity. Stages--only models arise for example from regression against disease stage 5,6 , and data--driven disease progression modelling 7-15 . Although such models have provided new understanding of the temporal progression of a range of conditions, the inherent assumption that all individuals have a single phenotype, i.e. follow approximately the same trajectory, is a key limitation. At best, this limits the biological"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "insight and the accuracy of stratification they can provide, but potentially could also lead to erroneous conclusions. Subtypes--only models use, for example, clustering (e.g. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] to identify distinct groups, or group individuals using information independent of the model, such as genetics (e.g. 24 ) or post--mortem examination (e.g. [25] [26] [27] [28] ) for models based on in--vivo imaging. With typical subtypes--only models, the limitation is the inherent assumption that all subjects are at a common disease stage so that the cohort has no temporal heterogeneity. This requires a priori staging and selection of individuals, which is typically crude in practice leaving models that are not specific to subtype differences. Models of both disease subtype and stage heterogeneity have been constructed previously for the small proportion of neurodegenerative diseases that are inherited on an autosomal--dominant basis. For example, Rohrer et al 29 investigate temporal heterogeneity within genetic groups by regressing imaging markers against an estimated age of onset (from family history). However, such studies lack the ability to identify novel within--genotype phenotypes, and the temporal resolution of the recovered genotype progression patterns is limited by inaccuracy of the a--priori staging. This paper presents Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) (see conceptual overview in Figure 1 ): a computational technique that disentangles temporal and phenotypic heterogeneity to identify population subgroups with common patterns of disease progression. SuStaIn is a new unsupervised machine--learning technique that uniquely builds on and combines ideas from clustering (e.g. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ) and data--driven disease progression modelling (e.g. [7] [8] [9] [10] 12 ). The combination uniquely enables SuStaIn to group individuals with common phenotypes across the range of disease stages. It determines the number of subtypes that the available data can support, reconstructs the trajectory of stages within each subtype, and assigns a probability of each subtype and stage to each subject. These features offer the potential for important new insights into disease biology, e.g. by revealing the earliest sites of disease and subsequent spreading patterns and thus supporting mechanistic models (e.g. 30, 31 ) of disease aetiology without the confounds of phenotypic heterogeneity. They also provide a mechanism for in vivo fine-grained stratification at early disease stages, facilitating precision medicine. Here, we use SuStaIn with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets from cohorts of genetic FTD and AD patients. In each case, SuStaIn provides a novel data-driven taxonomy (set of subtypes and stages), as well as new and detailed pictures of the progression of neurodegeneration within each of the data--driven subgroups. The genetic FTD data set provides a validation of SuStaIn's ability to identify subgroups with distinct temporal progression patterns, as the different genotypes are known to have distinct patterns of neurodegeneration visible as brain atrophy in MRI 29 . SuStaIn identifies subtypes from imaging alone that map closely onto the genotypes and reconstructs patterns of neurodegeneration that reflect analysis of the individual genetic groups. It further uncovers two distinct previously unseen within--genotype phenotypes for carriers of a mutation in the C9orf72 gene, while finding the MAPT and GRN mutation groups are more homogeneous. In AD, SuStaIn identifies three distinct subtypes and reconstructs their previously unseen temporal progression. In both neurodegenerative diseases, we demonstrate strong identifiability of the SuStaIn subtypes, i.e. we can assign patients to subtype, which subtypes--only models in the literature are unable to do; see e.g. 23 . Even at very early disease stages, at least a proportion of individuals show strong alignment with particular subtypes, which highlights the potential utility in precision medicine. In AD, we show that SuStaIn subtype and stage enhance the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories substantially beyond subtypes--only or stages--only models."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subtype progression patterns", "text": "We demonstrate SuStaIn in two neurodegenerative diseases, genetic FTD and sporadic AD, using cross--sectional regional brain volumes from MRI data in the GENetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). GENFI investigates biomarker changes in carriers of mutations in progranulin (GRN), microtubule--associated protein tau (MAPT), and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) genes, which cause FTD. GRN and MAPT mutations are known to be associated with more distinct phenotypes, whereas C9orf72 is a heterogeneous group. We used GENFI as a test data set with a partially known ground truth partly for validation, as we expect SuStaIn to identify genetic groups as distinct phenotypic subtypes, but also to investigate the phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity within genotypes. Specifically, we tested SuStaIn on the combined data set from all mutation carriers in GENFI (Figure 2A ), without using knowledge of their genotype, and compared the resulting subtype progression patterns with (a) participant's genotype labels ( Figure 2B ), and (b) subtype progression patterns obtained from each genetic type separately ( Figure S1 ). Next, we used SuStaIn to identify sporadic AD subtypes from ADNI and characterise their progression from early to late disease stages ( Figure  3 ). We tested consistency of the SuStaIn subtypes in a largely independent dataset -ADNI 1.5T MRI scans rather than the main 3T data set ( Figure 4 ). In each disease we cross--validated our results to test the reproducibility of the subtypes and estimated progression patterns ( Figure S2 ). Figure 2 shows that SuStaIn successfully identifies the progression patterns of the different genetic groups in GENFI, without prior knowledge of genotype, and further reveals that the C9orf72 group is phenotypically heterogeneous, finding two neuroanatomical subtypes. Figure 2A shows the four subtypes that SuStaIn finds from the full set of all mutation carriers in GENFI. We refer to them as the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, temporal lobe subtype, frontotemporal lobe subtype, and subcortical subtype. Figure 2B reveals that GRN mutation carriers are the main contributors to the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, MAPT mutation carriers are the main contributors to the temporal lobe subtype, and C9orf72 mutation carriers are the main contributors to both the frontotemporal lobe subtype and the subcortical subtype. This suggests that there are two distinct subtypes in the C9orf72 group. Application of SuStaIn to each genetic type separately supports this finding by demonstrating that the GRN mutation carriers are best described as a single asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, the MAPT mutation carriers are best described as a temporal lobe subtype and the C9orf72 mutation carriers are best described as two distinct disease subtypes: a frontotemporal lobe subtype and a subcortical subtype. SuStaIn additionally finds an outlier cluster in the MAPT group for which the progression pattern has high uncertainty. This high uncertainty likely prevents the cluster from being detected when applying SuStaIn to all mutation carriers in Figure 2 as this small proportion of outliers can be sufficiently modelled by the three alternative subtype progression patterns. Figure S1 shows that the subtype progression patterns for each genetic type are in good agreement with those found in the full set of all mutation carriers ( Figure 2A ). Figure S2A shows that the four subtypes estimated in Figure 2A are reproducible under cross--validation, with a high average similarity between cross--validation folds of greater than 93% for each subtype. Altogether these results provide strong evidence that the C9orf72 group are phenotypically heterogeneous, expressing two distinct subtypes, whereas the GRN and MAPT groups express more homogeneous phenotypes. SuStaIn identifies three subtype progression patterns in AD Figure 3 shows the temporal progression of the three neuroanatomical subtypes that SuStaIn identifies from ADNI, which we term \"typical\", \"cortical\" and \"subcortical\". SuStaIn reveals that for the typical subtype atrophy starts in the hippocampus and amygdala; for the cortical subtype in the nucleus accumbens, insula and cingulate; and for the subcortical subtype in the pallidum, putamen, nucleus accumbens and caudate. Figure S2B shows that these three subtypes are reproducible under cross--validation, giving an average similarity between cross--validation folds of greater than 92% for each subtype. Figure 4 shows that the three subtypes in Figure 3 are reproducible in a largely independent dataset consisting of regional brain volumes derived from 1.5T rather than 3T MRI scans. From the 1.5T data, SuStaIn broadly replicates the three major clusters found in the 3T data, again finding a typical, cortical and subcortical subtype. The origin of atrophy for each subtype is in general agreement with the 3T data: atrophy begins in the hippocampus and amygdala for the typical subtype, in the insula and cingulate for the cortical subtype; and in the pallidum, putamen and caudate for the subcortical subtype. The main difference compared to the 3T data is that the nucleus accumbens is not indicated as an early region to atrophy in the 1.5T data for the cortical and subcortical subtypes. SuStaIn additionally identifies a small proportion (4%) of outliers with a parietal subtype in the 1.5T data."}, {"section_title": "SuStaIn reveals novel within genotype phenotypes in FTD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AD subtype progression patterns are reproducible in an independent dataset", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Disease subtyping and staging", "text": "We investigated SuStaIn's capability for reliable stratification in each neurodegenerative disease ( Figure 5 ) to determine the potential for homogeneous cohort identification. First, we assessed how reliably SuStaIn assigns patients to subtypes ( Figure 5A and B). Specifically, in genetic FTD, we tested the consistency of SuStaIn subtypes with the different genetic types in symptomatic mutation carriers. We also compared the discriminative power of the SuStaIn subtypes against a subtypes--only model, i.e. clustering without progression modelling: a comparable model that accounts for phenotypic heterogeneity but not temporal heterogeneity ( Figure 6 and Table 1 ). Second, we assessed the reliability of the SuStaIn stages in each disease ( Figure 5C and D) by comparison with clinical diagnostic categories. In ADNI, where clinical follow--up information is available, we further examined the ability of SuStaIn subtypes and stages to predict relevant outcomes, by determining whether SuStaIn subtype and/or stage modify the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories ( Table 2 ). We compared the predictive power with a subtypes--only model, and stages--only model, i.e. progression modelling without clustering: a comparable model that accounts for temporal heterogeneity but not phenotypic heterogeneity (Table S1 ). Figure 5 illustrates the practical utility of SuStaIn's disease subtyping and staging information for each neurodegenerative disease. Figure 5A shows that the identifiability of the SuStaIn subtypes in genetic FTD increases as the diseases progress, with the subtypes being strongly identifiable in symptomatic mutation carriers in GENFI. Figure  5B shows that the identifiability of the SuStaIn subtypes in AD also increases with disease progression, with a strong separation of the subtypes in ADNI participants with an AD diagnosis. The strong identifiability of the AD subtypes that SuStaIn achieves by accounting for temporal heterogeneity is in contrast to previous studies 23 that model phenotypic but not temporal heterogeneity. Moreover, the identifiability is seen even at early disease stages (MCI), where many subjects cluster around the vertices of the triangles. Figures 5C and 5D show that the distribution of SuStaIn stages differs between diagnostic groups in both GENFI and ADNI, and provides a good separation of presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers, and cognitively normal (CN) and AD. SuStaIn subtypes discriminate FTD genotype Table 1A shows the classification accuracy obtained using the SuStaIn subtypes in Figure 2 to discriminate the genotype of affected mutation carriers in GENFI. The SuStaIn subtypes give a balanced accuracy of 95% for the two--way classification task of distinguishing the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups. For the more challenging three--way classification task of distinguishing all genotypes in the presence of heterogeneity, the SuStaIn subtypes provide a balanced accuracy of 81%. A high proportion of the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups are correctly assigned to the asymmetric frontal lobe (93% of affected GRN carriers) and temporal lobe subtype progression patterns (91% of affected MAPT carriers). The heterogeneous C9orf72 carrier group are much more difficult to classify, with a total of 58% of affected C9orf72 carriers being assigned to the frontotemporal lobe and subcortical subtypes. Apart from heterogeneity, the C9orf72 carriers are also more difficult to classify because the frontotemporal lobe and subcortical subtype progression patterns are more similar to the other subtypes; by evaluating the similarity of each pair of subtype progression patterns (see Methods: Similarity between two subtype progression patterns) we find that the asymmetric frontal lobe and temporal lobe subtypes have the most distinct progression patterns of any pair of subtypes; the asymmetric frontal lobe and frontotemporal lobe subtypes have the most similar progression patterns of any pair of subtypes. The assignment to genotype in Table 1A is performed by simply allocating individuals to their most probable SuStaIn subtype and thus to the corresponding genotype. However, we can improve overall balanced accuracy with alternative choices of decision thresholds on the subtype probabilities that account for differences in the confidence with which individuals are assigned to groups (the homogeneous genetic groups are typically assigned to their corresponding phenotype with much higher confidence than the C9orf72 group). Table 1C shows the classification accuracy obtained for discriminating genotype when the probability required for assignment to a particular subtype is optimised. After increasing the probability required for assignment to the asymmetric frontal lobe and temporal lobe subtypes corresponding to the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups, the overall balanced classification accuracy increases from 81% to 86%. The classification accuracy for assigning the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups to their corresponding phenotype remains high, with 93% of affected GRN carriers being assigned to the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype and 91% of affected MAPT carriers being assigned to the temporal lobe subtype. The assignment of C9orf72 mutation carriers to their genotype improves substantially, with the proportion of affected C9orf72 mutation carriers being assigned to the frontotemporal lobe and subcortical subtypes increasing from 58% to 75%. Of note is that the optimised threshold for assigning affected MAPT carriers to the temporal lobe subtype (probability of 0.35) is much lower than that for assigning affected GRN carriers to the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype (probability of 0.65). This is likely due to the presence of outliers in the MAPT group ( Figure S1 ). Table 1B shows the classification accuracy obtained using a subtypes--only model (see Figure 6 ), which does not account for temporal heterogeneity, to discriminate the genotype of affected mutation carriers in GENFI. The SuStaIn subtypes out--perform the subtypes--only model. The subtypes--only model gives a balanced accuracy of 92% compared to 95% using SuStaIn for the two--way classification task of distinguishing GRN and MAPT carrier groups; the subtypes--only model gives a balanced accuracy of 65% compared to 81% using SuStaIn for the three--way classification task of distinguishing all genotypes. We further performed the same optimisation of the probability required to assign individuals to different subtypes for classification of genotype for the subtypes--only model (shown in Table 1D ) as we did for SuStaIn (Table  1C ). Again the SuStaIn subtypes substantially out--perform the subtypes--only model; the optimised subtypes--only model gives a balanced accuracy of 69% compared to 86% using SuStaIn. In the subtypes--only model the majority of misclassifications arise from the earlier stage affected GRN and MAPT carriers being assigned to the mild frontotemporal subtype associated with C9orf72 carriers. Table 2 shows that the SuStaIn subtypes and stages have predictive utility for the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories in ADNI. By fitting a Cox Proportional Hazards model, we found significant effects of baseline SuStaIn subtype (p=2.44\u00d710 --3 ) and stage (p=8.76\u00d710 --11 ) on an individual's risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Of the SuStaIn subtypes, the subcortical subtype is associated with the lowest risk of conversion, whilst the typical subtype is associated with the highest risk of conversion. Table S1 shows that SuStaIn out--performs subtypes--only and stages--only models at predicting the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories in ADNI. By performing likelihood ratio tests comparing SuStaIn to subtypes--only and stages--only we find that SuStaIn provides a significantly better fit than both subtypes--only (p=3.96\u00d710 --5 ) and stages--only (p=7.18\u00d710 --4 ) models. This shows that both the subtypes and stages estimated by SuStaIn provide additional information for estimating the risk of conversion from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "SuStaIn subtypes and stages are identifiable", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SuStaIn out--performs subtypes--only models for discriminating FTD genotype", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SuStaIn subtypes and stages have predictive utility in AD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study we introduce SuStaIn -a new and powerful tool for data--driven disease phenotype discovery, providing new insights into disease aetiology, and new power for patient stratification in clinical trials and healthcare. Using the GENFI dataset we are able to show that SuStaIn can successfully recover known distinct progression patterns in genetic FTD that correspond to individuals with different genotypes. SuStaIn further reveals within--group heterogeneity for carriers of a mutation in the C9orf72 gene and characterises the heterogeneity as distinct temporal progression patterns in two subtypes. This demonstrates the utility of SuStaIn for data--driven disease phenotype discovery, and provides new biological insight into the C9orf72 mutation. Application of SuStaIn to the 3T ADNI dataset provides data--driven support for post--mortem neuropathological findings, finding three distinct AD subtypes. These three subtypes are corroborated using a largely independent data set (ADNI 1.5T). The disease subtype characterisation SuStaIn provides goes much further than post--mortem neuropathological studies 3, 28 , or other machine--learning techniques 23 , by characterising the temporal trajectory of each subtype, enabling in vivo classification of subjects by disease stage as well as disease subtype. We demonstrate the utility of SuStaIn for in vivo patient subtyping and staging in both genetic FTD and AD. In genetic FTD, we show that the SuStaIn neuroimaging subtypes can distinguish affected carriers belonging to different genetic groups with high classification accuracy. In AD, we demonstrate that the SuStaIn subtypes are identifiable, even at early disease stages (MCI), and that the SuStaIn subtypes and stages have added utility for predicting conversion between clinical diagnoses, beyond models that do not account for phenotypic heterogeneity (in disease subtype) or temporal heterogeneity (in disease stage)."}, {"section_title": "Subtype progression patterns New insights into FTD heterogeneity", "text": "The asymmetric frontal lobe subtype and temporal lobe subtype in Figure 2 show clear similarities with previous studies of regional volume loss in GRN and MAPT mutation carriers respectively, i.e. asymmetric frontotemporoparietal lobe volume loss in GRN carriers and temporal lobe volume loss in MAPT carriers 24 . However, SuStaIn provides much greater detail and accuracy by avoiding reliance on crude a priori staging, e.g. via mean familial age of onset. The frontotemporal lobe subtype and subcortical subtype in Figure 2 both have features previously associated with C9orf72 mutation carriers, e.g. widespread symmetric grey matter atrophy and volume loss in the cerebellum 24 , but SuStaIn assigns these features to two distinct disease subtypes, and further reveals the temporal progression of each subtype. Several biological factors may produce the two subtypes observed in C9orf72 mutation carriers, either individually or in combination. Clinically, whilst there is significant overlap, patients typically present with either a behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as their main phenotype 32 , and they can progress at various rates; genetically, the expansion length is variable and there are additional genetic modifiers (e.g. TMEM106B and ATXN2) that alter phenotype [33] [34] [35] ; and pathologically, most cases have either type A or type B TDP--43 pathology 32 . Whilst further study is required to determine the biological factors that influence neuroanatomical phenotype, these findings demonstrate the power of SuStaIn in identifying hitherto unrecognised disease subtypes using clinical data, to generate hypotheses that can be tested using basic science approaches."}, {"section_title": "Outliers in the MAPT mutation carrier group", "text": "We also find evidence for the presence of outliers in the MAPT mutation carrier group, but numbers are too small to determine whether these outliers have a distinct progression pattern. We ran a post--hoc analysis to check for differences between the outliers and the general MAPT carrier population. We assigned MAPT mutation carriers to their most probable subtype of the two SuStaIn subtypes from fitting to the MAPT mutation carrier group alone. Among individuals with significant evidence of MRI atrophy (SuStaIn stage of greater than or equal to 5), four individuals were identified as outliers and nine as inliers. Although MAPT mutations have been commonly thought to have a very specific pattern of atrophy affecting the anterior and medial temporal lobes predominantly, one previous paper has shown that there can be a second pattern of atrophy in specific mutations, where the lateral temporal lobes are affected more than the medial regions 36 . Interestingly, the two pairs of individuals who constitute the outliers in our analysis all have P301L mutations, a mutation that falls into this second alternate atrophy pattern group in 36 . None of the inliers in our analysis have P301L mutations, or V337M mutations, the other mutation identified in 36 as having an alternate atrophy pattern. This suggests that SuStaIn may be able to identify particular MAPT mutations that fall into this alternate group, but larger studies will be required to confirm this."}, {"section_title": "SuStaIn reveals the temporal progression of subtypes", "text": "In contrast to previous work, SuStaIn reveals the temporal progression of neurodegenerative subtypes, and is able to determine the optimal grouping into, and number of, subtypes supported by the data. In genetic FTD, we identify that the three genotypes are best described as four major phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, with the GRN and MAPT mutation carrier groups each constituting a single major phenotype, but the C9orf72 mutation carrier group best being described as two phenotypes. In AD, we find that there are three subtypes: a typical subtype for which atrophy starts in the hippocampus and amygdala; a cortical subtype for which atrophy begins in the nucleus accumbens, insula and cingulate; and a subcortical subtype for which atrophy originates in the pallidum, putamen, nucleus accumbens and caudate, with each subtype having its own distinct progression pattern. These temporal spreading patterns for distinct subtypes offer new biological insight. For example, the progression pattern of each subtype provides a view of how neurodegeneration spreads from a distinct origin over the rest of the brain that is uncorrupted by phenotypic heterogeneity. A key advantage of SuStaIn is that it provides a purely data--driven, hypothesis--free, reconstruction of the progression of neurodegenerative disease subtypes. However, these observations also have great potential to inform hypothesis-based mechanistic models 30, 31 of neurodegenerative disease, which explain the temporal progression of neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms of disease propagation over brain networks. This allows different hypothesised disease mechanisms to be evaluated on real data. Current mechanistic models implicitly assume a single disease progression pattern -an assumption often violated in disease data sets, but much more reasonable if focussed on particular SuStaIn subtypes."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of AD subtype progression patterns with neuropathological studies", "text": "Post--mortem histology 3 and retrospectively--analysed MRI scans close to the time of death 28 observe three distinct patterns of atrophy in late--stage AD patients: one focussed on the temporal lobe that is similar to the late stages of the typical SuStaIn subtype; one affecting predominantly cortical regions cf. late stages of the cortical SuStaIn subtype; and one with stronger subcortical involvement cf. late stages of the subcortical SuStaIn subtype. This gives confidence in the SuStaIn subtypes, which provide much greater information by revealing the progression of each subtype over time, including the earliest sites of regional volume loss. Moreover, and importantly for practical utility, the SuStaIn subtypes are identifiable in vivo using MRI. Reproducibility of AD subtypes in an independent dataset The three AD subtypes found in the 3T MRI data set are corroborated by the largely independent 1.5T MRI data set. However, there are some small differences between the subtype progression patterns of the three subtypes recovered in each data set. These differences are predominantly found in how early the nucleus accumbens begins to atrophy in the different subtypes: across all three subtypes the nucleus accumbens is found to atrophy earlier in the 3T subtypes than the 1.5T subtypes. A possible explanation for this is that the volume of the nucleus accumbens can be estimated more accurately using the higher field strength 3T MRI scans than the 1.5T MRI scans, and thus atrophy in the nucleus accumbens can be identified from an earlier stage in the 3T data set compared to the 1.5T data set. AD outliers with a parietal subtype In the 1.5T MRI data set we additionally find a small proportion (4%) of outliers with a parietal subtype. This small subgroup may represent outliers with a posterior cortical atrophy phenotype: comparing the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale--cognitive subscale (ADAS--cog) scores between individuals with an AD diagnosis that are assigned to the parietal subgroup (N=6) and the typical AD subgroup (N=65), we find that the parietal subgroup have worse performance (Mann--Whitney U test) on certain praxic (Q6. Ideational Praxis, p=6.1x10 --3 , z=2.7) and spatially--demanding (Q14. Number Cancellation, p=4.9x10 --3 , z=2.8) subtests, but similar performance in memory domains (Q8. Word Recognition, p=0.81, z=--0.2; Q1. Word Recall, p=0.48, z=0.70).

This is further demonstrated in AD, in which SuStaIn's subtypes and stages substantially out--perform subtypes--only and stages--only models for predicting conversion between diagnostic categories.

Subjects were included from the second data freeze of GENFI, which in total consisted of 365 participants recruited across 13 centres in the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and Portugal. 313 had a usable volumetric T1--weighted MRI scan for analysis (15 participants did not have a scan and the other participants were excluded as the scans were of unsuitable quality due to motion, other imaging artefacts, or pathology unlikely to be attributed to frontotemporal dementia). The 313 participants included 141 non--carriers, 123 presymptomatic carriers, and 49 symptomatic carriers. Of the 123 presymptomatic mutation carriers there were 62 GRN, 39 C9orf72, and 22 MAPT carriers. Of the 49 symptomatic carriers, there were 14 GRN, 24 C9orf72, and 11 MAPT carriers. The acquisition and post--processing procedures for GENFI have been previously described in 29 . Briefly, cortical and subcortical volumes were generated using a multi--atlas segmentation propagation approach 37 , combining cortical regions of interest to calculate grey matter volumes of the entire cortex, separated into the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, cingulate, and insula cortices. In addition to regional volumetric measures, we also included a measure of asymmetry, which is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the volumes of the right and left hemispheres, normalised by the total volume of both hemispheres. This asymmetry measure was log transformed to improve normality. ADNI dataset Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non--profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5--year public--private partnership. For up--to--date information, see http://www.adni-info.org. Written consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution. We downloaded data from Laboratory Of Neuro Imaging (LONI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu) on 11 May 2016 and constructed two cross--sectional volumetric MRI datasets for SuStaIn model fitting: those with higher (3T) and lower (1.5T) field strength. The inclusion criteria for the 3T and 1.5T datasets were having cross--sectional FreeSurfer volumes available that passed overall quality control from either a 3T (processed using FreeSurfer Version 5.1) or a 1.5T (processed using FreeSurfer Version 4.3) MRI scan. The 3T dataset consisted of 793 subjects (183 cognitively normal, 86 significant memory concern, 243 early mild cognitive impairment, 164 late mild cognitive impairment, 117 Alzheimer's disease), of which 73 were enrolled in ADNI--1, 99 were enrolled in ADNI--GO, and 621 were enrolled in ADNI--2. The 1.5T dataset consisted of 576 ADNI--1 subjects (180 cognitively normal, 274 late mild cognitive impairment, 122 Alzheimer's disease). The 1.5T and 3T datasets are largely independent: only 59 subjects (14 cognitively normal, 33 late mild cognitive impairment, 12 Alzheimer's disease) have both 1.5T and 3T scans. We downloaded processed cross--sectional FreeSurfer volumes for 1.5T and 3T scans, using FreeSurfer Versions 4.3 and 5.1, and quality control ratings. We retained only the volumes that passed overall quality control, and normalised them by regressing against total intracranial volume. We further downloaded demographic information for covariate correction: age, sex, education, and APOE genotype from the ADNIMERGE table. We downloaded follow--up information to test the association of the SuStaIn model subtypes and stages with longitudinal outcomes, consisting of diagnostic follow--up data and cognitive test scores from the mini--mental state examination (MMSE). We also downloaded baseline CSF measurements of A\u03b21--42, which we used to identify a control population."}, {"section_title": "Z--scores", "text": "We expressed each regional volume measurement as a z--score relative to a control population: in GENFI we used data from all non--carriers, in ADNI we used amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, defined as those with a CSF A\u03b21--42 measurement greater than 192 pg/mL 38 . This gave us a control population of 48 amyloid--negative cognitively normal subjects for the 3T dataset, and 56 amyloid--negative cognitively normal subjects for the 1.5T dataset. We used these control populations to determine whether the effects of age, sex, education, or number of APOE4 alleles (ADNI only) were significant, and if so to regress them out. We then normalised each dataset relative to its control population, so that the control population had a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Because regional brain volumes decrease over time the z--scores become negative with disease progression, so for simplicity we took the negative value of the z-scores so that the z--scores would increase as the brain volumes became more abnormal."}, {"section_title": "Mathematical modelling SuStaIn modelling", "text": "We formulate the model underlying SuStaIn as groups of subjects with distinct patterns of biomarker evolution (see Mathematical Model).

This linear z--score event--based model is based on the event--based model in 7, 8, 39 , but reformulates the events so that they represent the continuous linear accumulation of a biomarker from one z--score to another, rather than an instantaneous switch from a normal to an abnormal level. The resulting mixture of linear z--score event--based models describes the biomarker evolution of each subgroup as a piecewise linear trajectory, with a constant noise level that is derived from a control population (see Mathematical model). The model assumes a fixed number of subtypes C, for which we estimate the proportion of subjects f that belong to each subtype, and the order Sc in which biomarkers reach each z--score for each subtype c = 1\u2026C.

To fit the C cluster model using the C--1 cluster model, we generate C--1 candidate C cluster models by going through each of the C--1 clusters in turn and finding their optimal split into two clusters; we then use this two cluster solution together with the other C--2 clusters to initialise the fitting of the C cluster model.
