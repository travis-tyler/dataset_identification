[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Accurate diagnostic assays and large-scale testing are critical for mitigating outbreaks of infectious diseases. Early detection prompts public health actions to prevent and control the spread of pathogens. This has been exemplified by the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and rapidly spread around the world 1-3 . The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was critical for the development of diagnostics 2 , which led to several molecular assays being developed to detect COVID-19 cases [4] [5] [6] [7] . The World Health Organization (WHO) currently lists seven molecular assays (i.e. qRT-PCR) to diagnose COVID-19 8 ; however, it is not clear to many laboratories or public health agencies which assay they should adopt.\nOur goal was to critically compare the analytical efficiencies and sensitivities of the four most common SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assays developed by the China Center for Disease Control (China CDC) 7 , United States CDC (US CDC) 6 , Charit\u00e9 (Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology, Germany) 5 , and Hong Kong University (HKU) 4 . To this end, we first generated RNA transcripts from a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from an early COVID-19 case from the state of Washington (United States) 9 . Using RNA transcripts, isolated virus RNA, and mock clinical samples, our analyses show that all of the primer-probe sets used in the qRT-PCR assays can detect SARS-COV-2, but we find important differences between the analytical sensitivities to detect low amounts of virus and the detection of false positives. Thus, we provide evidence that all of the assays are appropriate for virus detection as long as the limitations of each are recognized."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Generation of RNA transcript standards for qRT-PCR validation A barrier to implementing and validating qRT-PCR molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection was the availability of virus RNA standards. As the full length SARS-CoV-2 RNA is considered as a biological safety level 2 hazard in the US, we generated small RNA transcripts (704-1363 nt) from the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes spanning each of the primer and probe sets in the China CDC 7 , US CDC 6 , Charit\u00e9 5 , and HKU 4 assays ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1; Supplemental Tables 1-2 ) 10 . By measuring PCR amplification using 10-fold serial dilutions of our RNA transcript standards, we found the efficiencies of each of the nine primer-probe sets to be above 90% ( Fig. 1B ) , which match the criteria for an efficient qRT-PCR assay 11 . Our RNA transcripts can thus be used for assay validation, positive controls, and standards to quantify viral loads: critical steps for a diagnostic assay. Our protocol to generate the RNA transcripts is openly available 10 , and any clinical or research diagnostic lab can directly request them for free through our lab website ( www.grubaughlab.com ).

To do so we used the same (i) thermocycler conditions (40 cycles of 10 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 20 seconds at 55\u00b0C); (ii) primer-probe concentrations (500 nM of forward and reverse primer, and 250 nM of probe); and (iii) PCR reagents (New England Biolabs Luna Universal One-step RT-qPCR kit) in all reactions. From our measured PCR amplification efficiencies and analytical sensitivities of detection, most primer-probes sets were comparable, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) set, which had low sensitivity ( Fig. 2 ).\nBy testing each of the nine primer-probe sets using 10-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA derived from cell culture ( Fig. 2A ) or 10-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into RNA extracted from pooled nasopharyngeal swabs from pre-COVID-19 respiratory disease patients (virus RNA-spiked mocks; Fig. 2B ), we again found that the PCR amplification efficiencies were near or above 90% ( Fig. 2C ). To measure the analytical sensitivity of virus detection, we used the cycle threshold (CT) value in which the expected linear dilution series would cross the y-intercept when tested with 1 genome equivalent per \u03bcL of RNA. Our measured sensitivities (y-intercept CT values) were similar among most of the primer-probe sets, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) set ( Fig. 2D ). We found that the CT values from the RdRp-SARSr set were usually 6-10 CTs higher (lower virus detection) than the other primer-probe sets.

Our mock samples demonstrated that many of the primer-probe sets cross-reacted with non-SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, which may lead to false positive results ( Fig. 3 ).\nWhen using nasopharyngeal swabs without spiked in SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we detected CT values <40 for the CCDC-N (5/8, 62.5%), CCDC-ORF1 (2/8, 25%), 2019-nCoV_N2 (2/8, 25%), and 2019-nCoV_N3 (6/8, 75%) sets, which suggests amplification of nonspecific products ( Fig. 3 ) . Moreover, the CT value ranges for mock samples overlapped with the CT value ranges (~36-40) for the swabs spiked with 10 0 and 10 1 virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL ( Fig. 3 ) , indicating that this \"background noise\" will limit the ability to differentiate between true positives and negatives at low virus concentrations using the CCDC-N, CCDC-ORF1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and 2019-nCoV_N3. In fact, the 2019-nCoV_N3 primer-probe set has been excluded from the US CDC assay due to these issues 12 .\nOf the primer-probe sets without background CT values in the SARS-CoV-2-negative mock samples (E-Sarbeco, RdRp-SARSr, HKU-N, HKU-ORF1, and 2019-nCoV_N1), our results show that none were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 1 (10 0 ) virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL and mixed detection at 10 (10 1 ) virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL ( Fig. 3 ). We found that the two most sensitive primer-probe sets are E-Sarbeco (Charit\u00e9) and HKU-ORF1, which each detected 6/8 (75%) of the nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with 10 virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL ( Fig. 3 ). At 100 (10 2 ) virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL, we could detect virus (CT <40) and differentiate between the negative mocks for all replicates and primers sets, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) set, which was negative (CT >40) for all 10 0 -10 2 genome equivalents/\u03bcL concentrations. Thus, our results show that there are differences in each of the primer-probe sets to differentiate between true negatives and true positives at virus concentrations at or below 10 virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL. .

We deviated from the recommended concentrations in the original assays to make a fair comparison across primer-probe sets, using 500 nM of each primer and 250 nM of probe 2. To investigate the effect of primer-probe concentration on the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2, we made a direct comparison between (i) our standardized primer (500 nM) and probe (250 nM) concentrations, (ii) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 100 nM of probe 1 and 2 (confirmatory assay), and (iii) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 200 nM of probe 2 (discriminatory assay) per reaction 5 . We found that adjusting the primer-probe concentrations or using the combination of probes 1 and 2 did not increase SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection when using 10-fold serial dilutions of our RdRp RNA transcripts, or full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture ( Fig. 4 ) . The Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology assay is designed to use the E-Sarbeco primer-probes as an initial screening assay, and the RdRp-SARSr primer-probes as a confirmatory test 5 .

To investigate whether this had already occurred during the early COVID-19 pandemic, we calculated the accumulated genetic diversity from 992 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Fig. 5A ) and compared that to the primer and probe binding regions ( Fig. 5B ). Thus far we detected 12 primer-probe nucleotide mismatches that have occurred in at least two of the 992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\nThe most potentially problematic mismatch is in the RdRp-SARSr reverse primer ( Fig. 5B ), which likely explains our sensitivity issues with this set ( Figs. 2-4 ) . Oddly, the mismatch is not derived from a new variant that has arisen, but rather that the primer contains a degenerate nucleotide (S, binds with G or C) at position 12, and 990 of the 992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes encode for a T at this genome position ( Fig. 5B ). This degenerate nucleotide appears to have been added to help the primer anneal to SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-related CoV genomes 5 , seemingly to the detriment of consistent SARS-CoV-2 detection. Earlier in the outbreak, before hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes became available, non-SARS-CoV-2 data were used to infer genetic diversity that could be anticipated during the outbreak. As a result, several of the primers contain degenerate nucleotides ( Supplemental Table 3 ). For RdRp-SARSr, adjusting the primer (S\u2192A) may resolve its low sensitivity.\nOf the variants that we detected in the primer-probe regions, we only found four in more than 30 of the 992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (>3%, Fig. 5B ). Most notable was a stretch of three nucleotide substitutions (GGG\u2192AAC) at genome positions 28,881-28,883, which occur in the three first positions of the CCDC-N forward primer binding site. While these substitutions define a large clade that includes~13% of the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes and has been detected in numerous countries 13 , their position on the 5' location of the primer may not be detrimental to sequence annealing and amplification. The other high frequency variant that we detected was T\u2192C substitution at the 8 th position of the binding region of the 2019-nCoV_N3 forward primer, a substitution found in 39 genomes (position 28,688). While this primer could be problematic for detecting viruses with this variant, the 2019-nCoV_N3 set has already been removed from the US CDC assay. We found another seven variants in only five or fewer genomes (<0.5%, Fig. 5B ), and their minor frequency at present does not pose a major concern for viral detection. This scenario may change if those variants increase in frequency: most of them lie in the second half of the primer binding region, and .

Ignoring gaps and ambiguous bases, we compared all possible pairs of nucleotides in all columns of a multiple sequence alignment including all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (as of 22 March 2020). We assigned a score of 1 for each identical pair of bases, and divided the final score by the total number of valid nucleotide pairs, to finally express pairwise identities as percentages. Pairwise identity of less than 100% indicates mismatches between primers or probes and some SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We calculated mismatch frequencies and reported absolute and relative frequencies for mismatches with frequency higher than 0.1%.

This should be carefully evaluated to determine CT value cut-offs to differentiate between positives and negatives. The US CDC assay, for example, uses a cut-off value of CT 40, but we generated CT values in the range of 37-40 when the 2019-nCoV_N2 set was tested on RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs void of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Considering that both the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 and N2 sets need to be >40 CTs to be considered as negative, background amplification in one of the sets would result in inconclusive results.\nOverall, we found that the most sensitive primer-probe sets are E-Sarbeco (Charit\u00e9), HKU-ORF1 (HKU), and 2019-nCoV_N1 (US CDC). In contrast, the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) primer-probe set had the lowest sensitivity, likely stemming from a mismatch in the reverse primer.
