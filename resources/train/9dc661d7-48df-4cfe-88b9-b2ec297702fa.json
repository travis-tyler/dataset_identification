[{"section_title": "T", "text": "he underwater environment that covers 70% of Earth's surface poses major logistical challenges to seafloor studies. Marine geophysical research is conducted with large research vessels, temporary ocean-bottom seismometers (1), and a limited number of permanent tethered observatories (2,3). Emerging float networks, seafloor global navigation satellite system, and high-frequency remote sensing are beginning to infill major data gaps with promising near-real-time cov-erage. The impact has included quantification of offshore seismic hazards (4,5), submarine volcanism (6), marine ecology, and ocean transport (7), yet many oceanographic and solidearth processes remain spatially aliased. Fiber-optic sensing is an emerging means of recording dense geophysical information onshore (8,9) and should be equally useful offshore, using existing dark fiber seafloor optical fibers. Marra et al. (10) proposed using transmission time-of-flight of ultrastable laser pulses inside transoceanic subsea fibers to record cable-averaged seafloor strain. To examine seafloor strain with higher spatial resolution, we used backscattered laser pulses with phase-based coherent optical time-domain reflectometry (\u03d5-OTDR), otherwise known as distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), inside the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) science cable that spans the continental shelf offshore of California (Fig. 1) (11). In contrast to the approach of Marra et al., DAS multiplexes the optical analysis and thus resolves the seafloor strain field every 10 m, which in our case produced an array dataset totaling 3.2 TB collected over 4 days. We recorded the 11 March 2018 strike-slip earthquake near Gilroy, CA, using the MARS cable. Figure 2 shows this earthquake wavefield DAS record after minimal data processing (11). P, pP, PP, S, and SS phase arrivals matched predicted arrival times for the U.S. Geological Survey-cataloged event solution and 1 of 5  cable geometry. The P-wave was barely visible over cable segments, potentially owing to the suboptimal orientation of particle motion relative to the fiber axis (q > 71\u00b0). Converted pP and PP phases with greater horizontal components were more robustly observed. Time-domain beamforming of the record found that energy arrived with equal components from the epicenteral backazimuth of 81\u00b0N and a direction around 45\u00b0N ( Fig. 2E), interpreted as seismic multipathing through the complex threedimensional North American-Pacific plate boundary (12). A second source of scattering was found to originate from local structure immediately below the seafloor cable. After each seismic phase, we observed strong coherent seismic energy propagating outward with apparent velocity of 200 to 600 m/s from discrete points between 15.1 and 16.3 km on the MARS cable and also between 8.4 and 10.3 km ( Fig. 2, B to D). We interpreted this as body wave conversion into Scholte waves at subvertical seafloor faults, which act as point scatterers. Scholte waves have Rayleigh-type wave motion and propagate at the ocean-solid earth interface. Wavefront tracking of the main SS phase showed slowdown between 14.5 and 16.5 km, coincident with observed scattering (Fig. 2D). Assuming wave propagation in the cable axis plane, velocity decreased from 2.1 km/s to 1.2 km/s over <1 km. We interpreted this as a waveguide effect where seismic energy interacts with highly fractured, lowvelocity fault zone gouge layers (13). Similar observations were made for the subsequent magnitude 2.7 aftershock. Recent high-resolution seismic reflection imaging from this section of the continental shelf near Monterey and Soquel canyons identified extensive paleocanyon deposits and the NW-SE striking Aptos Fault Zone, a major step-over relay between the San Andreas Fault Zone onshore and the San Gregorio Fault Zone offshore (14,15). Four subvertical Aptos faults mapped in (14) transect the MARS cable around 15 to 17 km and near 19 km at an oblique angle ( Fig. 1). These fault locations correlate with observed secondary scattering locations from the Gilroy event. We identified a number of unmapped faults ( Fig. 1 for locations; strike based on regional information) in a segment extending the Aptos Fault Zone 15 to 20 km SSE parallel to shore, potentially connecting to the Monterey Canyon. Ocean-solid earth interactions generate Rayleigh waves between 0.05 and 0.5 Hz, which are globally recorded as primary and secondary microseisms (16)(17)(18)(19). In principle, horizontal seafloor fibers have zero strain sensitivity to primary microseism (PM) hydrostatic load changes. To test this hypothesis, we fit a PM model based on buoy wave height records to DAS strain data at 0.05 to 0.15 Hz (11). We 2 of 5 found that these DAS records can be explained as PM ( fig. S1), likely because the fiber package experiences a Poissonian strain response (20) or an unquantified transverse seafloor current motion in the shallow waters of Monterey Bay. Tracking microseism energy over 4 days (Fig. 3), we observed a consistent response between buoy wave motion, seafloor DAS strain, and seismometer noise onshore (11). All three instruments record high amplitudes during the initial period of high storm activity on 10 March 2018. Recorded amplitudes decrease as the first storm loses energy and then increase as the second storm builds. Small absolute frequency shifts and amplitude discrepancies between the three records could be the result of a number of variables, including complicated energy partitioning, that is, the quality and character of microseism energy conversion at the ocean-continent interface; fiber and seismometer coupling; lateral separation and water-depth differences between the buoy and fiber (18); and poorly constrained ocean site effects (21). To assess energy partitioning, we decomposed the wavefield in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Shoaling wave loads in shallow water produce PMs (18,22) that obey the dispersion equation"}, {"section_title": "of 5", "text": "where w is angular frequency, g is gravitational acceleration, k is wavenumber, and H is water depth. DAS PM recordings were found to be strongly dispersive ( fig. S2). Because PMs are caused by local wave height, outgoing components are the result of coast reflection. We thus computed that the reflected PM energy is~1% of the incoming energy. The leading hypothesis for secondary microseism (SM) generation is that opposing wind-wave trains mix nonlinearly and produce Scholte waves at near-acoustic speeds (23,24). Testing this hypothesis requires observation of both opposing ocean waves and the resulting Scholte wave generation, which has only been documented in one deep-ocean environment (25). In Monterey Bay, we observed weak energy at 0.25 to 1.5 Hz and very low wavenumber (0.003 m \u22121 ) with symmetric amplitude components traveling at 400 to 1000 m/s, faster than observed wind-wave speeds. We interpreted this as in situ SM generation ultimately produced by the nonlinear interaction of the aforementioned incoming and outgoing windwaves ( fig. S2C). This suggests that SMs are generated even when one wind-wave component is vanishingly small. SM amplitudes were 1.5 to 2 dB below PM, likely owing to the shallow water environment. We detected a number of nonmicroseism hydrodynamic signals (Fig. 4). At 0.5 to 5 Hz, we observed decreasing amplitude as the first storm lost energy, consistent with seafloor current-driven sediment transport similar to noise profiles of bedload transport observed onshore near rivers (26,27). At 1 to 2 Hz, we observed transients coincident with rising tide, interpreted as thermal strain related to semidiurnal internal tidal bores (28)(29)(30)(31). At 0.005 to 0.05 Hz, we observed tidally modulated infragravity waves previously observed using the Monterey Bay seismometer supported by MARS (32). At~0.001 Hz, we also observed a strong gliding signal with harmonics declining in energy from 10 March 2018. Signal gliding correlated with high and low tide. The signal may be related to the higher harmonics of the Monterey Bay seiche (33), but water level monitoring documented stable seiche amplitudes (34). An alternative hypothesis is that this is a solid-earth tilt response to slowmoving internal gravity waves, vertical oscillations of the ocean stratification interface, which break near steep bathymetric features such as the Monterey Canyon (28,(35)(36)(37). Internal waves enhance cross-shelf transport of fluid and biology and are therefore foundational in models of thermohaline ocean circulation and marine ecology (38). Independent of the source mechanism, this low-frequency DAS signal highlights the potential utility of the method for studying quasi-geodetic strain phenomena. Fig. 4. Broadband hydrodynamic signals.
