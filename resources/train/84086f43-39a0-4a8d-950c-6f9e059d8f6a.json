COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The disease signifies a respiratory syndrome starting from mild upper respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronavirus genus of the coronaviruses. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) also belongs to the same genus, SARS-CoV-2 leads to milder infections.\nHowever, SARS-CoV-2 have a broader community transmission when compared with SARS and MERS. Hence, laboratory testing is of paramount importance to distinguish between COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. Moreover, extensive testing will help in COVID diagnosis and a better understanding of disease prevalence in asymptomatic infections. As of November 10, 2020, there have been over 50 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1.2 million deaths across the world. Contribution of Laboratory medicine in diagnosis, prognosis, risk prediction and management is indispensable in most of the human pathologies, and COVID-19 is not an exception. The current COVID-19 pandemic has reconfirmed that laboratory diagnostics will remain the core of every clinical decision made. This review covers recent laboratory modalities available for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment response in COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "LABORATORY TESTING IN COVID-19", "text": "Clinical Laboratories are of paramount importance in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. From early diagnosis, Clinical Laboratories play a crucial role in monitoring comorbidities, diagnosing complications, assessment of treatment responses and in assessing the prevalence of diseases in the community. Timely and accurate diagnosis of the disease is essential for early initiation of treatment as well as to prevent the transmission to contacts.\nDifferent counties had followed and implemented different testing strategies targeting different genes based on the availability of diagnostic methods and consumables (Table 1) . Further, the WHO has meanwhile taken strict steps and created the diagnostics available with the mission to \"detect, protect and treat\" to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2(3). Early diagnosis and immediate treatment will significantly decrease future COVID-19 cases. Therefore, early laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"section_title": "FOR COVID-19", "text": "Compared to symptomatic testing and CT scan method, the molecular techniques are more appropriate in accurate diagnosis since they target the identification of pathogens ( Figure 1 ). Despite this, the Real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) serves as a gold standard method for nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2. Since this a time consuming and sophisticated method, rRT-PCR serves better as a diagnostic tool than a screening tool (10) .\nConsidering the current stage of the pandemic, a large number of patient screening is needed using novel screening methods which require lesser equipment and materials.\nThe advancement of molecular techniques is mainly reliant on understanding the genomic and proteomic composition of the pathogen. Similarly, the changes in the host gene or protein expressions induced by the pathogen after infection (11) . World Health Organization (WHO) and China jointly described genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic characterisation (12, 13) . This genome sequencing has given a road map to researchers for designing primers and probe sequences for rRT-PCR and some other nucleic acid amplification tests. "}, {"section_title": "NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION TEST (NAAT)", "text": "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, nucleic acid amplification testing is the primary method of diagnosis. Multiple real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits have been invented to detect SARS-CoV-2. Corman et al. aligned and scrutinised SARS-CoV-2 related viral genome sequences to construct a set of oligo primers and probe sequences (6) . Among these mainly three conserved sequences have been revealed. 1) In open reading frame ORF1ab region the RdRP gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene), 2) Envelope protein gene (E gene), 3) Nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) (6) . Different countries submitted their primary probe designs to the WHO. As an example, the rRT-PCR can be designed as two genes target system or three genes target systems, where one primer set detects family of coronaviruses, the second set detects specifically SARS-CoV-2 and third is human RNase P as the internal control (Table 1) . Similarly, ICMR also released some recommendations for COVID-19 diagnosis. The ICMR has recommended the use of US-based RT-PCR probes distributed to national laboratories (16).\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set up a panel of genes through RT-PCR for the specific finding of SARS-CoV-2 and overall detection of SARS-like beta coronaviruses (9) . Primarily designed by targeting three different sets of primers to the N gene among these two primers sets are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and one primer set is specific to all beta coronaviruses. If all three genes are positive, then it specifies the COVID-19 confirmation. Similarly, in Germany Charite (6) developed two sets of nucleic acid tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat-like beta-CoVs by targeting the RdRp and E genes, if both tests were positive then COVID-19 confirmation through SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. The results of the Chu et al. study suggested targeting the N gene as primary screening and ORF1ab as a confirmative target. Studies targeted at two or more genes, thus had a stronger outcome performance compared to single genes alone (20) . Now, molecular testing was developed as the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, hence the E and RdRb genes suggesting better analytical sensitivity compared to the N and ORF1ab genes combination.\nWhile different institutions have developed various SARS-CoV-2 research protocols, it remains uncertain if the findings of nucleic acid tests based on multiple targets are comparable. In a recent study compared the analytical sensitivities of the United States, Germany, Hong Kong and China qRT-PCR assays by using RNA transcripts isolated from a COVID-19 patient (21) .\nThey found that all primer-probe sets used in the qRT-PCR tests could detect SARS-CoV-2, but the significant difference was observed in the limit of detection (LOD) and the ability to distinguish the positives and negatives while the viral load is at lower levels. The highest sensitivity of primer-probe sets was found E-gene (Germany), N1 gene (US CDC), ORF1 (Hongkong) but RdRp gene (Germany) showed the lowest sensitivity. In another study from Germany Konrad et al.\nfound that by using a single-step qRT-PCR method, the E gene target was more sensitive than the RdRp target (22)."}, {"section_title": "DIRECT RT-PCR", "text": "The positive controls (2019-nCoV pseudovirus) provide a nucleic acid extraction and a reverse transcription control to validate the entire procedure and reagent integrity. Similarly, the RNAse P internal control provides an RNA extraction of practical control and secondary negative control. However, RNA extraction from clinical samples creates a major bottleneck in the diagnostic process, as it either runs manually and thus is laborious or automated and expensive. To overcome this, recently, some research groups developed direct RT-PCR by omitting RNA extraction procedure (23) (24) (25) . In this method, after the collection of patient material and deposition of potential SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in transport medium followed by the inactivation of the virus through detergent/chaotropic reagents or heating process step. Then, transfer the lysate to single-step RT-PCR format in which cDNA synthesis by RT and detection by qPCR may take place. Wee Sk et al. showed that direct RT-PCR has a high sensitivity of 6 RNA copies per reaction and is quantitative over a dynamic range of 7 orders of magnitude (25). Direct amplification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from samples without RNA purification allows the reducing hands-on-time, time-to-results, and costs. As per WHO guidelines, one of the following conditions should be met for considering a case as a NAAT-confirmed laboratory in areas with no circulation of SARS-CoV-2(18).\n1) A positive NAAT result for at least two different targets on the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome, of which at least one target is preferably specific for SARS-CoV-2 virus using a validated assay;\n2) One positive NAAT result for the presence of beta coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 virus further identified by sequencing partial or whole genome of the virus as long as the sequence target is larger or different from the amplicon probed in the NAAT assay used.\nAt the moment, it's important to identify that a negative result may not eliminate the possibility of COVID-19, it might be due to the poor-quality specimens, early or late collection, inadequate sample, and incorrect test procedures. When a patient with a high level of suspicion obtains a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, especially when only upper respiratory tract specimens have been collected, additional specimens should be collected and tested, including, where possible, from the lower respiratory tract (26)."}, {"section_title": "LOOP-MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION", "text": "Isothermal amplification depended nucleic acid tests are currently under progression for SARS-CoV-2. Recently a few studies reported the development of reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) tests (27) (28) (29) and some are clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 (30, 31) .\nPrimarily RT-LAMP is based on the DNA polymerase and 4-6 primers to bind at distinct regions on the target genome. RT-LAMP is a highly specific method since it uses a greater number of primers, like two inner primers and two outer primers on different regions on the genome. In LAMP diagnostic tests, SARS-CoV-2 family genes such as ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E) or/and N gene can be targeted, and the procedure will be done in a single step at 63 \u00b0C isothermal conditions, and within 15-40 minutes the results will be obtained (27, 28, 30, 31) . For the POCT of SARS-CoV-2, many institutes are keen to implement isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, eliminating the need for a highly costly thermal cycler. The most promising alternative to PCR may be loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) because it provides many advantages in terms of precision, sensitivity, reaction efficiency and product yield. Recently, a reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP assay targeting non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) for SARS-CoV-2 detection was developed by Park et al., whose LOD was 100 copies per reaction (32) . Similarly, RT-LAMP assay within 60 min targeting an ORF1ab and the S gene, whereby the LOD was 20 copies/reaction and 200 copies/reaction, was prepared by Yan et al. (33) . (37) . In addition to that, Broughton et al. compared the detection strategies of DETECTR, and the RT-qPCR which is recommended by CDC/WHO for SARS-CoV-2 detection, however, they found that the limit of detection these methods is ten copies/\u00b5L, 1 or 3.2 copies/\u00b5L input sample, respectively. Also, the assays turnaround time is 45 min and four hours, respectively (37). Since less time consumption and equipment requirement, these methods can be set up in emergency departments and local community hospitals. Recently, Hou et al. exploited polymerase mediated amplification by the combination of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR-Cas13-mediated enzymatic signal amplification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and 7.5 copies/reaction within 40 min. The CRISPR-Cas13-based assay has a higher detection potential than the RT-PCR assay, according to a comparative clinical study. (38) . In another study, Ding at al developed the protocol by integrating RT-RPA and CRISPRbased detection in a one-pot reaction and incubating at a single temperature (39) . This \"All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a\" (AIOD-CRISPR) assay detected as little as 4.6 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per \u03bcL input at 40 minutes per \u03bcL input."}, {"section_title": "SEROLOGY TESTING", "text": "It is emphasised that nucleic acid-based testing methods need to extract nucleic acid in advance, the requirement of trained technicians, complex operation, expensive equipment; it is complicated to do in epidemiological and surveillance purposes. With the aid of viral protein antigen and antibodies which are produced in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection can be used for diagnosis. Since variations in the viral load throughout infection, it may difficult to detect the viral proteins. In contrast to this, the detection of antibodies which are generated to viral proteins may enable the indirect ways to detect SARS-CoV-2.\nSerology testing involves the screening test by qualitative assays and measurement of different classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 by using quantitative assays for establishing whether a person has been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Zhang et al. detected immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) from the human serum of COVID-19 patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (40) .\nAlthough recent reports suggesting that detection of antibody-based methods targeted to IgM and IgG by using recombinant N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2are consistent with the results obtained by real-time RT-PCR (41) (42) (43) .\nIn addition to this, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein presented a better antigenicity than viral N protein in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (44) . Also, IgA levels in patient serum have positively correlated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, signifying that serum IgA can be used as a biological marker (44) . In clinical diagnosis, the IgA and IgM antibodies against viral proteins can be detected seven days after SARS-CoV-2 infection or within 3-4 days after symptoms appear, as well as for IgG antibodies appears in 7-10 days later SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nSerology testing has some advantages over other techniques, apart from being inexpensive. The primary application of serology testing is to identify individuals who previously had SARS-CoV-2 infections. This knowledge can be used to guide studies of epidemiology and seroprevalence, and to facilitate contact tracing. Serology tests can also be used to determine possible convalescent donors of plasma and to assess the immune response to candidate vaccines. Finally, serology tests can also aid in diagnosing Covid-19 in patients with clinical suspicion but having repeated RT-PCR-negative results (45, 46) . Serology testing has its limitations too. The serology test cannot be used to diagnose acute or recent COVID-19 cases. Antibody tests for COVID-19 may also interact with other pathogens, including other human coronaviruses and leads to false-positive results. Based on current data, the WHO does not recommend the use of antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care but encourages the continuation of work to establish their usefulness in disease surveillance and epidemiologic research (14) .\nSerology testing helps in the assessment of seroprevalence of COVID-19 disease in the community. Nationwide serology testing would help in tailoring the public health measures to control and avoid renewed COVID-19 epidemic wave (47) . Serologic surveillance also can help in anticipate and modify treatment modalities as in perinatal clinical practices pregnant women (48) . Seroprevalence surveys can also help in understand the geographical profile of the COVID-19 disease and help in creating a regional level approach in controlling the pandemic (49) . However, serology testing cannot be used to determine the infectivity status or the susceptibility to reinfection for the patient. The presence of antibodies does not render the patient non-infectious, as the antibodies can be of non-neutralising in nature (50, 51) .\nVirus neutralisation tests have to be performed to assess the neutralising capability of antibodies generated by the body against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence clinical laboratories are recommended not to promote so-called \"immunity passports\" due to a lack of evidence for the neutralising capability of antibodies (52)."}, {"section_title": "VIRAL SEQUENCING", "text": "Sequencing does not play a part in the initial SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnosis but can be beneficial in the following circumstances; 1) Provides evidence of virus existence; 2) Monitoring for viral genome mutations that could affect medical countermeasure performance, including diagnostic testing; 3) Virus sequencing of entire genomes can also inform studies on molecular epidemiology.

Fibrinogen was found to be higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (55) .\nThe role of laboratory parameters indicating inflammation have been discussed elsewhere (60) . IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine, was found to have a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases (61) .

ALC and LDH stood out as parameters that can, with the levels at admission, reliably predict the admission of the patient to ICU (53) . The change of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer level has been found to help in discriminating severe COVID-19 cases from mild/moderate ones on consequent days after admission (65) .
