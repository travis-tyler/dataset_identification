[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Although cerebrovascular disease has long been known to co-occur with Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent studies suggest an etiologic contribution to AD pathogenesis. We used four dimensional (4D)-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate blood flow and pulsatility indices in the circle of Willis. We hypothesized decreased mean blood flow and increased pulsatility, metrics indicative of poor vascular health, would be associated with cerebral atrophy and an AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile. Methods: A total of 312 patients along the AD continuum (172 middle aged, 60 cognitively healthy older, 44 mild cognitive impairment, and 36 AD) underwent MRI, CSF, and medical examinations. Regression was used to predict CSF biomarkers and atrophy from 4D-flow and analysis of covariance to compare vascular health between groups. Results: Decreased mean flow in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and superior portion of the internal carotid artery (sICA) and increased pulsatility in the MCA were associated with greater brain atrophy. Decreased mean flow in the sICA was associated with lower amyloid beta 1-42 (Ab 42 ) in the CSF, a pathologic biomarker profile associated with AD. Interestingly, although metrics of flow and pulsatility differed markedly across the AD spectrum, there were no significant differences in cardiovascular risk score, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure across the three age-matched older cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Although viewed as separate clinical entities, the line between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular-mediated cognitive decline is increasingly blurred. An autopsy study found that of patients clinically diagnosed with AD, almost half had mixed pathology, the most common of which was vascular. This suggests that vascular pathology may be a salient contributing feature to dementia [1, 2] . Additionally, patients with mixed pathology were more likely than those with singular pathology to present with dementia clinically [1] . The American Heart and Stroke Associations posit that the synergism between AD and vascular pathology heightens the risk of cognitive impairment. It is suggested that the same risk factors identified for stroke may also predict AD; specifically, hypertension is believed to be a risk factor for poor brain aging and dementia [3] [4] [5] . Providing further credence to this intertwined relationship, autopsy studies show that patients with AD were more likely to have significant atherosclerotic deposits in the circle of Willis compared with those in controls [6] .\nIn addition to vascular pathology measured at autopsy, intracranial blood flow has also been shown to differ between AD patients and controls. A study using twodimensional (2D) phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in eight AD patients and nine controls found that AD patients had 20% lower total blood flow, suggesting a role for reduced blood flow in AD [7] . Transcranial Doppler (TCD), an ultrasound method commonly used in clinical practice for diagnosing emboli, stenosis, and hemorrhage, demonstrates reduced steady-state cerebral blood flow in AD [8] . Additionally, a TCD analysis in 103 subjects reported decreased mean arterial flow and an increased pulsatility index (PI) in AD patients, suggesting that TCD screening may be able to mitigate symptomatology by identifying people who would benefit from medications to improve cardiovascular health, and by extension, cerebrovascular function [9] .\nPulsatility of the cerebral vessels may be especially telling; a study of nondemented elderly participants showed that pulse wave velocity in the brachial-ankle vascular bed, a metric of mixed central and peripheral arterial stiffness, was higher in individuals who were amyloid positive on Pittsburgh imaging compound-B imaging [10] . Another study explored the relationship between arterial stiffness and amyloid deposition over time, finding that a one standard deviation (SD) increase in central pulse wave velocity was associated with an approximately twofold increase in amyloid deposition over a 2-year period [11] .\nRecent advances in MR hardware and acquisition and reconstruction methods have facilitated the use of 4D-flow MRI in clinically feasible scan times [12] . Of particular interest for cranial imaging is an approach called phase contrast vastly undersampled isotropic projection imaging (PC VIPR), which uses the concept of radial undersampling for accelerated imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution [13, 14] . PC VIPR simultaneously captures the vessel anatomy as well as the vascular flow in the form of a velocity vector field throughout the cardiac cycle and over a large imaging volume. Subsequent postprocessing allows for detailed hemodynamic analysis of various vessels. Using this PC VIPR technique to analyze flow in 11 cranial vessel segments in 314 individuals across the AD spectrum, we observed that AD patients had the lowest intracranial arterial flow, followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), than nondemented older controls, and finally middle-aged adults exhibiting the highest flow [15] . The opposite relationship was observed for PI, a surrogate metric of vessel stiffness, with the highest PI values seen in dementia patients. These results were especially marked in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the superior portion of the internal carotid artery (sICA) [15] . Given the significant differences in mean blood flow and PI between diagnostic cohorts, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between vascular health and markers of AD, including brain atrophy as shown on MRI, and amyloid and tau pathology measured via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, given that clinical measures of cardiovascular disease were significantly associated with amyloid deposition in several studies [3, 10, 11] , a major focus of the present study was to determine if intracranial 4D-flow MRI might account for unique variance in our outcome measures not accounted for by a current goldstandard for assessing cardiovascular disease risk, the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject population", "text": "A total of 312 (mean age 5 64.85 years; SD, 10.26) participants from the University of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participated in the study.

Samples were sent in bulk for analysis at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at the Sahlgrenska Academy of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The CSF samples were assayed for total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau 181 ), and amyloid beta 1-42 (Ab 42 ) using commercially available enzymelinked immunosorbent assay methods (INNOTEST assays; Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium) as described previously [21] [22] [23] .

ASCVD risk score, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure calculations\nThe ASCVD risk score is a formula developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association to estimate risk of a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years [24] . It is an updated version of the Framingham risk score (FRS). The variables needed include systolic blood pressure (and whether this value is medically treated or untreated), total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, age, sex, race, diabetes status, and smoking status. These data were acquired at the clinical visit closest to the scan date (mean, 66.2 days; SD, 44.7). Systolic and diastolic pressures were measured using a brachial sphygmomanometer. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), a metric that represents organ perfusion, was calculated according to the following formula: MAP 5 1/3 (systolic pressure2diastolic pressure) 1 diastolic pressure.

The older adult, MCI, and AD groups were coded relative to the middle-aged cohort, which was hypothesized to have the least vascular pathology, owing to the fact that they have no dementia diagnosis and are the youngest subjects. For atrophy analyses, linear regressions with MCA and sICA mean blood flow and MCA and sICA PIs as the independent variables were performed. Degrees of freedom for all linear regression analyses were included to account for the fact that not all participants have all PC VIPR measurements, some of which were unmeasurable due to variant anatomy. For CSF analyses, dependent variables were CSF Ab 42 , T-tau, and Ptau 181, and independent variables were MCA and sICA mean blood flow and PIs. To compare vascular health between older controls and participants diagnosed with MCI and AD, analysis of covariance models with age and gender covariates were used, with MAP, PP, or ASCVD risk score as the dependent variables. For MAP and PP, a covariate of antihypertensive treatment (yes/no) was added because unlike ASCVD, these metrics do not take into account treated blood pressure status."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Detailed demographic and descriptive breakdown by diagnostic cohort (172 middle aged, 60 cognitively healthy older, 44 MCI, and 36 AD) can be found in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "ASCVD risk score, MAP, and PP analyses", "text": "The percentage risk of having a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years was on average 4.58% (SD, 4.43), 26.92% (SD, 16.34), 29.12% (SD, 18.72), and 25.90% (SD, 19.74) for the middle aged, cognitively healthy older, MCI, and AD groups, respectively.

Intracranial blood flow was associated with both atrophy and CSF markers of amyloid. Accurate characterization of vascular pathology in vivo is important, given that approximately 50% of individuals with clinically diagnosed AD have mixed pathology at the time of autopsy, the most common of which is both amyloid and infarct [2] . The interrelationship between AD pathology and vascular health is further underscored by the fact that individuals who have significant amyloid positivity on positron emission tomography imaging have greater vascular bed pulse wave velocity [10, 11] . The present study uniquely examines the health of the intracranial arteries of the circle of Willis and demonstrates that reduced blood flow and increased PI of these arteries are associated with various features of the AD pathologic profile."}, {"section_title": "ASCVD risk score, MAP, and PP", "text": "As the ASCVD risk score has been recently implemented, there is a paucity of literature regarding its relationship to AD. The earlier FRS has been extensively examined; a study of 1755 offspring of the Framingham cohort was studied both in 1991-1995 and again in [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] . At the initial visit, the FRS was calculated, and at the follow-up visit, memory tests administered. The researchers found that individuals with a higher cardiovascular risk score at midlife were more likely to experience memory decline [26] . Additionally, a study of 1202 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort found that patients with AD biomarker positivity and high stroke risk (as identified by the FRS) had the lowest cognitive performance [27] . In contrast, a study of 82 elderly patients with mild-tomoderate cognitive deficits (mean age, 79.0 6 5.9 years; 67.1% females) did not find that present FRS was predictive of further decline [28] . Fig. 4 . Higher pulsatility index is associated with a greater degree of atrophy. Scatter plot of the results of the linear regression examining the relationship between pulsatility and atrophy, controlling for age, gender, and diagnostic group.

Abbreviations: MCI, mild cognitive impairment; AD, Alzheimer's disease. There are components of the vascular risk score that relate specifically to peripheral vessel health. In particular, higher PP, or a greater difference between systolic and diastolic pressures, is believed to be due to increased arterial stiffness. A study of 877 participants (aged 55-91 years) from the ADNI cohort sought to examine the relationship between PP and AD CSF biomarkers. Patients with a positive biomarker profile were found to have greater PP than individuals who were P-tau 181 negative. Subjects in their veryold age group (80-91 years) with a higher PP or MAP at baseline progressed more rapidly to dementia [29] .\nOur study suggests that intracranial 4D-flow metrics of vascular health may be more direct predictors of AD pathology than the ASCVD risk score, PP, and MAP. This is evidenced by the fact that although there is significant difference between the three older diagnostic groups on intracranial 4D-flow metrics, they do not differ on MAP, PP, or ASCVD score. This suggests that intracranial blood flow and PI in the cerebral arteries may measure intracranial vascular health in a more specific manner than the overall ASCVD risk score or peripheral pressure metrics, and thus may have greater utility in the prediction of AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Atrophy", "text": "Considerable research suggests a significant contribution of vascular pathology to cognitive decline, with a potentially synergistic effect on cognition when combined with pathognomonic AD pathology. In a neuropathologic study where ratings of atrophy and large vessel disease were performed by pathologists blind to study objectives, more severe large-vessel vascular disease was associated with a greater degree of cortical atrophy [30] . The SMArt-MR (second manifestations of arterial disease) study sought to investigate the vascular contributions to cognitive decline in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. Researchers found that patients with atrophy and high white matter hyperintensity lesion volume had increased cognitive decline compared with subjects with a lesser amount of vascular pathology [31] . Furthermore, an interaction was observed with brain volume and the presence of infarcts, where subjects with brain volume reduction and infarct pathology displayed perturbed executive functioning, although this relationship was not seen in subjects with reduced brain volume but without infarcts [32] .\nThe additive nature of vascular/infarct and amyloid pathology in increasing the odds of dementia and the incidence of cognitive decline has been shown in myriad studies, as discussed in the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association scientific statement to health care professionals [4] . Our study suggests that increased loss of brain volume due to impaired blood flow dynamics may be a biological mechanism for this additive hypothesis paradigm. The positive correlation between 4D-flow MRI metrics of poor vascular health (lower mean blood flow and increased PI) and atrophy observed in our study suggests that intracranial cerebral artery health is an important contributor to atrophy, and explains something beyond age-related volume loss or volume loss expected when disease state is controlled for in regression analyses."}, {"section_title": "CSF biomarkers", "text": "Amyloid plaque deposition in the brain parenchyma is a hallmark of AD, and recent research has suggested an association of intracranial vascular health with this pathologic marker. In a metabolic labeling study of 12 control and 12 AD subjects, production of Ab 40 and Ab 42 was not different between groups, but clearance rates were significantly reduced in AD patients [33] . Most soluble b-amyloid is believed to be removed via paravascular clearance, suggesting a role for disturbed blood flow in the pathogenesis of plaques [34] . Furthermore, b-amyloid tends to cluster around large diameter arterial vessels as opposed to smaller capillaries, suggesting that arterial health, such as that measured by 4D-flow MRI, is important to investigate [35] . Probing this relationship directly, a study of transgenic mice expressing human b-amyloid protein found that manipulation of cerebral blood flow by aortic constriction resulted in greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy and amyloid plaques [36] .

The risk equation includes a parameter for hypertensive medication, but does not account for type or dose. As this study design was cross-sectional, determinants of causality cannot be made; plans are underway, however, for participants to return for longitudinal follow-up imaging, which will allow greater ability to define the interrelationship between AD and vascular pathologies. The middle-aged group in particular will be a focus of future studies because they are enriched for AD risk factors, to determine how vascular health at midlife contributes to subsequent cognitive decline.
