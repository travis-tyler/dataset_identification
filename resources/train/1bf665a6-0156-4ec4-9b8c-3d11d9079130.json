[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. COVID-19, short for \"coronavirus disease 2019\", a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. COVID-19 is a new disease and many experts in the field are still learning how it spreads. It has rapidly spread to many countries around the world including the United States [1]. Worldwide travel due to globalization has also results in an increased risk of disease transmission [2] . The outbreak of Covid-19 has rapidly spread to more than 220 countries around the world including the United States.\nThere were more than 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday, June 15 and at least 115,000 people have died in the United States according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University [3] . Already in June, about 300,000 new Covid-19 cases and at least 10,000 more have died in the United States as of Monday, June 15, 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, there are about 8 million confirmed cases and more than 430,000 reported deaths as of Monday, June 15, 2020 [3] Many countries around the world implemented their own policies and restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 in recent months. In the United States, many states were under strict orders to stay home at least in the month of April. The worst weeks for coronavirus deaths in the U.S. were in early April. In recent weeks, there are some significant developments related restrictions include social-distancing, reopening states, and staying-at-home orders. Some researchers expressed concern the process of easing restrictions and relaxing stay-at-home orders too soon can quickly surge the number of infected Covid-19 cases as well as the death toll in the United States.\nCOVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets which means to become infected people generally in within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact with these droplets. While the best way to prevent illness is to avoid virus exposure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [4] recommends taking preventive actions to contain the spread of viruses. This includes: (i) avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; (ii) stay home when you are sick; (iii) cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash; (iv) clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes, and (v) wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Chin, Chu et al [5] investigated the stability and detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) in different environmental conditions including temperatures, surfaces. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected more than 127,000 coronavirus deaths in the country by June 27 [24] .\nRecently there are some researchers have been developed mathematical models to determine timelines for social distancing, healthcare policies and social distancing practice [6] [7] [8] [9] , case fatality rate [10] [11] [12] and disease transmission [13] [14] and disease detection in different environments [5] . Pham [15] recently develops a model that can estimate the cumulative number of deaths in the United States due to the ongoing Covid-19 virus based on a logistic function. This model, however, assumed that there is no significant change in the coming days due to various testing strategies, social-distancing policies, the reopening of community strategies, and staying-at-home orders policy. The model also did not take into account the daily new cases and the total number of new cases of Covid-19. Based on the Covid-19 global and United States death data, it appears that the cumulative number of deaths can follow an S-shaped curves. There are a number of existing S-shaped logistic models in the literature [16] [17] [18] [19] .\nIn this paper, we develop a novel generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of recent coronavirus-related restrictions include reopening states, staying-at-home orders and social-distancing practice of different communities as well as coronavirus recovered and new cases. The models can estimate the number of daily deaths and total number of death toll in the United States related to Covid-19 virus.\nWe analyze the proposed models using several existing criteria for the Covid-19 data to predict the death toll in the United States, Italy and UK. The results show that the proposed models fit significantly well. The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models in this study. Section 2 discusses the model development and present several explicit models that can estimate the total number of deaths in the US, Italy and UK. Section 3 discusses the modeling results based on the Covid-19 deaths data. Section 4 briefly discuss the findings and conclusion remarks.\n.

Our models account for the fact that changes to these policies which can lead to a surge of coronavius cases and deaths, especially in the United States. In other words, we discuss the models with considerations of the effects of recent reopening states, staying-at-home orders and practicing social-distancing of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered and new cases that can estimate the daily death toll and total number of Covid-19 deaths in the US, Italy and U.K."}, {"section_title": "Model Considerations", "text": "We first present a generalized model addressing the Covid-19 related changes and restrictions such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, staying-at-home orders along with a set of selected indicators include the total number of cases and the death toll. Specifically, the model takes into considerations that: 1. There are a few people in the communities who have already infected Covid-19 virus from the beginning and are spreading the virus into the community but do not know if they are infected the virus. Consequently, the virus is spreading through the people who are in close contact with one another. 2. The virus is spreading through the areas based on a time-dependent infected rate per person in which it will be spreading at a very slow rate from the beginning due to a small number of infected people and will be spreading at a growth rate much faster due to more number of people who have already infected the virus and are in close contact with non-infected individuals as the time progress, and hopefully with the help of testing strategies and those restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19, then growing slowly until it reaches the maximum daily death toll related to Covid-19 virus. 3. The model also considers the effects of recent Covid-19 related changes such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, staying-at-home orders along with a set of selected indicators of the Covid-19 data that can lead to a surge of coronavius cases and deaths. 4. We assume deaths are proportional to infections, but with a lag. There can be a significant time lag between when someone is infected and when they die."}, {"section_title": "Model Development", "text": "We now present a novel generalized mathematical model as follows:\nwhere .
