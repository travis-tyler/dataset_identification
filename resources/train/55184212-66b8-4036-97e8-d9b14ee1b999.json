[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report describes how the education system in the United States compares with education systems in the other Group of Eight (G-8) countries. The G-8 countries-Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States-are among the world's most economically developed countries. Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2006 draws on the most current information about education from three primary sources: the Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) project, conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003), also conducted by the OECD;andthe 2003 Trends in International Mathematics andScience Study (TIMSS 2003), conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). Begun in 2002, the series is published on a biennial basis. It should be noted that most of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. For example, Canada, France, and Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2003; therefore, these countries do not appear in indicators using these data. The United Kingdom is not included in indicators using PISA 2003 data due to low response rates; and in indicators using data from TIMSS 2003, the United Kingdom is represented separately by two of its component jurisdictions, England and Scotland. The main findings of this report are summarized below. These highlights are organized around the five major sections of the report-population and school enrollment; academic performance; context for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income."}, {"section_title": "Population and School Enrollment Youth Population", "text": "In 2006, the population of 5-to 29-year-olds (roughly the population most likely to be enrolled in education) represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States. In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 26 percent in Italy to 34 percent in the russian Federation. In the past 10 years, the United States had the highest growth among the G-8 countries in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds, which increased by 7 percent between 1996 and 2006 (indicator 1)."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Internationally, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). As used in this report, \"higher education\" refers to ISCED levels 5A (academic higher education below the doctoral level), 5B (vocational higher education), and 6 (academic higher education at the doctoral level) (except where specific data exclusions are noted). For more information on the ISCED levels, see appendix A. Although U.S. students were generally at an advantage in terms of socioeconomic status (SES) compared to their G-8 peers, low-SES 15-year-old students in the United States were outperformed by their peers in Germany, France, Japan, and Canada in mathematics literacy (indicator 8). In all G-8 countries, 15-year-old students who spoke the language of assessment, other official languages, or other national dialects at home most of the time scored higher in mathematics literacy than did their peers who spoke another language at home most of the time (indicator 9).\nMet guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, replacement schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace.

That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, replacement schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. MAthEMAtICS prOfICIEnCy Of 15-yEAr-OLDS About one-quarter of 1-year-old students in the United States scored at or below the lowest proficiency level on the PISA 200 combined mathematics literacy scale, a higher proportion of students than in Germany, France, Japan, and Canada. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a system of international assessments that measures 15-year-old students' capabilities in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years. In 2003, PISA was conducted in 41 countries, including 30 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and 11 non-OECD countries. PISA 2003 included an in-depth assessment of mathematics literacy, with less detailed assessments in reading and science literacy. In PISA 2003, each student was awarded a score on the combined mathematics literacy scale based on the difficulty of the tasks that he or she could reliably perform. These student performance scores were also used to create six proficiency levels, with level 6 the highest. Students who failed to complete the tasks associated with level 1 were categorized as having proficiency below level 1. In Japan, Canada, France, and Germany, students performed, on average, at proficiency level 3 on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale; in the United States, the average score of 483 (see Indicator 7: Mathematics Performance of 15-Year-Olds Across Content Areas) was above the bottom cut point for level 3 by about 1 score point. Students in the russian Federation and Italy scored, on average, at level 2 on the combined mathematics literacy scale. Looking at the distribution of students across the mathematics proficiency levels, 26 percent of U.S. students scored at level 1 or below; these students failed to demonstrate consistently that they have baseline mathematical skills (figure 6). The U.S. percentage was higher than the percentages in four of the other G-8 countries reporting data 6 (Germany, France, Japan, and Canada), but lower than the percentages in the russian Federation and Italy. The United States had a lower percentage of students at each of the higher proficiency levels of 4, 5, and 6 than did Germany, France, Japan, and Canada. None of the other G-8 countries had a lower percentage of students scoring at level 6 (the highest proficiency level) than the United States. The PISA 2003 results are somewhat different from those for PISA 2000, when reading literacy was the major domain and the United States had a higher percentage of students at the lowest proficiency level, but also a higher percentage of students at the highest proficiency level (Lemke et al. 2001).\nRefers to the average scheduled annual salary of a full-time teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of the teaching career.

Japan had the largest average class size in primary education, with 29 students. The U.S. student/teacher ratio at the primary level (15) was lower than the ratio in all but one of the other G-8 countries.

Teacher participation in this area was lower in Italy, Japan, and Scotland (ranging from 29 to 42 percent), but higher in England (76 percent) (indicator 13). In England, Italy, and the United States, there was generally more reported participation in professional development in mathematics than in science. Across all four professional development activities examined, no G-8 country had more fourth-graders with teachers reporting professional development participation in science than in mathematics (indicator 13)."}, {"section_title": "School Principals' Uses for Assessments", "text": "In 2003, a greater percentage of U.S. 15-year-old students than their peers in all other G-8 countries had principals who reported using assessment results to compare their school's performance to district-or national-level performance. This frequency ranged from about 2 out of 10 students in Japan and Germany, 3 out of 10 students in Italy, and 7 out of 10 students in the russian Federation and Canada to 9 out of 10 students in the United States. Similarly, a greater percentage of U.S. students than their peers in four other G-8 countries had principals who reported using assessment results to compare their school with other schools (80 percent in the United States vs. 53 percent in Canada, 29 percent in Italy, 17 percent in Germany, and 12 percent in Japan). Assessment results were also more likely to be used in the United States than in the same four G-8 countries to monitor schools' progress from year to year (93 percent in the United States compared to a range from 44 to 79 percent). In the United States, the assessment purpose least frequently cited was making judgments about teachers' effectiveness (55 percent) (indicator 14)."}, {"section_title": "SUMMArY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Expenditure for Education", "text": "Public School Teachers' Salaries In 2004, the United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary education levels with minimum training (roughly $32,000). For public school teachers with minimum training plus 15 years of experience, average salaries were higher in England, Scotland, Japan, and Germany than in the United States at both education levels. In most G-8 countries, public school teachers at both education levels with minimum training earned less than the average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in their respective countries. On the other hand, in all G-8 countries, public school teachers at both education levels with minimum training plus 15 years of experience earned at least as much as the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (indicator 15).\nAll of the G-8 countries in 2003 spent more money per student at the higher education level than at the combined primary and secondary education levels; however, more money in total was spent at the combined primary and secondary education levels than at the higher education level, where student enrollment is much lower. The United States spent $24,074 per student at the higher education level and $8,943 per student at the combined primary and secondary education levels, with both amounts higher than the corresponding figures in all other G-8 countries. In total dollars as a percentage of GDP, the United States spent 2.9 percent of its GDP on higher education and 4.1 percent of its GDP on primary and secondary education. Considering education expenditure at all levels combined, the United States spent a higher percentage of its GDP on education (7 percent) than did any of the other G-8 countries (indicator 16)."}, {"section_title": "Education Returns: Educational Attainment and Income", "text": "In 2004, the russian Federation had the largest percentage of adults ages 25 to 64 who had completed higher education (55 percent), followed by Canada (45 percent); Italy had the smallest percentage (11 percent). 2 In the United States, 39 percent of adults ages 25 to 64 had completed higher education. Among 25-to 34-year-olds, 36 percent of U.S. males and 42 percent of U.S. females had completed higher education (indicator 17). In all of the G-8 countries except Germany, a greater percentage of first university degrees 3 were awarded in the combined field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field, with the highest percentage awarded in the United States. In contrast, in science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields, the United States awarded the lowest percentage of first university degrees of all the G-8 countries (indicator 18). In the United States and all other G-8 countries, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment. For example, among U.S. adults ages 25 to 64 in 2004, 83 percent of those who had completed academic higher education were employed, compared with 73 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education or postsecondary vocational training and 57 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below (indicator 19). Eighty-three percent of U.S. adults ages 25 to 64 whose highest educational attainment was at the lower secondary level or below earned at or below the median income of U.S. adults in 2004, while 69 percent who attained at least a first university degree earned above the median income (indicator 20)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "In the Russian Federation, the reference year is 2003 rather than 2004. 3 Programs that prepare students for advanced research and highly qualified professions are classified as first university degree programs. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, the first university degree corresponds to a bachelor's degree; it excludes associate's degrees.\nIn addition to examining how many foreign students are hosted by each G-8 country (as a percentage of all foreign students enrolled in higher education), the extent of student mobility in the G-8 countries can be examined by two measures that take into account the size of a country's higher education system: (1) the percentage of a country's students enrolled in higher education who are foreign students (i.e., foreign students by country of destination) and (2) the percentage of a country's students enrolled in higher education who study abroad (i.e., foreign students by country of origin). Among the G-8 countries, the United States had the most foreign students (in absolute numbers) enrolled in higher education, but foreign students made up a higher percentage of enrollment in higher education in the United Kingdom (16 percent) as well as in Germany, France, and Canada (11 percent each) (figure 3b). The United States was one of the countries with the smallest percentages of foreign students (3 percent); the others were Japan (3 percent), Italy (2 percent), and the russian Federation (1 percent). With the exception of the russian Federation, all of the G-8 countries had a greater percentage of students coming into the country than going abroad to study.

In a majority of the G-8 countries, the largest percentage of adults ages 25 to 64 in 2004 had completed upper secondary education or postsecondary vocational training as their highest level of education (figure 17a). The exceptions were Italy, where about half of the 25-to 64-year-old population had completed lower secondary education or below, and the russian Federation and Canada, where 55 and 45 percent of the adult population, respectively, had completed higher education. In all of the G-8 countries except the russian Federation, less than half of the adult population had completed higher education. The russian Federation had the largest percentage of adults ages 25 to 64 who had completed higher education, followed by Canada, and Italy had the smallest percentage (11 percent); in the United States, 39 percent of adults in 2004 had completed higher education. Focusing on the younger adult population (ages 25 to 34) shows that in several of the G-8 countries, higher percentages of this age group had completed higher education than had the broader adult population of 25-to 64-year-olds. For example, in Canada and Japan, at least half of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed higher education (figure 18b). In France, 38 percent of 25-to 34-yearolds had completed higher education, compared with 24 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds (figures 17a and 17b).

Findings from TIMSS 2003 were used to create new indicators pertaining to fourth-graders in mathematics and science-their overall academic performance based on established international benchmarks, differences by sex in their academic achievement, and reports by their teachers about their professional development in these subject areas. The 2006 edition of Education at a Glance was used not only to update many existing indicators, but also to develop several new indicators. These new indicators cover class size and the ratio of students to teaching staff, expenditure in education institutions by service category, educational attainment in the adult population, and the distribution of the population by education and income."}, {"section_title": "Education Levels Used for the Indicators", "text": "Many of the indicators in this report refer to at least one of the following education levels: preprimary education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators (see appendix A for a more detailed description). To ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 1997). The following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to With the emergence and growth of the global economy, many have turned to international comparisons to assess how well national systems of education are performing. These comparisons shed light on a host of issues, from access to education to equity of the resources devoted to educational achievement. They provide the opportunity to compare different aspects of countries' education systems, assess these systems' performance, and identify potential strategies to improve student achievement and system outputs. Since the 1960s, the United States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the U.S. education system relative to education systems in other countries. These projects include the Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS), both conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA); and OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). This report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2006, draws on the most current information available from most of these projects at the time the report was being produced (in the summer and fall of 2006) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the U.S. education system compares with those in other economically developed countries. 1 Updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of Eight (G-8) countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These are among the most industrialized countries in the world. The G-8 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the other G-8 countries are among the major economic competitors of the United States. The leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues."}, {"section_title": "What's New in 2006?", "text": "Whereas the previous Comparative Indicators reports (in 2004 and 2002) were organized largely around levels of education, the current report is organized by topic around the following sections-population and school enrollment; academic performance; context for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income. The indicators in this report were prepared using new results from three main sources: PISA 2003, TIMSS 2003, and  Data from the 2001 administration of PIRLS were used extensively in the 2004 edition of this report (see http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2005021).

The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes tertiary programs 2 that fall into three main categories: Academic higher education below the doctoral level. These programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. Vocational higher education. These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. Doctoral level of academic higher education. These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. This program of study-which is primarily vocational in nature-is generally taken after the completion of secondary school, but the subject content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certificate programs, such as 1-year certification programs offered at community colleges. 3 Mapping G-8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED Differences in the structure of countries' education systems often make international comparisons difficult. To improve the comparability of education indicators, OECD and UNESCO worked with countries to standardize their education systems with the ISCED, as described above. Using ISCED classifications as a starting point, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) worked with education professionals in other G-8 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED applies to each of the G-8 countries are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The report begins with a summary section that highlights key findings; it then presents 20 indicators that compare different aspects of the education system in the United States to education systems in other G-8 countries. The indicators are organized into the following sections: population and school enrollment; academic performance; context for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income. The first section, population and school enrollment, presents indicators that suggest the potential demand for education in countries as measured by the size and growth of their youth population and current levels of enrollment in formal education. The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-8 countries. The next section, academic performance, presents indicators on student achievement in mathematics and science in the G-8 countries, including achievement differences across key demographic variables such as sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and language spoken at home. This section also presents an analysis of the relationship between mathematics and reading achievement. The third section highlights a range of key policy-relevant issues pertaining to the context for learning, including instructional time, class size and the ratio of students to teaching staff, and teacher professional development in mathematics and science. This section also presents a cross-national look at the purposes of assessment as reported by school principals. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditure for education, including breakdowns by expenditure as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and an indicator on public school teacher salaries in primary and secondary education. The final section, education returns: educational attainment and income, focuses on educational attainment, employment rates, and earnings (including breakdowns by sex and field of study). Each indicator is presented in a two-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with its G-8 peers (with data available) on the indicator. The key findings are followed by a short section that defines the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it. The second page presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings. These tables and/or figures also include the specific data source for the indicator and more detailed notes on interpreting the data. In the international classification, more advanced postsecondary education (such as attending a 4-year college or university) is referred to as tertiary education.

PISA 200 data. PISA is conducted by the OECD and is an assessment of 15-year-old students, with a major focus in 2003 on mathematics literacy. TIMSS 200 data. TIMSS is conducted by the IEA. Due to the availability of fourth-grade data from a larger number of G-8 countries in TIMSS 2003, this report uses data from the fourthgrade assessments in mathematics and science, rather than eighth-grade data. Data for indicator 1, on youth population, are from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. When interpreting the data presented in this report, it is important for readers to be aware of limitations based on the source of information and problems that may exist in verifying comparability in reporting. Throughout this report, the unit of analysis is often the student. For example, many of the indicators show the mean scores of students (e.g., indicators 5 and 7) or the percentage of students along a particular characteristic (e.g., indicators 4 and 9). Other indicators also use the student as the unit of analysis, but report data from other sources. For example, using data from PISA 2003, indicator 14 shows the percentage of students whose principals reported that they used assessment results for various purposes. Using data from TIMSS 2003, indicator 13 shows the percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in various professional development activities. In several other indicators, the unit of analysis is not the student. For example, in indicator 15, the unit of analysis is the teacher (i.e., teacher salaries), and in indicator 18, the unit of analysis is postsecondary degrees. Except for indicator 15, which explicitly states that the data pertain to public school teachers only, the indicators in this report include data from both public and private schools."}, {"section_title": "Availability of Country Data", "text": "It should be noted that most of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. That is, specific countries are sometimes not included or are only partially included in an indicator.

For example, Canada, France, and Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2003; therefore, these countries do not "}, {"section_title": "Sampling and Response Rates", "text": "In sample surveys like PISA and TIMSS, participating countries were expected to make great efforts to secure the participation of sampled schools and students. However, 100 percent participation at the school and student levels, and across items, is often not attainable. In anticipation of the fact that school participation falls short of 100 percent in many countries and, thus, to avoid sample size losses resulting from this, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, replacement schools for each sampled school. For each sampled school, the next school on the ordered school sampling frame was identified as its replacement, and the one after that as a second replacement, should it be needed. The use of implicit stratification variables and the subsequent ordering of the school sampling frame by size ensured that any sampled school's replacement would have similar characteristics. Although this approach does not guarantee avoiding response bias, it may reduce the potential for bias, and was deemed more acceptable than over-sampling to accommodate a low response rate. Consistent with what has been done in TIMSS 2003 reports published by IEA, TIMSS 2003 participating countries that met sample participation rates only after including replacement schools have been footnoted in the tables and figures of this report. In order that PISA and TIMSS can ensure reliable and internationally comparable data, participating countries agree ahead of time on a process for the validation of all national data submissions. As the basis for this process, PISA and TIMSS have established technical standards for the quality of datasets which countries must meet in order to be included in the comparative results. These standards are described in detail in the technical reports (Martin, Mullis, and Chrostowski 2004;OECD 2005). In the case of the United Kingdom in PISA 2003, OECD (2004 reported that the uncertainties surrounding the sample and its bias are such that its scores cannot reliably be compared with those of other countries. Thus, in the indicators in this report using data from from PISA 2003, it is noted that the United Kingdom is not included due to low response rates. Consistent with NCES statistical standards, item response rates less than 85 percent are footnoted in the tables and figures of this report, as well as instances where reporting standards are not met because of too few observations to provide reliable estimates."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Testing", "text": "About half of the indicators presented in this report are derived either from administrative records that are based on universe collections or from national sample surveys for which standard errors were not available. Consequently, for these indicators, no tests of statistical significance were conducted to establish whether observed differences from the U.S. average were statistically significant. However, for the 10 indicators derived from PISA or TIMSS data (indicators 4 through 11, 13, and 14), student's t statistics were calculated for comparisons of estimates within or between countries (e.g., to test whether a U.S. estimate is statistically different from other G-8 countries' estimates).

The population of 5-to 29-year-olds represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States (table 2). In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 26 percent in Italy to 34 percent in the russian Federation. Focusing on the subpopulation of 5-to 19-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of primary-and secondary-school age) reveals that this age group represented 21 percent of the total population in the United States in 2006. The U.S. percentage was higher than the percentages in all of the other G-8 countries, which ranged from 14 percent in Italy to 19 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Among the other G-8 countries, only Canada experienced growth over this period (3 percent). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds declined in all of the other G-8 countries, with decreases ranging from 2 percent in the United Kingdom to 18 percent in Italy. Consistent with the results for the broader youth population, the United States had the highest growth in the subpopulation of 5to 19-year-olds, which increased by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006. There were also increases in Canada and the United Kingdom (3 percent and 2 percent, respectively). All of the other G-8 countries experienced a decline over this period, with the largest in the russian Federation (27 percent). With respect to the high end of the age range, the United States had the second highest growth in the subpopulation of 20-to 29-yearolds, which increased by 9 percent between 1996 and 2006.

The percentage change in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds is calculated by subtracting the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 1996 from this population in 2006 and dividing by the 1996 population of 5-to 29-year-olds. These calculations are applied in the same way to the age groups 5 to 19 and 20 to 29. The age group (e.g., 5 to 29) as a percentage of the total population may have declined from 1996 to 2006 even though the size of the age group may have increased. This is due to a higher rate of increase of the total population compared to the rate of increase for the specific population age group.     \nThe percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference year is 2004 for population and enrollment data in all countries; however, reference dates within the year may differ. Thus, enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories largely due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in center-based programs and excludes children in homebased early childhood education. The ending age of compulsory education is the age at which individuals are no longer required to participate in formal education. Over the past 3 decades, the number of foreign students (i.e., students enrolled outside their country of citizenship) in higher education has grown more than fourfold: from 0.6 million worldwide in 1975 to 2.7 million in 2004 (OECD 2006a). In 2004, G-8 countries hosted about two-thirds of the foreign students in higher education, with a majority of them enrolled in four countries: the United States, which received the largest percentage of these foreign students (22 percent); the United Kingdom (11 percent); Germany (10 percent); and France (9 percent) (figure 3a). Altogether, in 2004, these four G-8 countries accounted for 52 percent of all foreign students enrolled in higher education.\nForeign students are defined as noncitizens enrolled in education programs in a host country (thus, some permanent residents are included). As shown in the figures, education levels are defined accord-ing to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). For more information on the ISCED levels, see appendix A. Figure 3b. Foreign students as a percentage of all students enrolled in higher education programs, by country of destination and country of origin: 2004 1 Reference year is 2002 rather than 2004. 2 Excludes advanced research programs (i.e., doctoral level of academic higher education).\nOn the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2003), countries were required to sample students in the upper of the two grades that contained the largest number of 9-year-olds. In the United States and most countries, this corresponds to grade 4. Since the TIMSS mathematics and science achievement scales were designed to provide reliable measures of student achievement over time, the metric of the scale was established originally with the 1995 assessment. To facilitate the cross country comparison of achievement scores, an international average was calculated whereby all the participating countries contributed equally. The data were then standardized to set the international average at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about two-thirds of the students across all the participating countries scored between 400 and 600. In order to provide meaningful descriptions of what performance on the scales could mean in terms of the mathematics or science that students know and can do, TIMSS established four international achievement benchmarks in mathematics and science (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 625 for the advanced benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, and 400 for the low benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally.  \nOn the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2003), countries were required to sample students in the upper of the two grades that contained the largest number of 9-year-olds.

The data were then standardized to set the international average at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about twothirds of the students across all the participating countries scored between 400 and 600. Male-female score-point differences in mathematics and science achievement presented in the text and in figure 5b are computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in figure 5a.

To facilitate the cross country comparison of achievement scores on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale, an OECD average was calculated whereby all the participating OECD countries contributed equally. The data were then standardized to set the OECD average at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about two-thirds of the students across all the participating OECD countries scored between 400 and 600. Mathematics proficiency was defined in terms of six levels (levels 1 through 6) based on student performance scores on the combined mathematics literacy scale. Exact cut point scores are as follows: below level 1 (a score less than or equal to 357.77); level 1 (a score greater than 357.77 and less than or equal to 420.07); level 2 (a score greater than 420.07 and less than or equal to 482.38); level 3 (a score greater than 482.38 and less than or equal to 544.68); level 4 (a score greater than 544.68 and less than or equal to 606.99); level 5 (a score greater than 606.99 and less than or equal to 669.30); and level 6 (a score greater than 669.30). In order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to correctly answer a majority of items at that level. Students at each succeeding level are capable of solving mathematical problems of increasing complexity. Students proficient at level 1 are able to identify information and carry out routine procedures according to direct instructions in explicit situations, such as locating and reading a specified value in a simple table or performing simple calculations involving relationships between two familiar variables. Level 2 can be considered the baseline at which students begin to demonstrate mathematical skills allowing them to use mathematics actively; they can extract relevant information from a single source and make literal interpretations of the results, such as recognizing simple geometric patterns and identifying relevant information in a simple and familiar graph. At level 3, students can use simple problem-solving strategies and skills, such as reasoning in familiar contexts, interpreting tables to locate information, and basic reasoning with simple probability concepts; they can link and connect multiple related representations (e.g., a formula and a graph) and carry out clearly described procedures requiring sequential processes. At level 4, students can reason flexibly and with some insight; they can solve problems that involve reasoning and argumentation in unfamiliar contexts, interpret complex text and graphs, and use multiple representations and multi-step calculations to solve practical problems. Students at level 5 can use well-developed reasoning skills, insight, and interpretation with different representations; interpret complex information about real-world situations; work strategically; use complex and multistep problem-solving skills; and make assumptions or work with assumptions to solve problems. Students proficient at level 6 can identify and combine multiple pieces of information to solve complex problems in the context of unfamiliar real-world situations; they can carry out a complex sequence of calculations and communicate complex arguments and explanations through reflection, insight, and generalization of the results. For more information about how proficiency levels were set for PISA 2003, see the technical appendix in Lemke et al. (2004). Indicator NOTE: In the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), mathematics proficiency was defined in terms of six levels (levels 1 through 6) based on student performance scores on the combined mathematics literacy scale. In this way, mathematics literacy was assessed along a continuum, with level 1 or below indicative of the lowest performing students. Due to low response rates, data for the United Kingdom are not shown. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.   MAThEMATICS PERFORMANCE OF 15-YEAR-OLDS ACROSS CONTENT AREAS In the United States, 1-year-old students in PISA 200 generally scored lower than their peers in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan on each of the four mathematics literacy subscales: space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and uncertainty. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) assessed 15-year-old students in mathematics literacy in 2003. In the United States, 15-year-old students had an average score of 483 on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale (figure 7). The U.S. score was lower than the average score of 500 for the participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (data not shown) (Lemke et al. 2004). Among the G-8 countries reporting data, 7 the U.S. score was lower than the average scores for Germany, France, Canada, and Japan and higher than the average scores for the russian Federation and Italy. For the most part, U.S. 15-year-olds scored lower than their peers in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan on the four mathematics literacy subscales, with each subscale representing a different content area: space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and uncertainty. (There was one exception: no measurable difference between the United States and Germany on the uncertainty subscale.) For example, the U.S. mean score of 472 on the space and shape subscale was lower than the mean scores for Germany (500), France (508), Canada 518, and Japan (553). Among the G-8 countries, students in Japan earned the highest score on the space and shape subscale, followed by students in Canada. On the change and relationships subscale, 15-year-olds in Japan and Canada earned the highest mean scores: 536 and 537, respectively. Students in the United States had a mean score of 486, outscoring only students in Italy (452). Similarly, on the quantity subscale, students in Japan and Canada earned mean scores of 527 and 528, respectively, outscoring students in all other G-8 countries. Students in Germany and France scored 514 and 507, respectively, and students in the United States had a mean score of 476. On the uncertainty subscale, students in the United States received a mean scale score of 491, outscoring students in Italy and the russian Federation, who had mean scores of 463 and 436, respectively. Among the G-8 countries, students in Canada earned the highest score on this subscale, followed by students in Japan, with scores of 542 and 528, respectively.\nKey Findings: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russian Federation, United States PISA defines mathematics literacy as \"an individual's capacity to identify and understand the role that mathematics plays in the world, to make well-founded judgments and to use and engage with mathematics in ways that meet the needs of that individual's life as a constructive, concerned and reflective citizen\" (OECD 2003). In PISA 2003, students were assessed on their mathematical knowledge in four content areas (space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and uncertainty), as well as the processes that need to be performed to solve mathematical problems in these four content areas and the real-world situations in which students encounter such mathematical problems. The space and shape subscale is related to spatial and geometric phenomena and relationships. The change and relationships subscale pertains to mathematical manifestations of change, functional relationships, and dependency among variables. The quantity subscale is related to numeric phenomena and quantitative relationships and patterns. The uncertainty subscale focuses on probabilistic and statistical phenomena and relationships. To facilitate the cross country comparison of achievement scores on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale, an OECD average was calculated whereby all the participating OECD countries contributed equally. The data were then standardized to set the OECD average at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about two-thirds of the students across all the participating OECD countries scored between 400 and 600. Indicator Figure 7. Average mathematics literacy subscale scores of 15-year-old students, by country: 2003 7 NOTE: The space and shape subscale is related to spatial and geometric phenomena and relationships. The change and relationships subscale pertains to mathematical manifestations of change, functional relationships, and dependency among variables. The quantity subscale is related to numeric phenomena and quantitative relationships and patterns. The uncertainty subscale focuses on probabilistic and statistical phenomena and relationships. The 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003) measured socioeconomic status (SES) based on the occupational status of the 15-year-old student's mother or father (whichever parent had the higher occupational status), with parental occupation reported by the student. Parental occupations were translated into socioeconomic index scores. For example, whereas a low index score (i.e., between 16 and 34 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a minimal level of education and skill (e.g., taxi driver, waiter/waitress), a high index score (i.e., between 71 and 90 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a high level of education and skill (e.g., medical doctor, university professor). In 2003, the United States had the highest mean socioeconomic index score of all the G-8 countries reporting data 8 (54.6 in the United States compared to a range from 46.8 in Italy to 52.6 in Canada) (data not shown). Furthermore, when students were classified into national quarters on the index, U.S. 15-year-olds in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score than their peers in all but one G-8 country (32.6 in the United States compared to a range from 26.9 in Italy to 31.7 in Canada). Only in Japan did students in the bottom national quarter have a higher mean index score (33.4) than their U.S. counterparts. These results show that U.S. students were generally at an advantage in terms of SES compared to their G-8 peers (both overall as well as specifically at the low SES level). On the other hand, when looking at the mathematics achievement of low-SES students, U.S. students did not demonstrate an advantage over their counterparts in most G-8 countries. Specifically, U.S. students in the bottom national quarter of the socioeconomic index were outperformed by their peers in Germany, France, Japan, and Canada on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale (448 in the United States compared to a range from 463 in Germany to 506 in Canada) (figure 8a). U.S. students in the bottom national quarter of the index scored higher than their counterparts in only one G-8 country-Italy (with an average score of 430). Nevertheless, in all G-8 countries, there was a relationship between SES and achievement scores. Specifically, students in the top national quarter of the socioeconomic index scored higher on the combined mathematics literacy scale than students in the bottom national quarter of the index. This difference ranged from 58 points in the russian Federation to 102 points in Germany; in the United States, this difference was 82 points. Another way to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status and mathematics achievement is to examine the specific change in score on the combined mathematics literacy scale in response to a one-standard-deviation increase (i.e., 16.4 units) in the socioeconomic index score. A greater increase in a country's average achievement score implies a stronger relationship between socioeconomic status and performance in that country. In the United States, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase of 30 score points (figure 8b). Compared to the United States, three G-8 countries had a weaker relationship between the socioeconomic index and mathematics literacy performance-the russian Federation, Japan, and Canada (with a range from 21 to 24 score points)-and one G-8 country had a stronger relationship-Germany (with 38 score points).\nTo facilitate the cross country comparison of achievement scores on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average was calculated whereby all the participating OECD countries contributed equally. The data were then standardized to set the OECD average at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about two-thirds of the students across all the participating OECD countries scored between 400 and 600. For more information about mathematics literacy in PISA 2003, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 6 and 7. Socioeconomic status is measured by the Highest International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (HISEI), which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. Parental occupation, as reported by the student, was coded based on the current version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) (International Labor Organization 1988). Occupational codes were, in turn, mapped onto an internationally comparable index of occupational status, the International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992). The ISEI captures the attributes of occupations that convert parents' education into income. It is derived by optimally scaling occupation groups to maximize the indirect effect of education on income through occupation and to minimize the direct effect of education on income, net of occupation (both effects being net of age). Indicator 8 Figure 8b. Change in the combined mathematics literacy scores of 15-year-old students in PISA 2003 per one-standarddeviation increase in the socioeconomic index, by country: 2003 NOTE: In the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003), socioeconomic status is measured by the Highest International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (HISEI), which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. This information, derived from students' responses to questionnaire items pertaining to parental occupation, is transformed into an index developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992  , which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. This information, derived from students' responses to questionnaire items pertaining to parental occupation, is transformed into an index developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992 (PISA 2003) distinguished between 15-year-old students who reported speaking the language of assessment, other official languages, or other national dialects at home most of the time and those who reported speaking another language at home most of the time. In 2003, 9 percent of U.S. students reported speaking another language at home most of the time (figure 9a). The U.S. percentage is higher than the corresponding percentages for France, the russian Federation, Italy, and Japan (all 6 percent or less) and lower than the corresponding percentage for Canada (11 percent). In all G-8 countries reporting data, 9 15-year-olds who spoke the language of assessment, other official languages, or other national dialects at home most of the time scored higher on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale than did their peers who spoke another language at home most of the time (figure 9b). This difference ranged from 13 points in Canada to 90 points in Germany; in the United States, this difference was 46 points. In the United States, 15-year-olds who spoke another language at home most of the time scored 444 on the combined mathematics literacy scale. This is measurably different from the corresponding score in one G-8 country-Canada. In Canada, students who spoke another language at home most of the time had a higher score (525) than their U.S. peers did.\nTo facilitate the cross country comparison of achievement scores on the PISA 2003 combined mathematics literacy scale, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average was calculated whereby all the participating OECD countries contributed equally.

The data were then standardized to set the OECD average on the reading scale and the mathematics scale at 500, with a range from 0 to 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. Since the individual country means were weighted averages of the student scores, this standardization implied that about two-thirds of the students across all the participating OECD countries scored between 400 and 600. Proficiency in reading literacy and mathematics literacy was defined in terms of levels based on student performance scores on the combined scales for each subject area. Exact cut point scores in reading literacy are as follows: below level 1 (a score less than or equal to 334.75); level 1 (a score greater than 334.75 and less than or equal to 407.47); level 2 (a score greater than 407.47 and less than or equal to 480.18); level 3 (a score greater than 480.18 and less than or equal to 552.89); level 4 (a score greater than 552.89 and less than or equal to 625.61); and level 5 (a score greater than 625.61). See the Definitions and Methodology section of indicator 6 for cut point scores in mathematics literacy. In order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of items at that level. In reading literacy, tasks at level 1 require students to locate single pieces of information with little or no competing information or draw simple inferences. On the other hand, tasks at level 5 require students to examine very complex texts, locate and organize multiple pieces of information, interpret language or apply unfamiliar categorization schemes, or evaluate and hypothesize about the information in the text. See the Definitions and Methodology section of indicator 6 for a description of the proficiency levels in mathematics literacy. Score-point differences presented in the text are computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in figure 10a.\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2003 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science, and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects. For each participating school at the fourth grade, one teacher questionnaire was administered to the classroom teacher of the sampled fourth-grade class. The TIMSS 2003 fourth-grade  (TIMSS 2003) asked teachers of fourth-and eighth-graders to report on their professional development participation in several areas in the 2 years before the assessment. This indicator discusses the results for teachers of fourth-graders in four areas: content, pedagogy/instruction, improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills, and assessment. (Teachers reported participation separately for mathematics and science.) The results show considerable variation by area of professional development, subject area, and country. In 2003, about two-thirds of U.S. fourth-graders had teachers who reported participating in professional development pertaining to mathematics content in the previous 2 years (figure 13). Teacher participation in this area was lower in Italy, Japan, and Scotland (ranging from 29 to 42 percent), but higher in England (76 percent). At least half of the fourth-graders in England, the russian Federation, and the United States had teachers who reported participating in the other three areas of professional development in mathematics. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development pertaining to mathematics pedagogy/instruction ranged from 30 percent in Italy to 88 percent in England, with the United States at 54 percent. In mathematics, more fourth-graders in the United States than in Scotland, Japan, and Italy had teachers who reported participating in professional development in the area of improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills and in the area of assessment. However, a greater percentage of students in England than in the United States had teachers who reported participating in professional development in the area of improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills in mathematics (72 vs. 58 percent). In England, Italy, and the United States, there was generally more reported participation in professional development in mathematics than in science in each of the four areas, with one exception (in Italy, no statistically significant difference was detected in the area of content). Across all four areas, no G-8 country reporting data had more fourth-graders with teachers reporting professional development participation in science than in mathematics. The percentage of fourth-graders in England, the russian Federation, and the United States whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science ranged from 30 percent in England in assessment to 51 percent in the russian Federation in pedagogy/instruction. In Italy, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science was 22 percent or less in all four areas. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development pertaining to science pedagogy/instruction ranged from 15 percent in Italy to 51 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 38 percent. In science as in mathematics, more fourth-graders in the United States than in Scotland, Japan, and Italy had teachers who reported participating in professional development in the area of improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills and in the area of assessment. However, a greater percentage of students in the russian Federation than in the United States had teachers who reported participating in professional development in the area of science assessment (45 vs. 34 percent). teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. Countries were required to sample students in the upper of the two grades that contained the largest number of 9-year-olds. In the United States and most countries, this corresponds to grade 4. 1 1 Met international guidelines for participation rates in 2003 only after replacement schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, replacement schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace.   \nData for this indicator are from the PISA 2003 school questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about a variety of school-related aspects, including school characteristics, the school's resources, the student body, teachers in the school, pedagogical practices of the school, and administrative structures within the school. At all schools with participating 15-year-old students, a school questionnaire was administered to the principal. The PISA 2003 principals do not constitute representative samples of principals. rather, they are the principals for nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level.  The United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels with minimum training. Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary for teachers at these education levels with minimum training. International comparisons of public school teachers' salaries can be used to examine how teacher compensation varies across countries. This indicator presents a cross-country comparison of the average salaries of teachers at two points in their careers: (1) starting salaries of full-time teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers and (2) average salaries of full-time teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified plus 15 years of experience. Comparisons are presented across two education levels: primary and upper secondary. The indicator also compares the ratio of these average salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries; this ratio provides a proxy measure of teacher earnings relative to the earnings of the country's average paid employee. Of the seven G-8 countries reporting data in 2004, the United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels with minimum training (roughly $32,000) (figure 15). Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary for teachers at these two education levels with minimum training. In most G-8 countries in 2004, public school teachers at both education levels with minimum training earned less than the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (table 4). For example, in the United States, the GDP per capita was about $39,700, and the average starting salary of public primary and upper secondary school teachers with minimum training was about 80 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public primary and upper secondary school teachers with minimum training earned 131 and 147 percent, respectively, of the German GDP per capita.  (OECD 2006b). Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to U.S. equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, and are defined as before-tax, or gross, salaries (the total sum paid by the employer for the labor supplied), excluding the employer's contribution to social security and pension (according to existing salary scales). Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized education systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. While this indicator compares public school teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified and those with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified plus 15 years of experience, there may be considerable variation across countries in the percentage of teachers who meet these definitions. Furthermore, the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country. In the United States, teacher training is decentralized and varies by state. As shown in the figure and table, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). For more information on the ISCED levels, see appendix A.\nPer student expenditure is based on public and private full-timeequivalent (FTE) enrollment figures for the 2002-03 school year and current expenditure and capital outlays from both public and private sources, where data are available. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2003. Dollar figures for education expenditure and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. Using PPPs to convert all education expenditure data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Within-country consumer price indices are used to adjust the PPP indices to account for inflation because the fiscal year has a different starting date in different countries. The national averages shown here do not represent the withincountry variation that may exist in the annual education expenditure per student.

Indicator 9 Figure 9b. Combined mathematics literacy scores of 15-year-old students, by language spoken at home and country: 2003   In all G-8 countries, 1-year-old students who scored low in either mathematics or reading tended to score lower than average in the other subject as well. This indicator examines the extent to which students who perform poorly in reading are also likely to perform poorly in mathematics, and vice versa. Student performance can be evaluated not only by examining mean scores, but also by looking at the percentages of students who can accomplish tasks at particular proficiency levels. In the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003), 15-year-old students' proficiency in reading literacy was defined in terms of five levels and their proficiency in mathematics literacy in terms of six levels. In this way, literacy skills were assessed along a continuum, with level 1 and below indicative of the lowest performing students. This indicator focuses on the reading performance of the lowest mathematics performers and the mathematics performance of the lowest reading performers. The results show that in all of the G-8 countries reporting data, 10 15-year-old students who scored low in either mathematics or reading tended to score lower than average in the other subject as well. The sections that follow describe the results separately for reading and mathematics, respectively. In all of the G-8 countries, the average reading scores for students at level 1 or below in mathematics were lower than the respective country averages in reading (figure 10a). In fact, in the majority of the G-8 countries in 2003, the average reading scores of the lowest mathematics performers were at least 100 points lower (i.e., at least one standard deviation lower) than the respective country averages in reading. In the United States, the average reading score of the lowest mathematics performers was 116 points lower than the average U.S. reading score (380 vs. 495). 11 Another way of evaluating the relationship between reading and mathematics achievement is to consider the percentage of students at level 1 or below in mathematics who are also at level 1 or below in reading, and vice versa. In all of the G-8 countries, at least one-half of the lowest mathematics performers were also among the lowest reading performers (with the United States at 62 percent) (figure 10b). As noted, the mathematics performance of the lowest reading performers can also be examined. Similar to the results for reading, in all of the G-8 countries, the average mathematics scores for students at level 1 or below in reading were lower than the respective country averages in mathematics (figure 10a). Once again, in the majority of the G-8 countries, the lowest reading performers scored at least 100 points lower in mathematics compared to the respective country averages in mathematics. However, in Italy and the russian Federation, which were the two lowest performing G-8 countries overall in mathematics, average mathematics scores were 93 points and 70 points lower, respectively, among the lowest reading performers. In Japan and Canada, the two highest performing G-8 countries overall in mathematics, average mathematics scores were about 130 points lower among the lowest reading performers. The percentage of students at level 1 or below in reading who were also at level 1 or below in mathematics ranged from 61 percent in Japan to 82 percent in the United States, with the U.S. percentage higher than that of its G-8 peers (figure 10b)."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Due to low response rates, data for the United Kingdom are not shown in this indicator. 11 Score-point difference was computed from unrounded numbers.

There were five levels for reading and six levels for mathematics. Students were classified into levels according to their scores. In this way, literacy skills were assessed along a continuum, with level 1 or below indicative of the lowest performing students. Instruction in classroom settings at school, however, is only one aspect of student learning. Learning time in out-of-school activities ranged from 35 to 42 percent of students' total mathematics learning time in Japan, the United States, Canada, and France; it was 54 percent in the russian Federation (computed from data in figure 11). U.S. 15-year-olds reported spending 2.8 hours per week on mathematics homework or other study set by teachers, less than that reported by their peers in Italy (3.5 hours per week) and the russian Federation (5.0 hours per week). Adding up the various time allocations, U.S. 15-year-olds reported spending 4.6 hours learning mathematics in at-school settings and 3.3 hours per week learning mathematics in out-of-school settings (computed from data in figure 11). Since the data on instructional hours presented in this indicator refer to school weeks only, and countries differ in the number of weeks per year in which schools are open, data are also presented on the number of instructional weeks per year for six of the G-8 countries reporting data. 12 The number of instructional weeks per year ranged from 33.5 in Italy to 39.7 in Germany. In the United States, the number of instructional weeks per year was 36.0, which is more than in the russian Federation and Italy, but less than in Canada, Japan, and Germany. The computations presented in the text are carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figure 11.  The issue of class size has received a great deal of attention in U.S. education policy, since it is commonly looked upon as a factor influencing the interaction between teachers and students. While smaller classes are generally valued because they may allow students to receive more individual attention from their teachers, evidence on the effects of variation in class size upon student performance is mixed (OECD 2006a). One factor that confounds the association between class size and student performance is the ratio of students to teaching staff. Unlike measures of class size, the ratio of students to teaching staff accounts for teaching staff in addition to classroom teachers, such as teachers who may be developing curriculum or have other indirect instructional roles. Hence, it is useful to jointly examine both class size and the student/teacher ratio as indicators of the resources devoted to education. Figure 12a shows average class size in primary education for seven G-8 countries reporting data. In 2004, two countries had an average class size of less than 20 students-the russian Federation (16 students) and Italy (18 students). Four countries had an average class size between 20 and 25 students-Germany, with 22 students; France and the United States, both with 23 students; and the United Kingdom, with 24 students. Japan had the largest average class size in primary education, with 29 students. Figure 12b shows the ratio of students to teaching staff for the G-8 countries, broken down by four levels of education: preprimary, primary, secondary (lower and upper secondary combined), and higher education. In the United States, student/teacher ratios were fairly consistent across education levels. In other countries, such as Japan, ratios tended to be higher at the lower education levels, but lower at the higher levels. On the other hand, in Italy, lower ratios were observed at the lower education levels, with a sharp increase at the higher education level. Specifically, in 2004, the U.S. student/teacher ratio at the preprimary level was 14, which was higher than the corresponding ratios in Italy (12) and the russian Federation (7), but lower than those in the United Kingdom (18), Japan 18, and France (19). At the primary level, the student/teacher ratio in the United States was 15, which was higher than the corresponding ratio in Italy (11), but lower than those in the other G-8 countries (with ratios ranging from 17 to 21). At the secondary level, student/teacher ratios ranged from 10 in the russian Federation to 16 in the United States. Finally, at the higher education level, the student/teacher ratio in the United States was 16, which was higher than the corresponding ratios in the russian Federation (13), Germany (13), and Japan (11), but lower than those in the United Kingdom (18), France 18, and Italy (22)."}, {"section_title": "Definition and Methodology", "text": "Average class size is calculated by dividing the number of students enrolled by the number of classes. Average class size refers to the division of students who are following a common course of study, based on the highest number of common courses (usually compulsory studies), and excludes teaching in subgroups outside the regular classroom setting.

(2006   Observing the distribution of populations at various education levels by earnings is one way to examine the relationship between education and earnings across countries. In this indicator, the extent to which higher levels of educational attainment are linked to higher incomes is examined across the populations of the G-8 countries. In all of the G-8 countries reporting data, adults with a relatively low level of education (i.e., those whose highest educational attainment is at the lower secondary level or below) tended to have lower income levels. For example, 83 percent of U.S. adults ages 25 to 64 whose highest educational attainment was at the lower secondary level or below earned at or below the median income of U.S. adults in 2004 (table 5). The U.S. percentage was higher than the corresponding percentages in all of the other G-8 countries except the United Kingdom (also at 83 percent). The four other G-8 countries had percentages that ranged from 62 percent in Italy to 69 percent in France. Many people with low levels of education also earned at or below half of the median income; 44 percent of U.S. adults whose highest educational attainment was at the lower secondary level or below earned at or below half of the median income of U.S. adults in 2004. The U.S. percentage was higher than the corresponding percentages in all of the other G-8 countries, with those for Italy and France being the lowest (19 and 17 percent, respectively). In contrast, the percentage of adults at or below the level of lower secondary education who had more than two times the median income of all 25-to 64-year-olds in their respective countries ranged from 1 percent in the United Kingdom and Germany to 9 percent in Italy, with the United States at 2 percent. Across the G-8 countries, adults who had completed academic higher education tended to have higher income levels. For example, 69 percent of U.S. adults ages 25 to 64 who had completed academic higher education earned more than the median income of U.S. adults in 2004 (table 5 and figure 20). In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 67 percent in Canada to 79 percent in France. Many people with high levels of education also earned more than two times the median income; 30 percent of U.S. adults ages 25 to 64 who had completed academic higher education earned more than two times the median income of U.S. adults in 2004 (table 5). The corresponding percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 23 percent in Germany to 34 percent in Italy. In contrast, less than 10 percent of adults who had completed academic higher education earned at or below half of the median income in three G-8 countries (France, the United Kingdom, and Italy).

The 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003) asked school principals to report whether or not they have used assessment results for various purposes. In 2003, principals across the G-8 countries very frequently reported using assessment results to inform parents about their child's progress. In all of the G-8 countries reporting data, 14 at least 96 percent of 15-year-olds had principals who reported that they used assessment results for this purpose ( figure 14). Similarly, principals frequently cited using assessment results to make decisions about students' retention or promotion. In all G-8 countries, at least threequarters of the students had principals who reported that they used assessment results for this purpose. In the United States, however, this percentage was lower than the corresponding percentages for Japan, Canada, Germany, and the russian Federation-76 percent in the United States compared to a range from 90 to 97 percent. In all but one of the G-8 countries, at least three-quarters of the students had principals who reported that they used assessment results to identify aspects of instruction or the curriculum that could be improved. (The exception was Germany, at 45 percent.) In the United States, the percentage was 92 percent. On the other hand, the percentage of 15-year-olds with principals who reported using assessment results to group students for instructional purposes ranged from 36 percent in Germany to 72 percent in Canada; in the United States, the percentage was 66 percent. There was also considerable variation across G-8 countries in principals' reports pertaining to several other assessment purposes. For example, a greater percentage of U.S. 15-year-old students than their peers in all other G-8 countries in 2003 had principals who reported using assessment results to compare their school's performance to district-or national-level performance. This frequency ranged from about 2 out of 10 students in Germany and Japan, 3 out of 10 students in Italy, and 7 out of 10 students in Canada and the russian Federation to 9 out of 10 students in the United States. Similarly, a greater percentage of U.S. students than their peers in four other G-8 countries had principals who reported using assessment results to compare their school with other schools (80 percent in the United States vs. 53 percent in Canada, 29 percent in Italy, 17 percent in Germany, and 12 percent in Japan). Assessment results were also more likely to be used in the United States than in the same four G-8 countries to monitor schools' progress from year to year (93 percent of students in the United States had principals reporting this compared to a range from 44 to 79 percent). In the United States, the assessment purpose least frequently cited was making judgments about teachers' effectiveness (55 percent of students had principals reporting this). Compared to the United States, a greater percentage of students in Japan and the russian Federation (82 and 99 percent, respectively) and a smaller percentage in Canada, Italy, and Germany (31, 23, and 12 percent, respectively) had principals who reported that they used assessment results for this purpose."}, {"section_title": "ExpEnDItUrE fOr EDUCAtIOn", "text": "The United States ranked the highest among the G-8 countries in terms of expenditure per student at the combined primary and secondary education levels as well as at the higher education level.

The latter measure allows a comparison of countries' expenditure relative to their ability to finance education. In 2003, expenditure per student for the United States was about $8,900 at the combined primary and secondary education levels and about $24,100 at the higher education level (figure 16a). Both of these figures were higher than the corresponding figures for the five other G-8 countries reporting data, which ranged from about $6,500 in Germany to $7,700 in Italy at the combined primary and secondary levels and from about $8,800 in Italy to $11,900 in the United Kingdom at the higher education level. As previously noted, all of the G-8 countries spent more per student at the higher education level than at the combined primary and secondary education levels. However, as shown in figure 16b, all of the G-8 countries spent more money (i.e., in total dollars as a percentage of GDP) at the combined primary and secondary education levels than at the higher education level, where student enrollment is much lower. The United States spent 4.1 percent of its GDP on primary and secondary education, higher than the share of GDP spent on education at this level in Italy, Germany, and Japan. At the higher education level, the United States spent 2.9 percent of its GDP on education, higher than the percentage of GDP spent on education at this level than in any of the other G-8 countries.

The ISCED levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED levels are as follows: ISCED level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED level 0 programs can either be center or school based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. ISCED level 1 consists of primary education, which usually lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. In the United States, elementary school (grades 1 through 6) is classified as level 1. At ISCED level 2, or lower secondary education, students continue to learn the basic subjects taught in level 1, but this level is typically more subject specific than level 1 and may be taught by specialized teachers. ISCED level 2 usually lasts between 2 and 6 years, and begins around the age of 11. Middle school and junior high (grades 7 through 9) in the United States are classified as level 2. At ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, student coursework is generally subject specific and often taught by specialized Differences in the structure of countries' education systems often make international comparisons difficult. To improve the comparability of education indicators, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) created an internationally comparable method for describing levels of education across countries called the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Using the ISCED classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in the G-8 countries to create an overview of each country's education system. There are differences within the education systems of some G-8 countries due to responsibilities and oversight for education taking place at the regional or local level. However, the charts and accompanying text in this appendix are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education system of each G-8 country, from the preprimary to the doctoral level. Thus, some differences within the education systems of G-8 countries may not be discussed here. As indicated in the source note for each country chart, the information summarizing each country's education system comes largely from the previous Comparative Indicators report (in 2004). However, there are some differences in what appears in the current report compared to the 2004 report. As indicated in some of the source notes, some additional information comes from updated online resources. Also, some modifications were made based on comments received from several international reviewers: Yves Beaudin of the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (Toronto, Canada), Galina Kovalyova of the russian Academy of Education (Moscow, russian Federation), Thierry rocher of the Ministry of National Education (Paris, France), Hanako Senuma of the National Institute for Educational Policy research (Tokyo, Japan), and Linda Sturman and Liz Twist of the National Foundation for Educational research (Slough, United Kingdom).

The colors on each chart correspond to ISCED levels (see next section). The ISCED term for each level of education is written within each block. The terms in italics in each block are a country's designation for that particular level (e.g., high school for upper secondary teachers. Students often enter upper secondary education at the age of 15 or 16 and attend anywhere from 2 to 5 years. ISCED level 3 can prepare students for university, further schooling, or the labor force. Senior high school (grades 9 through 12) is considered level 3 in the United States. ISCED level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. ISCED level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs. Tertiary programs 1 are divided into ISCED levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED level 5A refers to academic higher education below the doctoral level. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED level 5A. ISCED level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. ISCED level 6 refers to the doctoral level of academic higher education.

These programs are vocational and are oriented toward preparing students for the labor force in semiprofessional and technical fields. Diploma: 2-to 3-year programs offered at community colleges, regional colleges, etc. These programs are vocational and are oriented toward preparing students for the labor force in semiprofessional and technical fields. Bachelor's degree: 3-to 4-year academic programs at a university college or university. (University bachelor's degree programs are usually 4 years, while university college programs can be 3 or 4 years.) Master's degree: Graduate programs at a university requiring 1 to 2 years beyond the bachelor's degree. This degree is designed to prepare students for professional careers. Doctorate: Academic graduate programs at a university requiring 3 to 5 years after the bachelor's degree. Doctoral programs prepare students for careers in research.\nAccademia degrees: Fine arts, restoration, and music degrees. Accademia degrees have been divided into two cycles according to the recent reforms, the first one taking 3 years to complete and the second one taking 2 years to complete. The diploma accademico di primo livello is awarded after the first cycle, and the diploma accademico di secondo livello is awarded after the second cycle. Laurea: A first-level university degree taking 3 years from university entry to complete. It is characterized by both theoretical and applied studies, similar to a bachelor's degree in the United States. Laurea specialistica/magistrale: Graduate specialized degree requiring 2 years of university study after a first-level degree, similar to a master's degree in the United States.

Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States andOther G8 Countries: 2004 (NCES 2005-021 NOTE: There are different types of secondary schools, some combining Hauptschule and Realschule. The secondary school a student in Germany attends is determined by a combination of factors, depending on the L\u00e4nder: admissions tests, previous grade point average, teacher recommendations, and parents' wishes. The degree of flexibility that a parent has in choosing which educational track their child enters also varies between regions. However, the type of school a student attends is sometimes less important than the chosen track: at the end of lower secondary, all students who meet the requirements receive a leaving certificate. At the Hauptschule it is generally the Hauptschulabschluss, but students who excel may receive a Realschulabschluss (called the Mittlere Schulabschluss in some L\u00e4nder). At the Realschule, students typically receive the Realschulabschluss; at the Gesamtschule, both types of diplomas are offered. All students attending Gymnasium who advance to the upper secondary level automatically receive the Realschulabschluss. Some L\u00e4nder also have an orientation phase during the first 2 years of lower secondary school, which gives parents and teachers 2 more years to decide a child's educational path. In L\u00e4nder with a 6-year primary school, lower secondary school is 2 years shorter.

Berufsfachschule-1-to 3-year full-time basic vocational school Fachoberschule-2-year advanced vocational school Gymnasium/Gymnasiale Oberstufe-Academic upper secondary school. Gymnasium continues from lower secondary school. Gymnasiale Oberstufe follows the same curriculum as the Gymnasium, but comes after Gesamtschule. Ages: 16 to 18 (graduation generally at 19 for academic programs; 18 or 19 for others) Number of years: 1 to 4 Universal enrollment: Through age 17 (see indicator 2) (most students in long programs turn 19 during the last year of upper secondary school) Compulsory: Until age 18 Entrance/exit criteria: Students must pass the Abitur in order to enter university and other forms of higher education. NOTE: Gymnasium and Gesamtschule are generally combined lower and upper secondary schools, although students concentrate their studies on fewer subjects during the last years of Gymnasium. Some L\u00e4nder offer fast tracks, where students can graduate from Gymnasium a year early. Additionally, a few L\u00e4nder offer the Berufsoberschule, a vocational upper secondary school for those who have completed vocational training or have 5 years of work experience.

It consists of the first 2 years (in England and Wales) or 3 years (in Northern Ireland) of primary school. The second stage (key stage 2) is often called junior school and encompasses the next 4 years of primary school.

Some areas have grammar schools and secondary modern schools, which enroll children with higher and lower achievement, respectively. Entrance/exit criteria: In order to obtain the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), students take a series of singlesubject examinations after the first 2 years of upper secondary school (at age 15/16). The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced levels (A levels) and the GCE Advanced Subsidiary examinations (AS levels) are similar tests taken in the sixth form (described below). NOTE: Comprehensive schools, grammar schools, and secondary modern schools all lead to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), typically at age 16. After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, and after receiving the GCSE, students have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the sixth form. Some schools do not offer the sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a further education college. Sixth forms usually offer the General Certificate of Education Advanced Subsidiary qualification (GCE AS level) at age 17 and the General Certificate of Education Advanced level examination (GCE A level) at age 18. GCE A levels are usually required for entry to higher education. Increasingly, however, students are able to enter higher education with a parallel qualification such as the Vocational Certificate of Education (VCE). These vocational certificates are also known as A levels in applied subjects. If students choose not to enter sixth form, their options are the labor force (often through apprenticeships or youth training courses) or a further education sector college. Further education sector colleges have traditionally offered vocational courses, but increasingly have academic programs.

Foundation degree: Employment-related higher education qualification taking 2 years to complete and offered at colleges and universities. Bachelor's degree: 3-to 4-year academic programs at colleges or universities. Most students opt for an honors degree, the requirements of which are specific to schools and departments. Honors degrees are an entrance requirement for most graduate programs. Advanced short degree: Short degree programs, which vary in length, for students who have already acquired a bachelor's degree, for example, the postgraduate certificate of education. Courses offered are often professional development-oriented. Master's degree: Usually a taught (as opposed to research) postgraduate degree offered at colleges and universities. One year or more beyond an honors bachelor's degree. Professional degrees: Advanced degrees in professional fields such as engineering, accounting, medicine, and information science.
