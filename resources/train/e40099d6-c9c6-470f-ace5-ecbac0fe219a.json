Appended are a glossary of terms and a section with technical notes and information on the study's methodology. (RC) In 1999-2000,42 percent of all undergraduates were enrolled at public 2-year institutions, commonly known as community colleges (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). The lower fees and open-access policies at community colleges have broadened access to postsecondary education for students facing such barriers to entry as poor academic performance in high school, limited English-language skills or other basic skill deficiencies, or financial hardship (Grubb 1999). Community colleges also serve students seeking additional job skills, technical certification, and enrichment opportunities. However, while access to community colleges is easily attained, research has shown that a significant number of students who enter community colleges do not complete a formal credential (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Currently, federal performance measures, as reflected in the Higher Education Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act, have been primarily limited to completion of formal credentials such as certificates and associate's degrees. However, because community colleges serve students with a wide range of goals and academic preparation (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000), holding community colleges accountable only for student attainment may understate their effectiveness in meeting a variety of objectives. This report provides information on the varying goals, preparation, and outcomes of community college students. This report uses data from the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000-2000National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2000. Each data set provides a different perspective on the major questions of the analysis. BPS is a representative sample of all undergraduates, regardless of when they graduated from high school, who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96 and were last interviewed in 2001, about 6 years later. This survey provides the latest data on degree attainment and persistence, as well as 4-year college transfer rates and outcomes. The analysis sample used in this report is limited to BPS students whose first postsecondary enrollment was in a community college. The NELS survey comprises a grade cohort, which means all respondents are in one grade or are about the same age. NELS respondents were first surveyed in 1988 when they were in the eighth grade, and were followed through high school and college. They were last interviewed in 2000, about 8 years after most of the participants had graduated from high school. Unlike the BPS cohort, which includes first-time students regardless of age, the NELS cohort reflects a more \"traditional\" group of studentsthose who enroll in postsecondary education soon after high school graduation. In the analysis for this report, only 1992 high school graduates who first enrolled in a community college within 2 years of high school graduation are included. NELS provides several measures of high school academic preparation to determine how students' academic performance is associated with their college outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Finally, the NPSAS survey consists of a representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary education at one point in timethe 1999-2000 academic yearincluding students of all ages as well as students who entered postsecondary education at various points in time and who are at different stages of their studies. NPSAS is used to examine the degree objectives of first-time and continuing community college students enrolled in 1999-2000. Drawing upon these three data sets, this study addresses the following research questions: 1. What percentage of students enrolled in community colleges seeks to complete a formal credential, either in a public 2-year institution or through transfer to a 4-year college or university? 2. How do different types of community college students differ in their intentions to complete a formal credential? 3. Among those intending to complete a certificate or degree or transfer to a 4-year institution, what percentage actually do so, and how do rates of completion vary among different types of students? 4. Among students intending to complete a formal credential, what is the relationship between rates of completion and different levels of postsecondary preparedness? 5. When students are asked about the impact of their postsecondary education on various aspects of their labor market participation, how do the responses of students who completed a formal credential differ from those of students who left without a certificate or degree? The findings of this study suggest that success rates for community college students, as measured by completion of a formal degree or certificate or transfer to a 4-year institution, are roughly 50 to 60 percent among students who enroll with intentions to earn a credential or transfer."}, {"section_title": "Community College Students Seeking Formal Credentials", "text": "Results from all three data sets suggest that roughly 9-in-10 community college students enroll intending to obtain a formal credential or to transfer to a 4-year institution. As shown in figure A, among all NPSAS undergraduates enrolled in public 2-year institutions in 1999-2000,11 percent of first-year students and 10 percent of continuing students reported no degree or transfer intentions. Similarly, among BPS students who first enrolled in public 2-year institutions in 1995-1996,11 percent reported no intentions of earning a degree or transferring to a 4-year institution (figure B). NELS 1992 high school graduates were asked what their highest degree expectations were when they were in 12th grade. Among those who first enrolled in public 2-year institutions, 10 percent reported that they were not seeking a degree and that they expected to complete less than 2 years of postsecondary education and nearly two-thirds reported that they were seeking a bachelor's degree or higher (figure C).\nData from the three surveys examined here provide answers to the question of what percentage of students in community colleges enrolls intending to obtain a formal credential from several perspectives. Beginning with the 1999-2000 NPSAS, the most recent data source on community college enrollment, 89 percent of students in their first year of community college were either in a certificate program (14 percent) or an associate's degree program (75 percent) in 1999-2000; the remaining 11 percent indicated that they were not pursuing any type of undergraduate degree (figure 1). Among continuing community college students enrolled in 1999-2000 (i.e., those in their second year or beyond), 10 percent were enrolled in a certificate program, 81 percent were enrolled in an associate's degree program, and 10 percent said they were not enrolled in an undergraduate degree program. In short, regardless of whether students were enrolled for the first time or continuing their education, about 9-in-10 community college students were enrolled in a certificate or degree program in 1999-2000. Estimates from the 1996/01 BPS survey are consistent with these findings. When asked what they expected to accomplish while enrolled at a community college, 11 percent of the beginning students said they expected a certificate, 49 percent anticipated an associate's degree, and 25 percent expected to transfer to a 4-year institution and attain a bachelor's degree (figure 2). When asked about their purpose for enrolling, 58 percent of the BPS students at community colleges cited transfer or a formal credential. This estimate appears lower than that suggested by Figure 2. Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students first enrolled in public 2-year institutions according to their specific degree expectations and reported primary purpose for enrolling the degree goal question, which indicated that a total of about 84 percent of first-time community college students intended to obtain a credential or to transfer. However, as shown in figure 3, among the 23 percent of students citing \"job skills\" as their purpose for enrolling, a total of about 78 percent said they expected to obtain a degree or to transfer. A composite measure that combined responses to items asking about expectations for degree/transfer and purpose for enrolling (see appendix A for details), indicated that a total of about 89 percent of all first-time students intended to obtain a degree and/or transfer, while 11 percent expected to do neither (figure 4). Thus, these responses were consistent with the NPSAS estimates that about 9-in-10 of first-time students intended to obtain a credential or transfer.

Therefore, it takes them longer to complete associate's and bachelor's degrees than the typical time expected-2 years and 4 years, respectively, of full-time study. The length of certificate programs varies, but they are typically 1-year full-time programs (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Among BPS students, the average time from first enrollment to attainment for students who had attained an associate's degree as their highest credential (16 percent of all students) was about 3 1/2 years (41 months). Students who had completed a certificate (10 percent of all students) vi   vii Executive Summary took an average of about 2 1/2 years to complete their program. Students who had completed a bachelor's degree within the 6 years of the survey period (10 percent of all students) took nearly 5 years (56 months) to complete the degree. However, about 8 percent of BPS community college students, or roughly 44 percent of those in bachelor's degree programs, were still enrolled in a 4-year institution and had not yet completed a degree. These students required more than 6 years to complete their bachelor's degrees.\nIn a recent report analyzing the entire BPS cohort, the authors point out that the time it took students to attain an associate's degree was necessarily longer than 2 years because most community college students do not attend full time on a continuous basis (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002, table 8).17 Figure 6 shows the average number of elapsed months and the average number of enrolled months to complete a certificate, an associate's degree, and a bachelor's degree for BPS community college students who had completed these credentials as their highest attainment by 2001.

Among those who had transferred, about 8-in-10 had either attained a bachelor's degree (35 percent) or were still enrolled in a 4-year institution (44 percent) as of 2001 (figure F). Moreover, community college students with bachelor's degree intentions were not likely to earn an associate's degree before transferring. Among transfers, roughly one-fifth of bachelor's degree seekers, had earned an associate's degree before transferring.\nAmong all BPS students who first enrolled in a community college in 1995-96, 29 percent had transferred to a 4-year institution as of 2001 (table 8). Among these transfer students, 35 percent had attained a bachelor's degree in these 6 years and 44 percent were still enrolled in a 4year institution. In total, 6 years after first enrolling in a community college, nearly 8-in-10 transfer students had persisted toward earning their bachelor's degree. Among students who reported that they intended to transfer to a 4-year institution, 51 percent had made the transfer. Among these transfers, 44 percent had attained a bachelor's degree and another 38 percent were still enrolled and working toward their degree, representing a total persistence rate of 82 percent. Thus, while about one-half of bachelor's degree seekers did not transfer for one reason or another, for those who did, most attained their degree or were still enrolled and working to complete it 6 years after first enrolling in a community college. For the most part, transfer students who enrolled in a community college with bachelor's degree intentions did not earn an associate's degree before transferring. About one-fifth (19 percent) of such transfers had earned an associate's degree before transferring, compared with about one-half (51 percent) of transfer students who reported having an associate's degree goal when they first enrolled.

Thirty percent of these students entered community college with 12th-grade mathematics proficiency scores at Level 1 or below. These students could perform simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers but could not perform simple operations on decimals, fractions, powers, or roots. In addition, 44 percent of NELS community college students enrolled with 12th-grade reading proficiency scores at Level 1 or below. These students had basic comprehension skills, but they could not make relatively simple inferences from reading a text beyond the author's main point. While many NELS 1992 high school graduates entered community college lacking strong academic preparation, about one-third (36 percent) were academically qualified to attend a 4-year institution. These are students who could possibly have enrolled in a 4-year college or university based on several measures of academic preparation, including SAT scores, rank in high school class, NELS achievement tests, and the rigor of their course taking. In addition, 17 percent and 24 percent, respectively, had scored at the highest proficiency levels tested in reading and mathematics as seniors in high school. Taking into account students' academic profiles, college students who were better prepared academically to enter postsecondary education tended to complete a certificate or degree or attend a 4-year institution more often than those who were less prepared. For example, among those who scored at the highest proficiency level tested in mathematics as seniors in high school, about three-quarters had either attained a degree or certificate or had enrolled in a 4-year institution, compared with roughly half (54 percent) of those who scored at the lowest levels. Similarly, among community college students who were academically qualified for enrollment in a 4year college, roughly three-quarters had either attained a degree (including 36 percent who had attained a bachelor's degree) or had enrolled in a 4-year institution, compared with 55 percent of those who were either not qualified or only minimally qualified to attend a 4-year college."}, {"section_title": "Community College Completion and Employment Outcomes", "text": "BPS community college students who were no longer enrolled 3 years after first attending were asked several questions about the impact of their education on their salary and other employment experiences.

Despite the small percentage of completers, there were some obvious differences between these students and their peers who had not completed with respect to reporting positive employment outcomes.

In 1999-2000,42 percent of all undergraduates were enrolled at public 2-year institutions, commonly known as community colleges (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). Since the community college movement began, these institutions have served a critical role in broadening access to postsecondary education (Cohen and Brawer 2002). Because of their lower fees and open-access policies, they have provided entry into the postsecondary education system for those who could not afford 4-year colleges, who had poor academic performance in high school, who needed English or other basic skills before pursuing college-level work, who wanted job skills, or who were not sure about what they wanted to do (Grubb 1999). Community colleges also play an important role in preparing students to become skilled technicians, in occupational areas that require less than a baccalaureate degree. Although access to a community college is easily attained, many students who enroll do not complete a formal credential. For example, 44 percent of those who began their postsecondary education in a community college in 1995-96 had not earned any type of degree or certificate and were no longer enrolled in postsecondary education by 1998 (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Of those students who expected to attain a certificate, 39 percent had done so by 1998, and an additional 3 percent had attained an associate's degree. Of those who expected to attain an associate's degree, 6 percent had attained a certificate by 1998, and 11 percent had attained an associate's degree.' There is no single benchmark against which to assess these outcomes, and the factors affecting attainment are varied, complex, and often outside the influence of postsecondary institutions. Federal policy, as reflected in the Higher Education Act and the Carl Perkins Vocational Education Act, has defined measures of program completion and established standards for performance. To date, these performance indicators have been limited primarily to measuring completion of formal credentials such as a certificate or an associate's degree. However, community colleges Introduction serve students with a wide range of goals, and for some students, attaining a formal credential is not their primary reason for enrolling (Phillipe and Patton 1999). While some students seek an associate's degree or wish to transfer to a 4-year institution, others are looking for job skills so they can enter the workforce, change jobs, or advance in their careers. Still others seek basic skills such as English language proficiency or personal enrichment opportunities. Thus some community college students attain their personal goals without completing a certificate or degree program. In addition, some students come prepared for college-level work, but many do not. For example, of 1992 high school graduates beginning their postsecondary education in community colleges by December 1994, 64 percent were not qualified or were only minimally qualified to do 4-year college-level work.2 Additionally, 54 percent of these students enrolled with one or more risk factors associated with lower rates of postsecondary persistence and attainment.3 This report uses several data sets to profile community college students and describe their persistence and attainment. The analysis focuses on the following questions: 1. What percentage of students enrolling in community colleges seek to complete a formal credential, either in public 2-year institutions or through transfer to a 4-year college or university? 2. How do different types of community college students vary in their intentions to complete a formal credential? 3. Among those intending to complete a certificate or degree or transfer to a 4-year institution, what percentage actually do so, and how do rates of completion vary among different types of students? 4. Among students intending to complete a formal credential, what is the relationship between rates of completion and different levels of postsecondary preparedness? 5. When students are asked about the impact of their postsecondary education on their labor market participation, how do the responses of students who completed a formal credential differ from those who left without a certificate or degree? Wherever possible, the analysis takes into account differences in student objectives. While it examines student outcomes mainly with respect to students' completion of formal credentials certificates and degrees, along with transfer to 4-year institutionsthe analysis concentrates on those students who say that these objectives are their primary reason for enrolling. 2See table 6. 3Ibid. This report analyzes data from three sources: the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01); the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000), \"Fourth Follow-up, 2000-2000National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2000. Each data set provides a different perspective on the major questions of the analysis. BPS consists of a sample of all undergraduates, regardless of when they graduated from high school, who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995 96 and were last interviewed in 2001, about 6 years later. This survey provides the latest data on degree attainment and persistence 6 years after the students first enrolled as well as their 4-year college transfer rates and the outcomes of these transfers. The sample used in this report was restricted to BPS students whose first enrollment in postsecondary education was in a community college. NELS tracks a grade cohort over time, meaning the respondents are all in the same grade and about the same age. NELS respondents were first surveyed in 1988 when they were in the eighth grade and then followed through high school and college. They were last interviewed in 2000 about 8 years after most participants graduated from high school. The sample used in this report was restricted to 1992 high school graduates whose first enrollment in postsecondary education was in a community college within 2 years after graduating from high school. Unlike the BPS cohort, which includes first-time students regardless of their age, the NELS cohort reflects a more \"traditional\" group of studentsthose who enroll in postsecondary education soon after high school graduation. NELS provides several measures of high school academic performance to determine how students' academic preparation is associated with their college outcomes. Finally, NPSAS consists of a sample of all students who were enrolled in postsecondary education during the 1999-2000 academic year. NPSAS includes not only students of all ages but also those who entered postsecondary education at different points in time and who are at different stages of their studies. The data from NPSAS are used to determine the degree goals of community college students who first enrolled in 1999-2000 as well as those of continuing students."}, {"section_title": "Terminology", "text": "This report examines relationships among students' objectives for enrolling in community colleges and how well they realized these objectives.

This analysis focuses on whether or not students earn a formal credential, certificate, or associate's degree or transfer to a 4-year institution. While the requirements for earning an associate's degree are fairly standard across programs of study and institutionstypically requiring 2 years of full-time enrollmentrequirements for completing a certificate can vary from a few hours to as much as 2 years of full-time study, with 1 year of fulltime study the norm (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Additionally, programs in fields with formal licensing requirementssuch as nursing, real estate, cosmetology, and many of the building tradesare more likely than other programs to offer formal certificates when students complete the program of study. Not all students enroll in community colleges intending to obtain a credential or transfer. Some enroll to take a specific course or two, to upgrade job skills, or perhaps to satisfy personal enrichment objectives.

Table 2 displays data from the 1999-2000 NPSAS survey, which also indicates that older community college students, whether in their first year or continuing, were more likely than younger students to enroll without a credential goal. Among those in their first year, 16 percent of students 24 years or older were not enrolled in any undergraduate degree program, compared with 7 percent of students 19 to 23 years and 9 percent of those 18 years or younger. Older students were also more likely than younger students to be enrolled in a certificate program and less likely to be pursuing an associate's degree. When examining the reported purpose of BPS students for enrolling in a community college, age differences were also apparent (table 3). Students 24 years or older were more likely than younger students to cite job skills as their purpose for enrolling. In contrast, students  24 years or older were less likely than students 18 or younger to report transfer to a 4-year institution as their purpose for enrolling (12 percent vs. 50 percent). An analysis of differences by gender and race/ethnicity among the BPS students revealed that women were more likely than men to report intentions of obtaining a degree or certificate (25 percent vs. 16 percent), while men were more likely to report that they intended to transfer to a 4-year institution (42 percent vs. 33 percent) (table 3). Asian students were more likely than both White and Black students to report intentions of transferring to a 4-year institution (61 percent vs. 37 and 28 percent, respectively).7 Table 4, which combines degree and transfer expectations, indicates that Black students were more likely than White students to report intentions of earning a credential at the community college without transferring (53 percent vs. 39 percent). Among BPS students with one or more characteristics known to place them at risk of not completing their postsecondary education,8 26 percent said they enrolled in a community college to obtain job skills, compared with 11 percent of students with no risk factors (table 3). A lower percentage of students with one or more risk factors reported that their purpose for enrolling was to transfer to a 4-year institution than their counterparts with no risk factors (32 percent vs. 55 percent). Similarly, in table 4, it is evident that students at risk were more likely to report intentions of earning a credential without transferring (45 percent vs. 26 percent), while students with no risk factors were more likely to report intentions of transferring and earning a credential (32 percent vs. 19 percent). Looking at the actual degree program in which BPS students were enrolled when they first began community college, age differences were also observed (table 5). Older students were less likely than younger students to be enrolled in liberal arts or undeclared programs but were more likely to be enrolled in certificate programs. Students at risk were also more likely than those with no risk factors to be enrolled in certificate programs (19 percent vs. 4 percent). In summary, the analysis revealed important differences in the characteristics of students with various postsecondary objectives and patterns of enrollment in programs of study.

This section of the report addresses how prepared high school graduates who enroll in a community college are to undertake collegelevel coursework. Are they at risk of not completing their postsecondary education before they begin? The NELS survey of 1992 high school graduates provides a number of indicators of students' academic readiness as well as indicators of risk associated with postsecondary attrition. Measures of academic preparation used in this analysis include students' 12th-grade proficiency test levels in mathematics9 and reading19 and whether they completed the minimum basic curriculum as advocated in A Nation at Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983). This coursework includes 4 years of English, 3 years of social studies, and 2 years each of mathematics and science. Additionally, students who were academically qualified to attend a 4year college were also identified.11 The analysis also used risk profiles of students to determine whether students were at risk of dropping out of high school,12 or for those enrolled in college, if they were at risk of not completing their postsecondary education.13 Many of the NELS students who began their postsecondary education in community colleges faced many challenges to completing a credential (table 6). Thirty percent of these students enrolled with 12th-grade mathematics proficiency scores at Level 1 or below. These students could perform simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers but could not perform simple operations on decimals, fractions, powers, or roots. In addition, 44 percent of the NELS students enrolled with 12th-grade reading proficiency scores at Level 1 or below.

Therefore, it is appropriate to examine outcomes specifically for those who did report intentions of completing a degree or certificate. It is primarily these students for whom completion, as measured by earning a formal award, is a relevant indicator. What, then, were the rates of completion among students for whom a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree through transfer to a 4-year institution was a stated aim? Among BPS community college students expecting to either complete a formal credential or transfer to a 4-year institution, about 39 percent had attained a credential by 2001 (table 7a).

Completion Among 1992 High School Graduates Who Enrolled in Community Colleges minimum basic high school curriculum had attained or transferred to a 4-year institution, compared with 56 percent of their peers who did not complete that curriculum (table 9b). Rates of completion were also lower for students scoring at the lowest levels on high school assessments of proficiency in reading and mathematics. For example, about one-half (54 percent) of students who had scored in the lowest proficiency levels of mathematics as seniors in high school had earned a credential or attended a 4-year institution, compared with three-quarters who had scored in the highest levels tested (level 4 or 5). Similarly, students who scored at levels 1 or 2 in reading proficiency were less likely than their peers who scored at level 3 to have attained or transferred (60 and 63 percent vs. 75 percent).21 Among NELS high school graduates who in 1988 had two or more risk factors associated with dropping out of high school, 54 percent of community college students had completed a degree or attended a 4-year institution by 2000, compared with 67 percent of students who had no dropout risk factors. Similarly, 44 percent of 1992 high school graduates who enrolled in a community college with two or more characteristics that placed them at risk of not completing their postsecondary education had completed a credential or attended a 4-year institution by 2000, compared with 70 percent of students with no such risk factors and 66 percent with one risk factor. How long community college students waited to enroll in postsecondary education after high school graduation was also related to their completion of a degree or transfer. Two-thirds of those who enrolled in a community college within 4 months of high school graduation completed a formal award or attended a 4-year college or university, compared with 40 percent of those who delayed from 5 to 7 months and 50 percent who delayed from 7 to 24 months. Finally, as previously discussed, roughly one-third of 1992 high school graduates enrolled in a community college even though they may have been able to enroll in a 4-year institution based on their academic qualifications. These students were more likely than their peers who were not qualified or only minimally qualified to have earned a bachelor's degree by 2000 (36 percent vs. 12 percent) and also more likely to have earned any formal credential (62 percent vs. 43 percent) (table 9a)."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Analysis", "text": "To take into account the interrelationship of academic preparation indicators, risk factors, and demographic characteristics that may influence students' likelihood of completing a 21There were too few cases who scored below level 1 to find a significant difference between this group and others."}, {"section_title": "56", "text": "Completion Among 1992 High School Graduates Who Enrolled in Community Colleges postsecondary credential, a multivariate analysis was conducted on the NELS data. (See appendix B for a detailed description of the methodology used.) The multivariate method used in this analysis is an approach sometimes referred to as \"communality analysis.\" Multiple linear regression was used to adjust for the covariation among a list of control variables, which were selected based solely on the descriptive analysis rather than on a theoretical model, and the regression model was not reduced. The dependent variable was a dichotomous outcome (yes/no) indicating whether a student had either attained a formal credential or attended a 4-year institution. The least squares regression coefficients, expressed as percentages, are displayed in table 10. Significant coefficients represent the observed differences that remain between the analysis group (such as those with the highest mathematics proficiency scores) and the comparison group (those with lowest level scores) after controlling for the relationships of all the selected independent variables. For example, the least squares coefficient for scoring at level 4 or 5 in mathematics is 14.5. This means that compared with those who scored at level 1 or below, about 15 percent more of the students with high level scores would be expected to have a successful outcome after controlling for the relationships among the other independent variables. The first column of table 10 contains the unadjusted percentagesthat is, the percentages before taking into account the interrelationships among the other variables. Numbers with asterisks indicate that the percentage of students in that category is significantly different from the percentage in the reference category. After adjusting for the relationships among the independent variables listed in the table, three variables remained significantly associated with degree attainment or 4-year transfer. Students who scored in the highest mathematics proficiency level (vs. the lowest levels), students who completed the minimum basic high school curriculum (vs. not completing), and those who enrolled in college with no characteristics that placed them at risk of not completing their postsecondary education (vs. those with two or more factors) were all more likely than their counterparts to have attained or transferred.22 On the other hand, after controlling for all other variables, the difference between rates of attainment or transfer between the highest and lowest reading proficiency scores was no longer significant.23 Similarly, the difference between students with and without factors that had placed 22The variable indicating students' qualification for a 4-year college was not included in the model with the NELS proficiency scores and high school coursetaking because the scores and high school coursetaking are components of the qualification composite; therefore, the variables are highly intercorrelated. 23Holding related variables constant typically reduces the magnitude of the differences between the unadjusted percentages. In some cases the difference is no longer significant."}, {"section_title": "5 7", "text": "Completion Among 1992 High School Graduates Who Enrolled in Community Colleges Table 10.

For example, the coefficient for mathematics proficiency score of 4 or 5 is 14.5, which means that about 15 percent more students at this proficiency would be expected to attain a degree or enroll in a 4-year institution compared to those who scored at level 1 or below.

This variable was constructed using the following six composite and questionnaire variables: single-parent family, low parent education, sibling dropout, 3 or more hours at home alone, limited English proficiency, and low family income. mRepresents an index of risk from 0-6 characteristics known to adversely affect postsecondary persistence and attainment.

Completion Among 1992 High School Graduates Who Enrolled in Community Colleges them at risk of dropping out of high school were no longer significant. These results may in part be due to the association between reading scores or high school dropout risk and the presence of characteristics that place students at risk of not completing their postsecondary education; once postsecondary risk was held constant, the association between reading proficiency or high school dropout risk with the outcome diminished. Finally, before controlling for the relationship among the independent variables, students from families in the highest socioeconomic (SES) quartile were more likely than their peers in the lowest quartile to have attained a credential or transferred to a 4-year institution. Also, Black and Hispanic students were less likely than White students to have attained or transferred. However, once students' academic preparation and other variables were held constant, the socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity differences no longer remained. One explanation for this result is that low SES students as well as Black and Hispanic students are more likely to be at risk of dropping out of high school and when holding dropout risk constant, the associations between outcomes and SES and race/ethnicity variables diminished. Alternatively, the result suggests that students may be able to overcome such disadvantages with adequate academic preparation."}, {"section_title": "6 0", "text": "Completion and Employment Outcomes For many students, the work world competes with postsecondary education, and both the lure or, in some cases, the necessity of work can lead them to leave postsecondary education without completing a certificate or degree.

Although educational objectives vary among students enrolled in community collegesolder students, for example, are more likely to pursue a certificate while younger students are more likely to seek an associate's degreemost community college students say that they desire a formal credential, either from the community college or through transfer to a 4-year institution. Controlling for student objective and ignoring those who do not seek a certificate or degree, between 40 and 50 percent of students who first enrolled in a community college had attained a formal credential within the time frame of the two surveys studied (6 to 8 years). An additional 12 to 13 percent had not attained a credential but had transferred to a 4-year institution. For students who had completed a degree, it took them longer than might be expected in large part because they attended on a part-time basis. For example, students in associate's degree programs took an average of 3 1/2 years to complete and many of those in bachelor's degree programs were still enrolled after 6 years. The reasons for not completing are complex, including poor academic preparation and a significant time commitment required to complete a credential, as well as other factors such as family responsibilities that increase the risk that students will not achieve their postsecondary education objectives. Better preparation and fewer risk factors were associated with higher rates of completion. Finally, while many students who leave community colleges without completing a credential report that their postsecondary experience favorably affected their labor market opportunities, students who completed were more likely to report positive impacts than students who did not.
