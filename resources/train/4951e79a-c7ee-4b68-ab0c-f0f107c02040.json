The subjects with MCI had memory complaints, a CDR score of 0.5, mild impairments on objective cognitive measures (i.e., amnestic deficits), and no significant impairments in ADL. On MMSE the range for MCI was 24-30, and the education-adjusted cut-off score for Logical Memory II was \u22648 for 16 years of education, \u22644 for 8-15 years, and \u22642 for 0-7 years. The participants with MCI did not qualify for the diagnosis of AD. Finally, subjects with AD had mild AD with memory complaints, a CDR score \u22650.5, and significant impairments on objective cognitive measures and in ADL. On MMSE the range for AD was 20-26, and the education-adjusted cut-off score for Logical Memory II was \u22648 for 16 years, \u22644 for 8-15 years, and \u22642 for 0-7 years. Individuals with AD met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD 18 . Importantly, all diagnoses were independent of biomarker information. All included participants had available information on CSF biomarkers and MRI atrophy at baseline, as well as longitudinal information regarding diagnostic status. A total of 154 participants with MCI were included in the current study. Of those, 74 progressed to AD (MCI-P) within 36-months, and 80 remained stable in their diagnosis across time (MCI-S). In addition, 101 HC participants and 102 participants with AD were included for descriptive comparisons. We classified the individuals and compared the groups by assessing the baseline data. For the cognitive characterization, we conducted group comparisons of global cognitive performance as measured with MMSE, and episodic memory as measured with the delayed recall in the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT; total score = 15). Demographic and clinical variables are presented in Table 1 . The study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of all included ADNI centres (see supplementary information), and written informed consent (including extensive description of the ADNI) was acquired from all included participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All study methods and protocols were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.\nAssessment procedure for cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. For CSF, the A\u03b2 42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) protein levels were measured from the ADNI baseline aliquots (See Shaw et al., 2009 for detailed information) 19 . In summary, calibration curves were produced for each CSF marker using aqueous buffered solutions that contained the combination of the three CSF markers at concentrations ranging from 56 to 1,948 pg/ml for recombinant tau, 27 to 1,574 pg/ml for synthetic A\u03b2 42 peptide, and 8 to 230 pg/ml for a tau synthetic peptide phosphorylated at the threonine 181 position."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of the A/T/N classification system.", "text": "The A/T/N is a three-tailed binary +/\u2212 categorization system based on the underlying pathophysiology in each category 6 .

Each individual was rated as either positive (+; i.e., abnormal) or negative (\u2212; i.e., normal) on each biomarker.\nThe cut-offs of the selected CSF biomarkers have previously been published 19 . In summary, the cut-off values were derived from the comparison between ADNI AD cases and healthy controls.

For MRI, a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence was acquired on 1.5 T scanners with a voxel size of 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.2 mm 3 . All T1-weighted images were visually rated for regional brain atrophy by an experienced radiologist (See Ferreira et al., 2015 for detailed information) 20 . In summary, the medial temporal atrophy (MTA) scale scored the degree of atrophy from zero to four 21 . The posterior atrophy (PA) scale scored from zero to three and evaluated atrophy in the posterior cortex (posterior cingulate sulcus, precuneus, parieto-occipital sulcus, and parietal cortex) 22 . Finally, the global cortical atrophy scale -frontal subscale (GCA-F) scored from zero to three and evaluated atrophy in the frontal cortex (bordered by the central sulcus, the frontal bone, and the fissure of Sylvius) 23 . Higher scores in the three scales denote end-stage degree of atrophy. Intra-rater reliability (weighted kappa) for MTA was 0.94 and 0.89 in the left and right hemispheres respectively. Equivalent numbers for PA was 0.88, and for GCA-F 0.83.\nClassification of brain atrophy patterns. Cut-offs for the visual rating scales have previously been published 20 . In summary, normal versus abnormal cut-off points were determined for each individual in the three visual rating scales. A MTA score \u22651,5 were considered to be abnormal in the age-group 65-74, \u22652 for the age-group 75-84, and \u22652,5 for the age-group 85-94. For PA and GCA-F, a score \u2265 1 was always considered abnormal irrespective of age (age-correction did not improve diagnostic accuracy in cut-offs derivation). The four atrophy patterns were created using the combination of MTA, PA, and GCA-F 14, 24 , and have previously been described in relation to AD 13 . The atrophy patterns for each study group are illustrated in Fig. 1 . In summary, the minimal-atrophy pattern was defined as no evidence of visual brain atrophy according to the above-mentioned rating scales cut-offs. The limbic-predominant pattern was defined as an abnormal MTA, and a normal PA and GCA-F. The typical AD pattern was defined as an abnormal MTA in conjunction with either an abnormal PA or GCA-F, or an abnormal MTA in conjunction with both an abnormal PA and GCA-F.

The descriptive results of the A/T/N classification are displayed in Fig. 2 (see also supplementary material for specific baseline information on the comparison between A\u2212/T\u2212/N\u2212 or A+/T+/ N+ MCI subjects). Overall, the overlap between amyloid pathology, tangle pathology, and neurodegeneration increased with disease progression, being extensive in MCI-P and AD, and inferior in MCI-S and HC. In particular, participants with a positive \"A\" biomarker were more highly represented in AD (92%) and MCI-P (91%) than in MCI-S (59%) and HC (39%). Of the 114 MCI-participants with positive \"A\", 67 progressed to AD (59%), which correspond to an incidence rate of 196 per 1000 individuals with MCI that progress yearly to AD (95% CI, 154-238). Furthermore, an overall positive A/T/N classification (i.e., A+/T+/N+) was more common in AD (63%) and MCI-P (54%) than in MCI-S (28%) and HC (12%).

Only one individual had an A+/T\u2212/N+ pattern. In MCI-S, 28% (n = 23) of those that had the minimal-atrophy or hippocampal-sparing pattern also had a negative \"A\" biomarker. The equivalent number for MCI-P was 3% (n = 2), and the proportion comparison between MCI-S and MCI-P was significant (X 1 = 25.00, p < 0.01).

Importantly, the addition of different brain atrophy patterns accumulated the diagnostic substrate and increased knowledge of the clinical trajectories. This combined approach could be important for increasing certainty in the diagnostic and prognostic procedures in MCI, and therefore also supportive in targeting good candidates for interventions. We will first discuss the A/T/N classification scheme assessed in individuals with MCI and then discuss the impact of brain atrophy patterns when added to the A/T/N classification, with a special focus on variability in the \"N\" domain.\nThe A/T/N classification. We showed a progression rate from amnestic MCI to AD (47%) which is consistent (48%) with a previous study with the same follow-up time of 36-months 25 . In addition, we showed that 58% of the MCI-participants with a positive \"A\" biomarker progressed to AD which is comparable with a previous study showing that 57% of an MCI-population with abnormal A\u03b2 42 progressed to AD during a mean follow-up of 2.2 years 26 . Notably, being classified as MCI with a positive \"A\" biomarker increased the risk of progressing to AD during a 36-month period in comparison with being classified with a negative \"A\" biomarker. The effect was evident even after controling for cognitive baseline status. This resembles models of AD-related neurodegeneration, in which amyloid deposition acts as the trigger of further disease progression 27 . In addition, the A/T/N classification showed a stepwise increase in numbers of A+/T+/N+ profiles from HC (12%), via MCI-S (29%), to MCI-P (54%), and finally the highest number for AD (63%). Thus, the more advanced stage of the disease, the higher was the prevalence of positive A/T/N biomarkers, as it was a comorbidity of pathophysiological processes. In addition, the MCI subjects with an overall positive A/T/N pattern had a worse episodic memory performance compared with those with an overall negative A/T/N pattern which might reflect a later stage of MCI for A+/T+/N+. Interestingly, we showed that MCI-P had similar A/T/N classification patterns to the group with AD. A positive \"A\" biomarker was represented in more than ninety percent in both MCI-P and AD. However, a positive \"A\" biomarker was also present in MCI-S (59%) and HC (39%), but to a lesser degree. Thus, there was a considerable amount of individuals in HC and MCI-S with evidence of AD-like pathology. However, A\u03b2 42 deposition increases with age and is also apparent in healthy individuals 28, 29 . Recently, an A/T/N classification in cognitively normal individuals showed that the A+/T+/ N+ prevalence increased continuously with age 30 . Notably, considering all groups, only one individual had the A+/T\u2212/N+ profile. This might reflect an individual in an early stage of preclinical AD (A+/T\u2212) in conjunction with non-AD pathology (N+) 6 . Thus, in our A/T/N classification of MCI, the CSF biomarker patterns seems to generally follow the order of A+, then T+, and finally N+. As in healthy aging individuals 30 , the biomarker sequence of A+/T\u2212/N\u2212 to A+/T+/N\u2212 to A+/T+/N+ is also noted in the current study of MCI and might represents the pre-dementia AD staging pattern 7 . However, ADNI is a highly selective cohort and the A+/T\u2212/N+ profile might be more commonly occurring in clinical settings with more diverse pathology and clinical trajectories. Importantly, longer follow-ups are needed to increase knowledge on the staging evolvement in healthy individuals as well as in MCI to confirm the A/T/N progression.\nFurthermore, we showed that MCI with a negative \"A\" biomarker was more common in MCI-S than in MCI-P. Despite that, we reported that seven individuals with MCI and a negative \"A\" biomarker progressed to AD within 36 months. Of those seven, six had an A\u2212/T\u2212/N\u2212 pattern, and one an A\u2212/T+/N\u2212 pattern. Interestingly, when we added information on atrophy patterns to those profiles, we demonstrated that five individuals had an abnormal MTA score (two individuals with a limbic-predominant pattern and three with a typical AD pattern), and the additional two had abnormal cortical atrophy (both with a hippocampal-sparing pattern). Thus, the biomarker profiles of these individuals might be related to suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) 6, 27 , that has previously been suggested to target individuals without evidence of amyloid accumulation but with evidence of neuronal injury. Possibly, such a pattern might also resemble neurodegeneration due to non-AD pathology 30 . "}, {"section_title": "MCI-P H-S (n = 9)", "text": "Age** 70,81 (7, In addition, no MCI individual with an A\u2212/T\u2212/N\u2212 profile and minimal-atrophy progressed to AD within the studied time-frame. Thus, an MCI diagnosis with an overall negative A/T/N classification in addition to a pattern of minimal-atrophy does not seem to represent MCI due to AD 31 or prodromal AD, and the clinical cognitive symptoms are probable due to other underlying causes 8 . All these findings suggest that in MCI individuals with a negative \"A\" biomarker, it is crucial to investigate the patterns of atrophy on MRI as well, which may have higher diagnostic utility than the CSF T-Tau levels.\nThe addition of brain atrophy patterns. Notably, the A+/T+/N+ pattern was more common in the MCI-P groups with minimal atrophy and hippocampal sparing pattern than the MCI-P groups with limbic predominant and typical AD patterns. The minimal atrophy and hippocampal sparing groups had lower levels of education, and the minimal atrophy group was also younger than the other groups, as recently reported in AD dementia 32 .\nIn addition, MCI-P with minimal atrophy had the lowest levels of A\u03b2 42 and the highest levels of p-tau and t-tau. This is in conjunction with what has previously been reported in groups with minimal atrophy in an AD population 13 . Also, the step-wise addition of p-tau (as a neurodegeneration marker) to cognitive measures has previously shown to improve risk stratification compared to hippocampal volumes (derived from MRI) in subjects with MCI 33 . Individuals with MCI and a minimal atrophy pattern in conjunction with abnormal CSF (A+/T+/N+) could therefore be good candidates for interventions due to their absence of irreversible brain atrophy, together with young age, less cognitive impairment at baseline (i.e., AVLT delayed), and slow cognitive decline across time 13 . Additionally, as suggested by Jack et al. 6 , we described the \"N\" category with only one biomarker (t-tau) in the current study. Another established marker to describe the \"N\" category is brain atrophy derived from MRI. When comparing the \"N\" classification with the atrophy patterns, several individuals with MCI showed inconsistency regarding the \"N\" binary classification and the MRI character of atrophy. For example there were individuals with MCI-P and A+/T+/N+ in conjunction with minimal atrophy (i.e., N\u2212 according to the visual rating scales). This highlights an incongruity between CSF t-tau and brain atrophy in MRI. Those conflicting results have been emphasised previously, showing that neurodegeneration biomarkers are modestly correlated 27 . In the absence of overt neuronal injury this might be related to increased neuronal secretion of tau in response to amyloid pathology, and that CSF t-tau and p-tau concentrations do not reflect neurodegeneration and tangle pathology directly 34 . These neurons may eventually accumulate tangle pathology and degenerate, but that would become evident in MRI many years later. In addition, this emphasises that individuals with MCI display heterogeneous neurodegeneration patterns as reflected on both MRI 35 , and CSF 36 , and that different biomarkers might become abnormal at different stages of the disease progression, or never coincide 37 .\nThe MCI individuals with a positive \"A\" biomarker in conjunction with amnestic impairment should be considered as prodromal AD according to the IWG criteria 8 , and as MCI due to AD according to the NIA-AA criteria 31 . In agreement, the addition of atrophy patterns to the \"A\" biomarker information, at least to some degree, enhanced confidence to the MCI prognoses in the current study. The progression rate from MCI to AD varies and annual rates between 4-36% have been reported 38 . Thus, we cannot with certainty confirm that MCI-S individuals in the current study will progress to AD. However, the MCI-S individuals with a positive \"A\" biomarker and AD-like atrophy patterns are likely to progress in respect to previous reports. For example, higher rates of AD-like atrophy has been reported in progressive MCI 39, 40 , and amyloid positive MCI individuals have been shown to be more likely to progress to AD than amyloid negative MCI individuals 41 . However, further longitudinal large-scale clinical studies that examine atrophy patterns in conjunction with A/T/N classifications are needed to increase knowledge on different MCI pathways. The current study shows for the first time that this joint strategy holds high promise.\nLimitations and future prospects. Since MCI individuals in ADNI are amnestic at entry, a future prospect is to adapt the A/T/N classification scheme and atrophy patterns to MCI participants with non-amnestic clinical presentations. As shown previously, the nature of memory impairment might differ due to the influence of non-memory cognitive functions on memory performance across atrophy patterns in AD 13 . In the current study, MCI and AD are only represented by amnestic deficits which narrows the spectra of atypical AD-related topographies, also due to the unresolved question whether AD must be represented solely by amnestic impairment 42 . In addition, the A/T/N classification scheme needs to be further validated, especially in community samples with MCI subjects. This would make it possible to draw firmer conclusions on the clinical significance of the scheme and first thereafter be able to be applied on MCI subjects in general. Thus, research studies in large-scale clinical settings are important to increase knowledge on this and other related topics.\nThis study has some additional limitations. Several individuals have CSF values close to the cut-offs. In clinical settings, the values close to the cut-offs have to be carefully interpreted and handled in relation to additional clinical information, as well as additional biomarker information. We only followed the participants for 36 months after their initial diagnosis, and a longer follow-up might have increased the number of MCI participants progressing to AD 43 . In addition, the sub-group categorization focusing on atrophy patterns in MCI partly rendered in small sample sizes, and a future prospect would therefore be to maximise sample sizes to increase the possibilities for stronger generalizations to the MCI-population."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We conclude that the A/T/N classification scheme is easy and adaptable on individuals with MCI, and that visual rating scales can be used to identify AD-related atrophy patterns also in MCI. We presented that no individual with MCI progressed to AD if they had a negative \"A\" biomarker in conjunction with minimal atrophy. In contrast, several individuals with MCI progressed to AD if they had a positive \"A\" biomarker in conjunction with minimal atrophy. In addition, many individuals with MCI showed inconsistency in the neurodegeneration domain (\"N\"), reflecting an incongruity between CSF t-tau levels and brain atrophy on MRI. Thus, we propose that the A/T/N biomarker system should be applied and interpreted together with information about brain atrophy patterns. This joint strategy shows promising sings for increasing certainty in the diagnostic and prognostic procedures in MCI, and can also be supportive in targeting suitable candidates for interventions. Accordingly, implementation in the clinical routine could be justified."}]
