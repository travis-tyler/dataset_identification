[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ObjectiveaaThis article investigates subjects aged 55 to 65 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to broaden our understanding of early-onset (EO) cognitive impairment using neuroimaging and genetics biomarkers. MethodsaaNine of the subjects had EO-AD (Alzheimer's disease) and 27 had EO-MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The 15 most important neuroimaging markers were extracted with the Global Shape Analysis (GSA) Pipeline workflow. The 20 most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen and were associated with specific neuroimaging biomarkers. ResultsaaWe identified associations between the neuroimaging phenotypes and genotypes for a total of 36 subjects. Our results for all the subjects taken together showed the most significant associations between rs7718456 and L_hippocampus (volume), and between rs7718456 and R_hippocampus (volume). For the 27 MCI subjects, we found the most significant associations between rs6446443 and R_superior_frontal_gyrus (volume), and between rs17029131 and L_Precuneus (volume). For the nine AD subjects, we found the most significant associations between rs16964473 and L_rectus gyrus (surface area), and between rs12972537 and L_rectus_gyrus (surface area). ConclusionaaWe observed significant correlations between the SNPs and the neuroimaging phenotypes in the 36 EO subjects in terms of neuroimaging genetics. However, larger sample sizes are needed to ensure that the effects will be detectable for a reasonable false-positive error rate using the GSA and Plink Pipeline workflows.

One subtype is the autosomal-dominant, familial early-onset AD (EO-AD). A very small percentage of people who develop AD have the EO variety, which is classified as the beginning of the disease presentation before the age of 65. Researchers have found out three genes whose mutations cause EO-AD. These are APP 3 (amyloid precursor protein) on chromosome 21; PS1 4 (presenilin 1) on chromosome 14; and PS2 5, 6 (presenilin 2) on chromosome 1. The other group is sporadic, non-familial AD, most commonly termed \"late-onset AD\" (LO-AD), which is defined with the disease presentation after the age of 65.\nGenetic studies have provided significant insights into the molecular basis of AD. Rare hereditary EO forms of the disease have been linked to mutations of three different genes, as mentioned. These mutations explain, however, less than 1% of all cases of AD. 7 Some people who have EO-AD do not have mutations in any of these three genes. That suggests that EO-AD is linked to other genetic mutations that have not been identified yet.\nIn this paper, \"neuroimaging genetics\" refers to the use of computationally-derived neuroanatomical, functional, or connectivity imaging markers as phenotype assays to evaluate the genetic variation. Recent and ongoing advances in neuro-imaging genetics have made it possible to scan populations with multimodality neuroimaging to collect genome-wide data 8, 9 and to study the influence of genetic variation on the brain structure and function. [10] [11] [12] Quantitative trait (QT) association studies have been shown to have increased the statistical power and thus, decreased the sample size requirements. 13 In addition, neuroimaging phenotypes may be closer to the underlying biological etiology of the disease, which makes it easier to identify underlying genes. 10 This study focuses on analyzing gene interactions and collective genome effects on the brain structure in ADNI EO-AD and EO-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) data. Specifically, this study uses existing LONI computational tools and techniques (e.g., the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas, 14 BrainParser, 15 and the LONI Pipeline environment 16, 17 ) to study interrelations between phenotypes, genotypes, and biomedical neuroimaging features in the subjects from ADNI.\nA broad search for genes, SNPs, and alleles was used holistically to identify their associations with brain shape changes and subject phenotypes. We investigated whether or not there are collective multi-gene patterns that are significantly associated with imaging biomarkers. SNPs and other types of polymorphisms in single genes such as APOE have been related to neuroimaging measures in both healthy controls and cognitive impairment (such as MCI and AD) patients; however, a single gene or a few imaging measures may be insufficient to understand the multiple mechanisms and imaging manifestations of these complex diseases. Thus, we used a genomewide association study (GWAS) to relate high-throughput SNP data to large-scale neuroimaging data. We conducted a GWAS on the EO-AD and EO-MCI subjects to study the genes that influence the brain structure across all the brain regions.\nThis article uses data from subjects aged 55 to 65 to broaden our understanding of EO cognitive impairment (especially EO-AD and EO-MCI) in terms of neuroimaging genetics. We hypothesize that some specific SNPs that discriminate between EO-AD and EO-MCI subjects may be extracted in terms of GWAS, and EO cognitive impairment patients have different ROIs specific to EO cognitive impairment. Thus, we can associate the two results and identify a significant relationship between them. Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between neuroimaging phenotypes and genetic variants, but nothing has been reported yet on either shape-based neuroimaging measures or EO cognitive impairment subjects. 10, 18, 19 Therefore, we are attempting to expand the narrow scope of studies, in terms of EO cognitive impairment, in the field of neuroimaging genetics."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI data", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a $60 million, five-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test if serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) results, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment results can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and to monitor their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principle Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., of VA Medical Center and the University of California San Francisco. ADNI is the result of the efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and its subjects were recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults aged 55 to 90 to participate in the research, in which approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals were to be followed for three years, 400 people with MCI were to be followed for three years, and 200 people with early AD were to be followed for two years.

This interview generated an overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score and the CDR Sum of Boxes. 21 The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for each structural MRI scan was also conducted. APOE genotyping was determined using DNA obtained from the subjects' blood samples and was performed at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe participants were selected from the ADNI database if they were classified at the baseline as 1) cognitively normal control individuals with a CDR score of 0; 2) patients with MCI with an MMSE score of between 24 and 29, a subjective memory complaint verified by an informant, objective memory loss as measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, a CDR score of 0.5, absence of significant levels of impair-ment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia at the time of the baseline MRI scan, and who were classified as having the amnestic type of MCI based on the revised MCI criteria; and 3) patients with AD who met the criterion for probable AD (a CDR score of 1).\nThese 36 EO-AD and EO-MCI subjects were chosen from among all the subjects in the ADNI database (DB) who were aged between 55 and 65 as of September 2010.

Genetic analyses were performed using PLINK version 1.09 (http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/).\nBlood samples were obtained from each participant and sent to Pfizer for DNA extraction. All the DNA extractions and genotyping were blinded to the group assignments. TGen genotyped the blinded DNA using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. Approximately 200 ng of DNA was used to genotype each subject sample according to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After amplification, fragmentation, and hybridization, the specifically hybridized DNA was fluorescently labeled with a single base extension reaction and detected using a BeadArray scanner. Non-specifically hybridized fragments were removed by washing them off, and the remaining specifically hybridized DNA were processed for the single base extension reaction, stained, and imaged on an Illumina Bead Array Reader. The normalized bead intensity data obtained for each sample were loaded into the Illumina BeadStudio 3.2 software, which generated SNP genotypes from fluorescent intensities using the manufacturer's default cluster settings. The data analyzed with BeadStudio are publicly available on the LONI website (http:// ADNI.loni.usc.edu). The raw genotypic data were imported into a genome-wide data management system, i.e., SNPLims, to allow the export of user-defined formats compatible with the genetic programs used for the statistical analysis.\nThe quality control (QC) procedures were implemented for the genome-wide data. We performed all data analyses and QC procedures using the PLINK software package (http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/), release v1.09. SNPs were excluded from the imaging genetics analysis if they could not meet any of the following criteria: 1) a call rate per SNP >90%; 2) a minor allele frequency (MAF) >10%; and 3) a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test result of p>0.01.
