Most of the studies we reviewed show that women faculty earn less than their male counterparts do, even after controlling for other factors that affect earnings. The gender gap in earnings narrowed by the late 1970s, and several authors hypothesize that this was the result of affirmative action policies implemented in the early 1970s. The estimated size of the earnings gap appears to be sensitive to the kinds of control variables used in various studies. Studies that control for academic rank, publications, and family characteristics tend to show smaller earnings gaps than those that do not. However, evidence on the direct and indirect effects of marital status and parental variables on the earnings gap is mixed."}, {"section_title": "ACADEMIC RANK", "text": "There is substantial evidence that women, as a group, are underrepresented in senior academic ranks. In part, this is because women faculty tend to be younger than their male counterparts, a consequence of the relative increase in the number of women graduates entering the 1 fields of science and engineering.' Many of the studies we reviewed, however, show that even after controlling for other factors affecting promotions, including experience, women are less likely to appear in senior ranks. Some studies provide evidence that women are particularly disadvantaged early in their careers, during childrearing years."}, {"section_title": "SCHOLARLY PRODUCTIVITY", "text": "Many researchers use measures of scholarly productivity as control variables in both salary and academicrank studies. Scholarly production is typically a significant factor in determining earnings and promotions, and many authors noted that women faculty members publish less on average than their male counterparts do.' Thus, gender differences in publication rates explain, at least partially, differences in average earnings and promotion rates between women and men. One study, however, which used a quality-weighted index of scholarly output, found that female economists are more productive than their male counterparts are.' Also, some of the gender differences in productivity might be explained by job selection and gender sorting by coauthors. Men and women tend to collaborate with coauthors of the same sex. Because there are relatively few women in faculties, women are placed at a disadvantage because it is more difficult for them to find collaborators."}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATION OF REPORT", "text": "Sections 2 through 5 of this report deal with background issues, findings on the gender earnings gap in academia, the effects of gender on tenure status and academic rank, and the literature on gender differences in scholarly productivity.

Findings in the literature indicate that the gender earnings gap is at least partly due to gender differences in promotions and scholarly productivity."}, {"section_title": "SECTION 2. BACKGROUND ISSUES", "text": "The background issues described in this section are important for interpreting the literature on women in academic careers. These include human capital and occupational choice theory, the kinds of data that are typically used in empirical research on the effects of gender on academic careers, and selection issues that complicate interpreting the results of empirical research."}, {"section_title": "HUMAN CAPITAL THEORY AND OCCUPATIONAL CHOICE", "text": "Human capital is the set of skills and abilities that enable individuals to perform jobs. Individuals can acquire or add to their stock of human capital through education and training. Economic theory suggests that individuals invest in education and training to realize the expected future benefits of both earnings and nonpecuniary amenities associated with employment. Clearly, individuals with doctoral degrees have made substantial investments in human capital. These investments include the direct costs of education plus the opportunity costs of earnings forgone during schooling. Individuals can also accumulate human capital through on-the-job experience. For example, doctorate earners might reasonably be expected to improve both their research and their teaching skills with experience, particularly during the early years of their employment. Even within academics, different jobs lead to the formation of qualitatively different human capital. For example, an individual who takes employment in an academic department that stresses research is likely to acquire skills quite different from an individual who works at a teaching institution. One issue raised in the literature is whether women and men acquire qualitatively and quantitatively different levels of human capital because of family and parental responsibilities. One hypothesis is that human capital accumulated by female scientists and engineers depreciates when childbearing and child rearing interrupts their. careers (or alternatively, that women accumulate human capital at a slower rate than men do because parental responsibilities interrupt their participation in the workforce). A second hypothesis, advanced by Johnson and Stafford (1974), argues that women have less incentive to accumulate human capital than men do because child rearing leaves them with less time to realize re-3 turns on their investments. Johnson and Stafford argued that the tendency of women to take jobs at teaching rather than research institutions reflects occupational choices that trade human capital accumulation for short-term economic benefits.4 Some have criticized the emphasis on human capital theory in the literature. Strober and Quester (1977), for example, discounted Johnson and Stafford's argument that women's job choices reflect deliberate decisions to forgo human capital investments in favor of short-term economic gains. Colander and Woos (1997) argued that emphasis on differences between men's and women's human capital diverts attention from demand-side discrimination against women. They argued that lower pay for women faculty allows established academic \"insiders\" to capture economic rent."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "Data requirements generally depend on the objectives and design of a particular study. However, if the objective is to measure the effects of gender on the careers of academic scientists and engineers, some general data requirements can be identified. First, measures of career outcomes are required, for example, earnings and academic rank. In addition to measures of outcomes, well-designed studies of gender effects require data on control variables that might be expected to affect outcomes. These include measures of productivity (e.g., number of publications) and human capital (e.g., quality of graduate program attended, years of experience).5 Also, many of the studies we reviewed contain variables reflecting personal characteristics that might affect outcomes, including age, marital status, number of children, and race/ethnicity. Generally, the studies we reviewed used two kinds of datadata that are national in scope and data from single academic institutions. An obvious advantage of using national data sets is the ability to generalize results of studies to the national population. However, some 4Johnson and Stafford argued that starting pay at less prestigious institutions that emphasize teaching is higher than at more prestigious research institutions. 'We might argue that career outcomes should depend strictly on productivity. However, given the difficulty of measuring productivity in academia, many studies include variables reflecting human-capital accumulation as controls. of the single-institution data sets used in the literature contain detailed measures of control variables, especially those reflecting human capital and productivity. Two national data sets used frequently in the literature are data collected and maintained by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and by the Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching. Salary studies by NSF (1996), Johnson andStafford (1974), andFarber (1977) used NSF data. Also, Long (2001), Olson (1999), Kahn (1993), and Weiss and Lillard (1982) used NSF data to study the effects of gender on academic rank. The Carnegie Foundation data include relatively detailed information on outcome measures, such as salary and academic rank, and on several control variables, including sociodemographic characteristics (gender, race, marital status, and children), employment history, time spent on teaching and research, and productivity (articles and books published). Ashraf (1996), Bellas (1993), Carnegie Foundation (1990, and Barbezat (1987Barbezat ( , 1989b used Carnegie Foundation data for studies on gender earnings gaps. In addition to the data described above, some researchers used national data sets that are limited to specific fields. For example, Macfarlane and Luzzadder-Beach (1998) and Ongley et al. (1998) both used data maintained by the American Geological Institute for studies of academic rank. Several authors, including Brennan (1996), Everett et al. (1996), Heylin (1989), and Reskin (1976) used data from the Ainerican Chemical Society. Winkler et al. (1996) used data from the American Meteorological Society in a salary study. Some authors have designed their own national databases for their studies. For example, Broder (1993) drew a sample from applications for NSF grants to study the effects of gender on the salaries and rank of academic economists, and Formby et al. (1993) Kirshstein et al. (1997) used data from the 1993 NSOPF in their study of women and minority faculty in science. and engineering. Numerous studies in the literature used data from single academic institutions. As noted above, some of the data assembled for these studies are richly detailed. For example, Raymond et al. (1988) and  constructed detailed measures of relative productivity (publications and research awards) by individual academic departments for their salary studies. Katz (1973) included measures of teaching quality and service to the academic community as well as detailed measures of scholarship in his study of salary at a large public university. Longitudinal data that track individuals over time are useful for analyzing time between promotions and salary increases. However, relatively few of the studies we reviewed used longitudinal data. Farber (1977), who used NSF data,6 and Megdal and Ransom (1985), who used data from a single institution to study salary increases, are exceptions."}, {"section_title": "SELECTION ISSUES", "text": "Occupational choice theory states that individuals select jobs that give them the largest expected future benefits; however, the feasible set of employment opportunities from which individuals make choices is constrained. Perhaps most obviously, an individual's endowment of human capital limits available choices. For example, employment opportunities at top research universities are typically available only to the most able of those with doctoral degrees, who have demonstrated high levels of academic achievement. Discrimination can also affect job choices. Gender bias, for example, can either limit the set of job opportunities available to women or make some jobs less attractive because of lower pay or reduced promotion possibilities.' There is substantial evidence in the literature that female and male scientists and engineers take academic jobs that are qualitatively different. Brennan (1996) reported that women are underrepresented at research universities, and the Carnegie Foundation (1990) found a 6 Farber used NSF panel data from 1960through 1966 'The literature provides some evidence that perceived discrimination affects job choices. Neumark and McLennan (1995) reported evidence that women who report acts of discrimination are more likely to change jobs. 0 concentration of women at lower-paying institutions. Koplin and Singell (1996) and Broder (1993) reported that female economists tend to be employed in less-prestigious departments. Barbezat (1992) found that women tend to be employed in academic jobs that stress teaching over research. There is also evidence that women and men tend to select different academic fields. Olson (1999) found that women are overrepresented in biology. Barbezat (1992) conducted a survey of the employment preferences of individuals with doctorates in economics entering the job market. She found that salary and benefits are more important to men than they are to women. Women, however, place a higher preference than men do on student quality, teaching load, collegiality and interaction within academic departments, opportunities for joint work, and female representation on the faculty. Women also prefer spending more time teaching,' whereas men prefer research. Barbezat found that after controlling for differences in stated job preferences, gender has no effect on actual employment placements. We emphasize that Barbezat's findings are limited to first jobs in a single field. Moreover, preferences stated by the survey subjects may be, to some extent, rationalizations of employment opportunities. In short, whether male-female differences in employment outcomes result from differences in job preferences or from limited opportunities as a consequence of discrimination is unclear. The evidence cited above suggests that employment outcomes for scientists and engineers in academia are not randomly distributed. More likely, they reflect the combined selection forces of human capital accumulation, job preferences, and limited opportunities. Selection has important implications for interpreting the results of empirical research on the effects of gender on employment outcomes in academic labor markets. For example, if gender differences in employment at teaching and research institutions are partly the result of discrimination, then controlling for the characteristics of the employing institution in a salary study will mask the effects of limited employment opportunities for women. Similarly, if women are underrepresented in higher academic ranks because of disparate treatment, controlling for rank in a salary study will understate the effects of gender on earnings.9 In theory, these types of selection.\u00b0W omen's preferences for teaching are consistent with findings reported in Zuckerman et al.

For example, the estimated differential in 1965 reported for the Ferber and Kordick (1978) study is 12.1 percent. This means that Ferber and Kordick estimated that, other things being the same, women faculty earned 12.1 percent less than male faculty in that year. The estimated salary differentials in Table 3-1 show a relatively clear pattern over time. Studies that examined academic salaries in 1975 or earlier, with the exception of 1972 (Ashraf 1996), show double-digit percentage differences between men's and women's salaries. Barbezat (1987) estimated female-earnings differentials in 1968-1969 of 16.5 percent and 21 percent, depending on controls. However, after 1975 only the study by Haberfeld and Shenhav (1990) shows a higher than single-digit percentage differential."}, {"section_title": "PERCEPTIONS OF DISCRIMINATION", "text": "Several studies suggest a widespread feeling among women in academics that their gender is a roadblock to their careers. These analyses of surveys and case studies indicate that women find that their gender limits career advancement (Brennan, 1992); women feel marginalized and excluded from a significant role in their departments (MIT 1999); women in the junior faculty ranks are more frustrated than men by the publishing review process; women lack practical applications for their research, respect from colleagues, and networking in their field (Macfarlane and Luzzadder-Beach, 1998); and women face more difficulties reaching tenure because of interruptions in their careers from childbearing (Brennan, 1996). A few studies have linked measures of job satisfaction or perceptions of discrimination to career outcomes. One kind of model examines the relations between different outcomes (tenure status or wage differentials) and overall job satisfaction. A second kind of model examines the effect ofjob satisfaction on the likelihood ofjob retention and consequently on tenure. For example, Hagedorn (1995), using a national database of faculty members in all fields, first estimated a gender-based wage differential and then incorporated the estimates into a causal model to predict several job-related measures of satisfaction. She found that the estimated wage differential has significant effects on women's perceptions of the employing institution, stress level, global job satisfaction, and intent to remain in academia. Neumark and McLennan (1995) used data from the national Longitudinal Survey of Young Women to test a \"feedback\" hypothesis,'\u00b0 an alternative to the human capital explanation of gender differences in wages. Their findings only partially support this hypothesis. They found that working women who report discrimination are subsequently more likely to change employers, to marry, and to have children. However, they also found that there is no relationship between self-reported discrimination and the subsequent accumulation of labor-market experience and that women reporting sex discrimination do not subsequently have lower wage growth. Using 1993 data from the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty to investigate the direct and indirect effects of gender on job satisfaction, Busenberg (1999) concluded that gender affects job satisfaction among aca-SECTION 3. EARNINGS Most of the studies we reviewed show that women faculty earn less than their male counterparts do, even after controlling for other factors that affect earnings. The modeling issues discussed here, which focus on the kinds of control variables used in academic salary studies, are important for interpreting our findings from the literature, which we present below."}, {"section_title": "MODELING ISSUES", "text": "Most of the salary studies we reviewed used multivariate regression analysis to control for factors other than gender that might affect the earnings of academic scientists and engineers. Typically, controls were for measures of human capital, measures of productivity, personal characteristics, and academic field.\nMany of the studies on academic rank that we reviewed attempted to determine the effects of gender on academic rank after controlling for the effects of other factors that might affect promotions (e.g., experience and scholarly production). In most cases, these studies employed one of two kinds of analyses: discrete outcome models or hazard models. Discrete outcome models permit multivariate analyses of outcomes that are observed as discrete events. This kind of model is appropriate for analyses of discrete career outcomes, such as academic rank or tenure (e.g., the individual is either tenured or not tenured). Two kinds of commonly used discrete outcome models are logit analysis and probit analysis.23 Long (2001), Olson (1999), and Raymond et al. (1993) all used logit analysis in their studies of academic rank. Ransom and Megdal (1993), McDowell and Smith (1992), and Farber (1977) used probit analysis. Logit and probit analyses allow researchers to estimate, for example, the effect that gender has on the probability of being promoted to the rank of full professor after controlling for other factors that might affect rank, such as experience or scholarly productivity. Hazard analysis is a useful tool for analyzing factors that affect the length of time required to achieve a given academic rank.24 Both Weiss and Lillard (1982) and Kahn (1993) used hazard analysis in their studies of academic rank. Hazard analysis allows the researcher to estimate, for example, the effect that gender has on the time required to reach the rank of full professor after controlling for other variables affecting promotions. The kinds of control variables used in the literature on academic rank are similar to those used in salary stud-23Logit and probit analyses are similar statistical tools but differ in assumptions about the distributions of random modeling error. 24Ha7ard analysis, sometimes referred to as duration analysis, is superior to ordinary least squares regression analysis in that it can deal with censured observations.

One might argue that the characteristics of the employer serve as proxies for human capital (i.e., individuals who have accumulated the most capital are more likely to land jobs at the most prestigious institutions), but if women are discriminated against in the academic labor market, then employer characteristics might be a biased measure of human capital. Alternatively, one might argue that institutional characteristics serve as proxies for nonpecuniary job amenities (e.g., quality of students and emphasis on teaching rather than on research). If they do, then measures of institutional characteristics might be appropriate controls for individuals' willingness to trade earnings for nonpecuniary job amenities. '5 The effect of employer characteristics on earnings is unclear, particularly for junior faculty. The most highly qualified individuals might be expected to find jobs at the most prestigious institutions and be compensated accordingly. But junior faculty taking jobs at the most prestigious universities might expect to accumulate more human capital than they would at other institutions. This suggests they might be willing to trade current income for future returns to investments in human capital.'6\nSeveral studies, including Long. (2001), Olson (1999, Broder (1993), Kahn (1993), and McDowell and Smith (1992) controlled for the characteristics of the employing institution. These controls could be interpreted as measures of human capital, given that individuals who have accumulated the most human capital are most likely to be employed at the most prestigious universities. In studies of academic rank, however, employer characteristics are probably better interpreted as proxies for variations in tenure and promotion requirements.

Of the studies that we have reviewed, only two found no statistically significant gender differences in promotion rates. Raymond et al. (1993) found no evidence of gender having an effect on academic rank, but this study used data for a single institution. A study by McDowell and Smith (1992), who used data for only the field of economics, found no statistical difference in promotion rates between men and women after allowing for gender differences in the effect of experience on academic rank. They did find that women receive less credit for experience than men do. Interpreting gender differences in returns received from experience has raised controversy in the literature. Gender differences in credit for experience could be due either to gender differences in human capital accumulation (caused by family responsibilities and workforce interruptions) or to gender bias. The findings from some of the studies we reviewed suggest that women faculty are placed at a particular disadvantage by family responsibilities during child-rearing years. For example, Farber (1977) found that women receive significantly fewer promotions when they are young but found no significant differences in promotion rates for older women. McDowell and Smith (1992) concluded that promotion rates for women are lower than those for men because women receive less credit for years of experience.

Discrimination in promotions will tend to mask male-female salary differentials. The insignificant result for the years 1987-1988 is based on the Formby et al. (1993) study; however, Formby et al. restricted their sample to new hires and studied salaries for only the academic field of economics. Table 3-1 indicates whether three important kinds of variablesacademic rank, publications, and marital status or the number of childrenare included as controls \"See O'Neill and Sicherman (1997), Ransom and Megdal (1993), and Barbezat (1989b) for similar interpretations. in the studies listed. Including rank in faculty salary studies is controversial because discriminatory treatment in promotions tends to mask male-female salary differentials. The issue of scholarly production (e.g., the number of publications) is also important because most of the available evidence suggests that women publish less frequently than men do.19 As a result, excluding scholarly production as a control is likely to increase measured salary differentials. Finally, we might hypothesize that family responsibilities negatively affect the career advancement, and hence earnings, of women faculty. In short, we would expect that including all three kinds of controls would reduce measured salary differentials."}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Control Variables on Earnings Differentials", "text": "Finding empirical evidence for these effects from the literature as a whole is complicated by the fact that different studies control for different combinations of factors, and because the gender gap appears to be changing over time. For the pre-1976 period, studies that excluded controls for rank, publications, and family characteristics tended to measure the largest salary gaps. For example, Barbezat (1987) measured the largest gap, 20.7 percent in 1968-1969, when she controlled for none of these factors, but when she controlled for publications, her estimate of the earnings gap for the same time period fell to 16.5 percent. Ashraf (1996), who controlled for all three factors, estimated the smallest pre-1976 earnings gap, 9 percent in 1972. A similar pattern appears in the post-1976 period. When controls for these three factors were excluded, Ransom and Megdal (1993) showed the largest post-1976 salary gaps, 9.9 percent in 1977 and 9.0 percent in 1984. Barbezat (1989b) also measured a 9.0 percent gap when these controls were excluded.20 In contrast, Ashraf (1996), who controlled for all three factors, found no statistically significant salary gaps in his analyses of post-1977 data. Some studies have focused on the issue of family responsibilities, but the evidence appears to be mixed. Johnson and Stafford (1974)  10 6 cause of job interruptions, women tend to accumulate less human capital than men do.2' Similarly, Farber (1977) found that percentage increases in earnings for women faculty are lower than those for men only during childbearing years. However, Strober and Quester (1977) criticized Stafford and Johnson's interpretation of results, noting that the data they used do not include workforce interruptions. And Barbezat (1987) found that marital and parental variables do not have the predicted effect on female salaries. Some of the indirect evidence on the effects of marital and parental variables is also mixed. If family responsibilities cause workforce interruptions, marital and parental variables might explain higher female exit rates from the science and engineering professions. Preston (1994) found that marital and parental variables positively affect female exit rates but not enough to explain the gender differential.\" Table 3-2 summarizes estimates of earnings differentials derived from studies of single academic institu-tions. All but two of these studies found negative salary differentials for women. Koch and Chizmar (1976) found that women earned about one percent more than men in 1973 at one institution. Raymond et al. (1988) found no significant difference in salaries earned by men and women faculty at another institution in 1984. Both studies controlled for academic rank."}, {"section_title": "INSTITUTIONAL SAMPLES", "text": "The studies listed in Table 3-2 are arranged chronologically, but we caution against drawing inferences about trends in the gender gap over time. Variations in conditions across different institutions are likely to be large enough to distort changes that could be occurring over time. Megdal and Ransom (1985) studied data from the same institution at three points in time. They found negative salary differentials for women of 10.5, 6.3, and 9.5 percent in 1972, 1977, and 1982, respectively. We have also indicated in Table 3-2 whether the various studies controlled for academic rank, publications, or marital and parental variables. Again, however, we caution against drawing conclusions about how these control variables affect estimated earnings differentials, because of likely variations in conditions across institutions. There is substantial evidence that women, as a group, are underrepresented in senior academic ranks. The modeling issues discussed below should be considered when interpreting the results of empirical research on advancement to senior academic ranks."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "ies and include measures of human capital, measures of productivity, personal characteristics, and academic field."}, {"section_title": "HUMAN CAPITAL VARIABLES", "text": "The rationale for including human capital variables as controls in studies of academic rank (and tenure status) is similar to the rationale for their inclusion in salary studies.

SCHOLARLY PRODUCTIVITY In our review, studies that modeled scholarly productivity directly as an outcome found that, other things being the same, women faculty tend to publish less frequently than their male counterparts. Some of these differences might be explained by job selection and gender sorting by coauthors, as men and women tend to collaborate with coauthors of the same sex. With relatively few women faculty, it is more difficult for women to find collaborators."}, {"section_title": "EVIDENCE ON PUBLICATIONS BY GENDER", "text": "Several studies in our review modeled scholarly productivity as outcomes using national data, a broad range of academic fields, and controls for experience and a number of other factors that might affect publication rates. These studies found lower scholarly output among women faculty relative to their male counterparts. Hamovitch and Morgenstern (1977) used data from the Carnegie Council of Education to look at gender differences in the number of articles published.\" They controlled for several factors, including experience (years since earning the doctorate), hours spent teaching, and number of children in the family, and found that women publish about 20 percent fewer articles than do men. They found no statistically significant relationship between publications and the number of children in the family.29 Mathtech (1999) used data from the 1991, 1993, and 1995 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to study articles published and papers presented by scientists and engineers.30 After controlling for a variety of factors, including experience, academic field, kind of graduate support, marital status, number of children, and other personal characteristics, Mathtech found that women present about 1.2 fewer papers and publish about 1.4 fewer articles than do men. 29This finding is consistent with results reported by Cole and Zuckerman (1991), who found no difference in publication rates for single and married women. '\u00b0The Mathtech sample was restricted to doctorate recipients with eight or fewer years of experience and included individuals working outside of academia. Sonnert and Holton (1995) used a survey of former National Science Foundation and National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship recipients to measure gender differences in scholarly productivity. They found that women in their sample had about 0.5 fewer publications than men did, a statistically significant difference even after controlling for fields. Two studies focused on publication rates in the field of economics. Although the degree to which these results can be generalized to other fields is open to debate, these studies do shed light on differences in scholarly output between men and women faculty. Broder (1993) measured scholarship as the number of articles published in top economics journals. After controlling for experience, quality of the graduate school attended, and quality of the employing institution, she found that female academic economists publish about 1.9 fewer articles in top journals than their male counterparts. Koplin and Singell (1996) controlled for similar variables in their study, including quality of graduate education and current employer, but used a quality-weighted index of scholarly productivity instead of a simple count of articles published. The quality index was computed as the number of citations the journal received per article published times 1000. Koplin and Singell defined scholarly output as the sum of quality-weighted articles published. They found that, other things being the same, women's scholarly output is significantly higher than men's. Both the Broder and the Koplin and Singell studies are significant in that they controlled for the current employment situation of individuals in their analyses. Women tend to take jobs in less-prestigious institutions and jobs that stress teaching over research (see Section 2). Thus, Broder 's results imply that women tend to publish less than the men at comparable institutions do. Koplin and Singell, however, found that after adjusting for the quality of scholarship, women tend to be more productive than men at comparable institutions are.3'"}, {"section_title": "GENDER SORTING BY COAUTHORS", "text": "We reviewed two studies that focused on gender sorting by coauthors. Both found that men and women faculty tend to publish with coauthors of the same sex. Because both studies limited their samples to economists, generalization to other fields should be done cautiously. However, the findings of these studies are significant in that they suggest that coauthoring places women at a disadvantage in publishing. McDowell and Smith (1992) found a statistically significant propensity on the part of both male and female economists to coauthor. They also conducted a multivariate analysis of the decision to coauthor and found that women are less likely than men to coauthor. This finding, they argued, is likely the result of women finding it difficult to coauthor because of the relatively small proportion of women in the profession.\" McDowell and \"McDowell and Smith speculated that the coauthorship problem might cause women to seek jobs in larger departments with more women in an effort to find research partners. Smith concluded that the difficulty in finding coauthors poses a particular disadvantage for women, because their subsequent analysis showed that academic institutions tend to give single-authored and coauthored publications equal weight in promotion decisions. Like McDowell and Smith, Ferber and Teinman (1980) used a sample of economic journal articles to show a statistically significant tendency for coauthors to collaborate with the same sex. Ferber and Teinman also analyzed journal acceptance rates from a survey sponsored by the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. They found that when referees are blind to sex, articles submitted by women (either alone or with a male coauthor) have a significantly higher acceptance rate than articles submitted by men. However, when sex is known (or can be inferred from names), they found no statistically significant difference in acceptance rates. he National Science Foundation promotes and advances scientific progress in the United States by competitively awarding grants for research and education in the sciences, mathematics and engineering.
