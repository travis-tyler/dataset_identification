[{"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction 2014). The S protein initiates the receptor binding in the S1 subunit and S2 subunit that fuses and initiates the attachment to the host membrane. It is revealed that angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is one of the major binding receptors of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lungs, where it was dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in case of MERS-CoV (Guo et al., 2008; F. Li, 2016; W. Li et al., 2003; McBride et al., 2014; Mubarak et al., 2019) . The ACE2 receptor mainly expresses in the lung alveolar epithelial cells and its main function is to reduce the blood pressure through catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin-II. Once the protein is bound with the receptor the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells, which contains ORF1a and ORF1b genes. ORF1a and ORF1b genes produce pp1a and pp1b that use host ribosomes for the translation process. The process of PPs leads to the production of 16 NSPs and all these NSPs having the indistinct function in the host cells such as suppression of host gene expression, formulation of multi-domain complexes and some of them act as primase (Stobart et al., 2013; Te Velthuis et al., 2012) . M, E, and S proteins enter into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) complex and produce viral envelope. At the same time, the ribonucleic-protein formation will occur once the replicated genomes bind to the N protein. Once the virus particles came out from ERGIC, the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and releases of the virus particles into the extracellular region occur. Transition between a metastable prefusion state to a stable post-fusion state is triggered by the binding of spike protein with ACE2. Several researchers studied and reviewed the binding mechanism of spike protein with ACE2 receptor and screened small molecule and other inhibitors towards different targets (Boopathi et al., 2020; Brielle et al., 2020; Freitas et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Also, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) dynamics and development of inhibitor targeting the RBD domain (Tai et al., 2020) and suggested the potential role of the RBD domain towards the therapeutic development against SARS CoV2.\nProcyanidin is a member of proanthocyanidin that belongs to the class of flavonoids-the secondary metabolites of polyphenolic plant and fungus. Proanthocyanidins are the most abundant polyphenolic compounds after lignin (Souquet et al., 1996) . This oligomeric compound formed from catechin and epicatechin molecules that mainly found in apples, maritime pine bark, aronia fruits, cinnamon, and grapes (Pacheco-Palencia et al., 2008; Vivas et al., 2006; Yang & Xiao, 2013) . Though, the dietary content of procyanidin is not yet studied well. Some of the preliminary studies show the potential role of procyanidins a cardioprotective and anticancer agent (Bae et al., 2020) and the inhibition of ACE (Actis-Goretta et al., 2003) . The large growing scientific literature collection of COVID 19 requires automated approaches for a better understanding of the disease. Text mining is one of the prominently adopted approaches in both academia and industry to extract information from the collection of literature (Bhasuran et al., 2016; . In this big data era, text mining is increasingly applied in various streams of science and technology for hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery. The text mining approach is implemented to identify the important COVID 19 genes/proteins and the biological connections between them. Particularly text mining methodology has been adapted to find the role of highly studied COVID-19 genes/ proteins such as ACE2, NSP (1-10), Helicase, ORF, etc. To identify these genes/proteins and the biological interlink between them, a curated dictionary-based gene/protein entity mapping and co-occurrence-based text mining approach is performed on the COVID-19 scientific literature set.\nIn this study, we explored the potential role of procyanidin as a therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation methods. The selection of procyanidin is made through the screening of plant-based compounds collected from various literature along with the output from the literature mining. The proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 were identified through named entity recognition method and 24 proteins are selected from the result which shows the higher frequency of the threshold value. The protein structures were collected from PDB databank and modeled using homology modeling. The molecular docking was performed to assess the binding affinity of procyanidin with the selected proteins. Further, crucial proteins such as ACE2, Mpro, and spike that directly involved in the entry of SARSCoV2 are selected for the MD simulation to reveal the inhibition mechanism of procyanidin. The MM-PBSA method was adopted to decipher the binding energy of the procyanidin."}, {"section_title": "Text mining", "text": "The text mining pipeline employed in the current study follows as, COVID 19 literature data collection, named entity recognition of gene/proteins, gene-gene co-occurrence extraction, construction of a gene-gene interaction co-occurrence network and analysis."}, {"section_title": "COVID19 corpus", "text": "In the present study, we used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) (https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) downloaded on April 10 th , 2020 as the literature data source.

Centrality measures are used to identify the most important highly connected nodes within a graph. In the current study, three types of centrality measures such as closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality were calculated from the generated gene-gene interaction network. In general, closeness centrality searches for the shortest path between the nodes, betweenness centrality calculates a node ability to connect the shortest path between any two nodes, and eigenvector measures the influence of a node based on its connectivity in the network.

The hydrogen bonds between residues and procyanidin disrupt the normal structure of the proteins that fail the protein or enzyme to perform its native functions. The binding site of procyanidin with all proteins rich in hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction apart from conventional electrostatic and van der walls interactions. Among the 24 screened proteins we have considered ACE2, Mpro, and spike protein separately as it is the crucial proteins that directly linked to the entry of SARS-CoV-2.

The higher number of these interactions depicts the strong affinity of procyanidin with ACE2. The residues Asn394, Gly395, Ser43, Leu351, Met62, Ser47, Asn51, His378, Ala348, Trp69, and Leu391 shows van der Waals interaction with the oxygen atom and the benzene ring of the procyanidin at the binding site.

The procyanidin bound ACE2 shows an average backbone fluctuation of 0.4 nm whereas the apo structure shows 0.2 nm. The Mpro and spike proteins show an average of 0.3 and 0.19 nm in backbone RMSD whereas procyanidin bound form shows an average of 0.4 nm with the highest fluctuation at 0.9 nm for Mpro and 0.6 nm for spike protein. The higher fluctuation of the protein while interacting with procyanidin indicates its lower stability that will lead to the non-functional state of the protein. It is essential to maintain the native structure of the ACE2 receptor for the strong attachment of spike protein and further progression of the virus replication. To understand the essential dynamics of these proteins we have performed the principal component analysis of Ca atoms from the 100 ns simulation trajectories. The PCA based Ca atoms of the proteins represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that is argued by its coincident eigenvalues and total concerted motion of the protein. As a result, the PCA based RMSF calculation help to reveal the dynamics of the critical residues that take part in the inhibition of the protein. The PC1's and PC2's of three proteins show lower fluctuations at the native form than the procyanidin-bound state (Figure 7) . The higher RMSF fluctuation of residues at the binding site indicates the conformational changes of the residues that destabilize the protein from its native structure.

Here, the starting frame and last frame of the simulation shows the presence of hydrogen bond which stabilize the procyanidin at the binding site. Further, the interaction energy such as electrostatic and van der Waals at the binding site have been calculated from the simulation trajectories (Figure 8c &d) . The van der Waals interaction energy is dominant at the binding site of all proteins than electrostatic interaction energy. ACE2 shows an average of \u00c0145.06 kJ/ mol and \u00c078.51 kJ/mol of van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energy respectively.

The time-dependent transformation of the secondary structure of the proteins shown in Figure 5 of supporting information.\nThe transformation between residues in the range of 40-50, 280-350, and 400-410 indicates the binding site where these residues are directly interacting with the proteins which are consistent with the principal components' analysis. The secondary structure of the protein is a key factor that controls the function of the proteins or enzymes. The transformations of the secondary structure are directly correlated to the functional changes of the proteins.

The backbone RMSD matrix of all the protein shows a significant deviation from the apostate to the procyanidin-bound state. The red color indicates the shorter distances between backbone atoms and blue color indicates the larger distances equivalent to 0.54 nm. When the procyanidin interacts with the protein blue color appeared on the matrix map is an indication of the larger pairwise distance between the backbone atoms. Further, we have superimposed the tertiary structure of the protein in both apo and bound state and observed the transformation from its initial frame (Figure 9 , 10, 11 c& d). The first frame to the last frame of ACE2 apo shows a 0.3 nm of RMSD over all atoms. Whereas, apo to bound state and first frame-of bound state to the last frame shows an RMSD of 0.5 nm and 0.45 nm respectively.
