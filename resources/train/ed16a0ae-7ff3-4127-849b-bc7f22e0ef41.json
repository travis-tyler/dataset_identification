At least 20% of all FTLD presents as a dominantly inherited familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (f-FTLD), usually because of mutations in the MAPT [3] , progranulin (GRN) [4] , or chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) [5, 6] S. McGinnis has served as an investigator for clinical trials sponsored by AbbVie, Allon Therapeutics, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, C2N Diagnostics, Eisai Inc, Eli Lilly and Co, Genentech, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Medivation, Merck, Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Novartis, Pfizer, and TauRx Therapeutics. He receives research support from the NIH. R. Pearlman is employed by the Bluefield Project. R. Rademakers together account for at least 50% of f-FTLD [7] [8] [9] . Because each mutation is highly predictive of a specific proteinopathy, the study of f-FTLD mutation carriers has the unique opportunity to provide specific biochemical targets in clinical drug studies. In addition, f-FTLD is currently the only practical way to identify people in asymptomatic or very early symptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), making it the best context for testing drugs aimed at delaying symptom onset. To prepare for disease-modifying trials, it is important to establish the natural history of f-FTLD and provide clinical and biomarker data for planning these studies, particularly in the asymptomatic phase. The rates of clinical and biomarker change in f-FTLD are complex and dynamic (Fig. 1 ). The alterations in the molecular biology of tau, progranulin and the granulins, C9RAN proteins, and so forth, undoubtedly occur early in life during the presymptomatic phase. As neuronal and/or glial dysfunction evolves, changes in neuronal networks occur over an acceleration phase, which can be demonstrated on neuroimaging measures, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes likely preceding structural MRI changes. Various other ancillary studies, including behavioral measures, neuropsychological measures, motor measures, and so forth, likely show the evolution of clinically silent to very minimally evident cognitive, behavioral, or motor changes over the several years of transitional period from presymptomatic to prodromal to minimally symptomatic phases of f-FTLD. MRI-based and other imaging measures likely change over this transitional period also. Additional changes occur with the onset of overt symptoms and continue onward through the mild, moderate, severe, and terminal phases of the symptomatic period-the latter aspects likely evolve in a decelerated manner. This hypothesized cascade of dynamic changes is analogous to what has been proposed in the evolution of Alzheimer's disease [10, 11] .\nAlthough there are growing data that support the cascade of events and findings just described [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , many of the findings are based on cross-sectional analyses, and few longitudinal data have been published thus far. Also many questions remain. How does one predict the onset of symptoms and rate of progression? What dictates the initial seed of neuronal dysfunction and hence the constellation of early features and evolving neuronal network dysfunction and associated clinical phenomenology over time? Why do some mutation carriers develop symptoms early in life whereas others never develop symptoms (i.e., incomplete penetrance)? Longitudinal evaluations of a large number of individuals in families with known mutations, followed prospectively in a standardized and comprehensive manner, offer the best hope of providing insights to these and other questions while also informing investigators how to optimally design clinical trials.\nWe sought to address many of these questions as part of the Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial Frontotempo-ral Dementia Subjects (LEFFTDS) protocol (UO1 AG045390). We describe herein the design and methodology of the LEFFTDS protocol. The initial baseline characteristics and analyses and other topics will be reported separately."}, {"section_title": "Objectives/aims", "text": "The specific aims/objectives of the LEFFTDS protocol are as follows: Note that the term \"asymptomatic\" is preferred over \"presymptomatic\" in the context of these LEFFTDS aims because there is incomplete penetrance across all three major genetic groups."}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "The overall schema for the LEFFTDS protocol is shown in Fig. 2 . The project is designed to enroll at least 300 subjects from families with f-FTLD into a longitudinal clinical and biomarker study. The subjects are recruited based on the interest of potential participants, with the expectation that enrollment will transpire in an approximately even fashion across kindreds with mutations in three most common genes associated with f-FTLD: MAPT (n 5 100), GRN (n 5 100), and C9orf72 (n 5 100). Our goal was to recruit approximately equal numbers of symptomatic mutation carriers, asymptomatic mutation carriers, and noncarriers (i.e., familial control subjects). At least three annual assessments (henceforth termed \"visits\") for each subject are planned for a period of more than this 5-year phase of the study. Each visit includes a clinical assessment, biofluid sampling with blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and MRI; CSF collection is optional. The clinical data are entered into an electronic data capture system (via the iMedidata RAVE system, Houston, TX). Most of these data are collected using measures in the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and FTLD Module of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), and these data are uploaded to NACC at the University of Washington. Blood and CSF are collected and sent to the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) at Indiana University. Aliquots of DNA, plasma, and CSF are sent to LEFFTDS-associated laboratories for genotyping and protein quantification. Brain MRI is performed using a standardized protocol similar to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative version 3 (ADNI-3) protocol. The data are transferred to the Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) at the University of Southern California, and downloaded and assessed at Mayo Clinic Rochester for quality review. All data and samples are available to internal and external investigators. The overarching design of the LEFFTDS protocol is to address the specific aims and to provide clinical, biofluid and neuroimaging samples, and data to investigators. More details on this infrastructure and procedures are described subsequently.\nA summary of the procedures for each visit is shown in Fig. 3 . The procedures can be viewed as five arms-clinical, biofluid-blood, MRI, biofluid-CSF, and genetic testing. Each visit includes, at a minimum, the clinical evaluation, blood draw, and MRI scanning; the CSF arm and genetic testing arms are optional. A genetic evaluation for counseling with or without genetic testing is available for any subject who desires it.\nThe key ratings for the assessment team include the CDR and the NACC FTLD Module scale [28] (which is a modification of the standard CDR Dementia Staging Instrument [64]-more details on these scales are given subsequently), neuropsychological data, the consensus clinical diagnostic assessment, and the confidence rating. The measures used in the diagnostic ratings and assessments are shown in Fig. 4 and Tables 2 and 3 .\nTo broaden the utility of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (which is now known as the CDR Staging Instrument and will be abbreviated as CDR hereafter) into FTLD spectrum disorders, the Behavior/Comportment/Personality and Language domains were added to the CDR to form the eight-domain \"FTLD-CDR.\" The older terminology FTLD-CDR represented the exact same group of measures now used by the updated name of \"CDR Dementia Staging Instrument plus NACC FTLD Module Behavior and Language domains (CDR plus NACC FTLD). Because the CDR is now trademarked, this updated abbreviation for the eight-domain ratings was proposed by the developers of CDR and the NACC FTLD Module, and all references to this combination of measures will be abbreviated \"CDR plus NACC FTLD\" henceforth in this article.\nA foundation of the LEFFTDS protocol is the rating of each subject as normal or not, and if not normal, how severely abnormal (questionable, mild, moderate, severe) each subject is. The CDR scale, adapted more for FTLD spectrum cases to represent the CDR plus NACC FTLD scale, was determined to be the initial benchmark.\nThe six domain CDR has functioned very well in the AD clinical spectrum. Two additional domains were added as part of the FTLD Module-Behavior/Comportment and Language-but these ratings are viewed separately from the six domains and have not been incorporated into an FTLD-specific global score. Motor dysfunction as seen in FTD with parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also important in the clinical and functional assessment of FTLD subjects, requiring a motor domain to be designed-this is under development at the time of this writing.\nAnother key aspect of FTLD characterization, particularly in the early phenoconversion transition from normal to minimally symptomatic, is to determine the drivers of change. One could hypothesize that for some syndromes (e.g., bvFTD), the data from the informant's interview may be more informative than the data from the subject's interview and neurologic examination and the traditional neuropsychological data. For other syndromes (e.g., PPA), the data from the subject's interview and examination as well as the language-based neuropsychological data would be most informative. To capture these scenarios to test hypotheses, it would be important to analyze A/L, UDS XAMINER battery* [36] A/L, FTLD Language Semantic Fluency-fruits and vegetables [34] A/L, UDS Verbal Fluency-Phonemic Test [34] A/L, UDS Multilingual Naming Test [37] A/L, UDS Semantic Associates (Northwestern Naming Battery)* A/L, FTLD Regular and Irregular Word Reading (Hopkins Experimental Battery)* A/L, FTLD Action Naming (Northwestern Naming Battery)* A/L, FTLD Northwestern Anagram test* A/L, FTLD Sentence reading (Hopkins Experimental Battery)* A/L, FTLD Sentence repetition (Hopkins Experimental Battery)* A/L, FTLD Learning and memory Craft Story [34] A/L, UDS California Verbal Learning Test [38] A/L, FTLD Benson figure recall [39] A/L, UDS Visuospatial Benson figure copy [39] A/L, UDS Behavioral measures Depression Geriatric Depression Scale [40] A/L, UDS Neuropsychiatric Neuropsychiatric Inventory Q [41] A/L, UDS Social\nBehavioral Inhibition Scale* [42] A/L, FTLD Interpersonal Reactivity Index* [43] A/L, FTLD Revised Self-monitoring Scale* [44] A/L, FTLD Social Norms Questionnaire* A/L, FTLD Social Behavior Observer Checklist* A/L, FTLD Neurologic disorder-focused Parkinsonism UPDRS-motor subtest [ data based on (1) interactions with and measures completed by the clinician with the subject, (2) interactions with and measures completed by the informant, and (3) the neuropsychological assessment. Furthermore, attempts should be made to complete these ratings as independently as is feasible. Finally, a consensus rating considering all data would be the key classification for determining the clinical status at any given visit. It would also be possible for investigators to go back and analyze data from different rating streams to earlier visits to determine which data were optimally predictive of phenoconversion."}, {"section_title": "Recruitment", "text": "The subjects are recruited from subjects/kindreds already identified at the collaborating centers.

Each informant is also interviewed. The data, measures , and databases where the data are stored are summarized in Table 1 .\nMost of the subject-based and informant-based questionnaires/measures are administered by a trained study coordinator who is experienced in assessing FTLD subjects. All measures are completed in-person with subjects and informants whenever possible; when this is not feasible (i.e., insufficient time during the scheduled in-person visit, informant not present), then measures are completed by telephone. The standard medical/neurologic interview and examination is completed face-to-face by a clinician experienced in FTLD, which is usually the site Principal Investigator (PI). The clinician interviews the informant in person or by telephone whenever feasible. The neuropsychological battery is administered by a trained psychometrist who is experienced in assessing FTLD subjects.\nMost of the data are collected using measures developed by the NACC UDS Task Force, which comprise the UDS version 3.0 (UDS 3.0) [48] . Although the UDS measures have been applicable to subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a variety of dementia syndromes, the focus over many years was on subjects with MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. To support FTLD research, the NIA and NINDS jointly funded the FTLD Module Task Force, which led to the creation of the measures expanding the characterization of the cognitive, behavioral, language, and motor features typical of FTLD spectrum disorders. More information on UDS 3.0, the FTLD Module, and other aspects of NACC can be found at https://www.alz.washington.edu/.\nBoth the LEFFTDS and ARTFL protocols were designed to develop methodology and infrastructure to prepare for therapeutic trials in FTLD. Some measures were therefore added to both protocols to supplement the UDS and FTLD Module-these are designated as being only in the ARTFL/LEFFTDS (A/L) database in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Clinical ratings and diagnoses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CDR plus NACC FTLD", "text": "There are two scores that are generated as part of the CDR plus NACC FTLD scoring system-the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score and the CDR plus NACC FTLD sum of the boxes. For the CDR plus NACC FTLD sum of the boxes score, the value is determined by simply adding all eight of the domain scores.\nThe global CDR plus NACC FTLD is more complex. First, it does NOT follow the standard CDR algorithm. For example, if there are one or more scores of 0.5 in the nonmemory domains of the standard CDR, the global score may still be 0; this standard CDR algorithm was developed to emphasize the importance of at least mild memory impairment for the global value of the standard CDR to be .0 for those with suspected AD pathology. Because the earliest manifestations of evolving FTLD are usually nonmemory, the CDR plus NACC FTLD does not require memory impairment to score .0-any domain score .0 will result in a global score .0. The guidelines of the CDR plus NACC FTLD global score are therefore as follows:\n1. If all domains are 0, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 0. 2. If the maximum domain score is 0.5, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 0.5. 3. If the maximum domain score is .0.5 in any domain, then the following applies: If the maximum domain score is 1 and all other domains are 0, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 0.5. If the maximum domain score is 2 or 3 and all other domains are 0, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 1.\nIf the maximum domain score occurs only once, and there is another rating besides zero, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is one level lower than the level corresponding to maximum impairment (e.g., if maximum 5 2, and there is another rating besides zero, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 1; if maximum 5 1, and there is another rating besides zero, the global CDR plus NACC FTLD score is 0.5).

Note that the \"CDR\" in this A/L FTLD-CDR classification scheme represents a more broad clinical dementia rating perspective. The criteria for this A/L FTLD-CDR classification are as follows.\nA/L FTLD-CDR 5 0-asymptomatic: These subjects have (1) normal cognitive, behavioral/comportment and language functioning based on the absence of subjective complaints of cognitive, behavioral, and language changes from their baseline, (2) a global CDR plus NACC FTLD score of 0, and (3) cognitive/behavioral/language functioning based on a normal neurologic examination and performance on neuropsychological and behavioral measures within normal limits.\nA/L FTLD-CDR 5 0.5-questionably/minimally symptomatic: These subjects generally have (1) a questionable or mild change in cognitive, behavioral, or language functioning based on the subject and/or informant, (2) a global CDR plus NACC FTLD score of 0.5, (3) a mild degree of impairment in cognitive/behavioral/language functioning based on neurologic examination and/or neuropsychological and behavioral measures, and (4) does not fulfill established criteria for probable bvFTD, PPA, or another defined neurodegenerative disorder.\nA/L FTLD-CDR 5 1-definitely and mildly symptomatic: These subjects generally have (1) at least mild change in cognitive, behavioral, or language functioning based on the subjects and/or informant, (2) a global CDR plus NACC FTLD score of 1, and (3) at least mild degree of impairment in cognitive/behavioral/language functioning based on neurologic examination and/or neuropsychological and behavioral measures, and (4) does fulfill established criteria bvFTD, PPA, or another defined neurodegenerative disorder.\nA/L FTLD-CDR.1-definitely and moderately to severely symptomatic: Subjects with moderate severity dementia (or moderate degree of neurologic impairment associated with another defined neurodegenerative disorder) plus a moderate degree of dependency on caregiver 1/2 devices would be classified as FTLD-CDR 5 2, and those with severe dementia (or severe degree of neurologic impairment associated with another defined neurodegenerative disorder) plus near complete or complete dependency on caregiver 1/2 devices would be classified as FTLD-CDR 5 3.\nAtypical cases: Any subjects who do not fulfill any set of criteria as stated previously are classified in the most appropriate A/L FTLD-CDR category (e.g., a subject who fulfills criteria (1) and (2) for A/L FTLD-CDR 5 0.5 but has a normal neurologic examination and normal neuropsychological scores will be classified as A/L FTLD-CDR 5 0.5 because this designation best approximates the criteria."}, {"section_title": "Clinicogenetic classification", "text": "The clinical classification scheme described previously was designed to be paired with the genetic status of any subjects, such that the presence (1m) or absence (2m) of a mutation is followed by the clinical code (e.g., 1mFTLD-CDR 5 0 for asymptomatic mutation carrier).

We have therefore chosen to use the term \"MCI-behavior\" and purposefully use this diagnosis loosely, because there are no operational criteria for this presumed intermediate stage in the normal to bvFTD evolution.\nA reasonable application of the MCI-behavior diagnosis would be in the setting of any patient who exhibits features and findings consistent with clinically possible bvFTD using the Consensus criteria (see subsequently) [65] . In other words, the presence of one or more of the following would be fitting for MCI behavior:\nDisinhibition: Socially inappropriate behavior; loss of manners or decorum; impulsive, rash, or careless actions. Apathy or inertia: Loss of interest, drive, and motivation; decreased initiation of behavior. Loss of sympathy/empathy: Diminished response to other people's needs or feelings; diminished social interest, interrelatedness, or personal warmth. Ritualistic/compulsive behavior: Simple repetitive movements or complex compulsive or ritualistic behaviors. Hyperorality and appetite changes: Altered food preferences, binge eating, increased consumption of alcohol or cigarettes, oral exploration, or consumption of inedible objects Importantly, particularly in familial FTD, there are circumstances in which delusions, hallucinations, and other forms of odd behavior may be part of the evolving behavioral phenotype.

Depending on the analysis of interest, the 1mFTLD-CDR . 0 group can be further subclassified as 1mFTLD-CDR 5 0.5, 1mFTLD-CDR 5 1, 1mFTLD-CDR 5 2, and 1mFTLD-CDR 5 3.\nAn obvious tenet to the LEFFTDS approach is ensuring confidentiality and blinding. For those subjects who undergo the clinical genetic testing arm of the protocol, when they can share the results of testing with any of the research staff with whom they come in contact, this process is not encouraged so as to promote blinding of the study staff. For those subjects who do not wish to undergo clinical genetic testing, all research staff who may interact with the subjects or their relatives must remain blind to the genetic test results, which are performed for the purposes of the protocol. The research genetic testing is performed at University of California, Los Angeles, and the results for each subject based on their subject code (but not name or other identifying information) are uploaded into a secure database."}, {"section_title": "Accessing data and/or samples", "text": "The schema for accessing data and/or samples is shown in Fig. 2 . The clinical data (which includes neuropsychological data) can be accessed via two mechanisms-the A/L database management system (RAVE) or the NACC; note that the data in the A/L RAVE system include more measures and can also potentially be attached to genetic and biofluid data if desired. The process for requesting data is explained at the web site https://ucsf.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/ SV_e4BBGMiXV7HRTg1. The data requests are reviewed by committee and adjudicated in a timely fashion, and data are provided in a secure manner after all vetting and confidentiality measures are satisfied. Clinical data focused on UDS 3.0 and FTLD Module measures can be requested at NACC at the web site https://www.alz.washington.edu/.\nSamples can be requested by accessing the NCRAD web site and following all procedures as described at the web site https://ncrad.iu.edu/accessing_data.html. A minimum data set of clinical and genetic information can be attached to each sample. If more detailed clinical and/or imaging data are desired in addition to samples, then the following web site should also be accessed: https://ucsf.co1.qualtrics.com/ jfe/form/SV_e4BBGMiXV7HRTg1. The sample request and approval processes are similar to those regarding the clinical 1/2 genetic data. Samples are provided to investigators in a blinded manner, in which the investigator is expected to submit all findings derived from his/her analyses for incorporation into the full A/L database. Additional aspects on this process are explained at these web sites and associated links.\nMRI scan data can be accessed as described on the LONI web site: http://www.loni.usc.edu/. There is a QC file associated with each scan. A minimum data set of clinical and genetic information is also attached to each scan. If more detailed clinical and/or genetic data are desired in addition to scans, then the following web site should also be accessed: https://ucsf.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/ SV_e4BBGMiXV7HRTg1. Additional aspects on this process are explained at these web sites and associated links."}, {"section_title": "Future considerations", "text": "The methods and processes described herein will surely undergo evolution in the future. Updates will be maintained in the web site (under construction). The LEFFTDS protocol is also similar in many ways to the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative study in Europe and Canada, and attempts to harmonize many aspects of LEFFTDS and Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative will continue for the years ahead."}]
