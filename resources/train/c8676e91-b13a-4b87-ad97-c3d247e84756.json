[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Background. Statistics have gained a lot in reputation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost everybody on this globe follows numbers and studies \"the curve\"on recorded cases, on daily increases or on incidences of CoV-2 infections.\nThe open question. What do these numbers mean? What does it mean that we talk about \"a second wave\"? Intuitive interpretations of \"the curve\" suggest that the higher the number of new infections, say in a country, the more severe the epidemic is in this country. Is this interpretation correct? When the number of infections increases, decision makers start to discuss additional or tougher public health measures. Is this policy approach appropriate?\nOur message. Reported numbers of CoV-2 infections are probably not comparable over time. When public health authorities report x new cases on some day in October 2020, these x new cases do not have the same meaning as x new cases in April, May or June 2020. The bias results from di\u00a4erent testing rules that are applied simultaneously. Private and public decision making should not be based on time series of CoV-2-infections as the latter do not provide information about the true epidemic dynamics in a country. If the reason for testing was known, a unbiased measure of the severity of an epidemic could be computed easily.\nOur framework. We present a theoretical framework that allows one to understand the link between testing and the number of reported infections. We extend the classic SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927, Hethcote, 2000) to allow for asymptomatic cases and for testing. 2 Our fundamental assumption states that the true numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals are not observed.\nResults. The reason for the intertemporal bias consists in relative changes of test regimes. If a society always employed only one rule when tests are taken, e.g. \"test for SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a certain set of symptoms\", then infection numbers would be comparable over time. If tests are undertaken simultaneously, e.g. \"test in the presence of symptoms\"but also \"test travellers without symptoms\", and the relative frequency of tests changes, a comparison of the number of reported infections over time bears no meaning. The paper illustrates the bias by a \"second wave\"in reported cases which -by true epidemiological dynamics -is not a second wave.\nUnderstanding this bias also provides an answer to one of the most frequently asked question when it comes to understanding reported infection numbers: What is the role of testing? Do we observe a lot of reported infections only because we test a lot? Should we believe claims such as \"if we test half as much, we have half as many cases\". This paper will provide a precise answer to what extent the reported number of infections is determined by the number of tests in a causal sense. The answer in a nutshell: If tests are undertaken because of symptoms, there is no causal e\u00a4ect from the number of tests on the number of reported infections. If tests are undertaken for other reasons (travellers, representative testing), the number of reported infections go up simply because there is more testing. 3 We show that time series on the number of tests and time series on reported infections do not allow one to obtain information about the true state of an epidemic. We also study the positive rate as the ratio of the number of positive tests to the total number of tests. The positive rate is informative if we undertook representative testing only. The positive rate is not informative about true epidemiological dynamics when there are several reasons for testing.\nUnderstanding the biases also allows us to understand how to correct for it. The paper presents a severity index for an epidemic that is unbiased. One can obtain this index in two ways: Record the reason why a test was undertaken or count only the Covid-19 cases. Such an index should be used when thinking about relaxing or reimposing public health measures. Testing is important for detecting infectious individuals, counting Covid-19 cases is important for private and public decision making.\nStructure of paper. The next section presents the model. Section 3 shows biased and unbiased measures of the true but unobserved dynamics of an epidemic. It also studies the (lack of) informational content of time series on reported infections and time series on the number of tests, and the properties of the positive rate.

Let us now describe how we can understand (unobserved) epidemiological dynamics. We start with some initial condition forS (t).

Initially, there are very few infectious individuals, say, there are two,\u0128 symp (t) =\u0128 asymp (t) = 1: Given infection rates (6a) and (6b) and parameters, the number of infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic cases evolves according to (4) and (5). 6 The model neglects the e\u00a4ect of quarantine. If infectious individuals know about their status and therefore stay in quarantine, they should be removed from\u0128 (t) or at least get a lower weight in (6).\nInfectious individuals are removed from being infectious at a rate : 7 The number of susceptible individuals follows (1).\nThe epidemic is over with herd immunity, i.e.S = 0 at some point (far in the future) or when recovery is su\u00a2 ciently fast relative to in \u2021ows such that\u0128 = 0: 8 The epidemic is heading towards an end when d dt\u0128 symp (t) < 0 and d dt\u0128 asymp (t) < 0; i.e. the number of infectious individuals falls. 9 We abstract from public health measures and their e\u00a4ects (as studied e.g. by Dehning et al., 2020 or Donsimoni et al., 2020a .

Unfortunately, this classi\u2026cation does not relate to the reason for testing and the latter is required to infer the true infection dynamics.\nWhat should be done to quantify the relevance of the bias? Local health authorities in Germany collect the names of individuals with con\u2026rmed CoV-2 infections. If additional information on symptoms, that is already being collected (the reporting form 20 allows for ticks on fever, coughing and the like), was made available to the public or scientists, the bias could be computed easily. 21 We currently know Covid-19 cases for intensive care in hospitals, but this data is not yet easily accessible (see https://www.intensivregister.de). While only a fraction of Covid-19 cases ends up in intensive care, this number might be more informative than CoV-2 infections. The number of deaths associated with Covid-19 is a further measure as would be excess mortality. While these are only partial measures of Covid-19 dynamics, Covid-19 measures (positive CoV-2 tests with symptoms, number of all Covid-19 patients in hospitals, not just intensive care) would provide a better basis for regional and local decision makers than CoV-2 infection measures.\nIf one day we know how strong the quantitative bias is, we could now hope that the bias is small. Then the guidance given to society by the focus on CoV-2 infections would have been correct. But even with a small bias, the focus on CoV-2 infections should stop. We know that it is not the perfect measure. It rather biases expectation building (and emotional reactions) of individuals. Hence, as soon as better Covid-19 measures are available, the CoV-2 measure should be replaced. The candidates are estimates of informative positive rates and (regional) time series on Covid-19 cases (and not CoV-2 infections). This would allow local politicians to base their decisions on intertemporally informative data, i.e. on local Covid-19 cases."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "True epidemic dynamics are unobserved. No country, no health authority and no scientist knows the true number of CoV-2 infections with or without symptoms for a given country. This is why testing is undertaken. Testing is a means to measure true but unobserved epidemic dynamics. The counted number of CoV-2 infections are not relevant for decision making, what matters is the true number of CoV-2 infections. Infections and the corresponding disease spreads when the true number of infections is high, not when the counted number of infections is high.\nWe extend the classic SIR model to take symptomatic and asymptomatic cases into account. More importantly, we treat CoV-2 infections as unobserved in the SIR model and model testing. We allow for various reasons for testing and focus on testing due to symptoms, representative testing and testing travellers. Testing travellers is an example of non-representative and nonsymptom related testing and includes the testing of sports professionals, in retirement homes or their visitors, in hot spots or contact persons of infected individuals.\nWe show that the presence of various reasons for testing biases the number of con\u2026rmed CoV-2 infections over time. The number of CoV-2 infections cannot be compared intertemporally. We might observe more CoV-2 infections today simply because we test more. However, the true number of infections might stay constant or even fall.\nWe do not claim, in any sense, that our \u2026ndings have empirical relevance. We simply do not know, at least given the data that are easily accessible to the public and given the data everybody observes (number of tests and number of reported infections) and on which all public health decisions are based, what the true epidemic dynamic is. We all look at a watch and we know that it is wrong. But we do not know how much it is wrong. It may be seconds, but it can also be hours.\nWhat are the positive lessons from this analysis? We propose an index which is unbiased over time. It is deceptively simple. Count the number of Covid-19 cases, not the number of CoV-2 infections. If we knew the number of Covid-19 cases, i.e. CoV-2 infections with severe acute respiratory symptoms (SARS), then we would know at least one part of epidemic dynamics (\u0128 symp (t) in our model).\nLet us stress that our \u2026ndings are not an argument against testing. Testing is important for identifying infectious individuals. They need to stay in quarantine in order to prevent the further spread of CoV-2 infections. This helps to reduce Covid-19 cases. Testing is important -but adding up con\u2026rmed infections from all sorts of tests is misleading. As long as the public focuses on all sources of positive cases, decisions by private individuals, \u2026rms, journalists, scientists and politicians are badly informed. Emotions, decisions and behaviour are misguided. This cannot be good for public health. Decisions must be based on the number of Covid-19 cases."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": ".
