[{"section_title": "", "text": "like SARS-CoV, including S, E, M, five accessory proteins listed as ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and ORF8b, N proteins and 16 NSP (NSP1-NSP16) [34] . SARS-CoV and newly appeared COVID-19 are the members of the same beta coronavirus subgroup, they only have 70% similarity at the genome level, and interestingly the novel group has been found to be genetically different from SARS-CoV [35] . This isolated novel \u00df-coronavirus, like other typical coronaviruses, has different ORFs (at least ten). ORF1a/b, as the first one, can be recognized about 75% of viral RNA, which is used for the production of two large poly-proteins. The complex of viral replicase transcriptase is formed by pp1a and pp1ab poly-proteins in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV due to processing into 16nsp1-nsp16 [36] .\nThe nsp proteins mediate the rearrangement of membranes originated from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in vesicles with double-membrane formation where viral replication and transcription occur [37, 38] . While SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 also called CD26) is the target of MERS-S via the RBD in the Nterminal surface subunit (S1). The molecular interaction of MERS-CoV with hCD26 has been delineated. The S1 domain is responsible for the detection of hCD26, situated in a C-terminal 240residue RBD with a core and an external subdomain [39] . It was reported that the binding of the surface S1 unit facilitates the attachment of the virus to the surface of target host cells.\nAdditionally, S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2 site is linked to priming processes through cellular proteases, which entails virus fusion and cellular membranes, driven via the S2 subunit.\nEngagement of ACE2 by SARS-S as the entry receptor [40] leads to the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 employment for priming of S protein [41, 42] .\nThe functional characterization and defined antigenicity of S protein make this protein an important target for vaccine development [43] . The 3D structure of the RBD region in the S protein regulates the formation of the van der Waals forces [24] . It is reported that Lys 31 residue can be critically recognized on the human ACE2 receptor by 394 Glu residue in the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 [44] . Briefly, after receptor attachment, the S protein undergoes a conformation change, which facilitates the fusion of viral envelope with the cell membrane via the endosomal pathway, resulting in the RNA release of SARS-CoV-2 into the target cells. Genome RNA is initially translated into the polyproteins of viral replicase (pp1a and 1ab), then can be cleaved into small fragments by viral proteinases. Discontinuous transcription of polymerase activity could lead to the production of different subgenomic mRNAs that can be translated later to the viral proteins.\nFinally, viral proteins and RNAs assembling into virions in the Golgi and ER organelles stimulates the transportation of vesicles to release [45] ."}, {"section_title": "Innate immunity", "text": "The launch response of the immune system to the invading of a microorganism such as a virus is directly related to the host sensing of the target organism and its linked constituents like uncapped viral RNA or the cellular stress response and consequent biological changes or damages due to infection [46] . This response could be primarily conducted by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) or Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like from the components receptors (RLRs) that enable to detect PAMPs (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns) originated of a virus or its replication intermediates, promoting the initial antiviral signaling cascades in response to the infection ( Figure 2 ) [47] . RLRs has known RNA sensors that are localized in the cytosol include three main members: laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), RIG-I, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5).\nRLRs are the essential sensors for virus infections that mediate effectively the transcriptional induction of various genes associated with the antiviral response of the host and type I interferons [48] . More interestingly, these sensors not only able to recognize viral RNAs but also the mislocalized or misprocessed cellular RNAs (unusual forms). Such unusual cellular RNAs processing or localization could potentially indicate the infection or possible occurrence of sterile inflammatory pathologies; therefore, the activation of RLRs is crucial in immunopathology concept [49] . MDA5, and RIG-I, as Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs), are mainly transcribed during the infection of the cells by SARS-CoV under in vitro condition. It is reported that Murine coronavirus (MHV) could be detected by MDA5 in microglial cells and brain macrophages, and in oligodendrocyte cells, by MDA5 and RIG-I. Though it has not been identified yet whether SARS-CoV infection can be recognized by MHV or RLRs, SARS-CoV is more likely to have similar intermediates for the replication process, as putative ligands for RLRs sensors; therefore, SARS-CoV is able to be potentially recognized by the same protocoles [47] .\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) as one of the PRRs, could be expressed by several types of immune cells. [50] . TLRs can be expressed either extracellular such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 on the surface of the cells or intracellular like TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in the cytosolic compartment, where they detect the genetic material of microorganisms [51] .\nViruses are mainly characterized based on the complexity of their genomes and also divided according to their replication mechanism (Baltimore classification). The nucleic acid sequence of viral genomes could have consisted of either RNA or DNA, single-stranded or double-stranded, continuous or segmented, and negative or positive in polarity [52, 53] .\nThough there is no proof for the direct implication of TLR in SARS-CoV detection, it was reported that TLR4 could potentially detect the viral related glycoproteins of RSV presented mainly on the lung epithelium's surface cells as an essential cofactor for the entrance of respiratory viruses. It has also been identified that TLR4 plays as a protective factor against the activity of MHV-1 in an animal investigation model for SARS-respiratory disease. Further studies also reported that by the injection of MA15-SARS-CoV to a mouse model and human dendritic cells, the transcriptional level of TLRs increased. Additionally, TLR3 activation plays a protective effect in the infected mouse model by SARS-CoV.\nRNA viruses can be internalized into the cells via different mechanisms, including binding to the surface receptors, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV or CEACAM1 for MHV and plasma fusion. This internalization process could expose the viral genomic (RNA) to the dsRNA sensing system (MDA5, TLR3, and RIGI) in the cells. These proteins could induce IFNb and the production of IFN\u03b2 protein through initiating of the IRF-3 cascade signaling. IFN\u03b2 protein can bind INFAR1\n(IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors) on the surface of the surrounding or same cells, activating the signaling pathway of Stat1 that is associated with the activation of several anti-viral genes with ISRE promoter. This could raise a question that how coronaviruses, either human(OC43, NL63, SARS-CoV, and 229E) or animal (MHV, IBV, and TGEV), interact with the IFN system (type I) [54] . Antiviral cytokine IFN not only has a vital role in controlling many viral infections but also they could promote the process of viral clearance through programing of the adaptive immune response.\nHowever, the aberrant response of IFN, cytokine, and ISGs was recognized in those patients suffering from an advanced level of SARS disease compared to the healthy group with innate immune regulated SARS disease [54, 55] .\nSeveral reports indicate that IFN (Type I) could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV in the cell culture and also the viral replication process in different animal models such as a mouse or cynomolgus macaques. Further investigations confirm that the SARS-CoV-infected animal model with a deficiency in IFN receptors such as Type I or Type III show more advanced stages in the replication process of viruses, particularly in the lungs. The expression of IFN receptor (Type III) was identified 24 h before the transcripts of Type I IFN in 2B4 cells, showing a delay in Type I IFN signaling and proving the protective function of Type III IFN in response to SARS-CoV infection [56] . Overall, studies in animal models of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection demonstrated that failure to induce IFN-I response in early stages correlates with the severity of the disease. Of note, these models may be indicated that timing is critical, as IFN-I response is protective in the beginning stage of the disease but is pathologic in the late stage [57] .\nAlthough SARS-CoV could effectively infect alveolar epithelial or airway cells, the infection of different hematopoietic cells like dendritic cells (DCs) and monocyte-macrophages is failed. The infection of DCs with SARS-CoV could also induce the lower levels of antiviral cytokines (IFN\u03b1\u03b2) expressions and control the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines up-regulations such as TNF, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 [58] . In the same way, macrophages infected with SARS-CoV indicate a considerable delay but a significant rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, particularly IFN [59] . Also, airway epithelial cells that are infected by SARS-CoV represent a large production of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 [56] . It is thought that delayed but higher amounts of chemokines and cytokines productions could lead to the deregulation or malfunction of the innate immune response to the infection. It was found that the serum levels of chemokines (IL-8, CXCL10, CCL2, and CXCL9) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TGF\u03b2, and IL-1) were increased in the patients with an advanced level of SARS infection compared to the patients with an uncomplicated level of SARS infection [60] .\nHowever, infected patients with SARS in advanced levels had a meager amount of antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Despite the increased level of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in SARS-infected patients, the levels of ISGs such as CCL-2 and CXCL10\nand IFNs like IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1 were enhanced in the infected patients compared to healthy control or the infected patients at a moderate level. These data indicate the possible role of ISGs and IFNs in the immunopathogenesis of infected patients with SARS. Therefore, it seems that dysregulation and exaggeration of chemokine or cytokine in response to SARS-CoV in macrophages, AECs, and DCs could play a considerable function in the pathogenesis of SARS [60] .\nMERS-CoV, similar to SARS-CoV, could infect airway epithelial cells, inducing the responses of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IFNs significantly but delayed. Though MERS-CoV is able to be replicated in either na\u00efve or activated DCs and monocyte-macrophages, activated T cells can only support the MERS-CoV replication [53] . This is a significant contrast that SARS-CoV could abortively infect T cells, monocyte-macrophages. The infection of THP-1 cells, dendritic cells, and DCs by MERS-CoV induce the higher production levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines but in a delayed manner. However, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction through DCs and monocyte-macrophages was not a significant except for the pDCs, which produce a remarkable amount of IFNs during the infection of MERS-CoV. It was documented that the serum levels of chemokines such as CCL5, IL-8, and CXCL-10 were increased considerably in individuals infected with an advanced level of MERS in comparison with those who are suffering from moderate disease.\nThe higher amount of these factors in the serum of MERS-infected patients is correlated with increased numbers of monocyte and neutrophil in the peripheral blood cells and lungs, showing the possible function of these cells in the pathology of the lungs [60] .\nThe kappa light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) as a well-known transcriptional nuclear factor is the most critical regulator for the induction of different pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, the early IFN-\u03b2 expression upon viral infection and innate immunity system. More interestingly, it has been proved that the induction of IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 could have occurred in the cells with spike protein overexpression (a protein of SARS-CoV) through the NF-\u03baB pathway [61, 62] .\nNeutrophils, as well-known immune cells, are presented in several types of lung diseases related to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and probably could contribute to the acute injury of lungs. Neutrophils have been poorly investigated in aspects of their response to viral infection, particularly viral disease in the respiratory system. To be able to reach the target site (the potential pathogenic site), neutrophils breakdown the collagen in pulmonary tissue (extracellular matrix (ECM)) by the production of MMP9 proteins. The production of TNF in the surrounding cells could increase the release of MMP9, leading to the absorption of more numbers of neutrophils towards the inflammation or infection. Subsequently, neutrophils start phagocytosis and degranulation of neutrophil myeloperoxidase, elastase, neutrophil extracellular traps [63] , and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to the pathogenic microorganism clearance. as well as ROS production, could worsen the disease manifestation [64] . It is suggested that severe host response in the infected patients with COVID-19 is due to improper activation of leukocytes such as neutrophils in peripheral blood. These results indicate that when the normal signals to moderate inflammation process are lost, specifically under cytokine storm conditions or a signaling interruption between neutrophils and macrophages, can cause progressive and consequently uncontrollable inflammation [65] .\nNetosis is known as specific cell death of neutrophils whereby NETS (decondensed chromatin fibers, granule components, and histones) are deployed in order to kill and immobilize pathogens while accelerating its death process. Though its main aim is to restrict the pathogenic spread, some viruses or bacteria could lead to excessive formation of NETs [66] . In other words, severe production of NET can induce a cascade reaction in an inflammatory procedure that is related to the promotion of metastasis in cancer disease, micro thrombosis facilitation, and damaging of surrounding tissues, resulting in permanent destroy of organs such as renal, pulmonary, or probably cardiovascular systems [65] .\nThe lung infection by HPAI, MERS-CoV, influenza A virus, and SARS-CoV is reported to cause a severe acute lung injury such as ARDS that is characterized by considerable deterioration to the alveolar epithelium and neutrophils infiltration [67] . A study conducted by Chen and et al. showed that 38% of the patients infected by COVID-19 had higher levels of neutrophils [68] . The critical question is that neutrophilia is driven whether by virus-induced cytopathy or viral infection response.\nARDS, as a common consequence of immunopathological events for infections with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, could be the main reason for death. In a study was represented that 6 out of 41 cases that infected by SARS-CoV-2 died because of ARDS [69] . It has been reported that one of the critical detrimental mechanisms of ARDS is the uncontrollable inflammatory response that leads to the release of a huge concentration of chemokines and pro- In addition to the immunohistochemical test indicated that MERS-CoV could mainly infect alveolar and airways epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. The severity of lung damage is related to uncontrolled levels of macrophages and neutrophils infiltration into the lungs and higher counts of these cells in the sample of peripheral blood in the MERS-infected patients [60] ."}, {"section_title": "Adaptive immunity", "text": "Antigenic peptides are predominately expressed by the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) in humans and can be detected by CTLs (virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes). Therefore, recognition of the fundamental mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation could "}, {"section_title": "Humoral immunity", "text": "Similar to other viral infections, the antibody profile has a common production pattern of IgG and IgM antibodies in the response of the SARS-CoV infection. The IgM antibodies specified for SARS can be detected up to 12 weeks, though the IgG antibody could be identified after a long time-frame, indicating that IgG antibody play probably the protective function and IgG antibody is mainly either S-specific and N specific [71] . with the severity of the disease is not clear yet [72] .\nAlthough the response of successful neutralizing is indicated in most cases, higher titers are also linked to more intense clinical symptoms, proposing that the response of a robust antibody could not be sufficient alone to prevent severe diseases. In the previous epidemic of SARS-CoV-1, it was indicated that neutralizing titers were considerably lower in the recovered patients than decreased patients. This has brought a challenge that the responses off antibodies to such viruses could potentially lead to pulmonary pathology though the induction of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) as an interesting phenomenon that concerns many researchers in this field. This phenomenon can be seen when virus-specific IgG antibodies (non-neutralizing) contribute to the entrance of virus particles to several cells such as monocytes or macrophages via expressed Fc-receptor (FcR), inducing the activation of inflammatory procedure in these cells. Research on the infected rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-1 showed that anti-S IgG is contributed in increasing the number of macrophages and monocytes in the lung and severe acute lung injury (ALI) [57] . Jaume et al. and Yip et al. also reported that though anti-S antibodies inhibit the entrance of viruses into permissive cells, they increase the infection by attaching to the IgG Fc receptor-II positive (Fc\u03b3RII+) cells, such as macrophages or B cells [73] . Furthermore, ADE is recognized in the isolation of monoclonal antibodies from a patient infected with MERS-CoV.\nADE of disease is also a common concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that motivate antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or elicit harmful immunopathology. This phenomenon occurs in MERS, SARS-CoV-1, Zika, HIV, and dengue virus infection and vaccination [74] . Vaccinespecific variations in ADE could occur for many reasons, including modifications in vaccine protein glycosylation, vaccine adjuvant, and previous exposure to other CoV strains. Multiplex approaches developed for influenza can be rapidly adapted to this use, particularly to evaluate the balance between vaccine-induced protection from infection against the increased risk of severe disease with the following infection despite vaccination [75] . However, there is not available data that supports ADE contributed by sera in animal models such as vaccinated rats with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and immunized macaques with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [76, 77] .\nSARS-CoV-2, as a known mucosal targeted virus, is expected to produce secretory IgA (sIgA) and also promote the mucosal immunity strongly. It is valuable to refer that the function of sIgA "}, {"section_title": "Cellular immunity", "text": "The migrated cells (DCs) from the lungs to the T-cell area can activate na\u00efve CD8 + T cells over the viral infection, resulting in the differentiation and proliferation of them into CTLs [80] . CD8 + T and CD4 + T lymphocytes (mainly CD8 + T lymphocytes) employ different cell-associated mediators such as FasL, perforin, or granzyme to promote the apoptosis process in target cells.\nBecause the induction of cytolysis needs to the engagement of antigen receptors in T lymphocytes by viral complexes of peptide/MHC molecules, the apoptosis mediated by T -cells mainly restricts the infected cells. As a significant exception, the mediated cytolysis by T lymphocytes plays a negligible function in the development of injured tissue generated by the adaptive immune system upon viral infection. However, the inflammatory mediators (soluble) derived from T cells such as MIP-1a TNF and IFN\u03b3 are able to deteriorate even uninfected cells and also increase the infiltration of injury-promoting innate immune cells [71] .\nCD4 + T cells are able to contribute to the production of antibodies, induce the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) in CD8 + T cells, and act as functional memory cells. T helper cells have essential roles in the regulation of B cell proliferation, differentiation and switching of immunoglobulin class. In particularly Tfh cells also contribute to the somatic mutation of B cells in the germinal centers. [81] . ICOS and CD40 ligand (CD40L) are abundantly expressed in Tfh cells, which its ligation with ICOSL and CD40 is fundamental for the B cell's immune responses [82] .\nCytotoxic CD4 + T cells (ThCTL) are mainly determined by their cytotoxic function and/or phenotype. ThCTL can also be detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (human species) in severe viral infections such as HCMV (human cytomegalovirus), HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus 1), and hepatitis viruses. A study that was conducted by Brown et al. indicated that, in vitro generated CD4 + cells could get cytolytic characteristic and have protective effect on influenza virus infection in combination with B cell help. In another study they indicated that, functional ThCTL could be found as a large effector population in lung (besides PBMC) as well following influenza infection in mouse model and play the cytotoxic role in the infection loci. It was reported that, effector profiles of CD4 + cells is distinct in the lung than draining lymph node (DLN) and that IFN-\u03b3 production via CD4 + cells at the site of infection could play a protective role. Moreover, CD4 + cells using perforin-mediated cytotoxicity that get in the lung, but not the DLN, are able to augment recovery from lethal influenza virus infection [83] [84] [85] .\nMore studies are in need to evaluate these cells in COVID-19.\nThe most current reports reveal that the numbers of CD8 + T and CD4 + cells are considerably reduced in the peripheral blood of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, their overactivation is a proof for high positive fractions of HLA-DR (as described CD4 + 3.47% and CD38 + (CD8 39.4%). Likewise, the response of SARS-CoV-infected patients at the acute phase is related to the severe reduction of CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells. In 12 patients recovering from mild COVID-19, robust T cell responses specific for viral N, M, and S proteins were detected by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. In the absence of antigen, CD8 + T and CD4 + T memory cells can even persist for several years in recovered patients with the SARS-CoV infection and capable of continuing the proliferation of T cells, IFN-g production, and DTH response.\nA study reported that the infection of SARS-CoV peptide is able to be recognized in response to specific memory T cells in 14 out of 23 recovered patients with SARS infection. It has also been reported that specific CD8 + T cells can indicate a similar influence on MERS-CoV removal in mice. These investigations could probably provide useful data about rational vaccines designing for SARS-CoV-2 infection [15] . The rise of CD8 + T cells in MERS-CoV-infected patients at the early phase could be associated with the severity of the disease, and T helper cells (Th1 type) are recognized at the convalescent stage. The cells of airway memory CD4 + T are specified for conserved epitope play a protective role against lethal function in animal models and can also observe cross-reaction between the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.\nThe strong response of T cells associated remarkably with higher amounts of neutralizing antibody; however, more Th2 cytokines in serum such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were identified in the fatal individuals. As neutrophils have a detrimental effect on all infections, the protective or possible destructive roles of Th17 against the infection of human coronavirus remains unclear [72] ."}, {"section_title": "Immune evasion by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV", "text": "MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can utilize different strategies to escape from the immune system to stay alive in host cells. Over the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, the dsRNA intermediates segregation of viruses in DMVs (Double Membrane Vesicles) is able to cover viral PAMPS from PRRs recognition in the cytosol. It has not been clarified whether the products of viral dsRNA or ssRNA degradation could be sequestered in DMVs or detected by PRRs. Due to the lack of a cap (50 nucleotides) in viral mRNAs, the eukaryotic mRNAs can be distinguished, and many viruses such as SARS-CoV have a sophisticated mechanism for mimicking the host capping system [47] .\nAlthough IFN-I has a significant protective effect on the infection of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the IFN-I pathway is controlled in the infected animal model. It is indicated that accessory protein 4a belongs to MERS-CoV is able to inhibit IFN induction at the MDA5 activation level via interaction directly with ds RNA. Moreover, ORF5, ORF4b, ORF4a, and membrane proteins of this virus could block IRF3 (nuclear transport of IFN regulatory factor 3) and subsequent IFN \u03b2 promoter activation. Coronavirus can also possibly affect the presentation of antigen. As an example, it was shown that the expression of genes is linked to the presentation of antigens is remarkably down-regulated after MERS-CoV infection [70] .\nReportedly, SARS-CoV, through encoding nsp3-deubiquitinase [18] , nsp3-macrodomain, nsp1, ORF6, ORF9b, and ORF3b, could subvert the antiviral reaction by antagonizing of ISG and IFN responses. While nsp1 blocks the IFN responses through inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation, nsp3 could impair the responses of IFN by undetected mechanisms. In addition, some structural proteins, such as nucleocapsid and membrane proteins, could dampen the signaling process of IFN [60] . While M protein is able to suppress the production of type I IFN by controlling the formation of the TRAF3-containing complex, the suppression mechanism of N protein is unknown [86] .\nEither nsp7 or nsp15 originated from SARS-CoV were considered as IFN antagonists; however, the functional mechanism has not been recognized yet. Of note, nsp15, as a known inhibitor for MAVS-induced apoptosis, could also act via an IFN-independent mechanism [87] . Furthermore, acute SARS-CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) and human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 could antagonize the signaling of the innate immune system contributed by stimulator of interferon genes (STING) such as MITA, ERIS, or MYPS. The membrane-anchored PLP domain expression in SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) or human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) blocks the activation of IRF-3 dependent promoters and STING-mediated of IRF-3 nuclear translocation [88] .\nThe presence of immunosenescence in older individuals impacts slightly on the innate immunity system, but significantly on the responses of T cell-dependent adaptive immunity. More evidence shows that the level of proinflammatory cytokines is considerably increased in elderly mice, and alveolar macrophages are sensitive to IFN-\u03b3 activation. [78] . In other words, immunosenescence and probably comorbid disorders are able to induce viral cytokine storm in older individuals, leading to the failure of life-threatening respiratory and multisystemic involvement. Therefore individual medicine can be developed in older people according to their personal medical history [89] ."}, {"section_title": "Inactivated Whole Virus", "text": "Inactivated Whole Virus or Whole killed Virus vaccine (WKV) is remarkable because of its safety, cost-effectiveness, easily prepared, and not involving laborious genetic manipulation [90] . Several [93] . In another study, formaldehyde-inactivated-SARS-CoV strain NS-1 represented an effective response, both humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection in monkeys [94] . The improved humoral immune response due to the application of the inactivated virus with adjuvants, either MF59 or alum associated with the stimulation of the CD4 + T cells, has been observed even after gene-based vaccination [95] . In other two studies conducted by Roberts and See, a whole-killed (deactivated by \u03b2-propiolactone) SARS-CoV vaccine or \u03b2-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated, and a mixture of two adenovirus-based vectors, one expressing the N and other expressing the S protein (named Ad S/N vaccine), were examined in BALB/c mice, golden Syrian hamsters, and 129S6/SvEv mice, respectively. The results of the first study showed the efficiency of the WKV associated with the higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to that of the Ad S/N vaccine. Nonetheless, intranasally administration of S/N limited noticeably the SARS-CoV replication in the lungs [96, 97] . Similar results were reported for the neutralizing antibodies production with various protection levels using inactivated SARS-CoV virion vaccines with or without adjuvant in different animal models [63, 96, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] .\nMoreover, SARS-CoV vaccine studies in mice lead to the observation of Th2-type immune responses, and also eosinophilia. It was indicated that oligomers of the SARS-CoV S protein act as an immunogen and cause eosinophilia in animals [98, 99] . These observed side effects are significant and should be accurately evaluated before using this type of vaccine in humans. Also, if genetically attenuated viruses were utilized in the starting point of virus inactivation process, the vaccine-induced eosinophilia would be probably abated.\nThe application results of the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine to 36 human cases revealed its high level of safety, well tolerating, and the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. Nonetheless, the responses of SARS-CoV-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T-cells have been identified in the mice vaccinated by a mixture of WKV and Ad S/N vaccine. Therefore, it has appeared that WKV vaccines are reliably safe and able to induce either SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies or T lymphocytes, though the mechanism of action is still unknown [106] . In MERS-CoV combined RABV, the S1 domain was combined with the RABV particles (BNSP333-S1). The responses of neutralizing antibodies were recognized after applying of the vaccines in mice with considerable safety [108] . Despite the advantages of IWV-based vaccine responses, such as neutralizing antibodies induction and reduction of the viral load in hDPP4 transgenic mice, unwanted responses like hypersensitivity lung immunopathologic reactions were observed [109, 110] . Besides the investigation of inactivated vaccines in animals, phase I of human trials was performed with or without adjuvants. The vaccine caused strong responses against the RBD, and the RBD-specific antibodies in the antisera could efficiently block receptor binding and virus entry when they combined with adjuvants like Freund's complete or incomplete. In spite of their high level of efficacy, they led to eosinophilia and other related symptoms of immunopathological disorders [101] . Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel vaccines with a high level of both antibodies and T-cells response; however, limited eosinophilic reactions.\nAlthough to the complex compositions of whole-cell antigens, the evaluation and quality control of WKV is complicated, several institutions started WKV development by different strains with confident low or no pathogenicity (Table 1 ) [111] .\nAlthough the Th2 immune responses, which induce production of IL-4, may be sufficient for protection against viral infections, defense requires Th1 responses, including cytotoxic T cells and Th1 cytokine production such as IFN-\u03b3. In order to this purpose achieve, using some adjuvants such as Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC), which is a synthetic dsRNA, has been suggested. The adjuvant provides activating the immune responses of host defense, both innate and adaptive immunity, especially when combined with viral antigens. In a study, it also showed, poly-IC and Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly-ICLC) could enhance the production of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and IFN -\u03b3, which lead to inhibition of CoV replication [112] [113] [114] .\nTLRs, especially TLR3, are the dominant elements as immunomodulators that have been used in vaccine designing, enable to response against different viruses. In fact, TLR signaling pathways is a key for differentiating of CD4 + T cells into Th1 cells, which induce IFN-\u03b3 production, and lead to a change of Ab class from IgM to IgG2 [115] .\nOn the other hand, the combination of TLR3 with poly-IC, which has a wide range of target cells, produce good immune responses against viral infection [116] . In a study by Barnard et In another study which conducted by Zhao et al., intranasal pre-treatment of Poly I-C (a TLR3 agonist) in C57BL/6 mice infected with SARS-CoV (MA15) leads to expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, TNF genes, virus loads reduction, and pathological effects in mice lungs [116] .\nAlthough the high stability of WKV has been proved during several studies, its efficacy is low and needs reminders of the immune system by repeated immunization [120] . In a study performed by Gao et al., PiCoVacc, as an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, evaluated in mice, rats, and macaques at different doses of vaccine during three times immunization. The study results showed partial or complete protection in macaques without any notable pathology and progress of infection [121] ."}, {"section_title": "COVID-19 show low or mild efficacy with adverse reactions after each dose vaccination.", "text": "Additional results about safety and also immunogenicity of the WKV-COVID-19 vaccine will be provided via the following phase3 clinical trial [122] ."}, {"section_title": "Live attenuated vaccines", "text": "Though live attenuated vaccines application has been limited due to the risk of reversion to a virulent type, they are mainly known as strong immunogenic, so a single administration in the absence of any adjuvant can provoke sufficient and effective protective immunity. Furthermore, they can stimulate strong cellular and antibody responses and often induce immunity persisting for several decades, by only one dose administration [123] . Live-attenuated vaccines either viruses with reduced fidelity capacity (mutated in nsp14), partial viruses (viruses eliminated in the envelope section (E) of protein), or the attenuated vector of viruses (AAV adenovirus, measles virus, parainfluenza, VSV, poxvirus, and rabies virus) are nontoxic and can trigger antibody and Tcell responses against SARS and MERS coronaviruses [124] . In general, live-attenuated vaccines can be recognized by the innate immune system like dendritic cells expressing pattern-recognition receptors, including the TLRs. However, many viruses can induce different signaling pathways of receptors and activation of immune cells [127] .\nReplication fidelity as a dominant virulence factor in coronaviruses is about 20-fold greater than other RNA viruses, which is associated with a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) activity. Considering this issue, a live-attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV, according to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MAwt) was investigated and found that MA-ExoN as a stable mutator phenotype could profoundly reduce fidelity after regular administration and attenuate pathogenesis in young, old and immunocompromised BALB/c mice. The obtained results indicated that high amounts of neutralizing antibodies are generated by the vaccinated mice with MA-ExoN. Also, stable weakening of CoVs and, possibly, other RNA viruses can be performed by ExoN inactivation [128, 129] . The efficiency of another live-attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine was evaluated in the golden Syrian hamster using a recombinant SARS-CoV without the E gene (rSARS-CoV-E). The high titers of serum-neutralizing antibodies were discovered. This antibody prevents the replication process of heterologous SARS-CoV and homologous (SARS-CoV Urbani) in the respiratory tract of animal models [132] . Also, a high neutralizing antibody titer was obtained by rVSV-S vaccination in a study done by Vogel et al. [133] . A live-attenuated vaccine comprising a recombinant SARS coronavirus without the E gene was also investigated, and it was found that the rSARS-CoV-E vaccine is immunogenic and effective in hamsters as an animal model, despite being attenuated in the replication process in the respiratory tract [132, 134] . "}, {"section_title": "Subunit vaccines", "text": "To develop both MERS and SARS vaccines, the most focus of the subunit vaccine was on the recombinant S protein (RBD) synthesized in heterologous expression systems. The subunit vaccines can be designed by full-length S protein and its subunits (S1, S2), N-terminal domain (NTD) with or without adjuvants to improve their immunogenicity [135] . In fact, the RBD in the S1 subunit plays a critical role in the binding process of the virus to host cellular receptors [136] .\nHigh-titer neutralizing antibodies can be induced by the subunit vaccine based on both RBD and non-RBD S protein (full-length) like the S2 subunit. As an example, a recombinant S protein trimer of MERS-CoV (MERS S-2P) can fuse to the DPP4 receptor, and RBD, S2-specific neutralizing antibodies produced. However, neutralizing antibodies induction was observed when this protein was utilized against divergent pseudotyped MERS-CoV in mice [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] . Contrary, partial effectiveness in the protection of immunized macaques and reduction of pneumonia and viral load as indicated by the RBD of S protein vaccination in Lan et al. study [143] . It was also reported that various fragments of the RBD, including 358-588 [144] , 367-588 [145] , 377-588, and 367-606 [146] could be used to vaccine development. The fragment of RBD containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV is a critical neutralizing domain and induces the highest humoral responses and neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals, especially when it fused with Fc of human IgG (S377-588-Fc) [144] . In another study, S377-588-Fc of MERS-CoV with MF59 as an adjuvant evaluated in BALB/c mice at different doses. The results showed strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice at the lowest doses [136] . Similar results indicated that MERS-CoVneutralization could rise by the immune response against the 358-to-588, 1-to-357, and S1-Fc 1-to-747variants [147] . It was proved that the fragment-comprising residues 377-588 of MERS CoV could sufficiently protect hDPP4-Tg and Adenovirus (Ad) Ad/hDPP4-transduced mice against MERS-CoV without inducing of immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune development [140, 144, [147] [148] [149] . Also, the residues of 367-588 or 367-606 in the MERS-CoV S1 subunit contain RBD [145, 146, 150] . In another investigation, it was found that intranasal administration of the RBD domain of the S protein in MERS-CoV can lead to more powerful response of local mucosal immune system in the lung tissue in comparison with the subcutaneous immunization [151] .\nSimilar to MERS-CoV, several non-neutralizing immunodominant domains are presented in the S protein of SARS-CoV (full-length) and are responsible for attaching the receptor to cellular ACE2, that may assist to the immunogenicity of main neutralizing domains or trigger detrimental immune responses [152] [153] [154] [155] . In addition to being immunogenic, these subunit vaccines indicate a high safety level and represent inconsiderable side effects. In several studies on SARS-CoV challenges, the role of the S protein in the induction of serum-neutralizing antibodies and the production of protective immune responses by S protein in the animal models (mice, monkey) were confirmed [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . Also, it was observed that CD4 + and the responses of CD8 + T-cells could be triggered by SARS-CoV S protein [162, 163] . Other subunit vaccines that are able to induce protective responses in mice and rabbits have been designed based on SARS-CoV RBD. It was discovered in another report that a chimeric protein( RBD linked to RBD-Fc) could provoke neutralizing antibodies in the different immunized animals(mice and rabbits), which could last for months and protect most of the vaccinated animal models from SARS-CoV infection [164] . Alongside RBD, several studies on the neutralizing activity of S1 protein or non-neutralizing antibody responses of S2 protein have confirmed the defensive efficiency of S protein fragments (S1 and S2) against SARS-CoV infection [156, 161, 165] . It has also been found that other subunit vaccines produced based on non-S structural proteins such as M proteins can lead to the neutralizing activity in the animal model [166] .\nMoreover, the identified protective response of immunodominant epitopes of M proteins (M1-31 and M132-161) that were obtained from the serum of SARS recovered patients in the immunized mouse and rabbit have been shown to cause immunogenicity and can trigger IgG specific antibodies in rabbits [167] . Various investigations showed that the CoV N protein could be considered as another antigen candidate in SARS-CoV vaccine production [168, 169] . Unlike M protein, the interaction of antibodies with CoV N proteins could provoke the activity of no virusneutralizing under in vitro condition [155] . However, in in-vivo conditions, the induction of cellmediated immunity by the protein can cause the protection to be activated [106] . The defensive mechanism of N-and M-based SARS subunit vaccines is still unidentified.\nSARS-CoV-2 S protein subunits such asS1 subunit that consist of two domains including the C terminal domain (CTD) linked RBD domain and NTD, and the S2 subunit consists of the membrane fusion peptide (FP), a membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and a transmembrane domain (TM) [170] . Several institutes have recently developed many subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. All of these vaccines are in the pre-clinical stage. Drosophila S2 insect cell expression system VLPs (Virus-like particles) is a developed strategy that has been currently used by ExpreS2ion. Virus-like particles or multiple recombinant structural proteins have enclosed a cell membrane lipid envelope or nanostructures enclosing the capsid proteins within itself. Also, it can fold the antigenic proteins of several microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, insects, mammalian cell lines, and even in transgenic plants. VLPs can act as non-replicating vectors for subunit and live-attenuated vaccine production in the absence of its genome [171] .\nOther subunit candidate vaccines based on S protein have been developed by WRAIR/USAMRIID, University of EpiVax, Georgia, and Queensland/GS, which are in preclinical stages. Adjuvanted S protein trimer introduced by Clover Biopharmaceuticals/Glaxo and Sanofi Pasteur/Glaxo Smith Kline institutes. Also, Ii-Key peptide and plant-based subunit vaccines are produced by iBio/CC-Pharming and Generex/EpiVax, respectively. In addition, full-length Strimer/nanoparticle plus Matrix M by NovaVax and S1 or RBD protein by Bio/CC-Pharming were listed in the WHO list March 2020 (Table 1) [172, 173] ."}, {"section_title": "Recombinant Vaccines", "text": "For an extended period, recombinant vaccines were widely produced in yeast or mammalian cells, which both are expensive expression platforms. The main disadvantages of such systems include high costs for preparation culture media and the risk of contamination by human pathogens.\nAdditionally, the production of recombinant vaccines in bacterial systems was not successful due to improper folding of eukaryotic peptides and the occurrence of inclusion bodies in bacterial hosts [174] . Most of the recombinant vaccines are designed based on highly purified recombinant proteins or subunits of pathogens (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Recombinant Vector Vaccines (RVVs)", "text": "Recombinant vector vaccines (RVVs) are produced based on bacterial or live viral vectors that are designed to represent various exogenous antigens [175] . RVVs appear to be the most promising types of live vaccines for the development of a transmissible vaccine platform [176] .\nOverall, gene-based vaccines are able to stimulate the responses of both cellular and humoral immune systems strongly, and viral vectors could potentially be an effective approach for antigenencoding genes delivery and antigen presentation. To be applied as an effective vaccine carrier, the provided viral vector should be firstly safe and then present pathogen-specific antigens efficiently to the immune system [177] . RVVs appears to remain effective, even when genetically are not in a stable form and prone to reversion to insert free vector. These types of vaccines seem to be the most promising transmissible vaccine platform [176] .\nIt has been shown that although recombinant RBD vaccines were formulated with Freund's adjuvant and Sigma adjuvant system\u00ae (monophosphoryl-lipid A and trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) to elicit neutralizing antibodies with strong protective immunity in the vaccinated animals, they significantly show reduced or eliminated antibody-dependent immune enhancement (ADE) and other related detrimental inflammatory or immune responses [178] . It has been also demonstrated that a recombinant SARS-CoV RBD protein fused with human Fc produces highly strong immune responses, leading to the completely protected vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV infection [164] . Considering the robust capacity of RBD for the induction of neutralizing antibody, the recombinant proteins linked RBD can be utilized for the development of SARS-CoV vaccines [179] . Another study showed that long-term protective immunity in animal models could induce highly robust neutralizing antibodies after the administration of SARS-CoV RBD proteins [180] . [143, 182] ."}, {"section_title": "It has been demonstrated systemic responses of lung resident memory T-cells, secretory IgA, and", "text": "IgG could be induced by the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine, which expresses MERS-CoV S protein when utilized intranasally into BALB/c mice, providing a stable neutralizing immunity to MERS spike pseudotyped virus; therefore, it is suggested that this vaccine has probably protective role against MERS-CoV infection [183] . The responses of the immune system to these provided vaccines were assessed in BALB/c mice, and obtained results indicated that RV based vaccines are able to induce earlier antibody responses and higher amounts of cellular immunity compared to the GEM particle vector [40] . Based on an animal study, the induction of neutralizing antibodies and the consequence of protection from the viral of SARS particles in mice emerged by the recombinant vaccine [184] . As discussed, another vaccine that is developed for clinical trial phase I is a DNA-based vaccine against SARS-COV [185] . Besides the vaccines undergoing phase I clinical trials, one of the notable COVID-19 vaccine candidates is a recombinant formulated vaccine in oral tablet form, which is used the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and can induce strong systemic and mucosal immunity (Table 1 ) [186] .

In addition, in contrast to the other protein-based subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines can lead to the Th1-biased immune response [190] .\nThe success in the outcome of vaccination is linked to both antibody and T-cell-mediated immunity, and generally, among different vaccines, only live-recombinant vaccines can effectively induce cellular immunity. It has been demonstrated that DNA vaccines encode proteins from pathogens induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. What makes DNA vaccine to induce a cellular immune response is the mimicking of the live viruses effects, which produce antigenic proteins and efficiently represented by MHC class I; therefore, inducing the responses of CD8 + T-cells [191] .\nSeveral successful DNA vaccines have been developed for the functional proteins of SARS-CoV, such as the one designed for S, and also those identified for M and N proteins [192] . A DNA vaccine that is provided based on M protein expression has been proved that is able to provoke neutralizing antibody and the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in mice [193] . The N-protein peptide N220 of the SARS-CoV synthesized via bioinformatics assessment supplies essential information for designing of therapeutic vaccines against SARS-COV infection [194] .\nThe responses of humoral and cellular immune systems can be induced by the application of DNA vaccines in response to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection [195] . It has been reported that DNA encodes the whole S protein to provoke neutralizing antibodies and then robust the immunity mediated via T cell in animal models such as mice, macaques, and camels. Mitigated distinguishing clinical signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection in macaques, including pneumonia, were observed in immunized macaques [193] . MERS-CoV-specific antibody and the response of T-cells can be initiated by DNA vaccines as effective vaccine candidates in non-human primates [195] . Vaccines that can express the MERS-CoV RBD, induced robust neutralizing antibodies in mice as well as in the response of T-cells in non-human primates [196, 197] .\nThe results of a recent study indicate that DNA vaccines that express the full-length subunit of S1 against MERS-CoV could significantly represent higher amounts of S1-specific antibodies (Abs).\nIt is suggested that while plasmids expressing full S protein induce Th2 response and are associated with minimized risk of the immunopathologies, DNA vaccine expressing S1 subunit can be considered as a potential vaccine candidate. It needs to note that full-length DNA vaccines against MERS-CoV lead to considerable titers of IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies (Th1-skewed response) along with very subtle S1-specific CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 response. This result suggests that raised amounts of all IgG isotypes in a balanced Th1/Th2 response is generated by pS1-immunization with markedly increased CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 response compared to the pS group [190] . Another study supports the use of the plasmid encoding S1 protein for the development of DNA vaccines against MERS-CoV S1 protein. The obtained results confirmed the strong protective humoral and cellular immune responses of DNA based vaccines in mice and also antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreting IFN-c and other generated cytokines provoked by gene-based vaccines [198] .\nThe previous reports on MERS have revealed that although subcutaneous vaccination with RBD of MERS-CoV S protein-induced systemic humoral immune responses, much stronger local mucosal immune responses, those induced by intranasal vaccination are strong and more robust [151] . Recently animal studies in rhesus macaques, mice, and came demonstrated immunization with a MERS-CoV vaccination, results in the activation of T-cell responses and increased production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines [195] .\nThe combination vaccines (protein and DNA), encodings protein, which is in the preclinical phase, and DNA-based vaccines with moderate and mild symptoms in Phase I and II clinical trials are two other vaccines against MERS-CoV [139, 190] .\nIn a recent animal study on DNA vaccine, which encodes more than 700 residues of the S1 protein, the defined vaccine induces strong protective responses of the antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice [198] . Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately high nucleotide similarly (89%) to SARS-like coronaviruses, the strategies for designing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are built based on the previous advances for SARS. Furthermore, genomic analyses indicated that either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 exhibits genomic similarities in the receptor-binding domain that can directly bind to the human receptor ACE2, suggesting its essential implications for the designing of novel vaccines [199] . [201] .\nClover Biopharmaceuticals could produce a protein trimer vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (S-Trimer) by Trimer-Tag\u00a9 technology application via a rapid expression system (mammalian cell-culture), and they will examine the preclinical safety soon [111] .\nInduction of anti-S antibodies in an animal model like mice and following SARS virus-specific neutralizing antibody and the responses of T-cells in the first phase of the human trial by using DNA vaccine candidates is well documented [185] . To date, all vaccine candidates against the SARS-COV2 have recently moved into clinical development. There are two vaccine candidates, the first one that is entered to Phase I clinical trials is a DNA plasmid encoding S protein (INO-4800) delivered by electroporation [202] , while another one is a recombinant vaccine that is produced by using of an adenovirus vector 5 (Ad5-nCoV) that encodes the S protein with full length, which is undergoing phase I trials since 12th April 2020 [199] .\nResults from phase I from the first DNA vaccine candidate against MERS coronavirus to enter clinical trials, dose-ranging study of GLS-5300, reported from 75 adults aged 18-50 years, received 0\u00b767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 intramuscular injection at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localized intramuscular electroporation (Table 2 ) [203] ."}, {"section_title": "mRNA Vaccines", "text": "RNA-based technologies for the generation of vaccines have attracted tremendous attention as a result of its safety and long-lasting immune response in human and animal models during two past decades [204] .

Moderna is a well-known biotechnology company with previous experience in mRNAs-based vaccines designing encoding antigenic proteins full-length S, S1, or S2 for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA cocktail encoding VLP is another mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19, which is introduced by Lin Jinzhong and his colleagues.

The innate and adaptive immune response is considered as a central factor of antiviral defense. However, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus could paralysis the immune protection by evasion of the immune response. Therefore, to achieve more information about the COVID-19 and immune response interaction, further investigation is required.\nThere is limited information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and more questions than responses for the lately recognized virus, such as the structural features, etiology, or related epidemiology, pathogenesis, and immunopathogenesis, etc. Access to necessary information on highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2, like identifying of mediators that manage the immune response, the involved pathways, and the mechanism regulate virus behavior, will help the design and development of successful antiviral therapeutics and vaccine candidates. To stop disease progression and the immune response promotion, it is necessary to formulate an effective vaccine.\nHigh mutation rates in SAR-CoV-2 are the critical subject in vaccine design, specifically when it can affect the binding affinity of the virus. A SARS-Coronavirus -2 variant carrying the spike protein amino acid mutation D614G has grown into the most dominant form in the global pandemic. Active tracking of variant frequencies shown a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at several geographic levels: regional, national and community. The shift arisen even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well recognized prior to institution of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly important, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness benefit. Studies have shown that in infected individuals, G614 is related with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, indicative of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity [209] . Even though difficult infectiousness of the G614 variant may completely reason for its persistence and rapid spread, other aspects should also be measured.\nThese include epidemiological influences because viral spread also is determined by on whom it infects, and epidemiological influences can also cause changes in genotype frequency to mimic evolutionary forces. In all possibility, an arrangement of evolutionary selection for G614 and the founder's special effects of being presented into highly mobile and connected populations may have together contributed, in part, to its rise. The G-clade mutations in the 5 UTR or in the RdRP protein might also have effects [210] .\nIn addition, there could be immunological consequences resulting from the G614 change in Spike.\nThe G614 variant is sensitive to neutralization by polyclonal convalescent serum, which is boosting in terms of immune involvements, but it will be vital to determine whether the D614 and G614 forms of SARS-CoV-2 are differentially vaccine-elicited antibodies or sensitive to neutralization by antibodies produced in response to infection with either type of the virus [211] .\nDespite fast developing in vaccines, it will probably come too late to have an impact on the first wave of a potential pandemic. Still, critical lessons can be attained for the development of potential vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. Notably, if the virus to be maintained within their host communities, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be critical to reducing morbidity and mortality.\nMoreover, as SARS-CoV-2 targets the mucosa of the respiratory tract, developing a vaccine that boosts the robust immunity through the in route as an efficient strategy to stop COVID-19\ninfection. The immunogenicity of vaccines is determined via numerous factors; the route of administration is one of the important factors.
