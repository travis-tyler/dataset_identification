[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To test the hypothesis that anxiety in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) increases rates of conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and to identify potential neural mechanisms underlying such an association. Methods: Participants (N \u00bc 376) with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were studied over a median period of 36 months. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association between anxiety severity ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and AD risk. Other variables were depression, memory loss, and MRIderived AD-related regions of interest (ROIs), including hippocampal, amygdalar, entorhinal cortical (EC) volumes, and EC thickness, In addition, a linear regression model was used to determine the effect of anxiety in aMCI on rates of atrophy within ROIs. Results: Anxiety severity increased rate of aMCI conversion to AD, after controlling for depression and cognitive decline. The association between anxiety and AD remained significant even with inclusion of ROI baseline values or atrophy rates as explanatory variables. Further, anxiety status predicted greater rates of decrease in EC volume. An association between anxiety and EC thickness missed significance. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms in aMCI predict conversion to AD, over and beyond the effects of depression, memory loss, or atrophy within AD neuroimaging biomarkers. These findings, together with the greater EC atrophy rate predicted by anxiety, are compatible with the hypothesis that anxiety is not a prodromal noncognitive feature of AD but may accelerate decline toward AD through direct or indirect effects on EC.

Although 10%e15% of people with aMCI convert to AD within a year, others remain stable or improve in memory performance. 3, 4 Most models incorporating cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological biomarkers have inadequate predictive value in identifying aMCI patients at high risk for disease progression. 5e8 These findings suggest that other variables contribute to AD risk.\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, are frequent in aMCI. 9e13 Much research has focused on the link between depression and AD, with converging evidence of a one and a half to two times increased risk of conversion in individuals with aMCI and concurrent depression. 14 Whether anxiety is a risk factor for AD is unclear. Past or current anxiety in aMCI may augment the risk of AD conversion by as much as 2.5-fold. 15e18 Conversely, anxiety may be protective against AD 19e21 or have no impact."}, {"section_title": "22e25", "text": "Although methodologic differences such as shorter follow-up 22e25 and clinical versus community samples 19e21 may account for the discrepant findings, an important consideration is the potential impact of concurrent depression, given the well-established comorbidity between anxiety and depression in the general population. 26, 27 Notably, studies that included depression as a covariate reported an inverse or no association between anxiety and AD. 19e21, 25 One of the first studies to demonstrate a nearly twofold increased AD risk in individuals with aMCI and anxiety reported that anxiety at baseline remained a significant predictor when depression was included as a covariate, although the results were not presented. 17 Other studies that demonstrated an association between aMCI with anxiety and conversion excluded depression as a covariate in longitudinal models of AD risk. 15, 16, 18 Thus, although evidence from large observational studies supports an association between anxiety in aMCI and AD risk, the degree to which depression contributes toward or confounds the association is unclear.\nAn association between anxiety and AD risk is suggested by studies that have demonstrated links between anxiety or stress and AD-related pathology. Anxiety in individuals with aMCI was associated with abnormal concentrations of Ab42 and t-tau in cerebrospinal fluid, whereas conversely depression and apathy were not. 28 In animal models of AD, stress-level glucocorticosteroid administration resulted in increases in amyloid formation and tau accumulation. 29 The well-established relationships among stress, cortisol, and hippocampal atrophy in humans 30e32 suggest that anxiety may increase AD risk indirectly through cortisol-mediated hippocampal neurotoxicity. Elevated cortisol levels have been found in older adults with clinically significant anxiety. 33 Chronic stress may also contribute to AD risk through other pathways related to increased allostatic load, such as effects on the cardiovascular system and plasticity changes to brain structures. 34 The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that anxiety symptoms in individuals with aMCI increase the risk of AD, independent of depressive symptoms. We also sought to identify potential neural mechanisms underlying such an association by determining the relationships among anxiety symptoms in aMCI, AD-related brain regions, and conversion to AD. Medial temporal lobe structures, which together play an integral role in memory formation and are robust predictors of progression to AD, 8 were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). These structures are hippocampal (HC-vol), amygdala (AMYG-vol), and entorhinal cortex volumes (EC-vol) and cortical thickness measures (ECthickness). We additionally included EC surface area measures (EC-surface) based on neuropathologic studies of early AD. 35 We hypothesized that anxiety symptoms in aMCI (aMCI anxiety\u00fe) would be associated with greater rates of atrophy within ROIs relative to nonanxious aMCI (aMCI anxietye)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 36 States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects. ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. 8 For up-to-date information, go to www.adni-info.org. Diagnoses were established by site investigators at screening and baseline visits using quantitative and qualitative global measures. General inclusion criteria were as follows: age 55e91 years for MCI and AD and 60e90 years for normal controls (NC), availability of family member/caregiver to provide collateral information, modified Hachinski ischemia score of no more than 4, stability of permitted medications, no significant neurological conditions, and good general health. Individuals with active mood disorders such as major depressive or bipolar disorder or those with Geriatric Depression Scale score less than 5 37 were excluded.\nCriteria for single-or multiple-domain aMCI 1 Clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments were collected at baseline and at 6-month intervals for 2 years and then annually thereafter. Data were downloaded from the ADNI public database on or before February 9, 2014 and reflect the status of the database at that point. The ADNI study was approved by the local institutional review board of each participating site. Before performance of any study procedures, informed consent was obtained from all subjects and study partners.

Endorsement of either is recorded as a positive response for anxiety. Severity of anxiety is then rated\n. NPI-Q responses were available for baseline and follow-up visits (every 6 months until 24 months, then annually). As a summary measure of exposure to anxiety during the observation period, we used the highest reported anxiety severity rating (NPI-Anxiety max ) recorded during the period of risk, defined as baseline through to the study visit immediately before AD diagnosis, or to the second-to-last study visit in stable aMCI participants. Negative responses on NPI-Q anxiety were coded as 0 for severity."}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Predictors of AD Risk", "text": "Baseline age, sex, education, Hachinski ischemia score, 41 and the following depression, cognitive, and AD neuroimaging biomarkers were included as explanatory variables of AD risk.

MRI-derived measures of total intracranial volume (ICV), HC-vol, AMYG-vol, EC-vol, EC-thickness, and EC-surface at baseline and at each study visit (every 6 months until 24 months, then annually) were extracted from the dataset UCSF-Longitudinal FreeSurfer (FreeSurfer Version 4.4; http://freesurfer.net/). The dataset includes MRI measures of cortical volume and thickness, standard deviation of cortical thickness, and surface area for 34 ROIs. Participants were scanned on 1.5-T scanners at 56 different sites using a standardized ADNI protocol for high-resolution magnetizationprepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) structural MRI. Images were preprocessed using gradient warping, scaling, B1 correction, and N3 inhomogeneity correction. Original scans and preprocessed images are available at http://www.loni. ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/. 36 Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of scans was performed using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Because MRI scans were acquired at multiple time points, scans were run through FreeSurfer using longitudinal processing, which involves creating a within-subject template space and average image unbiased toward the chronologic scan order using robust, inverse consistent registration. 47 Several processing steps, including skull stripping, Talairach transforms, atlas registration, and spherical surface maps and parcellations, were then initialized with common information from the within-subject template to optimize statistical power and reliability. 48 Further details on longitudinal processing are available elsewhere. 48 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to evaluate the effects of anxiety and other factors on time to conversion to AD. Factors were NPI-Anxiety max , GDS max , NPI-Dep max , sex, education, baseline age, Hachinski ischemia score, ADNI-MEM, ADNI-EF, and ROIs. This model yields a hazard ratio (HR) that gives the ratio of the probability of converting to AD at a given time per 1 unit of the predictor (anxiety severity rating), relative to the probability of converting to AD for aMCI with no anxiety. For multivariable regression models, we report the HR for the predictor conditional on other variables in the model (HR p ). To account for variability in anxiety and depression severity across the observation period, NPI-Anxiety max , NPI-Dep max , and GDS max were entered as time-dependent variables. 49 To appreciate the unconditional contribution of individual factors on AD risk, we fit bivariate Cox models with each factor as the independent variable. We then fit a multivariable Cox model using NPIAnxiety max and all demographic and clinical factors to determine the association between anxiety and AD, conditional on other predictors of AD risk. We used backward elimination to sequentially remove variables with p >0.10. This final model was confirmed by reintroducing each eliminated variable into the model to ensure p >0.10 and to determine whether the regression coefficient estimate for anxiety was substantively altered (!20%) by inclusion of the variable.\nTo evaluate the extent to which anxiety was predictive of AD over and beyond extent of memory decline, we challenged the final model by including a measure of change in memory (DADNI-MEM) and determined its impact on the size of the regression coefficient estimate for anxiety. DADNI-MEM was calculated as the difference between ADNI-MEM at baseline and at each follow-up visit during the period of risk and then entered into the model as a timedependent variable.

Baseline ICV was added to the model to account for variability in total brain volume across participants, and then baseline values for each ROI were entered individually into the model to determine their impact on the regression coefficient estimate for anxiety.\nThe same procedure was followed to evaluate the impact of change in each ROI (DROI) over time in the model.

Although all aMCI participants entered ADNI-1 with GDS scores of no more than 5 as per eligibility criteria, 8% of the sample reported GDS scores greater than 5 on at least one study visit during the period of risk. The numbers of aMCI participants with any positive response for NPI-Q depression or anxiety during the period of risk were comparable (45% versus 41%). Similarly, NPI-Anxiety max and NPI-Dep max distributions were comparable. In bivariate models, NPI-Anxiety max , NPI-Dep max , and GDS max were significantly associated with rates of conversion to AD (Kaplan-Meier survival curves and HRs in Fig. 1 Table 2 ). Neither NPI-Dep max nor GDS max met criteria for inclusion into the model, but we report a second model with NPI-Dep max added to interpret the effects of anxiety on AD independent of depression ( Table 2) . Inclusion of NPI-Dep max resulted in reduction of the regression coefficient estimate for anxiety by 17%, and HR p -anxiety was minimally reduced. GDS max reduced the regression coefficient estimate for anxiety by less than 5%. When either model was challenged by adding DADNI-MEM, the effect of anxiety on AD conversion remained significant and not substantively altered (HR p -anxiety remained at 1.30 and 1.27 [Wald z \u00bc 2.07, p \u00bc 0.04] for final or depression-adjusted model, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging Predictors of AD Risk", "text": "Baseline volumes of HC, AMYG, and EC were smaller in aMCI anxiety\u00fe participants ( Table 1) .

The regression coefficient estimate for anxiety was nominally increased with inclusion of DROIs in the model."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Anxiety severity in aMCI increased rates of conversion to AD, independent of depression or extent of memory decline. The HR p for anxiety was 1.33, indicating AD risk increased by 33%, 78%, and 135% demonstrated that anxiety attenuated the association between depression and dementia and that AD risk was similar for anxiety comorbid with depression or anxiety alone. 51 Collectively, these findings suggest that anxiety in aMCI increases risk of AD independently of depression. If anxiety in aMCI accelerates progression toward AD, is it possible that anxiety is simply a prodromal symptom of AD-because of the presence of AD pathology in limbic brain regions 52 -or is anxiety a subjective reaction to worsening memory? Against these possibilities are the significant associations between anxiety and AD, over and beyond extent of memory decline, baseline ROI volumes, or ROI atrophy rate. We also observed no differences in frequency of endorsing the GDS question, \"Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most?\", between aMCI anxiety\u00fe and aMCI anxietye, implying anxiety was not simply related to concerns regarding memory. Instead, we found that anxiety was associated with increased rate of atrophy within EC-vol (an association with EC-thickness, specifically, missed significance), suggesting anxiety may accelerate decline toward AD through effects on EC. Decreased EC-vol and EC-thickness were in turn associated with more rapid progression toward AD. The EC, along with perirhinal, parahippocampal cortices and HC, form the medial temporal lobe, which plays an integral role in memory formation. 53 A link between anxiety and EC was previously demonstrated in a study of AD patients where NPI anxiety scores were inversely correlated with metabolism in EC and anterior parahippocampal gyrus, after controlling for MMSE and NPI depression. 54 Contrary to hypotheses, anxiety was not associated with greater HC or AMYG atrophy rates. However, decreases in HC-vol or AMYG-vol was also not predictive of conversion to AD. This pattern of results is consistent with pathologic staging of AD, where neurofibrillary tangles appear initially in EC, followed by HC and then AMYG in preclinical AD. 52 Further, in healthy older adults, AD pathology as measured by amyloid-b deposition was associated with abnormal neural activity during recall within EC but not HC, suggesting that amyloid deposition is associated specifically with EC neuronal dysfunction. 55 One limitation to the current study is the use of NPI-Q in assessment of anxiety. Caregiver ratings may not accurately reflect the extent of anxiety experienced by individuals with aMCI. The NPI-Q also assesses a narrow range of anxiety symptoms and does not characterize onset or chronicity. In a study focused on anxiety profiles in MCI, chronic severe anxiety, as opposed to recent onset, was associated with aMCI and correlated with memory impairment. 56 Thus, it is possible that anxiety symptoms were underreported in the current study, resulting in a lower HR p estimate for anxiety and AD risk. Broader anxiety measures that are self-and clinician-rated are ideal but are challenging to implement in a large-scale, long-term observational study for which participant retention is critical. A second limitation relates to exclusion of comorbid depression on study entry in ADNI, a criterion implemented in other longitudinal AD studies because depression itself is associated with cognitive impairment. 57 Thus, whether an association between anxiety and AD would be detected in aMCI with high levels of depression remains to be determined. In summary, we demonstrated an association between anxiety symptoms in aMCI and rate of conversion to AD independent of depression, extent of memory loss, or atrophy of AD neuroimaging biomarkers. Further, anxiety in aMCI predicted greater EC atrophy rate, which itself was associated with AD risk. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that anxiety is not a prodromal noncognitive feature of AD but may accelerate decline toward AD through direct or indirect effects on EC. Anxiety in aMCI has been understudied relative to other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression and apathy, despite well-established associations between stress, cortisol, and hippocampal integrity.\n30e32 This may, in part, be attributable to the tendency to subsume anxiety symptoms within the rubric of depression. 58 Future research should clarify the clinical profile of anxiety and its association with AD in community samples of aMCI, and evaluate whether progression to AD can be delayed through routine monitoring and timely management of anxiety symptoms in aMCI, for example, using cognitive-behavioral interventions developed for anxiety in dementia."}]
