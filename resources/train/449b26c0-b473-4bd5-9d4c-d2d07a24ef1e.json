In addition to providing direct economic benefits, coastal wetlands have the capacity to function as a storm buffer to inland communities and infrastructure by absorbing wave energy thus providing protection from wind-generated waves (Leonard and Reed, 2002;Neumeier and Ciavola, 2004;M\u00f6ller, 2006;M\u00f6ller et al., 2011). However, protection varies spatially and temporally which demonstrates a non-linear relationship between the characteristics of ecosystems and their protective effects (Koch et al., 2009;Barbier et al., 2008). Barbier et al., (2013) directly linked hydrodynamic conditions such as wave height and storm surge to economic damage analysis to better demonstrate the value of wetlands during storms."}, {"section_title": "Louisiana contains 40 percent of the intertidal coastal marshes in the contiguous United", "text": "States (Williams, 1995) , and over the last century has experienced widespread losses (Barras et al., 2003;Barras et al., 2008;Williams, 1995;Dahl, 2000). Since the 1930s, an area of nearly 4900 km 2 of wetlands was converted to open water, with the average annual loss rate (from 1956 to 2006) ranging from 90 km 2 /y to 115 km 2/ y ( Barras et al., 2003;Barras et al. 2008;Couvillion et al., 2011). Multiple factors contribute to wetland loss including a lack of mineral sediment via riverine input, hydrologic disruption, saltwater intrusion and physical erosion, which are a result of both anthropogenic and natural forces and ultimately lead to the conversion of wetlands to open water (Boesch et al., 1994;DeLaune et al., 1994;Day et al. 2007;LCWCDTF, 2010;Day et al., 2011). The coalescing of interior ponds create larger open bays (Day et al., 1994;Ashton et al., 2009) that are exposed to more energetic events including both hurricanes and cold fronts (Fagherazzi et al., 2007;Fagherazzi and Wiberg, 2009). The wave climate along the Louisiana coast is a product of seasonal wind patterns and the passage of tropical and extratropical storms (Georgiou et al., 2005). The Northern Gulf Coast region is affected by a high incidence of tropical cyclones (Muller and Stone, 2001), however, cold fronts are often more damaging in terms of their erosive ability, compared to hurricanes, primarily because of their high frequency of occurrence (Mossa and Roberts, 1990). In an average year, 20 to 40 cold fronts pass through coastal Louisiana (Roberts et al., 1987;Chaney, 1998). These systems can be defined as narrow transition zones between two air masses of different densities, characterized by changes in wind speed, direction, barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity (Mossa and Roberts, 1990). The pressure gradient at the leading edge of these frontal systems controls the intensity and transfer of momentum/energy to the coast, which is manifested in the form of strong winds, large waves, and rapid changes in water levels (Pepper and Stone, 2004;Li et al., 2010). Keen (2002) identified cold fronts as major factors in the short-term evolution of estuaries along the northern Gulf of Mexico in terms of (1) waves and their continuous interaction with the bed, and (2) estuarine circulation due to shifting winds. During frontal passage, estuaries and bays that are connected to the ocean by well-defined inlets exchange as much as 40% of their volume which significantly affects their water level (Feng and Li, 2010). Onshore winds during pre-frontal conditions promote this exchange and increase the volume of water flowing through tidal inlets into the bays, as well as increasing salinity (Li et al., 2010;Schindler, 2010). Wind waves in shallow coastal bays during cold fronts are typically depth-limited (i.e. wave height is controlled by interaction with the sea-bed), are steep, and often exhibit high frequencies and nonlinear shapeform (i.e. their shape cannot be described by linear wave theory) (Keen, 2002;Stone et al., 2004). In shallow water, wave speed is governed by water depth rather than wavelength, and, therefore wave speed decreases near the shoreline (Holthuijsen, 2007). This decrease in speed shortens wavelength and increases wave height, resulting in larger and steeper waves, which in turn increases the number of wave crests with in a given distance. Since wave energy (per unit area over one wavelength) is proportional to the square of the wave height, , increasing the amplitude of a wave increases the energy transported by the wave (Knauss, 1996). Since steep waves can deliver more wave energy to the shoreline they are believed to be responsible for the chronic shoreline erosion along coastal bays (Keen, 2002;Stone et al., 2004;Schwinner and Pizzuto, 2000;Fagherazzi et al., 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Scientific Research Questions", "text": "The specific questions to be answered by this study are 1.

Studies of wave attenuation in saltmarshes have shown that vegetated wetlands can attenuate wave energy more effectively than un-vegetated sand or mudflats, and most wave energy dissipation occurs in the first few meters of the permanently vegetated saltmarsh (M\u00f6ller and Spencer, 2002). Wave energy dissipation was shown to be two times higher at scarped marsh edges than sites without the abrupt transition between the mudflat and saltmarsh (M\u00f6ller and Spencer, 2002). Saltmarshes evolve vertically, through the processes of deposition (organic and inorganic), surface erosion and relative sea level rise while horizontal evolution is a result of vegetation colonization and lateral erosional processes. Considerable attention has been focused on understanding the controlling processes responsible for the accretion or erosion of saltmarsh surfaces with field observations and numerical models (Delaune et al., 1983;Boumann et al., 1984;Reed, 1989;Nyman et al., 1990;Cahoon and Reed, 1995;Day et al., 1994;Morris et al., 2002;D'Alpaos et al., 2007;Kirwan and Murray, 2007;Mudd, 2011). However, lateral erosional mechanisms have not been as well studied; even though marsh edge erosion is one of the primary mechanism by which coastal marshes are being lost (van Eerdt, 1985;Penland et al., 2000;Schwimmer and Pizzuto, 2000;Schwimmer, 2001;van de Koppel et al., 2005;Wilson and Allison, 2008;Feagin et al. 2009;Marani et al., 2011). Marsh edge erosion is a complex process and is dependent on a variety of factors (soil characteristics, root effects, and bioturbation, etc.); however studies suggest that waves are the chief driver of saltmarsh edge erosion (Moeller et al., 1996;M\u00f6ller et al., 1999;Schwimmer and Pizzuto, 2000;Watzke, 2004;Wilson and Allison, 2008;Feagin et al. 2009;. Studying the relative importance of these factors, Feagin et al. (2009), suggested that it is the soil type rather than the vegetation that controls marsh edge erosion, whereas Fagherazzi et al. (2012), argue that vegetation does play a role in the resulting morphology of the marsh profile. Francalanci et al. (2013) has recently shown in wave flume experiments that vegetation roots prolonged the time needed to erode equal amounts of sampled marsh material. Few field studies directly address marsh edge erosion in southeast Louisiana. Watzke (2004) examined low-energy fringing marshes in Louisiana and concluded that these marshes undergo substantial geomorphological change due to erosion from locally generated high-frequency waves produced during cold fronts. Wilson and Allison (2008)  It is well documented that wetlands have a greater capacity to attenuate waves than do nonvegetated shorelines and that most attenuation occurs in the first few meters of the marsh or more specifically along the marsh edge. However, most prior studies measure attenuation rates as the average dissipation over tens of meters along transects that include the marsh edge. This study will: 1) examine wave transformation/attenuation and resulting erosion at the marsh edge with observations of wind generated waves during winter storms in the Biloxi Marsh, adjacent to Lake Borgne; 2) develop a simple numerical model for wave generation, transmission and marsh edge erosion; 3) validate against our field observations, (4) use the model to gain insight into marsh edge erosion processes in coastal Louisiana, and (5) develop a conceptual model describing marsh edge retreat based on observations and predictions from this study, supplemented further by long-term records of retreat (Martinez et al., 2009) in the Biloxi Marsh."}, {"section_title": "Regional Setting", "text": "The Mississippi River delta plain (MRDP) developed during the Holocene and covers an area of 30,000 km 2 (Coleman et al., 1998), is comprised of several delta complexes which in turn are composed of multiple delta lobes that are fed by many distributary channel networks of the Mississippi River (Roberts, 1997). The St. Bernard delta complex was active until approximately 1,500 years BP (Tornqvist et al., 1996) and extends east from Lake Pontchartrain to the Chandeleur Islands (Frazier, 1967  . These marshes maintain elevation within the tidal range through a balance between mineral sediment accumulation and peat formation versus submergence and erosive forces (Nyman et al., 1990;Day et al., 1994). When this balance is interrupted wetlands are lost. Penland et al. (2000) classified wetland loss in Louisiana as either inland or shoreline losses. Although nearly 70% of total wetland loss was attributed to interior processes, wetland losses around Lake Borgne is the result of shoreline losses with marsh edge erosion by wave processes the primary mechanism of shoreline retreat (Penland et al., 2000;Couvillion et al., 2011;Wilson and Allison, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Study Site", "text": "The study site is located on the eastern shore of Lake Borgne in the Biloxi Wildlife Management Area, Louisiana (Figure 1). Lake Borgne has a surface area of 730 km\u00b2 and an average depth of 3 m (USEPA, 1999). Lake Borgne has an oblong shape which trends from southwest to northeast and opens into Mississippi Sound. The shoreline at the site is oriented facing the northwest along the lake's minor axis. The fetch across the lake ranges from 16 to 22 km with the longer fetches facing the west-northwest. The wetlands surrounding the site were classified by the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) in 2012 as a saline marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora (68%) and Juncus romerianus (http://www.lacoast.gov/crms2/Home.aspx). The mean tidal range is approximately 0.39 m while the mean diurnal range is 0.45 m (USEPA, 1999). The site was chosen because of the shoreline orientation and the significant fetch across Lake Borgne which would increase the probability that wind-induced water setup and large wind waves will inundate the marsh. The nearest CRMS station (CRMS4572) to the study site reports an elevation change 0.11 cm/y greater than RSLR.

Marsh and water level elevations were taken at selected sites via Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and were correlated to water levels recorded by a NOAA tide gauge located 17 kilometers away at Shell Beach, LA. (Figure 1), and then used to hindcast conditions at the site to predict the likelihood of inundation. This was accomplished by correlating water levels measured at the study site with water levels obtained from the Shell Beach gauge to determine the offset between water surface elevations. The marsh elevations at the site were performed during calm conditions, and as such the effects of setup were most likely not present at either site. This allows for a more accurate calculation of the potential setup at each site resulting from a storm, thus providing a better estimate of the inundation depth. Measurements from three different surveys were used to calculate an average offset of 0.046 (+/-0.014) meters NAVD88. This offset was applied to the long-term water level records obtained from Shell Beach to estimate the water level and inundation at the study site in meters NAVD88. The study site was chosen after the preliminary survey, and then three field campaigns followed (Table 1). "}, {"section_title": "Topographic Survey", "text": "To define the marsh edge morphology, elevation measurements were conducted along a shore normal transect in the NNW direction ( Figure 2). Measurements were taken on the first site visit (12/14/2012), and during the last visit to the site (4/30/2013) ( Table 1). Elevations were at 2 meter intervals with additional points as needed to better define the marsh scarps and/or platforms. Data from the topographic and bathymetric survey was used to determine the elevations of marsh features as well as the elevations where the instruments were deployed, and to create a continuous cross-shore profile of the study area from the marsh platform to the Lake Borgne seabed. The surveys also served as an additional dataset documenting horizontal marsh retreat and overall profile evolution. The exact (cm scale resolution) location of the shoreline was determined during the final survey by walking along the marsh/water interface with the DGPS receiver. This GPS trace provides the most up to date position of the shoreline at the study site. The site elevations were obtained with two Thales Navigation Z-MAX dual frequency Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) operating as base and rover units. This method enables sub-centimeter accuracy horizontally and ~1 cm accuracy vertically through post processing. The base station data were processed using the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) system managed by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS). GNSS data postprocessed using CORS data improves the precision of coordinate measurements, both horizontally and vertically relative to the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) (NGS, 2006). The rover data was post processed using NovAtel-Waypoint's GNSS Post-Processing Software GrafNav, which performs differential processing using the base station data, the post-processed coordinates obtained from the NSRS and satellite clock and orbit information to calculate a solution for the rover data to facilitate better accuracy. The base station consists of a GPS unit with and external choke ring antenna placed 2 m above a temporary benchmark installed by inserting an aluminum rod approximately two meters into the marsh to provide a stable point for the base station and antenna to rest. The second GPS was used as a rover unit and was configured with a portable antenna module and mounted on a portable monopod, 1.431 m above the monopod's measuring surface. Water surface elevations at the site were measured in meters NAVD88 during calm meteorological conditions (when the effects of wind/wave setup, atmospheric pressure etc. are minimal ) and correlated with water level elevations obtained from the NOAA station at Shell Beach in order to tie the data to a common datum. This method permitted the use of the Shell Beach station as a proxy for conditions experienced at the study site, and for further use in wave hindcast and forecast analysis. This provides a local inundation depth for more accurate predictions of wave transformation and subsequent edge erosion. Three cross-shore profiles were surveyed spaced 50 m apart and were connected by two alongshore lines, at 100 m intervals. The along-shore lines are referenced with the cross-shore lines and provide a quality check for consistency in sounding values. The fathometer operates at a frequency of 200 kHz and has a vertical resolution of 0.01 meters. High frequency transducers have a better resolution than lower frequency transducers and are typically used for shallow water. The MSU corrects the stream of sounding data in real time for heave, pitch, and roll created by waves acting on the vessel while under way. The vessel based GPS functions as a rover unit and collects GNSS information simultaneously with the GPS receiver at the nearby base station. HYPACK\u00ae Hydrographic Survey and Processing Software was used to collect the data steam and to combine the real time and post processed corrections into a high resolution mapping of the nearshore area. To extend the elevation measurements at the site from the marsh platform to Lake Borgne, depth soundings were collected along the cross-shore profile extending from the topographic transect toward the bathymetric profile ( Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Bathymetric Survey", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Short-term erosion measurements", "text": "Marsh edge erosion was measured using erosion pins (Haigh, 1977;Priestas and Fagherazzi, 2011), inserted horizontally into the marsh scarp. Pins were placed at four locations at the site, two along the transect line as well as two other location to serve as a backup and to provide duplicate measurements for statistical inferences (Figure 3). The pins were constructed of metal bars, 1.5 cm wide and 45 cm long. Two pins were placed at each location and inserted approximately 35 cm into the marsh edge on 12/14/2012, and recorded erosion measurements on 12/22/2012 (8 days), and on 4/30/2013 (4 months). water elevations which results in a burst length of 768 s (12.8 min) consistent with observations at other deployment sites. The Vector ADV has two components, a canister that contains the instrument's electronics and pressure sensor and a transducer probe that sends and receives ultrasound pulses. The canister was mounted securely flush to the mud flat using two 120 cm metal rods (Figure 3). The velocity probe is connected to the housing with a flexible cable, and it was mounted to a different metal rod 1 meter from the seaward edge of the mud flat and 10 cm above the bed. The velocity probe was oriented such that the cross-shore velocity was aligned with the heading of the topographic transect. Finally, a RBR-Global TWR-2050 pressure sensor was placed at the edge of the vegetated marsh ( Figure 3), and measured waves and tides every 60 minutes by collecting a series of 4096 water elevations measurements at a sampling frequency of 4Hz, which results in a burst length 768 sec (12.8 min). The instrument was deployed 12.5 m. landward of the Vector ADV near the edge of the vegetated marsh platform, and was used to confirm inundation of the marsh and possibly resolve wave dissipation across the transect during storm conditions with sufficient inundation."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The data was recovered from the instruments and post processed to determine the wave and currents experienced at the site during the deployment period. The data were correlated to meteorological and astronomical data (tides and atmospheric pressure) obtained from NOAA tide gage station 8761305, Shell Beach, Louisiana. Standard wave statistics, (wave height and period) were computed with methods described by Tucker and Pitt (2001). Pressure data (frequency range 0.25-2 Hz) was processed to correct for the attenuation of pressure with depth, then standard spectral and zero-crossing non-directional wave parameters were computed. Velocity data from busts were used to calculate the mean velocity magnitude and the 95 th percentile velocities associated with the incoming waves with positive velocities denoting movement in a shoreward direction. The wave statistics generated by spectral methods were used to define other characteristics of the wave field such as wave steepness, the degree of nonlinearity, breaking criteria, the type of breaker and were used to validate predicted waves produced by the model. In order to determine these parameters, waves must be classified as shallow, intermediate or deep water wave using the ratio d/L, where d is the water depth and L is the wave length ( Table 2). The method used to calculate wave length was developed by Hunt (1979), is given by where, With the wave number k, the water depth h and wave period T, the wavelength can be derived using, \u2044 Most waves in the coastal zone are transitional or shallow water waves. In shallow water, wave speed is governed by water depth rather than wavelength therefore wave speed decreases near the shoreline. This decrease in speed shortens wavelength and increases wave height, resulting in larger and steeper waves (Holthuijsen, 2007). Wave steepness increases as waves become nonlinear and is determined by the ratio where H is the wave height. The degree of nonlinearity can be quantified with the Ursell Number, NUrsell, which combines wave steepness and relative water depth (USACE, 1984;Holthuijsen, 2007). Large NUrsell indicate increased nonlinearity and is given by: The Ursell number is also used to determine which wave theory is valid for a given wave (Table 3). Table 3 Range of values for the Ursell Number which can be used to indicate the degree of nonlinearity of a given wave. The Ursell Number is also use to identify the most appropriate wave theory to describe a given wave. The maximum height a wave can attain before it breaks is related to the water depth. This wave height/water depth relationship is often known as the breaker index, \u03b3 and is given by Linear Theory This is a first order estimate and can be as low as 0.5 or as high as 1.5 based on local bed slope, wave steepness or wind (Holthuijsen, 2007). The depth of water in which waves break is related to the wave height and for shallow water is given by 7The type of breaker can be predicted with the surf similarity parameter or Iribarren number (Battjes, 1974;Holthuijsen, 2007), \u03be b , and for shallow water is given by where, tan \u03b1 is the local bed slope, and H br is the wave height at breaking. Values for different breaker types are given in Table 4. "}, {"section_title": "Model Development", "text": "To forecast conditions at the site, the wave environment was modeled using empirical relationships developed by Young and Verhagen (1996) from field observations in shallow environments. This relationship shows the dependence of significant wave height H w and wave period T w on the available fetch X f . Given depth, d and wind speed, U w , the relationship is given by: where, The effects of wind setup, Z sup on local water levels was included in the wave analysis and is given by the relationship, were F' is the effective fetch, C f is the wind friction coefficient, \u03c1a/\u03c1w is the ratio of the density of air to the density of water, and U ow is over water wind velocity at 10 m above the surface (USACE, 1984). To determine U w and to characterize the wind distribution at the study site, an hourly time series of wind speed and direction was collected from the NOAA station 8761305, Shell Beach. A wind rose analysis was performed to obtain wind direction, frequency and magnitude for long term analysis. The records were split into two seasons to investigate seasonal trends. Period 1 corresponds to the cold front season (1 November through 30 March), and period 2 corresponds to the remaining part of the year (1 April through 30 October). After obtaining wave heights with the above relationship a regression analysis was conducted using a 3 rd degree regression function to simulate the transformation/transmission of offshore waves moving from the open water to the nearshore environment. The function was fitted to observations recorded at the study site, and was adjusted based on knowledge of inundation and local depth. The resulting wave heights were used to calculate the total and mean wave energy and wave power arriving at the study site (discussed later). Velocity data was used to calculate local shear stresses to assist in the erosion analysis. The maximum shear stress generated by a wave, \u03c4 w , can be estimated from the relationship, where \u03c1 is the water density, f w is a wave friction coefficient and U b is the maximum wave induced bottom velocity evaluated using linear wave theory and is given by: where k=2\u03c0/L is the wave number. The wave friction coefficient f w , calculated after methods by Kamphuis (1975) and Fredsoe and Deigaard (1992) is given by: with a w /k N the relative roughness. We assumed a a w /k N of 6.3 as used by Tambroni and Seminara (2012) in a similar environment thus used f w1 from above. To describe the erosion at the marsh scarp we used a formulation proposed by Mariotti and Fagherazzi (2010) that incorporates wave power, P into the erosion component in the relationship: where \u03c1 b is the sediment density, D is the sedimentation rate and R is the erosion rate. The erosion rate, R is composed of two terms that express erosion due to bottom shear stress from waves and currents and from turbulence generated from wave breaking and is given by, The shear component is used to describe erosion from bottom shear stresses that occur below the waves such as the water bottom or marsh surface when inundated and is given by, { where \u0391 is the erosion rate, \u03b1 ranges from 1 for cohesive sediments to 1.5 for loose sediments and \u03c4 cr is the critical shear stress needed for erosion to occur.  used a formulation of R break which incorporates wave power P, as the energy term to describe the forces acting on vertical surface of a scarped marsh edge and is given by, { where P is wave power per unit area, P cr is the critical power necessary for erosion, and \u03b2 is a calibrating constant. Wave power is the product of wave energy and wave group velocity and is given by linear theory as 23with, and 25Although these equations relate to bottom sediment erosion,  used the wave breaking term, R break , to model marsh edge erosion by setting P equal to the rate of power dissipation of the wave impact force to the marsh scarp. Similar approaches have been used to correlate long term marsh edge erosion to wave power (Schwimmer, 2001;Marani et al., 2011). Values of 3, 5 and 15 watts were used for P cr , with the lower values representing more erodible material in the mudflat and higher values for the more resistant marsh scarp . A value of 1 was used for the exponent \u03b1 since the site consists of primarily cohesive sediments. Vegetation and sediment characteristics are not accounted for directly in this approach but are included in \u03b2. The \u03b2 parameter was calibrated with the erosion measurements obtained on the marsh terrace to specify an erosion rate in m/y. Measured and predicted wave heights collected during the deployment period were used to calculate total wave energy and wave power arriving at the study site (Eq. 23 & 24). Wave power was used with an estimate of \u03b2 to obtain a preliminary value for R, and then calibrated to correspond to the erosion measured at the site in meters per year (Eq. 22). The calibrated value for \u03b2 was then used to validate R with predicted wave heights over the second deployment period. A correlation was identified between P and R for both deployment periods then \u03b2 was adjusted to correspond to the measured erosion over the second (longer) deployment. Once the \u03b2 parameter was set, it remained unchanged for all future long-term simulations. Quantitative comparisons of model results were performed based on regression analyses and the index of agreement method. The index of agreement is a method that compares timedependent predicted and observed variables developed by Willmott (1981). The index of agreement is a statistical approach to measure a model's performance by comparing model estimates or predictions with reliable pair-wise matched observations (Willmott, 1981).

Three distinct frontal systems with differing characteristics moved through the study area during the deployment period ( Figure 7); however the first system was not fully recorded in the data thus not used in the analysis. The second front (event 1) occurred on 12/18/2012 producing winds from the north at 4-6 m/s for approximately 8 hours (Figure 7). Although this was not an intense system, it was associated with a lower atmospheric pressure (10.1 dbar) and occurred at a higher tide (0.15 m NAVD88 or 0.316 m depth) when the marsh surface was inundated. The third system (event 2) moved through the study site on 12/19/2012 and produced sustained winds from the NNW at 13-15 m/s with gusts up to 18-20 m/s for more than 24 hours. This event was associated with a high atmospheric pressure (10.32 dbar) that, when combined with the set down produced by the northwest wind and a falling tide, eventually suppressed the water elevation exposing the instruments (Figure 7). A difference of 1 millibar (Mb) in atmospheric pressure can cause a difference in sea level of about 0.01 m (Wunsch and Stammer, 1997;Singh and Aung, 2005). However, the rapid onset of persistent winds perpendicular to the coastline produced enough wind set up to inundate the marsh. This can be seen in Figure 7 b (Event 2) where an increase in northerly winds caused an abrupt increase in water level (up to 0.2 m) during a falling tide and remained above the predicted astronomical tide for 8 hours. Also note that increasing atmospheric pressure suppressed the water levels further (Figure 7b), despite a decline in wind intensity, for approximately 24 hours; this suggests that atmospheric pressure may play an important role in contributing to the water level variability at the site. This depression of the water surface under high atmospheric pressure, and its elevation under low atmospheric pressure, is often described as the inverted barometer effect (Wunsch and Stammer, 1997). Changes in sea level due to barometric pressure seldom exceed 30 cm (Singh and Aung, 2005), but this effect can be important as it is usually associated with wind set-up during the storm. This analysis will consist of the complete data from the latter 2 events and will be referred to as event 1 and event 2.  The two frontal systems represent two different scenarios that occurred with different wind speed and atmospheric pressure combinations (Figure 7). Event 1 was a higher water (larger tidal range), lower wind intensity, and lower atmospheric pressure event relative to event 2 which was a period of lower water, higher wind speed and higher atmospheric pressure. This can be seen in the measured data (Figure 8), where during Event 1 (deployment hour 36); relatively high water levels inundate the marsh platform (dashed red lines) allowing waves to reach the upper marsh platform. Event 2, (deployment hour 80 -96), is marked by a decline in the water elevation due to falling tide and rising atmospheric pressure (Figure 7). During the second event the astronomical tide was decreasing (falling tide and lower range due to spring to neap variation) at the same time as a high pressure frontal system was approaching. An abrupt shift in the wind direction (south to northwest) and magnitude (~5 to 15 m/s) contributed to an increase in local water elevation due to wind and wave setup. Within several hours, the effects of atmospheric pressure and astronomical forcing on water levels became dominant over the wind effects, thus suppressing water level locally and facilitating wave attack to the lower mud scarp. This can be seen in Figure 7 and Figure 8, where an increase in wind speed forces an increase in water level while the astronomical tide was predicted to decrease, followed by a large increase in atmospheric pressure with corresponding decrease in water level to an elevation below the predicted astronomical tide."}, {"section_title": "Wave Analysis", "text": "Wave heights observed in Lake Borgne and the lower mud scarp from both events positively correlated with wind speed and wind direction, with the largest waves (~0.9 m) developing during strong northwest (12-15 m/s) winds during event 2 ( Figure 7 and Figure 8). Figure 9 shows simultaneous observations measured at the offshore and nearshore locations. This time series of wave heights demonstrates the effect of water level in controlling wave transmission by hindering wave growth and inducing wave breaking. Figure 9 shows an increase in wave height with the onset of northerly wind at both the offshore and nearshore locations. With persistent winds from a northerly direction, wave heights continued to grow at the offshore location ( Figure 9); however deceasing water levels at the nearshore location ( Figure 9) limit wave growth and force a decrease in wave height.

Each scarp and terrace eroded deeper into the substrate with the lowest terrace, composed of consolidated organic-rich mud without root material, ending at a final scarp that dropped off to 0.5 m below the surface at the most seaward limit of the shoreline. The lowest terrace extended towards the shore approximately 6.5 m to a second scarp approximately 20 cm in height. The second terrace was composed of predominately mud with small amounts of root material, extended 7 m then terminated at a third scarp approximately 10 cm in height. The third terrace was composed of mostly root material and extended approximately 6 m to the marsh edge. This marsh edge morphology was present in varying degrees along the coastline for 500 m in either direction (Figure 12). On 12/22/2012 we recovered the deployed instruments and examined the study area. Erosion rates at the site were significant during the instrument deployment but impacted the marsh edge differentially. Erosion pin measurements on the platform (Figure 13) recorded an average of 0.026 m (n=8) of erosion over the eight day deployment (Table 6)      On the second field visit (4/30/2013) the lower mud scarp could not be accessed due to high water levels at the site and therefore the erosion along the lower profile could not be assessed with either erosion pins or topographic survey. However, the segment of the shoreline that could be measured shows the landward movement of the shoreline with a differential retreat of the scarps and a lowering of the erosional terraces ( Figure 16).  During the second field visit the water elevation at the site was 0.154 m NAVD88 which is 0.115 m above the upper marsh scarp (RBR) elevation. Erosion pins EP03 and EP04 were the only pins recovered due to the elevated water level (Figure 13). The pins appeared to be fully eroded out of the marsh and were resting 1.5 m from the edge of a terrace made of mostly mud with some root material and covered by approximately 0.12 m of water ( Figure 17). When initially placed, the pins were inserted 0.30 m into the upper intermediate scarps (Figure 17). The GPS coordinates for the pins and their orientation were unchanged (Figure 17). A distance from the scarp edge was taken using a tape measure, and added to the previously known insertion depth of the each pin. Despite the error introduced by using a measuring tape, (not greater than 10 cm), this provides for approximately 1.5 m of erosion at this scarp over 4 months. "}, {"section_title": "Model Results", "text": "A numerical wave model was developed to study longer term wave climate predictions and to help in the predictions of marsh edge erosion at the site. Validated against observations, this forecasting tool can be valuable in estimating future marsh edge erosion trends, under future scenarios of climate change (ie. sea level rise, subsidence etc.). Although not the focus of this study, climate change could equally impact the elevation of the different marsh environments and the depth of the basin (ie Lake Borgne), both of which can impact wave climate and hence erosion rates. By correlating observations of incoming wave energy from Lake Borgne with measured nearshore wave heights (Figure 18), a 3 rd degree regression function was developed to transform predicted offshore waves to the nearshore environment ( Figure 18). This function required adjustment as the unadjusted function imposed an artificially lower wave height at the nearshore marsh environment. For example, note in Figure 9 that wave heights of 0.5 -0.6 m were attenuated to approximately 0.2 m while wave height was still increasing offshore. This artificial attenuation is due to the decreased water level during the second event, forcing a decrease in wave height at the nearshore location resulting in the divergence of the measured and predicted signals (Figure 9). Correlation of the observed and predicted wave height remained acceptable after the adjustment with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. This adjusted regression was then used for all future simulations to transform forecasted waves from the offshore to the marsh edge. The transformed waves were then used to calculate total and mean wave power and used in the 3 -2.1x 2 + 1.2873*x + 0.01098 f(x) = 1.333x 3 -2.136x 2 + 1.228x + 0.0089"}, {"section_title": "Measured Wave Data", "text": "Quantitative comparisons based on regression analyses and index of agreement were completed for the simulated waves against observations during the deployment period and are shown in (Table 8). Measured and predicted offshore wave height show a high index of agreement and correlation coefficients with scores of 0.90 and 0.92. Results for the transformation of the offshore waves near the shoreline are slightly less at 0.85 and 0.89, suggesting that the regression function can effectively translate waves from the offshore to the marsh edge with 85 -90% confidence. The lower scores are the result of the decreased wave heights forced by lower water levels during the second event as previously discussed. Regardless, this is a fairly good index of agreement and no further adjustments were performed, owing to the fact that the forecasting model was intended to be simple and allow for several years of wave simulations and resulting erosion. Wave heights were calculated using methods described by Young and Verhagen (1996), using wind data collected at Shell Beach. The wind data was subsampled to select only the winds that occurred when the water level exceeded the elevation of the lower mud. The selected winds were then used to calculate waves, and were binned by wind direction into 15 degree directional bins. Waves generated from winds between 270\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 were then used to calculate wave energy and wave power (see methods for details). A time series comparison between hourly observed and predicted wave heights during the deployment period is shown in Figure 19. Values for both offshore and nearshore predicted waves heights are listed in Table 9. Figure 19 Time series of measured offshore wave heights (red) and predicted offshore wave heights (black) using methods described by Young and Verhagen (1996). Table 9 Predicted wave heights for each annual and winter period. The calculated wave energy and wave power was used to predict the erosion rate at the site in m/y using previously discussed methods by . An erosion rate for the first  deployment period (8 days) was calculated by first using the measured wave heights to compute wave power (P) using Equation 22. Next, the critical wave power necessary to erode the marsh edge, (P cr ), was subtracted from the calculated wave power then the result was adjusted (by changing \u03b2) to generate a value for R that is approximately equal to the erosion measured at the site during the first deployment period. The erosion measured at the upper intermediate scarp, (3 cm over 8 days; 1.37 m/y equivalent for pins EP03 and EP04) was used instead of the erosion rate measured at the lower mud flat (2.7 m over 8 days; 123.2 m/y equivalent) as the former value is more representative of the documented erosion rates of 2.5 m/y (Watzke, 2004). Wave conditions were then predicted for the first deployment period using wind data following the methods of Young and Verhagen (1996). These predicted waves were first compared to the measured waves at the site, and then used to generate values for R to compare with the previously calculated erosion rates using the measured waves. The ratio of P/R using measure waves was compared to P/R using predicted waves and was within 0.1 standard deviations (Table 10). The procedure discussed above was used to find a value of \u03b2 that would produce the erosion measured during the second deployment period (192 days) using the wave power from predicted waves during that period. The ratio P/R for the measured waves during deployment period 1 was also compared to the P/R for the predicted waves for deployment period 2 (no measured waves) and was within 0.06 standard deviations (Table 10). The value of \u03b2 that was determined over the longer deployment was used to predict R for all future simulations; both annual as well as winter periods. Following , values for P cr that ranged from 3 W to 15 W were used. These values correspond to the wave power produced by waves 7-15 cm (assuming wave group celerity of 0.5 m/s). Trenhaile (2009) used similar values for erosion threshold values in a model for steeply sloping bluff retreat caused by broken wave impact forces. Table 10 Predicted values for total wave energy (E), total wave power (P), mean wave power (Pmean) and erosion rates (R) for each annual and winter period considered. The results for wave energy, wave power, and the resulting erosion rate are listed in Table 10, grouped by season and year. The mean erosion rate (R), calculated with winds during the winter season, using values for P cr of 3, 5 and 15 watts, ranged from 5.20 -6.93 m/y (\u00b11.4), while the mean erosion rate (R) using an annual wind record ranged from 3.77 -5.63 m/y (\u00b10.9). This variability in R can be expected since it is dependent on factors that vary annually and or seasonally such as wind speed and direction, water depth, vegetation, root health, and marsh stratigraphy. Larger values of R during the winter season (5 months) compared to the remainder of the year (7 months) indicate that frontal systems contribute a larger proportion of the edge erosion experienced at the site (Table 10). The predicted erosion rates (R), calculated with a P cr of 5, were compared to 3 different published erosion rates that were calculated with field measurements or digitized shorelines (Table 11). We estimated that a value for P cr of 5 would be the most appropriate for the wave power needed to erode the upper intermediate terrace at our site. The erosion rates from  were calculated using digitized shorelines and were measured along a transect that was located within 500 m of the study site. Martinez et al. (2009) also used digitized shorelines and averaged erosion rates across segments of the of Lake Borgne shoreline; this study site was included in a 17 km segment of the Lake Borgne shoreline. Watzke (2004) recorded field measurements of marsh edge erosion from 1999-2003 in Terrebonne Bay. Additional shorelines were digitized in this study from aerial imagery (1989, 2007, and 2013) 1930-1998 and 5.6 m/y from 1930-1995 (Martinez et al., 2009) (Table 11). The predicted values for R appear to underestimate recent (1998-present) erosion rates at the site (17.6 m/y), however the measured rates are much closer (8.89 m/y) after omitting the 2004-2005 erosion (Table 12). However, R predictions overestimate erosion rates when compared to field measurements of marsh edge erosion in Terrebonne Bay (2.5 m/y; Watzke, 2004) as well as historical rates at the site (2.9 m/y; Martinez et al., 2009,Table 11).

Wave regime correlated strongly with wind speed, direction and atmospheric conditions, suggesting that while the first two can aid in generating the waves and determining their direction, the latter (coupled with astronomical variations) governs where waves (large or small) arrive at the marsh edge, and when they do, controls their transformation and transmission onto the shore. The wind speed determines the amount of energy that can be transferred to the waves, while the wind direction determines the fetch, which dictates the distance, thus length of time, that energy the can be transferred to the wave. Wind set up alters the local water level which controls wave growth and decay by controlling the local water depth. In addition to wind effects, atmospheric conditions during cold fronts also significantly influence water levels which determine the location on the shoreline where waves can attack. A difference of 10 dbar in atmospheric pressure can result in approximately a 0.1 m change in sea level. This suggests that the passing of a high pressure system can suppress water levels such that wave attack and erosion is focused on the lower scarps, whereas a low pressure system can elevate water levels such that for the same wind speed and direction, the marsh platform is now attacked and eroded. These effects are more important when considered along with wind and wave set-up, further modulating water level fluctuations during winter storms. This observation is in line with modeling results of Tonelli et al. (2010), where they demonstrated that wave thrust focuses wave energy dissipation at different elevations during fluctuating water levels. During observations at the site, this is documented where event 1 exhibits waves that are nearly fully transmitted (no decrease in wave height), at the lower marsh scarp suggesting that these waves are likely impacting the marsh platform and intermediate or upper marsh scarps. In contrast to event 2 (Figure 8), the energy transmitted is initially focused to the upper scarp and terraces; but within hours is limited to the lower mud scarp, facilitating rapid meter scale erosion (Table 11 and Figure 15). The temporal frequency as well as the duration of winter storms also plays an important role in the distribution of the total wave energy arriving at the marsh edge. This is seen very well during event 2 where the prolonged suppression of the water level concentrated the incoming offshore wave energy (H 10 -0.4-0.9 m) at the level of the lower sharp for nearly 24 hours."}, {"section_title": "Model Predictions for Marsh Edge Erosion", "text": "When comparing measured erosion rates to mean wave power (R versus P), the model results are in good agreement with similar studies in the Venice Lagoon, Italy (Marani et al., 2011) which implies a linear relationship between edge erosion (R) and wave power (P), and likely similar marsh stratigraphy ( Figure 20). The scatter in their results is the product of assessing multiple locations and different observation periods. Our predictions are based on an average erosion rate at one location, therefore an increase or decrease in P would have a linear effect on R, however the slope similarity (0.035 vs. 0.029) reinforces further the site similarity and the proportionality of edge erosion to wave power. Moreover, our predicted values for P and R are generally higher than Marani et al. (2011) despite a similar trend. This can be explained in that Marani et al. (2011) describe sites with a single scarped edge and examined the forces affecting the scarp alone; therefore, water levels above the marsh surface were excluded, effectively decreasing the total energy arriving at the site. Although a reasonable approach, excluding submergence events is equivalent to ignoring erosion of the marsh surface during those events from non-breaking waves. During submergence, while scarp erosion is minimal due to the absence of breaking waves, surface erosion is still possible due to shear produced by the wave orbital velocity at the marsh surface. When multiple scarps exist, such as the site herein, subjected further to different submergence regimes due to water level fluctuations, a hybrid approach to the marsh edge erosion model is needed. A better method would be to treat each scarp or terrace separately, applying a separate break or shear term based on water level. Waves approaching the site can be binned based on water level, such that the wave power is distributed among the scarps and terraces as shear or impact forces. This can better characterize local conditions and help establish a framework where different values for \u03b2 and P cr can be used, that better characterize each terrace and scarp, accounting for the differential erosion rates observed at the study site. The total erosion rate (R) would then be the sum of individual R for each terrace and scarp and could be written as follows: where R break is the erosion to the scarp face due to wave impact forces and R shear is the erosion to the terrace surface due to wave shear stresses once inundated (for n number of scarps/terraces). The predicted values for edge erosion rates (R; long-term) were very similar to long term rates measured at the site using digitized shorelines (Martinez et al., 2009;. However, when predictions are compared to near term rates, they slightly underestimate erosion rates (Table 11). This can be attributed in part to the method used to calculate mean wave power. Since wave power is calculated from seasonal and annual records, by selecting waves within a specified direction (270 -45 degrees), it may inadvertently exclude waves that arrive at the site at oblique angles. Omitting these waves is not critical for smaller storms, however, when they occur during tropical storms the waves can be effectively transmitted onto the marsh platform and contribute to surface erosion by shear produced on the terrace, or scarp erosion by energy release during rapid transformation (refraction/shoaling/breaking). For instance, a 1 m storm surge produced by tropical storms could increase the Lake depth to nearly 3.5 m, as well as inundate the terraces by 0.75 m. This condition may facilitate breaking conditions at the marsh platform, but little erosion due to breaking at the lower mud scarp. The recent increase in frequency and magnitude of tropical storms (Poore et al., 2009) has likely contributed to the increased erosion reported in the near-term rates by  and Martinez et al. (2009). Examination of the near-term and longer-term erosion clearly shows that the longer the record, the lower the erosion rates appear. The lower erosion rate for the long-term record are likely the result of fewer named storms impacting the site (within 200 km), compared to recent years (16 hurricanes from 1930-1997 (0.24/y) versus 7 hurricanes from 1997-2013 (0.44/y)) (Poore et al., 2009; http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#). In addition, the increased magnitude of recent storms, for example Ivan, Katrina, Gustav and Ike has increased the near-term erosion rates (Barras et al, 2008;Couvillion et al., 2011). Watzke (2004) measured short term erosion rates (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003) in Terrebonne Bay noting that during periods with tropical storm activity, 70% more erosion occurred. Additional discrepancies in the predictions of short term erosion may be the result of grouping the effects of vegetation, sediment characteristics and marsh morphology into the \u03b2 parameter. Short term changes in vegetation characteristics that may affect the vegetation's ability to resist erosion, such as seasonal variation or compromise after large storm impacts, is not captured in a time-average value of beta. This seasonal or annual variability is averaged across longer time intervals therefore does not have a significant influence on the long-term rates. The normalizing of transient effects with time allows a single value for \u03b2 to produce reasonable results over longer time scales. Additionally, the value for P cr (critical wave power for erosion) changes with substrate strength which varies with depth (Howes et al., 2010;Marani et al., 2013) and presence of vegetation (Day et al., 1994;Francalanci et al., 2013). The multiple wave cut terraces at the study site, each eroding successively deeper into the substrate, suggest multiple values of P cr are needed to better characterize the marsh edge resistance to erosion at the study site. Moreover, water level dictates the primary erosive forces applied to the marsh edge, with shear dominating the terraced surfaces and impact/breaking forces dominating the intermediate scarps, each affecting different properties of the substrate, necessitating different values for P cr to adequately characterize the marsh edge. Finally, although effects of nonlinear waves were included in the wave prediction methods (Young and Verhagen, 1996), as well as in the transfer function, some assumptions needed for the analysis were based on linear wave theory. Since nonlinear waves transfer more energy than linear waves during transformation, the results would be biased towards under-predicting the amount of wave energy thus yielding generally a lower erosion rate."}, {"section_title": "Marsh edge erosion trends", "text": "H1 -Short period, high amplitude wind waves generated during cold fronts transfer a greater amount of energy to the marsh edge than waves generated during fair weather conditions. Measured wave characteristics support this hypothesis by showing the waves approaching the site are in fact high order nonlinear waves ( Figure 10). During event 2, 91% of the waves were breaking at the shoreline, and combined with event 1, generated 80% of the total wave energy at the site during observations. H2 -The energy transferred to the marsh edge during winter storms accounts for a greater proportion of the observed shoreline erosion compared to erosion rates produced during fair weather conditions. This hypothesis is supported by the model results as the predicted values of R (erosion rate) are greater during the 5 months of the cold front season (~5.44 m/y) than for the entire year (~4.02 m/y) (Table 11). Since mean wave power is proportional to the erosion rate, a reduction in the annual rate compared to that of the winter storm season indicates that the average wave power generated is higher during the winter season (with the exception of large storms). For example, if the erosion rate for the annual period (~4.02 m/y) is less than the erosion rate for the cold front season (~5.44 m/y), then summer erosion must be significantly lower. Increased winter erosion rates were also documented in Terrebonne Bay at 0.77 m/y, which is more than two times greater than summer erosion rates of 0.31 m/y (Watzke, 2004). In addition, published long-term erosion rates are often inferred by examining shoreline change maps over temporal scales that include seasonal variations and post storm effect that may contribute to significant errors in identifying the location of the shoreline. Documented erosion rates that include intervals of large tropical storms are often characterized as purely event driven. While the importance of post storm events such as winter storms is acknowledged as a potential mechanism in the continued erosion of the shoreline, they are not fully explored as a significant erosion process. For example, storm effects such as marsh surface denudation and increase in salinity and sulfides cause excessive plant stress and can contribute to future wetland losses (Barras, 2007;Steyer et al., 2010). This secondary loss of wetlands is incorporated into the erosion rates calculated from data sets that span multiple years and do not distinguish between causes of erosion during these periods, which can underestimate the significance of winter storms in this process. Ultimately, however, the loss is through marsh edge erosion and waves are still the chief driver."}, {"section_title": "Formation of scarp", "text": "The regression of the marsh is associated with a steepening of the cross shore profile, which eventually leads to scarp formation (Schwimmer and Pizzuto, 2000;Schwimmer, 2001). Increases in water depth results in increased wave power reaching the marsh edge (Schwimmer and Pizzuto, 2000;Tonelli et al., 2010). For a given wave forcing, scarp erosion is a discontinuous process, with periods of surface erosion alternating with scarp failure and mass wasting (Allen, 1990;Schwimmer, 2001;Francalanci, 2013). Bank retreat was recently shown through numerical modeling and laboratory studies to be the result of wind waves weakening the substrate by triggering the formation of overhang profiles that slump during subsequent wave attack Francalanci et al., 2013). The presence of vegetation helps resist this process by delaying mass failures and maintaining the scarp profile (Day et al., 1994;Francalanci, 2013;Pant, 2013). Wilson and Allison (2008) proposed an equilibrium profile for eroding marsh edges in southeast Louisiana which includes the lateral incision and retreat of the marsh surface forming a marsh scarp and an erosional surface that extends seaward until reaching a depth below local wave base (1.0 -1.5 m depending on adjacent bay size and depth). The profile was described as erosion dominated with retreat rates at 1 m/y and was widespread throughout Breton Sound and Barataria Bay marshes. The preliminary visit to our site in April 2012 demonstrated this general morphology with the addition of small erosive scarps at the marsh edge with terraces up to 1 meter submerged by approximately 0.15-0.2 m during high water. However when we returned to the site in December 2012 it was apparent that a large event had negatively impacted the site as the marsh edge now consisted of a broad platform approximately 25 m wide with multiple wave cut terraces extending from the marsh surface to the lower scarp of organic rich mud. This likely represents a disruption in the equilibrium marsh edge profile with a shift toward an equilibrium state."}, {"section_title": "Mechanism of Retreat", "text": "Wave impact forces cause failure of the marsh edge by exerting unsteady normal forces to the scarp and shear stress on the terraces (Francalanci, 2013;Tonelli et al., 2010). As previously discussed, water levels have a significant effect on how wave forces focus energy on the scarp. An increase in water level allows larger waves to approach the marsh edge. Once transformed near the edge, these waves are highly nonlinear and apply large impact forces to the scarp as they break. During decreased water levels wave height growth is limited by water depth; in the meantime, offshore wave heights are not appreciably affected. Thus during low water conditions large waves approach the lower mud scarp, transform rapidly, and then break delivering concentrated energy to the lower scarp. Changes in water levels also control shear stresses contributed by waves. In general, increase in water depth decreases bottom shear stresses, however higher water levels inundate upper and intermediate terraces, thus promoting erosion not only by wave impact but also by bottom shear stresses produced by wave orbits. Vegetation has the effect of protecting the marsh surface from wave erosion ; however the already severely impacted marsh edge at our site could not resist these forces. As the marsh root mats decay, soil shear strengths decrease appreciably allowing for physical processes to remove surface soils quickly (Day et al., 1994). At low water levels, bottom shear stresses produced by waves increase and promote the removal of previously eroded material below the lower scarp, thus maintaining the local water depth allowing the continued support of large wave during high water events. The consistent passing of frontal systems at different water levels focuses wave forces to different locations along the marsh resulting in the differential erosion that changes the profile from a scarped edge to the multiple stepped terraces identified at the site. Removal of the protective effects of the vegetation by decomposition and/or erosion exposes the less resistant material to the erosive forces of the waves resulting in very high rates of erosion. The rapid erosion measured at the lower mud scarp (2.8 m over 8 days) must be indicative of a transient self-organization toward an equilibrium state. We suspect that larger events, such as the passing of Hurricane Isaac on August 29, 2012 may have impacted the site leaving the marsh surface denuded. Denudation is common in intermediate, brackish, and salt marshes after large storms, and can range in width from 2 m to 13 km (Barras, 2007;Barras et al., 2010). Large areas of denuded marsh were found in Breton Sound after Hurricane Katrina (Barras, 2007). Also, the USGS reported significant damage to the marshes east of the Mississippi River in coastal Louisiana associated with Hurricane Isaac; however detailed information on location and extent of the damage could not be found (http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=3398). This is further supported with data from the Shell Beach Station recording winds trending from the N to NE at 10-25 m/s for greater than 24 hours while the site was inundated by water levels 0.5-1m. These conditions could have produced sufficiently large waves to damage the site. Winds increased to near 30 m/s from the E to SE with water levels in excess of 3 m. Denuded marshes can partly or completely recover in one growing season if the root mat is not entirely destroyed (Chabreck and Palmisano, 1973;Chamberlain, 1959); however a few centimeters of additional surface erosion can prevent recovery (Morton and Barras, 2011). The subsequent passing of repeated frontal systems at our site, before the marsh could recover, differentially eroded the damaged marsh surface exposing the less resistant substrate. This facilitated further erosion at the marsh edge to produce the high erosion rates measured at the site. These accelerated rates can be expected to continue until a new equilibrium is met. While results of this process are not clear or available in the literature, there is an underlying process unidentified. This can be expected with the temporal and spatial uncertainty and variability of digital shorelines thus making it difficult to discern the processes involved in short-term shoreline change. Wilson and Alison (2008) assumed a constant (and uniform) rate of lateral retreat in their conceptual model and recognized the potential influence of episodic winter and tropical storms as a method of shoreline retreat however; they do not describe how these events would disrupt the profile. We provide results herein that help describe the mechanism by which significant marsh edge erosion occurs during a frontal season following a significant impact to the marsh shoreline. This process supplements the Wilson and Allison (2008) conceptual model by describing a method of scarp edge development and evolution. Although the exact mechanism by which the profile was disrupted is unknown, the return to an equilibrium (state) profile can be described through field observations as follows ( Figure 21 "}, {"section_title": "Models of Marsh Scarp Retreat", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Meteorological conditions such as wind direction and intensity and atmospheric pressure gradients are the chief driver of wave climate and water depth at the site. Water levels have a significant effect on how wave forces shape the shoreline by controlling the location where waves can attack and by determining the type of wave forces (shear vs. impact) that will dominate the erosion process. This control imposed by water level resulted in the differential erosion observed at our site. Increased water levels inundate the intermediate terraces which supports larger waves that eroded the marsh edge by both wave impact forces and bottom shear stresses. Decrease water levels limits wave from reaching the upper platform thus focusing wave impact forces on the lower scarp. Bottom shear stresses increase and promote the removal of eroded material from below the lower scarp maintaining the water depth. The method used to implement the edge erosion submodel use to predict erosion at the marsh edge (R), gave reasonable estimates for long term erosion rates (4.02 \u00b11.2 m/y) compared to calculated long-term rates at our site (5.3 m/y) using re-analysis of digital shorelines developed by  and Martinez et al. (2009) supplemented further by digitizing additional shorelines for more recent years. The predicted value of R underestimates near-term erosion rates which we attribute to the increased frequency and magnitude of tropical storms as well as the need for more appropriate values of \u03b2 and P cr to characterize the marsh edge stratigraphy. High rates of erosion measured at the site (2.8 m lower mud scarp and 1.5 m intermediate scarp) suggest a transient self-organization toward an equilibrium state. Disturbance to the marsh edge, possibly due to the passing of Hurricane Isaac on August 29, 2013 may have destabilized the edge by eroding and denuding the marsh surface. Without the protective effects of the vegetation, the shoreline is more susceptible to repeated wave attack during frontal storms. Wave forces cause the failure of the scarp by exerting intermittent normal and shear stress on the soil, at a location determined by water level, creating multiple erosive scarps and terraces thus imposing a non-equilibrium condition. The subsequent passing of repeated frontal systems, before marsh recovery, differentially erodes the damaged marsh surface exposing the less resistant substrate thus facilitating further erosion and producing the high erosion rates measured at the site. These accelerated rates can be expected to continue until a new equilibrium is met."}]
