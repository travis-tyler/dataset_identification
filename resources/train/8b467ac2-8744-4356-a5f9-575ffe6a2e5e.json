According to United States Department of Education statistics; 43% of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students seeking an associate's degree had attained some degree of certificate five years after initial enrollment: 8% earned a bachelor's degree; slightly less than a quarter (23.7%) earned an associate's degree; and 11% earned a certificate. Furthermore, certificate seekers were more likely than associate degree seekers to attain a postsecondary credential (55% versus 43%, respectively); within five years of initial enrollment, 50% had earned a certificate, and 4% had earned an associate's degree. Regardless of initial degree objective, students who enrolled full time were more likely to attain either the degree they sought of a bachelor's degree than those who were enrolled part time. Finally, associate's degree seekers who delayed entry into postsecondary education by at least one year were much less likely to complete and associate's or bachelor's degree within five years than their counterparts who did not delay.
