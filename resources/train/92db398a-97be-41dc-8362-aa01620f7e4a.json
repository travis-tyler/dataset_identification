[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Singapore schools have consistently been outperforming their counterparts in mathematics and science on each and every cycle of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) ever since its inception in 1995. The findings of the recent cycle of TIMSS reveal that Korea and Singapore are the top-performing countries in science in TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, followed by Finland, Japan, Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei. At the eighth grade, Singapore had the highest average science achievement. This was followed by the next highest-performing-countries for science achievement, namely Korea, Chinese Taipei, and Japan. There is growing evidence that teacher preparation or preparedness is a powerful predictor of students' achievement, perhaps even overcoming socioeconomic and language background factors. Although a sound knowledge of science would seem to be a prerequisite for effective science teaching, evidence directly linking teacher preparation in science to the achievement of their students is quite limited. A meta-analysis of the effects of teachers' subject matter preparation on their students' achievement in mathematics and science found some studies showing a positive effect, but in general results were mixed (Wilson, Floden, & Ferrini-Mundi, 2002). In addition to the importance of a college or university degree or advanced degree, the literature reports widespread agreement that teachers should have solid mastery of the content in the subject to be taught. In a review of teacher quality research, the relationship between teachers' advanced degrees and student achievement was examined and found a positive relationship between subject-specific advanced degrees and student achievement in mathematics and in science. Besides, evidence from recent meta-analyses of research conducted in the United States shows that teacher professional development that is focused on science content has a significant positive effect on student achievement and that the amount of professional development was an important factor (Garet, Porter, Desimone, Birman, & Yoon, 2001;Johnson, Kahle & Fargo, Abstract. The ultimate aim of this research was to explore the contribution of teacher preparedness or readiness (in terms of their academic background, confidence in teaching science and career satisfaction) towards the achievement in science among Malaysian and Singaporean eighth-graders. The TIMSS 2011 international assessment of student achievement at the eighth grade comprises written tests together with sets of questionnaires that gather information on the educational and social contexts for achievement in science. The TIMSS 2011 science achievement scale was used to gauge Grade 8 students' science achievement. Confidence in Teaching Science Scale and Teacher Career Satisfaction Scale was used to explore science teachers' confidence in teaching science and career statisfaction, respectively. Data were obtained from 5,733 Malaysian students and 5,927 Singaporean students who participated in the TIMSS 2011 study using two-stage random sample design.Higher science achievement among Singaporean eighth grade students was related to teachers having more teaching experience, being confident in science teaching, and being satisfied with careers . However, these findings were not evident in Malaysia. The findings of such a research may help science educators and policy makers to identify and nurture the strong learning prerequisites of early adolescents in different education systems.

Chandrasegaran Curtin University, Australia ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ 2007). Research studies have shown that teachers' self-confidence in their teaching skills is not only associated with their professional behavior, but also with students' performance and motivation (Urdan & Schoenfelder, 2006). Hence, higher science achievement was related to teachers' having more teaching experience, being confident in their science teaching, and being satisfied with their careers. It is undoubtedly and undeniably that students' achievements are linked to teacher qualifications. However, in what way and how much the degree of teachers' preparedness or readiness affects students' achievement remain unanswerable. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on the predictive effects of teacher preparation on science achievement among early adolescents in Southeast Asian education systems. Hence, the purpose of the present research was to examine the predictive effects of teacher preparation (in terms of science teachers' formal education, teachers majoring in education and science, teachers' years of experience, teachers' professional development, teachers' preparation to teach the TIMSS science topics, teachers' confidence in teaching science, teachers' career satisfaction) on science achievement among eighth grade students in Malaysia and Singapore who participated in the TIMSS 2011 assessment. The findings of such a research may help science educators and policy makers to identify and nurture the strong learning prerequisites of early adolescents in different education systems."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background and Socio-cognitive Factors Influencing Teachers' Preparedness", "text": "The literature revealed that teachers' educational or academic background including their qualifications has great bearing on their preparedness or readiness in teaching science and mathematics. For example, Wenglinsky (1992) claimed that teachers who have a strong academic background and are qualified to teach in the related subject are better in the teaching profession and can make a difference to becoming an effective teacher. Among the sociocultural factors influencing teachers' preparedness to teach science include their formal education, years of related experience as well as the major subjects they took during the formal training such as pure science or TIMSS science related topics and science education. The studies by Monk (1994) as well as Saderholm and Tretter (2008) showed that the number of science courses taken by a science teacher had a positive influence on students' science achievement while teacher content preparedness has a large impact on students' achievement. Teachers' preparedness also includes their resourcefulness as well as lesson preparation that is related to a student's daily life, their readiness to collaborate with others to improve teaching through regular participation in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) as well as their ability to evaluate or assess students' learning. According to the NCATE (2010), knowledge and skill in how to teach are a must. Hence teachers' involvement in CPD to develop required knowledge and skills is also an important contributing factor towards teachers' preparedness. The taxonomy of educational behaviours for cognitive, affective and socio-psychological domains should be referred to more often by teachers for better understanding of pedagogical teaching approaches and evaluation/ assessment methods. Teachers' ability to formulate indicators for the assessment/evaluation of students' learning from the aspects of their cognitive (e.g., through Bloom's Taxonomy) and affective (e.g., using Krathwohl, Bloom & Masia's Taxonomy) development should also be enhanced regularly for better preparedness."}, {"section_title": "Affective Factors and the Relationship of Readiness with Students' Achievement", "text": "Hence, apart from teachers' qualifications, their preparedness or readiness could also be evaluated from the perspectives of affective domains or psychological factors such as their confidence levels and career satisfaction. 'Self-confidence' is a combination of general self-efficacy as well as self-esteem, i.e., the general feelings of selfworth or self-value. 'Self-confidence' is operationally defined as the belief of oneself towards his/her personal worth and the likelihood of he / she to be successful. 'Self-efficacy' is belief of oneself towards his/her own capacity to be engaged in and execute a specific behavior. It is the belief that a person has about whether or not he/she can succeed at completing tasks. There are two types of self-efficacy, i.e., 'general and specific self-efficacy' . The former is the belief in one's general capacity to handle tasks. The latter refers to beliefs about one's ability to perform specific tasks (e.g., cycling, studying and so forth) (Lefton, 1991;O'Neill & McMahon, 2011;Weiner, 1979). How will teachers' readiness or confidence levels influence students' motivation to learn for better achievement? Research has shown that effective teachers understand and are able to apply strategies with confidence ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ to help students to enhance their performance. For example, a longitudinal research by Goldhaber (2007) who examined over 700,000 student records in grades 4-6 and the licensing records for almost 24,000 teachers revealed positive results in this respect. He found that the students of teachers who are prepared show stronger learning gains in comparison to unprepared and underprepared teachers. Since teachers' confidence levels are important affective factors contributing to students' motivation levels and their achievement, the indicators in the affective domain should also be formulated in any evaluative studies of educational programmes focusing on the aspects of students' motivation and their achievement resulting from their active engagement in science/mathematics related activities. For example, the students may find the task inherently enjoyable (i.e., they have intrinsic motivation) and have an established long-term interest in particular topics (i.e., with personal interest). They will thus believe that they have the ability and confidence to succeed in the learning task (expectancy and self-efficacy belief ); and believe that success will be related to effort (an attribution) (Atkinson, Atkinson, Smith & Bem, 1993;Phillips, 2007). Students are then expected to be more motivated to learn and achieve better academically as according to Keller (2008), effective instructional pedagogy anchored on e.g., the 'Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction' (ARCS) instructional theory may influence motivation and performance."}, {"section_title": "Background Information of Malaysia and Singapore in TIMSS 2011", "text": "TIMSS is an international comparative study that has been implemented by The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) since 1995.

The plausible values, an approach developed by Sheehan (1987, 1989) and based on the imputation theory of Rubin (1987), are random elements from the set of scores (i.e., random draws from the marginal posterior of the latent distribution) that could be attributed to each student.

Research has shown that teachers' self-confidence in their teaching skills is not only associated with their professional behaviour, but also with students' performance and motivation (Bandura, 1997;Henson, 2002). Table 10 illustrates Teacher Career Satisfaction. Students were scored according to their teachers' degree of agreement with six statements on the Teacher Career Satisfaction scale. Students with Satisfied teachers had a score of at least 10.4, which corresponds to their teachers \"agreeing a lot\" with three of the six statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other three, on average. Students with Less Than Satisfied teachers had a score no higher than 7.0, which corresponds to their teachers' \"disagreeing a little\" with three of the six statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other three, on average. All other students had Somewhat Satisfied teachers. In Malaysia, the eighth grade science teachers reported somewhat higher levels of career satisfaction with 66% of students taught by 'Satisfied' teachers.

Almost all of the eighth grade students (87%) were taught science by teachers who were 'Satisfied' or 'Somewhat Satisfied' with their careers. The eighth grade students taught by 'Satisfied' teachers and 'Somewhat Satisfied' teachers had higher science achievement (592 respectively) than those taught by 'Less than Satisfied' teachers (576). It is noteworthy that several of the highest performing East Asian countries in science at the eighth grade (e.g., Japan and Korea) had among the lowest percentages of students taught by 'Satisfied' teachers (22% and 13%, respectively).
