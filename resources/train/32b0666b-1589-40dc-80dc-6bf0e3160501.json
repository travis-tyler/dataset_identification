The second and third measurements were then averaged to obtain one value (11) .

APOL1 risk status, which has been demonstrated to be associated with CKD progression (12, 13) , was assessed in African Americans who provided consent for DNA testing at visit 1 per methods described previously (13) . We imputed APOL1 risk status as low risk for white participants and characterized black participants as APOL1 low risk or APOL1 high risk based on the number of risk alleles.

We generated a scatterplot of eGFR and age across visits by diabetes status at baseline using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to find a curve of best fit for each diabetes group. To estimate individual eGFR slopes over time, we used linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts and random slopes. These models were fit on diabetes status at baseline as a nominal variable to adjust the baseline level of eGFR and included an interaction term between diabetes status at baseline and time to estimate annual decline in eGFR by diabetes categories. Linear mixed models were run unadjusted and adjusted, with the latter model including the following diabetes and kidney disease-related risk factors: age, sex, race-center, BMI, systolic blood pressure, hypertension medication use, HDL, prevalent coronary heart disease, annual family income, education status, and smoking status, as well as each variable interacted with time. Continuous covariates were centered at the analytic population mean. We tested model assumptions and considered different covariance structures, comparing nested models using Akaike information criteria. We identified the unstructured covariance model as the most optimal and conservative approach. From the mixed models, we described the overall mean annual decline by diabetes status at baseline and used the random effects to estimate best linear unbiased predictions to describe the distributions of yearly slopes in eGFR by diabetes status at baseline and displayed them using kernel density plots.\nBecause of substantial variation in annual eGFR slope among people with diagnosed diabetes, we sought to identify risk factors that were associated with faster decline. Among those with diagnosed diabetes, we compared unadjusted and adjusted mean annual decline in eGFR by race-APOL1 risk status (white, black-APOL1 low risk, and black-APOL1 high risk), systolic blood pressure (,140 and $140 mmHg), smoking status (never, former, and current), prevalent coronary heart disease (no prevalent coronary heart disease and prevalent coronary heart disease), diabetes medication use (no medication use, oral medication use only Because some of these variables were only available at visit 2, we required that participants included in this subgroup analysis attend both visits 1 and 2 and not be missing information on APOL1 or the variables assessed at visit 2 to ensure a consistent sample size. In addition to diabetes and kidney disease-related risk factors in the adjusted model, we also included diabetes medication use and HbA 1c to account for diabetes severity in these analyses.\nNext, to explore potential hyperfiltration, we used a linear spline model to allow the slope to change for each diabetes category between the first 3 years of follow-up (visit 1 to visit 2) and the subsequent time period (visit 2 to visit 5). We reported the unadjusted and adjusted distributions of annual eGFR slopes by diabetes status (assessed at baseline) from visit 1 to visit 2 and visit 2 to visit 5.\nTo test the robustness of our results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we did not assign eGFR values of 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in those who developed end-stage renal disease. All analyses were conducted in Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population Characteristics", "text": "There were 15,517 participants included in the analysis: 13,698 (88%) without diabetes, 634 (4%) with undiagnosed diabetes, and 1,185 (8%) with diagnosed diabetes at baseline.

From visit 1 to visit 2, the distribution of adjusted decline in eGFR among those with undiagnosed diabetes at baseline was less negative than those without diabetes, suggesting that they did not experience as much decline over the 3-year interval (Fig. 2) . Similarly, the adjusted mean annual decline in eGFR was largest among those with diagnosed diabetes, followed by those without diabetes and then by those with undiagnosed diabetes at baseline (22. Over the remainder of follow-up, from visit 2 to visit 5, we observed that the distributions of unadjusted and adjusted slopes among those with undiagnosed diabetes at baseline were more negative than those without diabetes at baseline (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\nSensitivity analyses without imputation of eGFR for those who developed end-stage renal disease attenuated the values of the mean annual declines in eGFR, but the significant differences between diabetes categories remained (Supplementary Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this prospective, community-based cohort followed over 26 years, we observed that diabetes is an important risk factor for kidney function decline. Persons with undiagnosed diabetes at baseline were also at higher risk of eGFR decline; interestingly, this followed a period of relatively little average eGFR decline, which may reflect early hyperfiltration. Large individual variation in eGFR trajectories was observed, particularly among persons with diabetes, with race, systolic blood pressure, and glycemia explaining some of the risk differences. Given the wellestablished evidence that glycemic control prevents or slows microvascular damage, our findings reinforce the need for early diagnosis of diabetes and glycemic control following diagnosis (16) (17) (18) . Our results also suggest that racial disparities persist over and above measured genetic and traditional risk factors. Few other community-based studies have evaluated differences in kidney function decline by diabetes status over a long period through mid-and late life. One study of 10,184 Canadians aged $66 years with creatinine measured during outpatient visits showed results largely consistent with our findings but with much shorter follow-up (median of 2 years) (19) .\nOther studies of eGFR change in a general population have found smaller declines than our results (20, 21) . A study conducted in Japanese participants aged 40-79 years found a decline of only 20.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year over the course of two assessments 10 years apart (compared with our estimate among those without diabetes: 21.6 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 /year). This is particularly interesting, as Japan is known to have a higher prevalence of CKD and end-stage renal disease than the U.S. (20) . However, this study evaluated participants over a shorter time frame and required attendance at both assessments, which may have decreased the likelihood of capturing severe cases and resulted in underestimation of decline.\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging also assessed kidney function over time in a general population of 446 men, ranging in age from 22 to 97 years at baseline, each with up to 14 measurements of creatinine clearance assessed between 1958 and 1981 (21) . They also found a smaller decline than we did (20.8 mL/min/year), although this study also had notable differences. Their main analysis excluded participants with hypertension and history of renal disease or urinary tract infection and those treated with diuretics and/or antihypertensive medications. Without those exclusions, their overall estimate was 21.1 mL/min/year, which better reflects a community-based population and our results. The study also took place prior to ARIC, and risk factor and treatment patterns may have differed due to secular trends. In addition, they used creatinine clearance instead of eGFR as a measure of kidney function, and although this may not affect computation of change, creatinine clearance estimates are known to be higher than GFR (22).\nIn our evaluation of risk factors that might explain the variation in decline seen among those with diagnosed diabetes, we observed that black race, systolic blood pressure $140 mmHg, insulin use, and HbA 1c $9% ($75 mmol/mol) were particularly important. Although the APOL1 high-risk genotype is a known risk factor for eGFR decline, African Americans with low-risk APOL1 status continued to be at higher risk than whites even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, diabetes medication use, and HbA 1c . This suggests there could be differences over time by risk factors, diabetes severity, access to health care, quality of health care, or health care utilization not accounted for in our analysis. 2 ), HDL (reference: 51.60 mg/dL), prevalent coronary heart disease (reference: no; and yes), smoking status (reference: never; and former and current), annual family income (reference: ,$25,000; and $$25,000), and educational status (reference: high school; and less than high school, vocational school, college, and graduate/professional school).\nOur results are relevant to the design and conduct of clinical trials. Hard clinical outcomes like end-stage renal disease are relatively rare, and a 30-40% decline in eGFR is now accepted as a surrogate end point for CKD progression (4). We provide data on patient subgroups that may experience accelerated trajectories of kidney function decline, which has implications for estimating sample size and ensuring adequate power in future clinical trials. Our results also suggest that end points of eGFR decline might not be appropriate for patients with newonset diabetes, in whom declines may actually be slower than among persons without diabetes.\nSlower eGFR decline among those with undiagnosed diabetes, who are likely early in the course of diabetes, is consistent with the hypothesis of hyperfiltration. Similar to other studies, we found that persons with undiagnosed diabetes had higher GFR at the outset, but this was a transient phenomenon, as they ultimately experienced larger declines in kidney function than those without diabetes over the course of follow-up (23-25). Whether hyperfiltration is a universal aspect of early disease and, if not, whether it portends worse long-term outcomes is uncertain. Existing studies investigating hyperfiltration as a precursor to adverse kidney outcomes are inconsistent (24, 26, 27) and often confounded by diabetes severity factors like duration (27) . We extended this literature by separating undiagnosed and diagnosed diabetes to help address that confounding.\nOur analysis has certain limitations. For our main analysis, we defined diabetes status and covariates at baseline and did not account for changes over time in diabetes status or covariates like subsequent medication use. Detection of possible hyperfiltration was limited to two measurements of eGFR per person over a 3-year time interval and up to three measurements in the subsequent 23 years. Undiagnosed diabetes at visit 1 was defined solely by glucose, which may have led to some misclassification. A single measurement of fasting glucose is prone to measurement error, given that only 76% of those with diabetes diagnosed by a single fasting glucose are confirmed by a second measurement (28) . This suggests we could have overestimated the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, although this bias would be conservative. There were also changes in clinical definitions of diabetes during the study period. At the time of visit 1 (1987-1989) , a higher threshold of glucose was recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes (140 mg/dL). We used a more conservative definition ($126 mg/dL) for consistency with current clinical guidelines (29) . We did not account for competing events (e.g., death) that may have prevented observation of eGFR measurements; diabetes is a strong risk factor for mortality (30) . Given the strong association between kidney function decline and mortality (31) , this may have resulted in underestimation of differences in trajectories between participants with and without diabetes. Additionally, although we were able to use undiagnosed diabetes to likely capture those early in the course of disease, we did not have information on diabetes duration at baseline among those with undiagnosed or diagnosed diabetes. Finally, albuminuria, itself a strong predictor of eGFR decline, was not assessed in ARIC until visit 4.\nStudy strengths include the racially diverse community-based cohort of middle-aged adults in the U.S. in the late 1980s followed through the early 2010s. Changes in kidney function were captured prior to the approval of new diabetes medications with kidney-related effects, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs, which might confound results. We also had complete follow-up for end-stage renal disease from the linkage of ARIC to the USRDS surveillance system, allowing us to account for those who developed end-stage renal disease, even if they did not return to a study visit.\nIn conclusion, we found that diabetes was associated with much steeper kidney function decline in a communitybased population followed over 26 years. We quantified the annual expected decline in eGFR among those without diabetes, with undiagnosed diabetes, and with diagnosed diabetes, which may be useful to inform future monitoring and clinical trials. Our results reinforce the importance of glycemic and risk factor control in the prevention of CKD."}]
