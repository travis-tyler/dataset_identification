[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Accurate estimates of storm surge magnitude and frequency are essential to coastal flood risk studies. Much research has focused on tide-surge interaction and joint probability techniques to combine multiple cyclone characteristics. In the Bay of Bengal, extreme water levels are derived from numerical storm surge models based on an idealised cyclone event; however, uncertainty within such calculations for this region is poorly understood, especially when propagated through to the flood hazard. We use the IBTrACs data set to estimate natural variability in four key parameters used to describe an idealised cyclone and create a set of idealised but equally likely ''1 in 50 year'' recurrence interval cyclone events. Each idealised cyclone is then used to force a storm surge model to give predicted peak water levels along the northern Bay of Bengal coast. Finally, extreme water level uncertainty is propagated through an inundation model to predict flood extent and depth over inland coastal floodplains. The descriptive parameters of 18 cyclone events (between 1990 and 2008) appear to show no statistically significant variation (at the 5 % level) due to landfall location, which allows us to pool characteristics for the entire Bay of Bengal. We find that the natural variability of cyclone parameters translates into large uncertainty both for storm surge height (of the order of metres) and for coastal inundation (hundreds of km 2 ). Using the variability estimates for a 1-in-50-year cyclone event making landfall at the 2007 Sidr location, cyclone central pressure drop uncertainty had the greatest effect upon simulated storm surge magnitude. However, uncertainty within cyclone track characteristics (track speed, landfall and genesis location) has greater influence on subsequent inundation extent. Storm surge hazard uncertainty due to cyclone \nNat Hazards (2014 ) 72:983-996 DOI 10.1007/s11069-014-1046 parameter variability was found to be comparable to the inundation difference simulated when the peak surge coincided with either a mean spring high or low water. Our research indicates the importance of improving extreme water level estimates along the Bay of Bengal coastline for robust flood hazard management decisions in the Bay of Bengal."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coastal flood risk from tropical cyclone storm surge is high in the northern Bay of Bengal, and projected to increase with sea level rise (see Murty et al. 1986; Karim and Mimura 2008) . Several hydrodynamic models have been developed to simulate storm surges in the region (e.g. Flather 1994) , which are typically forced with wind and pressure fields from an idealised cyclone model (e.g. Jelesnianski and Taylor 1973) . One successful example that has shown predictive skill is the IIT-D (Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi) storm surge model (see Dube et al. 2009 ), used as part of the Bangladesh early warning system (Dube et al. 1994) , and credited with reducing loss of life in the 2007 cyclone Sidr flooding event (Paul 2009 ); especially when compared to a similar cyclone event in 1991.\nCyclone Sidr was a category IV storm that made landfall on the Bangladesh coastline (at 89.8\u00b0E) on the 15th November 2007, resulting in a 5.8 m surge which, despite the efforts of forecasters, left 3,406 people dead and caused damage totalling US$1.7 Billion (Paul 2009; Dube et al. 2009 ). To further reduce storm surge fatalities in Bangladesh, improved coastal flood risk estimates are a priority, and this demands the accurate quantification of storm surge characteristics.\nIn the Bay of Bengal, the low occurrence of cyclone events, and a lack of high-quality water level records with which to estimate the recurrence interval of an extreme water level, has led previous coastal flood hazard studies to estimate extreme water levels using an analytical solution of storm surge based on more available wind speed data (e.g. Chowdhury et al. 1998) . Indeed, even where good-quality water level records are available, the irregularity of cyclone occurrence makes statistical estimates of extremes problematic (Haigh et al. 2013a, b) .\nMore recently, hydrodynamic models have been used to simulate sea level and subsequent inundation based on a single storm event in the Bay of Bengal (e.g. Madsen and Jakobsen 2004; Kumar et al. 2008) . Extreme water level estimates have been produced for the east Indian coastline by extrapolating cyclone parameters from an observations database to create an idealised ''1 in 50 year'' cyclone event (based on central pressure), which is then used to force a physics-based numerical storm surge model to predict the extreme storm surge at the coast (e.g. Jain et al. 2010a; Rao et al. 2010) . However, within this context of an idealised ''single storm'' event, each of these cyclone parameters are subject to variability (see Resio et al. 2009 ), which potentially translates to large simulated storm surge uncertainties (e.g. Azam et al. 2004 ); especially as a 1-in-50-year cyclone event does not correspond to a 1-in-50-year extreme water level.\nIn the US, the latest method of cyclone-induced extreme water level estimation uses a joint probability method (JPM) which statistically combines multiple storm parameter frequency distributions of these key cyclone parameters (e.g. Resio et al. 2009; Irish et al. 2011) to determine flood hazard and risk (e.g. Condon and Sheng 2011) . However, such an approach has not been performed in the Bay of Bengal. Storm surge hazard uncertainty has previously been shown to be very high in the northern Bay of Bengal due to differences in cyclone parameter observations (Lewis et al. 2012) . Hence, the uncertainty within extreme water level estimation needs to be investigated before robust future flood risk predictions are made for the region.\nFive cyclone parameters are used to create the time-evolving wind and pressure fields within the Jelesnianski and Taylor (1973) idealised cyclone model, and thus determine the storm surge generation (e.g. Azam et al. 2004; Resio and Westerink 2008) . These are: (1) the radius of maximum winds (RMAX), which is also called storm size; (2) pressure drop (DP), calculated as the difference between a cyclone's central pressure (CP) and the ambient pressure (we assume 1,010 hPa); (3) cyclone track speed (mvspeed); (4) cyclone track (hence landfall location), and (5) the angle of cyclone approach to the coastline during landfall, which we call the ''angle of attack''.\nThe application of a JPM technique for extreme water level estimation is an obvious direction for future work for this region, such as determining storm surge response functions (e.g. Smith et al. 2012) . However, before determining extreme cyclone parameter characteristics (and undertaking the computationally expensive task of estimating extreme water levels), uncertainties within the data available in the Bay of Bengal, and deficiencies within cyclone storm surge modelling techniques need to be understood. For example, the estimated extreme pressure drop (DP) of the ''1 in 50 year'' cyclone has varied widely in three recent Bay of Bengal extreme water level estimation studies: (1) 66 hPa, based on analysis of cyclones in a small region of interest (Rao et al. 2010) ; (2) between 66 and 94 hPa, dependent upon the region of interest (Jain et al. 2010a ); (3) 68.7 hPa, based on the analysis of cyclones throughout the Bay of Bengal (Sindhu and Unnikrishnan 2011) . The purpose of this paper is to understand the magnitude, and effect, of the natural variability within key cyclone parameters of a single storm event (hence, we shall not investigate factors such as ENSO on cyclone frequency or magnitude, e.g. Ho et al. 2006) . It is hoped that by understanding this uncertainty within the context of surge inundation hazard, future research can be directed to improve flood risk uncertainty estimation in the northern Bay of Bengal."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The characteristic variability of available key cyclone parameters (DP, maximum wind speed, mvspeed, angle of attack) was analysed using the IBTrACs (version 2) database of observed cyclone events (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ibtracs/, 2010). The IBTrACs dataset is the most complete global set of historical tropical cyclones available, and the World Meteorological Organization's official archiving and distribution resource for tropical cyclone best track data (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/, 2012). Direct observations of the radius of maximum winds (RMAX) were not available in the IBTrACs database, so we used the Willoughby et al. (2006) Eq. (1) to infer RMAX from observations of maximum wind speed (VMAX) and latitude (w),\nSixty-six storm events that had a full dataset (within IBTrACs) and made landfall in the Bay of Bengal were identified between 1950 and 2008. Tropical storms (weather systems with wind speeds less than 64 knots, based on the Saffir/Simpson scale) are likely to behave differently to the cyclone events that cause serious coastal inundation; therefore, tropical storms were removed from analysis if maximum wind speed (VMAX) was less than 64 knots during the 12 h period before landfall. This quality control left 18 observed Bay of Bengal cyclone events between 1990 and 2008, which were used to determine the natural variability and spatial dependence (with landfall zone) of the cyclone parameters.\nThe statistical variation of cyclone parameters from these 18 events was used to determine the uncertainty associated with an idealised 1-in-50-year cyclone making landfall at the location of the 2007 cyclone Sidr (89.76\u00b0E21.75\u00b0N). The Sidr landfall location was chosen because the largest historical storm surges have been generated from cyclone landfalls in this region (see As-Salek 1998), and a LISFLOOD-FP coastal flood inundation model has been validated for this cyclone event (see Lewis et al. 2012) . A 1-in-50-year cyclone event was chosen because it is a common baseline for flood risk modelling in this region (e.g. Jain et al. 2010b ). Hence, cyclone parameter uncertainty associated with a 1-in-50-year cyclone event can be determined and propagated through a storm surge model (in this case the IIT-D models) in a series of sensitivity tests.\nThe IIT-D model is a nonlinear, depth-averaged (2D), hydrodynamic storm surge model of the Bay of Bengal (resolution *1/30\u00b0), based on the finite difference scheme using the quadratic law from Johns et al. (1985) and forced by the Jelesnianski and Taylor (1973) cyclone wind field model. Further details of this storm surge model can be found in Dube et al. (2009) and Dube et al. (1994) . Astronomical tides are not included in this model: in the operational system, tides are eventually superposed (linearly added to simulated surge heights) to calculate total water levels (storm tides). We discuss the significance of omitting tide-surge interaction in Sect. 2.3. Storm surges from the hydrodynamic model are used as boundary forcing conditions for a validated LISFLOOD-FP, 900 m resolution, inundation model of the northern Bay of Bengal which is used to predict inland inundation extent (see Lewis et al. 2012) . Therefore, the storm surge hazard uncertainty based on a ''single storm'' methodology (i.e. an idealised 1-in-50-year cyclone event) can be determined. Whilst relatively simple, this is single storm context methodology is typically employed in the Bay of Bengal at present (e.g. Jain et al. 2010a, b; Rao et al. 2010; Sindhu and Unnikrishnan 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "The spatial similarity of cyclone parameters and normality of data", "text": "The spatial similarity of DP, VMAX, cyclone track speed, and cyclone development characteristics (dCP\u00c1dt) were tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit hypothesis test based on four landfall regions: (1) Far West (*Southeast India) 75\u00b0-80.85\u00b0E, (2) Central West (*Northeast India) 80.85\u00b0-86.35\u00b0E, (3) Central East (*Bangladesh) 86.35\u00b0-92.20\u00b0E and (4) Far East (*Myanmar) 92.20\u00b0-100\u00b0E. These four regions were defined based on a number of previous studies (e.g. Rao et al. 2010; Jain et al. 2010a ), but modified to give a similar sample size (n between 4 and 5). The 18 observed cyclone tracks and our four landfall regions are shown in Fig. 1 .\nKey cyclone parameters from the four different sub-regions were found to be similar at the 5 % significance level using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit hypothesis test; the results of which are shown in Table 1 . Although based on a small sample number (18 events between 1990 and 2008), our result indicates that instead of analysing cyclone characteristics only in the region of interest (e.g. Rao et al. 2010; Jain et al. 2010a) , an entire Bay of Bengal cyclone observation record (e.g. IBTrACs) can be used to extrapolate extreme cyclone parameters values; therefore, a greater number of events can be pooled, which may allow the application of a JPM technique (e.g. Irish et al. 2011) . Furthermore, the 1-in-50-year extreme pressure drop estimate (a DP of 68.7 hPa) of Sindhu and Unnikrishnan (2011) shall be used as the basis in our sensitivity test (Sect. 2.2) because in this study, cyclone characteristics throughout the Bay of Bengal were analysed between 1974 and 2000.\nFurther analysis of our 18 cyclone events with a Lilliefor's test indicated that the null hypothesis of a normal distribution cannot be rejected at the 5 % significance level for the following key cyclone parameters: DP (0.16 test statistic, 0.29 P value), VMAX (0.17 test statistic, 0.15 P value), and mvspeed (test statistic, 0.50 P value). Therefore, the variability within prescribing cyclone parameters can be reasonably described using one (68 % of variance) or two (95 % of variance) standard deviations from the mean value associated with the 1-in-50-year cyclone event. The storm surge response to uncertainty within key cyclone parameters can be tested by propagating an uncertainty range through the storm surge model whilst holding all other parameters at a fixed or ''standard'' value. Our experiments are summarised in Table 2 . We take the standard pressure drop for an extreme 50-year cyclone in the Bay of Bengal as the Sindhu and Unnikrishnan (2011) value of 68.7 hPa because this value was derived from analysis of cyclones in the entire Bay of Bengal and is consistent with our pooling of events (see Sect. 2.1). All other cyclone values are derived from analyses presented here and shown in Table 2 . There is no way to directly explore wind speed (VMAX) uncertainty within a cyclone storm surge model, because VMAX is estimated from an idealised cyclone model for computational stability (Jelesnianski and Taylor 1973) . Hence, perturbations of DP (Tests F in Table 2 ) effectively control the range of maximum wind speeds in the surge model. A linear wind-pressure relationship (Eq. 2) was derived from our 18 cyclone events (R 2 of 81 %, Spearman rank of 0.88 and P [ 0.01). This is shown as the solid black line in Fig. 2 along with the 68 % confidence interval obtained (grey shaded area). For comparison, Table 2 The difference of peak storm surge (m) simulated when natural variability within key cyclone parameters of an idealised 1-in-50-year cyclone are included (cyclone making landfall at the Sidr the linear regression (Eq. 2) is a good fit to the observed data (black plus symbol) in the vicinity of the standard 50-year value (68.7 hPa). Furthermore, the observed variability (taken as the confidence interval of the regression) is greater than differences between any of the wind-pressure relationships and is also greater than the estimated J-T range. Therefore, we choose to represent the natural variability of VMAX within a 50-year cyclone event by inverting the linear regression of the wind-pressure relationship (Eq. 2) using the range of VMAX given by the 68 % confidence interval (i.e. the vertical dimension of the shaded area). We thus convert the natural variability in the wind-pressure relationship of Fig. 2 into one standard deviation (SD) either side of the standard 50-year DP estimate. Extreme water level estimate studies typically use observed tracks (e.g. Jain et al. 2010a; Rao et al. 2010 ). However, for our sensitivity test, a cyclone track was synthesised by propagating the angle of attack (mean \u00b1 SD) outward from the coastline for 18 h (the typical duration of angle of attack observed) and connecting this position to an assumed cyclone genesis location. The cyclone track derived from our synthesis is shown in Fig. 3 for a central genesis location (87.5\u00b0E10\u00b0N). A second location, which relates to cyclone Sidr (93.2\u00b0E9.6\u00b0N), was assumed for our genesis sensitivity test (test A). Further, cyclone Sidr was chosen as the ''standard'' landfall location (89.76\u00b0E21.75\u00b0N), with the position varying by 26 km (the average coastal spacing between landfall locations from the 18 observed events) for sensitivity test B. The mean angle of attack (cyclone bearing during landfall) was calculated from the 10 events observed in zones 2 and 3 of Fig. 1 , and the associated standard deviation either side of the average, standard, value (347\u00b0N) was used for the angle of attack range in the sensitivity test (test C) .\nNo relationship between cyclone track speed (mvspeed) and cyclone strength (DP) was found for the 18 observed cyclone events; however, the average track speed was assumed to be different before and after cyclone landfall. Therefore, a standard time series (6 h Fig. 2 The observed variability within the cyclone wind-pressure relationship from 18 events (grey shaded region of Eq. 2), compared with three alternative methods of VMAX approximation (Eqs. 3, 4 and 5) and the maximum range from the Jelesnianski and Taylor (1973) formulae (J-T range, red dots). The pressure drop (DP) uncertainty equivalent to the natural variability of VMAX for a 68.7 hPa cyclone is shown with horizontal arrows and vertical dashed lines time-step) of the cyclone position was determined assuming a central genesis location and the average mvspeed pre-and post-landfall. The uncertainty of mvspeed was represented by \u00b1 1 standard deviations of the mvspeed data (test E). Lastly, to synthesise a time series (6 hourly) of pressure drop (DP) and storm size (RMAX) to force the storm surge model, the mean development (genesis to peak cyclone value) and attenuation rates (decay after landfall) were calculated from the 18 observed events, which could be applied to any cyclone track. These cyclone development and attenuation rates were standardised to relative cyclone length, and we assume that the peak values occur for 10 % of cyclone duration prior to landfall. The sensitivity test of cyclone development and attenuation (test D) used \u00b1 1 SD either side of the mean tendencies of RMAX and DP."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge uncertainty within an idealised 1-in-50-year cyclone", "text": "The uncertainty in storm surge magnitude (i.e. storm surge only simulated in the IIT-D model) associated with this idealised 1 in 50-year cyclone event making landfall at the cyclone Sidr landfall location was investigated by cascading the calculated variability (from 18 events) through the storm surge model for the six cyclone parameters listed in Table 2 (minimum and maximum scenarios were simulated whilst all other parameters were held at their ''standard'' value; hence, 12 model runs in total). Many of our tests produced significant (of the order metres) changes in the maximum storm surges generated (see Table 2 ). Uncertainty in cyclone strength (DP) was found to have the greatest effect upon storm surge height. Cyclone track uncertainty (genesis location, landfall and mvspeed) also had a significant effect on simulated storm surge magnitude.\nAlthough cyclone parameter uncertainty generated the large storm surge differences within the entire model domain, the precise spatial distribution of the peak storm surge is very important for estimating coastal flood hazard. For example, we found that the The inundation extent difference (maximum shown as red, minimum extent over-plotted in blue, with topography shaded (DEM ht) within a ''1 in 50 year'' idealised cyclone event making landfall at the Sidr location (89.76\u00b0E 21.75\u00b0N), for the combined uncertainties of (1) peak cyclone pressure drop (DP), (2) angle of attack and (3) cyclone landfall and tide timing uncertainties; based on the observed natural variability of 18 cyclone events in the Bay of Bengal Nat Hazards (2014) 72:983-996 993 estimated uncertainty in angle of attack significantly altered storm surge height distribution along the coastline (see Fig. 4 ). Therefore, we propagated the storm surge uncertainty through to inundation extent (hence the surge hazard uncertainty) using the LISFLOOD-FP inundation model of Lewis et al. (2012) . To determine the forcing water level condition (i.e. total water level), a mean spring tide sinusoidal time series, interpolated along the northern Bay of Bengal coastline was assumed, and added linearly to the peak surge height (see Fig. 4 ), using a sinusoidal water level time series (see Lewis et al. 2012 for further details). The simulated inundation extent is shown in Fig. 5 . The inundation difference due to the DP uncertainty within the 1 in 50-year cyclone event (test F) was calculated as 279 km 2 . A larger inundation difference of 1,179 km 2 was obtained as a result of the angle of attack sensitivity test (test C). Whilst variability in angle of attack had a negligible effect on peak surge height, it significantly altered the spatial distribution of the storm tide height along the coast (see Figs. 4, 5) . Hence, uncertainty of parameters within a single idealised extreme cyclone event translates into large uncertainties in storm surge hazard.\nThe uncertainty within cyclone development characteristics (dRMAX\u00c1dt and dP\u00c1dt) did not affect the magnitude of the simulated peak storm surge in our basic test (see Table 2 ). The relative timing of storm surge and tidal peak (i.e. maximum surge height firstly coincides with low water and then, in a subsequent run, coincides with high water) resulted in an inundation difference of 441 km 2 . This cyclone development and landfall timing result should be viewed with some caution since we have not explored temporal variability fully, and also tide-surge interaction is omitted here. As shown by Horsburgh and Wilson (2007) , the primary effect of low pressure weather systems on tides is to phase shift high water; this effect has been noted for the Bay of Bengal (at the Hiron Point tide gauge) by Antony and Unnikrishnan (2013) . The other component of tide-surge interaction is the modulation by the tide of storm surge generation. Whilst this has not been studied for the Bay of Bengal, results from other areas suggest that this could modify the surge generated by up to 1 m (e.g. Haigh et al. 2013a, b) . However, since the tidal range in the head of the Bay of Bengal is of the order 3 m, our experiment that coincides the storm surge peaks with tidal low and then high waters (see Fig. 5 ) contains greater variability than would result from surge modulation.\nBased on the simulated storm surge sensitivity to cyclone parameter uncertainty in this paper, it appears that including spatial storm surge uncertainty (resulting from cyclone parameter uncertainty) is an important component in extreme water level and flood forecasting in the northern Bay of Bengal. Therefore, the application of a joint probability technique to combine multiple cyclone characteristics, instead of a ''single storm'' extreme water level context (see Resio et al. 2009 ), is a priority in the Bay of Bengal region, which will require more cyclone data, which can be obtained (in part) by pooling all observations from within the Bay of Bengal."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The parameters that describe extreme cyclones appear to be statistically similar throughout the Bay of Bengal (at a 5 % significance level based on 18 events). Hence, future studies that extrapolate extreme cyclone parameters from observations (e.g. IBTrACs) can benefit from a greater sample number by analysing all Bay of Bengal cyclone events instead of just those from within a smaller region of interest. Further analysis of these 18 events (between 1990 and 2008) indicated that the variability within cyclone parameters (that describe a single cyclone event) follows a normal distribution (i.e. this null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5 % significance level). Therefore, we were able to prescribe cyclone parameter uncertainty for an idealised 1 in 50-year cyclone into the IIT-D storm surge model, which led to considerable differences (of the order metres) in simulated storm surges and simulated inundation extent.\nThe natural variability in the pressure drop of a 1 in 50-year cyclone event had the greatest effect on simulated storm surge height; however, uncertainty of cyclone track characteristics, in particular the angle of attack, was found to have a much greater effect on simulated inundation extent. Therefore, the variability within these key cyclone parameters needs to be included within any coastal flood risk assessment, as this uncertainty translates into large surge hazard uncertainties. Furthermore, a method to statistically combine multiple cyclone characteristics to derive the extreme water level return periods, instead of a single storm context, is a priority for this region. Indeed, our research indicates that before robust future flood risk estimates are made for the northern Bay of Bengal, accurate extreme water level estimates along the entire coastline are required. A JPM of cyclone extreme water level estimation (e.g. Irish et al. 2011; Resio et al. 2009 ), which has proven effective on the US coastline, may be a good approach to extreme water level estimation in the Bay of Bengal. An alternative approach for this region might be to synthesise a large number of cyclones (e.g. Smith et al. 2012 ) by perturbing tracks and parameters and then subjecting their combined outputs to spatial analysis.\nFuture work should try to collate longer cyclone parameter records, and try to obtain storm size (RMAX) observations, with which to determine extreme cyclone parameter distributions for a JPM cyclone extreme water level estimation method in this region. Furthermore, to improve coastal flood risk understanding in the northern Bay of Bengal, future work should also investigate flood risk uncertainty due to wave set-up and tidal contributions (see Jain et al. 2010b; Sindhu and Unnikrishnan 2011) , inundation modelling uncertainties (e.g. roughness parameter and digital elevation model uncertainty; see Lewis et al. 2012) and projected changes to the extreme water level climate (see Karim and Mimura 2008) . The work presented here significantly improves our understanding of uncertainty surrounding extreme water level estimates for the Bay of Bengal and should direct future work into better extreme water level estimates in this region. In addition to inundation hazard analysis (as here), the statistical variance of cyclone parameters could be used to generate a computationally efficient short-term ensemble forecast for flood warning and evacuation."}]
