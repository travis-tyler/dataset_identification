Wearable PA and heart rate monitors provide the opportunity to define age-related differences in the absolute and relative intensity of daily activities, and provide insight into the underlying factors influencing PA in older adults. Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 440, 52% male, aged 31 to 88 years) completed a clinical assessment and wore an Actiheart monitor in the free-living environment. The association between age and minutes per day in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous PA was assessed using relative intensity, as defined by heart rate reserve, and absolute intensity using activity count thresholds. Results: In cross-sectional analyses, time spent in sedentary and light activities as defined by relative intensity did not differ across age (p > 0.05), whereas time spent in moderate and vigorous relative PA was higher for each 1 year increase in age (p < .01). Using absolute intensity PA thresholds, older adults registered fewer activity counts per day with more sedentary time and lesser amounts of light, moderate, and vigorous PA (p < .05). Persons with higher relative and lower absolute PA intensity had poorer functional performance and higher subclinical disease indicators. Conclusions: These findings suggest that time spent in moderate or higher intensity activities may not be lower with age after considering changes in physiology, functional ability, and subclinical disease burden and highlight the need for more age-and ability-specific PA research to inform future interventions and public health guidelines."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Higher levels of physical activity (PA) may prevent or delay disease onset and progression with aging (1, 2) . Individuals who expend more energy performing moderate intensity PA tend to live longer and healthier lives (3, 4) . Despite these known health benefits, the general consensus is that only a small percentage of the population is physically active, and that time spent performing moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPA) decreases throughout adulthood, whereas the time spent in light activities and sedentary behaviors increases (5) (6) (7) (8) . These changes are believed to result from a combination of anthropometric, physiological, social, and behavioral factors, which may contribute to and result from declines in aerobic capacity and functional capability with aging (9) (10) (11) (12) . Advances in objective PA assessment (eg accelerometers) provide the opportunity to better understand age-related changes in the intensity, duration, and frequency of daily activities, and the corresponding effects on health and functional status (8, 13) .\nAccelerometers provide continuous measurement of daily activities, offering an objective measure of free-living PA (13) . Although the benefits of continuous monitoring are strong, analyzing and interpreting accelerometer data into clinically meaningfully measures (eg calories, steps, and time spent in MVPA) are challenging, as the only metric directly measured by accelerometers is acceleration. Data collected using accelerometers are usually reported as minutes of PA performed at different intensity levels, including sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous; yet, the algorithms used for this classification have generally been identified and validated in small laboratory studies of young or healthy individuals (5) (6) (7) 14) and may not be generalizable to older or less healthy populations (13, 15) . Given the dramatic physiological changes that occur with aging and disease, including declines in aerobic capacity, metabolic rate, and speed of movement, (9, 12, 16, 17) , the same quantity of movement may represent a substantially different level of effort across age and disease statuses, leading to erroneous conclusions regarding the relative intensity of daily activities in which older or unhealthy adults engage. Previous work examining the intensity of PA in older adults has indicated substantial differences in relative versus absolute intensity of activities measured in field and laboratory settings, but these differences remain under-assessed in free-living conditions due to challenges with defining individualized levels of exertion (18, 19) .\nHeart rate reserve, the percent of the difference between resting and maximal heart rate required by a given activity, is a well-recognized method of gauging a person's relative intensity while accounting for aerobic fitness (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Although few accelerometers have included heart rate sensors as standard features to date, the rapid development of wearable technology has witnessed a surge in devices with heart rate and photoplethysmography technology in the consumer and research markets, making it an emerging and potentially viable option for examining individualized intensity of daily activities (25, 26) . Such tailored estimates of PA hold the potential to enhance the way PA is currently assessed and analyzed by minimizing the potential for biases induced by using absolute cutpoints to define intensity of daily activities among individuals with widely differing functional capacities.\nThe objectives of this manuscript were as follows: (i) to examine the associations between age and relative intensities of daily PA using a combined heart rate and PA monitor, (ii) to compare these results to traditional absolute intensity measures derived using populationlevel activity count thresholds, and (iii) to explore differences in relative PA intensity by chronic disease burden and functional status. We hypothesized that relative intensity differs from absolute activity patterns as a function of age, and that older adults work harder to engage in daily physical activities."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a study of normative human aging, established in 1958 and conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program (27) . The BLSA is a continuously enrolled cohort of community dwelling volunteers who pass a comprehensive health and functional screening evaluation and are free of major chronic conditions at the time of enrollment. Once enrolled, participants are followed for life and undergo extensive testing every 1-4 years, depending on age. The sample for the current study consists of 546 women aged 31 to 88 years who underwent a physical examination, health history assessment, and symptom-limited maximal treadmill test during their BLSA visit, and subsequently wore an Actiheart activity monitor between August 2007 and November 2015. The Institutional Review Board of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences approved the study protocol and participants provided written informed consent.\nParticipants were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit of the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program for 3 days of testing. Height and weight were assessed in light clothing using a stadiometer and calibrated scale, respectively. Age and history of chronic conditions were derived from a health history interview conducted by a nurse practitioner. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position, three times on each arm, alternating right and left with 1 minute in between each measurement. The mean of these readings was used to define hypertensive status (\u2265140 mm Hg systolic or \u226590 mm Hg diastolic). Physical functioning was assessed using the Expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (exSPPB) and the Long Distance Corridor Walk (28, 29) . Perceived fatigability was assessed using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale after a 5 minute treadmill walk (0.67 m/s; 1.5 mph) (30) . Hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose were assessed using a glucose analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA) and an automated DiaSTAT analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), respectively.\nOn the last day of the BLSA clinic visit, participants were fitted with the Actiheart accelerometer, a combined heart rate, and uniaxial activity monitor (Actiheart, CamNtech, Cambridge, United Kingdom), positioned horizontally on the chest at the third intercostal space using two standard electrodes. Heart rate and accelerometry counts were measured in 1 minute epochs for the following 7 days in the free-living environment. Participants were asked to wear the monitor at all times (24 hours per day). Extra electrodes and specific placement instructions were provided, so participants could replace them if necessary. At the end of the 7 day monitoring period, participants returned the Actiheart via express mail, and data were downloaded using commercial software (Actiheart, version 4.0.32) to derive PA in counts per minute and heart rate in beats per minute. Participants who reported taking antiarrhythmic medications, including \u03b2 blockers and heart rate-altering calcium channel blockers, were excluded from the analyses (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Accelerometer Data", "text": "Minute-level activity counts were averaged across the number of days worn to arrive at an average count per minute for every minute Figure 1 .

Oxygen consumption was measured via indirect calorimetry using a Medgraphics Gas Exchange System (Medical Graphic Corp, St. Paul, MN). Oxygen consumption and heart rate were averaged in 30 second intervals, and the highest values were termed VO 2 peak and maximal heart rate, respectively, and verified with a respiratory exchange ratio of \u22651.1. Resting heart rate was defined using the nighttime heart rate data collected with the Actiheart. After defining each individual's HRR, minute-level PA intensity was classified using the following thresholds: sedentary/sleep (<20% HRR), light (20-39% HRR), moderate (40-59% HRR), and vigorous (\u226560% HRR) (22, 23) . Although participants taking medications for arrhythmias were excluded from these analyses, to reduce the potential for error introduced by transient arrhythmias, all minutes associated with zero activity counts were considered to be sedentary/ sleep time regardless of heart rate ( Figure 1 ). For the remaining minutes, given that the participant was moving (eg activity counts > 0), the amount of time spent at each level of intensity was calculated for each participant as follows: where i denotes a subject, J i is the number of days of Actiheart data for subject i, e t ij ( ) is the percent effort at minute t for subject i on day j, s t ij ( ) is the activity state at minute t for subject i on day j, and I is a 0/1 indicator function. Figure 2A -D shows the unadjusted associations (\u03b2, p-value) between the number of minutes per day spent in each level of relative intensity as a function of age. Based on the appearance of these plots, we explored continuous and log-transformed versions of crosssectional linear regression analyses between the time spent at each level of intensity and age, adjusted for sex, body mass index (BMI), race, functional status, and comorbidities. Given that these results did not substantially differ, we present the untransformed results to facilitate interpretation (Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "PA Intensity Estimates Using Activity Count Thresholds", "text": "As there are no established cutpoint thresholds for Actiheart, absolute intensity was calculated at the study population level by examining the distribution of activity counts across the population, and using the HRR formula to determine whether an individual was engaged in sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous intensity activities for every minute of every day. For each subject-day, the average activity count for each intensity level was calculated and then averaged across all days, resulting in four observations per subject, one for each intensity level. The distribution of these variables was examined across the study population, with each subject contributing one observation per intensity level. The 75th percentile of activity counts for each level was used to define sedentary, light, and moderate PA, with any activity above the 75th percentile classified as vigorous. This procedure resulted in the following minute-level activity count per minute cut point thresholds: Sedentary \u2264 10, 10 < Light \u2264 95, 95 < Moderate \u2264 234, and Vigorous > 234. Sensitivity analyses to explore other percentile distributions (eg 50th percentile) yielded similar results, but with greater risk of misclassifying lower intensity activities as moderate or greater.\nTo contrast within-person differences in time spent at each level of intensity as classified using absolute activity count thresholds, matrices were created for each subject comparing their absolute activity counts to their relative PA intensity at every minute of the day. Matrices were constructed for each participant by summing the total number of minutes in each combination of heart rate and PA and dividing by the total number of minutes of observed data (Supplementary Figure 2) .\nUsing this classification structure, participants were partitioned into tertiles across the distribution of time spent in sedentary/light PA as defined by activity counts and moderate/vigorous exertion as defined by relative intensity (eg the discordant pairs). Participants in the highest tertile of this distribution represent those who spent the greatest amount of time engaged in moderate/vigorous relative intensity PA as defined by HRR with the lowest absolute intensity activity counts as defined using cutpoint thresholds, and labeled as \"High Exertion\" participants (eg Supplementary Figure 2 , Subject 3).

Excluded participants had lower peak VO 2 , slower gait speed, and lower heart rate reserve, but had similar levels of daily activity in terms of total activity counts and the amount of time spent at each level of relative intensity. Descriptive statistics and comorbidity prevalence for the final sample are provided in Table 4 , stratified by age. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and lower extremity arthritis. All other conditions were uncommon, with a prevalence of <10%. On average, when PA level was defined by absolute intensity, older participants were more likely to have lower total activity counts, as well as lower light, moderate, and vigorous absolute intensity minutes, compared with younger participants (p < .001). In contrast, when PA level was defined by relative intensity, older participants had fewer light intensity minutes and more moderate and vigorous intensity minutes compared with younger participants (p < .05 for all). Figure 2 depicts the unadjusted associations between minutes per day spent at each relative level of PA intensity and age. There was no association between the amount of time spent in sedentary/sleep behaviors and age (\u03b2 = \u2212.03, p = .49), a weak negative association between time spent in light activities and age (\u03b2 = \u2212.10, p = .03) and weak positive associations between time spent in moderate (\u03b2 = .18, p < .001) and vigorous (\u03b2 = .16, p = .01) activities and age. Moreover, Figure 2 suggests higher variability at older ages, particularly in the amount of time spent in moderate and vigorous activities.\nIn fully adjusted models examining the association between relative PA intensity and age (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) , the association with time spent in light activities was attenuated (p > 0.05), but the positive associations with time spent in moderate (\u03b2 = 0.70 minutes per day for 1 year of age) and vigorous activities (\u03b2 = 0.31 minutes per day for 1 year of age) persisted (p < .01 for both). Men were more likely to accumulate higher sedentary/ sleep minutes (\u03b2 = 37.4 minutes per day) and fewer light (\u03b2 = \u221226.2 minutes per day) and moderate relative intensity minutes per day (\u03b2 = \u22129.9 minutes per day) than women. Participants with a history of diabetes were more likely to engage in vigorous activities (\u03b2 = 12.9 minutes per day), and participants with a history of lung disease (\u03b2 = 30.8 minutes per day) and lower extremity arthritis (\u03b2 = 13.6 minutes per day) were more likely to engage in moderate activities. No other variables contributed significantly to the models. Sensitivity analyses that limited bouts of moderate or vigorous relative PA to 10 minutes or greater in duration did not meaningfully change the results with the exception that sex no longer contributed to the number of moderate intensity minutes/day. To compare these results to those generated using absolute intensity thresholds, these analyses were repeated using population level cutpoints (Table 2 ). In fully adjusted models, the association with time spent in sedentary/sleep activities was higher with each year of age (\u03b2 = 2.3 minutes per day), whereas the time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous absolute intensity activities was lower (p < .01 for all).

Using absolute intensity thresholds, \"High Exertion\" participants appeared to be less active than \"Normal/Low Exertion\" participants (p = .03), registering an average of 3,759.2 fewer activity counts per day, and 8.01 fewer vigorous intensity minutes per day (p < .001 for both). However, using relative PA intensity thresholds, \"High Exertion\" participants appeared to engage in an average of 50.78 more minutes per day of light intensity activities, 75.00 more minutes per day of moderate intensity activities, and 27.89 more minutes per day of vigorous intensity activities. \"High Exertion\" participants tended to be older, have lower peak VO 2 and peak heart rate, slower gait speed, higher fatigability, and lower physical functioning (p-value for multiple comparisons < .0055).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine and compare concurrently measured HRR-based activities with accelerometry data in a large population. Our results indicate that when PA levels are defined by relative intensity, the amount of time spent engaged in sedentary or light activities remains constant across age, whereas the amount of time spent engaged in moderate or vigorous activities is higher in older than in younger adults. These cross-sectional findings support the hypothesis that patterns of relative PA intensity differ from that of absolute activity patterns with aging, and that the widely described age-related reduction in moderate/vigorous daily PA may be attenuated after considering changes in physiology.\nPrevious population-based studies defining the relative intensity of daily activities using activity count, energy expenditure, or MET cutpoints have concluded that older adults are mainly sedentary, engaging in little-to-no regular MVPA (5-7, 10, 31, 32) . The current findings question the utility of such absolute indices by highlighting a \"High Exertion\" phenotype that has a slower speed of movement and a greater effort for a given level of activity, even among relatively healthy older adults. Multiple factors may contribute to the development of this phenotype, including reduced aerobic capacity (8, 9, 33) and poorer functional performance (12, 29, 34, 35) . Interestingly, there were no differences in comorbidity burden between \"High Exertion\" and \"Normal/Low Exertion\" participants, Notes: Participants in the combined \"Normal/Low Exertion\" tertiles had the greatest agreement between relative and absolute intensity, whereas participants in the \"High Exertion\" tertile had the lowest agreement.\nThere were no significant differences between groups according to history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease, stroke, liver disease, kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, cancer, or anemia.\n*Bonferroni-adjusted signficance for multiple comparisons: p < .0055.\nwith the exception of lower extremity arthritis. This may indicate that the \"High Exertion\" phenotype emerges while diseases are in a subclinical phase, manifesting as changes in PA and functional abilities. To this end, subtle changes in PA may act as more sensitive markers of reduced aerobic capacity, impending functional decline, and disability than clinical disease burden. These results are consistent with previous laboratory studies showing lower accelerometer counts for a similar level of energy expenditure in slow versus normal paced walkers, (36) and with higher perceived exertion in older versus younger adults (18, 37, 38) . The interpretation of the health benefits associated with the intensity of daily PA informs the development of guidelines for public health recommendations, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services PA Guidelines (39) . Thus, it is essential to understand the effort required for various activities across a wide age range of functional abilities. Estimates from NHANES data suggest that only 2.4 per cent of adults aged 60 and older attain the recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous PA (6) . Although there may be changes in lifestyle factors that contribute to increasing sedentary behaviors in many older adults (40, 41) , failure to also consider changes in physiology may result in misclassification of a large portion of the population as \"sedentary\" even though their relative PA intensity is moderate or greater. A clearer understanding of the relative contribution of behavioral and physiologic factors cannot truly be discerned without longitudinal analyses and replication in clinical/less healthy populations of older adults.\nRecently, efforts to quantify and define daily PA have focused on accelerometer data, which is more objective and less subject to recall (8) 62 (9) .002 Max heart rate (bpm) \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 163 (14) 142 (17) Self-reported difficulty with one or more activities of daily living. \u00a7 Self-reported diagnosis of heart disease or cardiac surgery, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft, and angioplasty. || Self-reported diagnosis of and current medication for diabetes. \u00b6 Measured hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of \u2265 90 mm Hg or treatment with antihypertensive drugs.\n# Self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \u2020 \u2020 Self-reported diagnosis of stroke, mini-stroke, or slight stroke. \u2021 \u2021 Self-reported diagnosis of cirrhosis or liver disease. \u00a7 \u00a7 Self-reported diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy or nerve damage in the lower legs, feet, or hands. bias than PA questionnaires (42) . Yet despite these advantages, interpretation of accelerometry data remains problematic. Traditional \"one size fits all\" approaches to data analyses make it difficult to understand the true contributors or inhibitors to PA with aging. What is \"light MET activity\" in early and mid-life may represent \"moderate\" or \"vigorous\" relative effort in older age (43) . Inevitable declines in aerobic capacity and muscle strength and function (9, 37, 44, 45) make it unfeasible for even well-functioning older adults to maintain the same levels of fitness and PA as their younger counterparts (46) . A tempting solution is to develop age-specific cut points; yet considerable variation in health and functional status within age strata renders developing such thresholds problematic (13, 47) . The current results suggest that time spent in moderate intensity activities as defined by a personalized physiological threshold may be the best descriptor of daily PA with aging, as individuals must work harder to maintain daily activities.\nSome limitations of the current study should be recognized. The relative intensity or HRR methodology used in these analyses was limited to persons not taking cardiovascular medications known to affect heart rate. Although persons taking antiarrhythmic drugs were excluded, the possibility of transient arrhythmias cannot be ignored. To attenuate the possible effects of transient arrhythmias, all minutes associated with zero activity counts were determined to be sedentary or sleep regardless of heart rate. Further, given that monitoring occurred over a 24 hour period over several days in a large population, any residual effects of heart rate abnormalities should be minimal. We were also unable to distinguish between sedentary behaviors and sleep. This is an important distinction that should be further investigated in cohorts with detailed sleep diaries to better understand the contribution of sleep to changes in PA with aging. In addition, BLSA participants are healthier than the general population, with higher functional abilities and likely better motivation to maintain daily activities (8) . Although this minimizes confounding by disease burden, it is also likely that the differential age associations in PA are understated in these results. Finally, these cross-sectional analyses warrant replication in less healthy community dwelling populations, as well as expansion to longitudinal data samples, to better understand the association between relative intensity and daily PA.\nIn conclusion, this study provides detailed results on PA as defined by relative intensity in a large population of well-characterized adults in mid-to-late life and illuminates discrepancies in the patterns of age-associated differences in daily physical with regard to relative versus absolute intensity. The findings that the amount of time spent in relative moderate or vigorous intensity activities is higher with age appears to contradict the general consensus that sedentary behaviors increase with aging and highlights the need for more age-and-ability-specific PA research to inform public health guidelines for maintaining health and functional capacity."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Supplementary data is available at The Journals of Gerontology, Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences online."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": ""}]
