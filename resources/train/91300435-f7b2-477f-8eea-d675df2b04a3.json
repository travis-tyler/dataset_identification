The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, CSF, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.\nMethods: APOE \u24404 allele frequency, CSF proteins (A\u2424 1-42 , total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau 181p ]), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic MCI (n \u03ed 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 \u03ee 0.4 years).\nPatients with MCI converted to AD at an annual rate of 17.2%. Subjects with MCI who had abnormal results on both FDG-PET and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to AD than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p \u0545 0.02).

Because individuals with MCI decline at different rates and some never develop AD, there is a need for tools to select patients with MCI who would benefit most from treatment. Existing research has implicated a number of biomarkers that predict cognitive decline or conversion to AD in this population, including glucose metabolism reductions, measured by [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (FDG-PET) in parietal, posterior cingulate, and temporal brain regions 1,2 ; MRI evidence of medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy [3] [4] [5] [6] ; increased CSF total tau (t-tau) and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau 181p ), indicating neurofibrillary tangle pathology, and decreased A\u2424 1-42 , indicating amyloid (A\u2424) plaque pathology [7] [8] [9] ; and presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele. 10 While each of these measures has independently shown promise for predicting disease progression, 11 they have not yet been compared to one another in the same patient population. Furthermore, the relative value of biomarkers compared to neuropsychological tests is not well-understood. Word list learning ability, a form of episodic memory, is a particularly well-studied and strong predictor of conversion. [12] [13] [14] A number of studies have compared the predictive value of 2 or more biomarkers at a time, such as MRI and CSF, 15, 16 MRI and cognitive testing, [17] [18] [19] FDG-PET and CSF, 8 FDG-PET and cognitive testing, 20 and MRI, CSF, and FDG-PET, 21 but findings have been inconsistent, likely due to small sample sizes and a variety of methodologic factors.\nIn this study, we used MCI participant data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multicenter project with approximately 50 medical center and university sites across the United States and Canada. ADNI is supported by the NIH, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, and has the primary goal of evaluating MRI, PET, CSF, and clinical measures acquired serially over 2-3 years.\nWe compared the prognostic ability of a number of candidate biomarkers that were obtained at baseline to determine which marker or combination of markers is optimal for predicting both conversion to AD and cognitive decline. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to help develop new treatments and to decrease the time and cost of clinical trials.\nMETHODS Subjects. A total of approximately 200 cognitively normal older subjects, 400 subjects with MCI, and 200 patients with early AD are enrolled in ADNI, all of whom have had MRI scanning, approximately 50% have had PET scanning, and approximately 50% also agreed to lumbar puncture. As of April 2009, a subset of 85 subjects with MCI had baseline data available for all measures of interest and were used for this study. Serial clinical diagnostic assessments were carried out at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Approximately 8% of subjects completed 3 visits (12 mo), 15% completed 4 visits, the majority, 72%, completed 5 visits (24 mo), and the remaining 5% completed 6 visits (36 mo). Conversion to AD was established at individual recruitment sites, with review centrally, and none of the variables used in the prediction of outcome were used as indicators of conversion. An examination of each measure for outliers revealed that 3 subjects had abnormally high t-tau, p-tau 181p , or both (Z score \u03fe3), so they were excluded from tests that involved these measurements.\nFull inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in detail at www.adni-info.org. Briefly, all subjects were between ages 55 and 90 years, had completed at least 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, and were free of any other significant neurologic diseases. Subjects with MCI were classified as single-domain or multidomain amnestic MCI, 22 normal subjects had Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 0, and patients with AD met standard diagnostic criteria. 23 The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) 24 and diagnostic status (remaining stable as MCI or converting to AD) were the outcome variables of interest. The ADAS-Cog contains 11 items assessing fundamental cognitive functions (language, memory, praxis, comprehension), and the total score ranges from 0 to 70, with a higher score indicating poorer cognitive function.\nCandidate predictors included presence of an APOE \u24404 allele, neuroimaging measurements (FDG-PET, hippocampal volume), CSF biomarkers (A\u2424 1-42 , t-tau, p-tau 181p ), and episodic memory performance on the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), all obtained at baseline.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. The procedures for this study were approved by institutional review boards of all participating institutions. All subjects gave written, informed consent to blood sampling, lumbar puncture, cognitive testing, and neuroimaging prior to participation.\nBiomarker predictors. Episodic memory. The total number of words correctly recalled on all 5 immediate recall trials of the AVLT 25 was assessed at baseline and used as a predictor variable in our analysis because recent studies have shown that word list learning in particular is a predictor of conversion compared to other neuropsychological tests. [12] [13] [14] Genetic. APOE genotypes were determined for all ADNI subjects through analysis of blood samples that was carried out at the University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Laboratory.\nHippocampal volume. Structural magnetic resonance scans (1.5-T) were acquired at multiple ADNI sites using a standardized MRI protocol described elsewhere. 26 Bilateral hippocampal volumes were obtained using Freesurfer software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), an atlas-based approach that has been validated for use in subjects with a great deal of morphologic variability. 27 More information is provided in appendix e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org. CSF biomarkers. CSF biomarker variables included A\u2424 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau, phosphorylated at threonine 181, in pg/mL (p-tau 181p ), as well as ratios (t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 , p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 ).\nMethods for analysis have been previously described 28 and are provided online.\nFDG-PET. ADNI PET data were acquired at sites nationwide using a protocol described elsewhere (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/ADNI_Data.shtml). Briefly, PET images were acquired 30 -60 minutes postinjection. Images were averaged, spatially aligned, interpolated to a standard voxel size, intensity normalized, and smoothed to a common resolution of 8-mm full width at half maximum. Spatial normalization of each individual's PET volume to the standard 15 O-H 2 O PET template was conducted using SPM5 29 (template voxel dimensions: 91 \u03eb 109 \u03eb 91; voxel size: 2 mm \u03eb 2 mm \u03eb 2 mm). PET volumes were intensity normalized to a single region made up of the cerebellar vermis, defined by the AAL region within the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas, and the pons, defined by manual tracing on the MNI template. Methods for analysis have been previously described 30 and are provided in appendix e-1 on the Neurology Web site at www.neurology.org.\nCutoffs for subject classification. Dichotomous forms of all independent variables (defined as AD\u03e9/AD\u03ea) with the exception of APOE were established using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses with AD and cognitively normal ADNI participants to determine optimal cutoffs for each measure. Cutoffs for each variable were selected by choosing the threshold that optimized both sensitivity and specificity, and were subsequently used to categorize subjects with MCI as AD\u03e9 or AD\u03ea on each measure. ROC analyses were carried out using all available ADNI data for each measure.\nFor APOE, subjects were divided based on the presence (AD\u03e9) or absence (AD\u03ea) of at least one APOE \u24404 allele."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses.", "text": "Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 16.0. Independent samples t, Mann-Whitney U, and 2 tests were used to assess differences between converter and nonconverter groups on each measure and associations between dichotomized variables. Positive predictive value was calculated as the number of MCI converters correctly classified as AD\u03e9 divided by all MCI converters, and negative predictive value was the number of MCI nonconverters correctly classified as AD\u03ea divided by all MCI nonconverters.\nBoth univariate and multivariate models were examined to assess the degree to which each baseline predictor was associated with the outcome measure independently or in conjunction with the other variables. However, due to overlap in AD\u03e9/AD\u03ea status among CSF measures (table e-2 in appendix e-1), only one CSF measure could be included in multivariate models. p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 was selected because it showed the strongest prediction of conversion at the univariate level. Thus, 5 variables were included in the multivariate analyses: APOE status, FDG-PET, hippocampal volume, p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 , and AVLT recall.\nFor the Cox proportional hazards models predicting conversion, the time variable was amount of time (in years) from baseline to the visit in which AD was diagnosed, or to the most recent visit for censored cases. In the mixed effects models, the outcome measure consisted of all available serial ADAS-Cog measurements, which incorporated individual variability in the number of completed visits, missing data, and individual variability in between-scan intervals. 31 Each model included a random intercept to account for variability in individual starting point, and time between visits (in years since the initial visit) was computed separately for each individual. The interaction term for each independent variable of interest \u03eb time represents the degree to which that variable was associated with change in the ADAS-Cog over time.\nAssumptions of linearity were verified for each model. Age, education, and sex were included as covariates in all models, and all statistical tests were evaluated for statistical significance at \u2423 \u03ed 0.05, 2-sided, and trends at 0.05 \u03fd \u2423 \u03fd 0.10."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS Differences between converters and non-", "text": "converters. Table 1 summarizes demographic information for all groups (AD, MCI, normal), baseline measurements for converter and nonconverter MCI groups, and statistical differences between converter and nonconverter groups. Of the 85 MCI participants, 28 (32.9% total, or an annual rate of 17.2%) converted to AD. None of the subjects with MCI reverted to a normal diagnosis or converted to a non-Alzheimer dementia. Converters and nonconverters did not differ on demographic characteristics, but were either significantly or marginally different on shown for tests of differences between converter and nonconverter groups using continuous forms of the variables. Note that for ADAS-Cog, t-tau, p-tau 181p , t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 , and p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 , a higher mean is associated with greater impairment, whereas for the other measures a lower mean is associated with greater impairment.\ncognitive variables and predictor variables of interest. Agreement between AD\u03e9 and AD\u03ea categorizations across variables is reported online.\nClassification of AD\u0609 and AD\u060a subjects. Table 2 summarizes the numbers of normal subjects, subjects with MCI, and subjects with AD with available data for all measures of interest, and the ROC analysis results, which include the area under the curve (range 0.80 -0.95), threshold value, sensitivity (range 71%-93%), specificity (range 70%-88%), and overall accuracy (range 74%-90%) for classification of normal subjects and subjects with AD with each measure. Finally, the thresholds for each measure were applied to the MCI participants to determine positive and negative predictive values for conversion.\nCox proportional hazards models: Predicting conversion. In univariate models, several variables were associated with increased risk of conversion to AD. As shown in table 3, subjects categorized as AD\u03e9 on FDG-PET, hippocampal volume, p-tau 181p , ptau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 , AVLT, and, marginally, APOE had a higher risk of converting than AD\u03ea subjects on each measure (hazard ratio range 2.94 -4.68). In the multivariate model, only FDG-PET and AVLT remained significant predictors. Specifically, subjects who were AD\u03e9 on FDG-PET had a 2.72 ( p \u03ed 0.05) greater risk of converting to AD than subjects who were AD\u03ea on FDG-PET ( figure, A) , assuming equal AD\u03e9 status on the other variables, and this risk was 4.30 ( p \u03ed 0.02) for AVLT ( figure, B) . Taken together, these findings indicate that the 36 subjects (42%) who were AD\u03e9 for both FDG-PET and AVLT had an 11.7-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.22-61.75) greater risk of converting to AD than subjects categorized as AD\u03ea on both measures."}, {"section_title": "Mixed effects models: Predicting cognitive decline.", "text": "Average decline on the ADAS-Cog was 1.11 ADAS-Cog points/year (95% CI 0.69 -1.53). All baseline variables predicted subsequent ADAS-Cog decline in univariate models, although AVLT was marginally significant ( Abbreviations: AD \u03ed Alzheimer disease; AUC \u03ed area under the curve; AVLT \u03ed Auditory Verbal Learning Test; FDG \u03ed \u0353 18 F\u0354fluorodeoxyglucose; MCI \u03ed mild cognitive impairment; p-tau 181p \u03ed hyperphosphorylated tau; ROC \u03ed receiver operating characteristic; t-tau \u03ed total tau. a The number of subjects with AD and normal subjects with available data varied for each measure. b ROC analyses using available data for subjects with AD and normal subjects were carried out to establish threshold values for abnormal (AD\u03e9) and normal (AD\u03ea) cutoffs used in subsequent models. The AUC, threshold values used as cutoffs, and the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy (calculated using subjects with AD and normal subjects) are shown for each measure. The positive predictive value (percent MCI converters correctly classified as AD\u03e9) and negative predictive value (percent MCI nonconverters correctly classified as AD\u03ea) were also calculated for subjects with MCI using the ROC-derived cutoffs.\nwere significant predictors of conversion or decline in univariate models. In multivariate models predicting conversion, glucose metabolism and episodic memory function were significant. Individuals who were abnormal (AD\u03e9) on both FDG-PET and AVLT were 11.7 times more likely to convert to AD than individuals who were normal on these measures. In multivariate models predicting decline, the CSF ratio p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 (and, marginally, FDG-PET) were significant when accounting for all the other variables. There were several noteworthy features of our approach. First, cutoffs used to classify subjects with MCI as abnormal or normal on each predictor variable were derived from an independent sample, and are therefore potentially applicable outside of this population. Second, all predictors were defined a priori, as opposed to frequently used exploratory methods, such as voxel-wise analyses for PET and MRI data, that are optimized for a study-specific dataset. The availability of data through ADNI made it possible to directly compare all of these predictors in the same individuals for the first time. Finally, the use of dichotomous predictors, as opposed to a continuous variable, provides a precise way of selecting individual subjects with MCI for a clinical trial or potential treatment.\nThe fact that different combinations of markers predict conversion status and cognitive decline suggests that these markers may track different aspects of disease progression. Predictors associated with conversion (AVLT and FDG-PET) likely reflect disease severity, i.e., how close an individual is to a significant clinical transition. On the other hand, predictors associated with cognitive decline (primarily CSF p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 , and secondarily FDG-PET) likely reflect rate of change, independent of absolute disease severity.\nStudies comparing the predictive value of multiple biomarkers have been variable, although several useful meta-analyses or reviews have summarized recent findings. 11, [32] [33] [34] Our data are consistent with reports of the predictive value of CSF biomarkers, 35, 36 and a recent large, multicenter study that is one of the few to use externally derived cutoffs. 7 Our results are consistent with previous reports of the predictive value of FDG-PET, 1 studies that have examined both FDG-PET and APOE, 37, 38 and a report that FDG-PET was superior to the Mattis dementia scale. 20 Our findings are not in agreement, however, with recent data indicating that MRI and PET were superior to CSF in predicting cognitive decline. 21 Additionally, although we found that FDG-PET and AVLT performance were the best predictors of conversion, our univariate findings are consistent with Table 3 Results of Cox proportional hazards models, with potential conversion to AD as the outcome measure, and mixed effects models, with ADAS-Cog change as the outcome measure a studies showing that MRI and CSF, 15, 16, 39 MRI and cognition, 17 and MRI and APOE 40 measures are useful for predicting conversion to AD, although others have suggested that MRI measures are superior to cognitive measures in predicting decline. 18, 19 Finally, although studies of AD conversion frequently do not account for rates of conversion or time-dependent change as we have done here, our results are also consistent with one study that did account for time and compared p-tau 181p , t-tau, and FDG-PET and found that p-tau 181p optimally predicted cognitive decline, while FDG-PET optimally predicted conversion. 8 Inconsistencies in recent findings are likely due to a variety of methodologic issues such as differences in neuroimaging processing techniques and variable selection, CSF protein immunoassay techniques, criteria for setting cutoff points for subject categorization, study design, and statistical analysis. Importantly, few studies on AD prediction define predictor variables before evaluating their performance; instead, a \"predictive\" measure is developed based on differences between MCI converters and nonconverters and retrospectively applied to the initial population without validating it in an independent population (often due to sample size constraints).\nAn important limitation of our findings is that the hippocampal and FDG-PET ROIs may not be optimized for this sample. Whole-brain, data-driven, voxel-based, or other approaches to the analysis of PET or magnetic resonance data might have resulted in stronger prediction outcomes for the imaging variables. Hippocampal volume was a significant predictor of decline at the univariate but not multivariate level, suggesting that the association between hippocampal volume and decline may be mediated in part by the other measures in our analysis. In contrast, other studies have reported a stronger role for hippocampal or other structural measurements in predicting decline, 3 even when examined in conjunction with CSF measurements. 16, 41 However, the regions of interest that we selected were study independent, frequently associated with decline in AD and MCI, and obtained through an automated and standardized processing stream and are therefore strong candidate measurements for clinical trials of therapeutic treatments.\nThere are several other limitations of this study that deserve comment. First, these models are based on the subset of MCI participants who agreed to participate in all biomarker testing, and future studies will be needed to address the question of whether our findings generalize to a broader sample, and whether differences exist for single-domain and multidomain MCI or for patients with amnestic MCI who convert to non-Alzheimer dementias. Second, our results may depend on the number and precise combination of predictor variables included in the model. A longer follow-up period may also result in model changes, since the value of predictors is likely modulated by the phase of disease. Clinical diagnosis of AD involves factors that are difficult to standardize and involves some degree of subjectivity and uncertainty. Furthermore, there are other cognitive measures and biomarkers that may play important roles in prediction that were not addressed here (such as the CDR-sum of boxes, Mini-Mental State Examination, genetic markers, and diffusion tensor imaging measures). Importantly, forthcoming ADNI data using PET tracers for A\u2424 deposition will help elucidate the role of brain amyloid load in patient outcomes.\nThe current clinical role of these, and other, biomarkers in dementia care is relatively limited largely because of the lack of effective treatment. However, our results suggest that these biomarkers could be effective in identifying patients with MCI who are more likely to progress to AD over relatively brief time periods. This approach could be useful for identifying patients who would benefit from treatment when it becomes available and for selecting subjects in clinical trials of therapeutic agents for MCI."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Statistical analysis was conducted by Dr. Landau and Dr. Harvey."}, {"section_title": "STUDY FUNDING", "text": "Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (NIH Grant U01 AG024904).
