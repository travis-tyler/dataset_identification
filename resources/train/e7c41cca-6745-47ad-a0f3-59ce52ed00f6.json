INTRODUCTION On an annual basis, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) produces numerous estimates for a number of commodities of agricultural importance such as corn, cotton and soybeans, as well as for total number of farms in the United States (U.S.). A farm is defined as a place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the year. The calculation also includes any government agricultural payments. NASS uses its annual June Area Survey (JAS) as the vehicle to generate annual estimates of number of farms. These estimates are compared to ones obtained from the quinquennial Census of Agriculture (conducted for years ending in 2 and 7). The annual estimates of the number of farms from the JAS have been declining steadily between censuses (especially between the 2002 and 2007 Censuses). Furthermore, these have been considerably lower than farm numbers from the census, and the difference cannot simply be attributed to sampling error. Additionally, results from a qualitative study, known as the Classification Error Survey (CES), revealed that agricultural operations were being incorrectly classified as nonagricultural during the screening procedures of the JAS. These developments have prompted concerns leading to a series of actions intended to address and resolve the current issues with farm number estimation. To address these issues, an aggressive agenda to identify and implement ways to improve the number of farm indications from the JAS was developed that focused on explaining reasons for discrepancies in farm status between the annual JAS and the Census of Agriculture. The developed plans included 1) measures to improve the area sample for farm numbers, 2) the implementation of an intensive post-June survey re-screening and follow-up for bias reduction, and 3) the evaluation of capture-recapture estimation methodology to improve farm number estimation. This report presents the results of component 2 above --an intensive post-June survey rescreening effort intended to assess issues with screening procedures and to study misclassification in the JAS."}, {"section_title": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "NASS conducts an annual area frame based survey which collects information about U.S. crops, livestock, grain storage capacity, and type and size of farms. Since the distribution of crops and livestock can vary considerably across a state, the precision of the survey indications is substantially improved by dividing the land in the state into homogeneous groups or strata and optimally allocating the total sample to the strata. The basic stratification employed by NASS involves: (1) dividing the land into land-use strata such as intensively cultivated land, urban areas and range land, and (2) further dividing each land-use stratum into substrata by grouping areas that are agriculturally similar. The JAS uses a sample of designated land areas (segments) which field enumerators visit to collect data on all agricultural activity occurring therein. A typical segment is about one square mile (640 acres). Each segment is outlined on an aerial photo which is provided to the appropriate field enumerator. Through field enumeration, a segment is divided into tracts of land, each representing a unique land operating arrangement. An area screening form is completed for all sample segments. It inventories all tracts within the segment and contains screening questions that determine whether or not each tract has agricultural activity. In this way, all land inside the segment is screened for agricultural activity and the screening applies to all land in the identified operating arrangement (both inside and outside the segment). Those operations (tracts) that qualify as agricultural are interviewed using the area version questionnaire, which collects detailed agricultural information specifically about the operator\"s land, again both inside and outside the segment. The area frame is a theoretically complete sampling frame with every acre of land having a known chance of selection. As such, it can be used to estimate the number of farms and land in farms independently of the list frame, as well as to measure incompleteness in the list. The area frame uses a replicated sample design. A sample rotation scheme is used to reduce respondent burden caused by repeated interviewing and to avoid the expense of selecting a completely new area sample each year. Sample rotation is accomplished each year by replacing segments from specified replicates in each land-use stratum with newly selected segments. Approximately 20 percent of the replicates in each land-use stratum are replaced annually. In addition to the JAS and the annual list-based surveys, NASS conducts a Census of Agriculture every five years (for years ending in 2 and 7). The Census of Agriculture is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. The census collects data on land use and ownership, operator characteristics, production practices, income and expenditures, and many other characteristics. The outcome, when compared to earlier censuses, helps to measure trends and new developments in the agricultural sector of our nation\"s economy. The information is used only for statistical purposes and data are published only in tabulated totals. Census forms are sent to all known and potential agricultural operations in the U.S. The census provides the most uniform, comprehensive agricultural data for every county in the nation. It employs a dual frame: an independent list frame and the area frame from the JAS. The area frame is used as a measure of incompleteness of the list frame. Historically after each census, an evaluation has been conducted to measure misclassification of farms on the census mail list. This evaluation involves either recontacting a sample of census respondents or overlap matching the census mail list to the area frame. For the 1997 and 2002 Censuses of Agriculture, classification errors were measured by comparing an operation\"s status on the census to its status on the area frame based JAS. In cases where there were discrepancies between the two, the JAS was assumed to be correct, and the operations were counted as misclassified on the census. For 2007, the primary focus of the misclassification evaluation was to identify reasons for discrepancies between the JAS and the census. The 2007 Classification Error Survey (CES) was a qualitative examination of why classification and reporting errors occur. The 2007 CES results showed that most of the discrepancies were actual errors which occurred in the JAS, not the census. The U.S. Bureau of the Census has also found errors in screening area frame samples in its household surveys (Manheimer and Hyman, 1949;Eckman, 2009). These results also suggested that screening methods for the JAS should be reviewed. There were numerous cases of operations incorrectly classified as non-agricultural based upon non-agricultural land inside the segment, without recognizing the associated agricultural land outside the segment."}, {"section_title": "III. MOTIVATION AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT", "text": "Results from the 2007 CES indicated that misclassification was not limited to the census, but that some agricultural operations were incorrectly classified as non-agricultural during the screening procedures of the 2007 JAS (Abreu et. al., 2009). However, the CES was a very small study and produced no estimates of either JAS or census misclassification. In an attempt to get a better understanding of misclassification on the JAS, a post-June Survey intensive re-screening called the Farm Numbers Research Project (FNRP) was undertaken in the fall of 2009. The general idea for and framework of this project was formed out of a cross-Divisional meeting in December 2008, called to identify ways in which NASS might address the increasing spread between the number of farms indications from the JAS and the Census of Agriculture. In January 2009, the meeting notes/draft proposal document from the December meeting was widely circulated in Headquarters for comment. This document was refined based on the resulting feedback, and the final version (included in Appendix A) was presented and approved for implementation at the March 2009 Program Planning Council 3 (PPC) meeting. In anticipation of PPC approval, a cross-Divisional team, later to be called the Farm Numbers Research Project (FNRP) Team, was formed in January to flesh out the details of this very complex and extensive project. Unlike most research projects, there was to be no small scale pre-testing for this project. A basic premise of the project development was that it would be conducted as an operational activity in all states following the 2009 JAS. The concern being addressed was considered serious enough that senior management felt that the Farm Numbers Agricultural Statistics Board would need results from this project for every state for use in December 2009, when setting the 2009 number of farms estimates. In trying to address this need, the Team met weekly, with growing membership (as additional operational units\" participation was required), from January until the project was ultimately launched in August. FNRP\"s main objective was to determine the extent of misclassification resulting from the operational screening procedures for the June survey. The study focused primarily on the 20 percent newly rotated-in segments of the 2009 JAS. Addressing these segments specifically would help provide better long term estimates of farm numbers, due to their longevity in future samples, in addition to laying the ground work for better screening procedures for future segments. The project targeted three types of tracts in the newly rotated-in segments: 1. Non-agricultural tracts, 2. Agricultural tracts that were estimated, because their operators refused to participate in the JAS, and 3. Agricultural tracts that were estimated, because their operators were inaccessible in June. These tracts were to be re-contacted via mail, phone or through personal interviews as efficiently as possible, commensurate with achieving high quality results. Tracts which were entirely composed of Public, Industrial, or Grazing Association (PIGA) land were excluded, as PIGA land is used on a fee-per-head or Animal Unit Month (AUM) basis, and is not included in the annual land in farms estimates."}, {"section_title": "IV. SAMPLE SELECTION", "text": "There were 2,465 segments in the 2009 JAS that were eligible for the study. However, only 2,209 segments contained tracts in any of the three targeted categories described above. From those segments, there were 10,204 total tracts identified for this project, of which 8,552 were identified as non-agricultural during the 2009 JAS screening. An additional 1,652 were agricultural tracts whose operators refused or were inaccessible during the 2009 interview period. The sample included only operations from the newly rotated-in segments which comprised 20 percent of the 2009 JAS sample. It is important to note that not every state had 20 percent of their JAS sample rotated in for 2009. For the three states that received an entirely new frame in 2009 --Minnesota, South Dakota and Washington --only selected replicates (approximately 20 percent) were contacted. For New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and West Virginia (states that did not have any new segments in 2009) the rotation group targeted to leave the sample last was selected. Florida, Utah, and Wyoming had very few new segments in 2009, so for these states, segments in prior years were selected in addition to the few newly rotated-in segments. In most states, sample sizes were relatively small (see Appendix B for sample sizes by state). The sample also included specific segments from the Agricultural Coverage Evaluation Survey (ACES), which were selected only in Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina, and Vermont to aid with farm number estimates for the operational June survey, not for FNRP. These supplemental ACES segments were allocated to less cultivated strata where small farms are prevalent and more likely to be missed."}, {"section_title": "V. DATA COLLECTION", "text": "In conducting this study, all operators in the sampled June tracts needed to be identified, including all individuals in residential or other non-agricultural tracts. One major issue with non-agricultural tracts has been the lack of good name and address information. The rigorous rescreening undertaken for this post-survey effort focused heavily on obtaining mailable names and addresses (and phone numbers, if available) for all the selected places of interest in the targeted tracts. A place of interest is defined as any individual residing within the sampled tract or any land area that could have been drawn off as a separate tract within the sampled tract, regardless of size. JAS segments were overlapped with a real estate parcel dataset from First American Spatial Solutions 4 (FASS) to get name and address information for as many tract operators within the 4 First American Spatial Solutions (FASS) is a provider of property location information and geospatial services. They are now a division of Core Logic and aggregate up-to-date tax and municipal databases from around the country which provide geospatial analytics and solutions targeted around these areas. The ParcelPoint boundary database, which is a digitized and accurate spatial database of actual parcel boundaries of 125 million parcels in the U.S, was obtained from FASS. In addition, this database provided tax identification numbers, names and addresses. scope of the study as possible. FASS data provided field offices (FOs) with an additional source of information to identify owners of the land within the segment. The FASS database contained name, parcel address, owner address if different from parcel, telephone number, and tax identification number. Maps were produced showing all parcels within each JAS segment. One map was created for each segment, and each FASS parcel on the map contained a number referring to an accompanying report delivering the information described above. See Appendix C for examples of maps of JAS segments displaying FASS parcel numbers. FO staff received JAS segments with FASS information and used it to build a mailing list of potential names and addresses for subtracts for which this information was not otherwise available. This process proved especially beneficial in densely populated areas, since it provided a listing of land owners, which helped enumerators with pre-screening. In addition to the use of FASS data, FO staff also looked to obtain operators\" information through Google maps and any other sources identified locally. Operators of the selected places of interest in the study tracts were asked to participate in this effort, referred to in the field as the Land Utilization Survey. The primary purpose of the survey was to verify farm/non-farm status, and respondents to it completed a short and simple questionnaire that contained questions similar to those on the JAS screening form. The questionnaire did not have the exhaustive list of crops and livestock items that are in the June questionnaire; however, it collected enough information to calculate points for tracts which did not report sufficient sales. The calculated points allowed for a definitive farm/nonfarm determination for these tracts. See Appendix D for a copy of the survey instrument used for this study. The current JAS screening procedures implement a \u00bd-acre rule which instructs enumerators to visually inspect residential areas of \u00bd acre or less per parcel for any agricultural activity (Bosecker et. al., 1988). If there is no clear indication of agricultural activity, the tract is identified as non-agricultural and no JAS questionnaire is completed. This is done to minimize interviewing costs in enumerating every unit in a segment, which is especially important for densely populated areas of land where the cost of enumeration can be very high. For the FNRP, enumerators were instructed to ignore the \u00bd-acre rule and attempt to go to every place of interest (i.e., operator) in a specific June tract. As a result of this, the concepts of subsampling and subtracts, which are not routinely part of the JAS, were introduced. It is important to note that current NASS procedures define each tract as a unique land operating arrangement. However, for densely populated June-defined tracts it is possible that multiple operations (places of interest) may be present. For example, a residential development with multiple houses may be designated as one tract and labeled \"houses.\" For the FNRP, houses within the selected tract had to be screened individually. To get the best possible results from the FNRP study, commensurate with containing data collection costs at an acceptable level, a special subsampling scheme was developed and the concept of subtracts was introduced. For any sampled June tract containing seven or fewer places of interest, all of them were interviewed. For tracts with 8-20 places of interest present, enumerators were instructed to randomly interview 1/2 of them. For tracts with 20 or more places of interest present in the target tract, enumerators were instructed to interview 1/6 of them. The selected units in the target tract were determined through rolling a die for each place of interest. No more than 20 places of interest were interviewed in any given tract. Additionally, no fewer than three places of interest were interviewed in each tract, unless there were fewer than three total places of interest in the tract. The project allowed substantial time and flexibility in scheduling and coordinating data collection efforts. FOs could collect their data in any manner they deemed appropriate beginning in late August and continuing through early November. For the most part, FOs had an initial mail-out in late September with additional mailings to follow. They employed several different data collection strategies; however, much of the phone/field follow-up occurred in October. Editing and summarization of the results occurred in November."}, {"section_title": "VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "There were 10,204 tracts within the scope of FNRP\"s selected segments. The subsampling scheme employed for FNRP identified 6,987 additional places of interest eligible to be interviewed. The resulting total of 17,191 places of interest, or subtracts, represented a 68.5 percent increase, indicating that there were potentially additional farming operations within a NASS tract. Overall, the study resulted in 12,847 completed subtracts, a 74.7 percent completion rate. Because the JAS is a probability-based sample, each tract has an inclusion probability \u03c0 i and an expansion factor e i = 1/ \u03c0 i . Within each tract identified as a farm, a proportion of a farm is observed. This proportion, the tract-to-farm ratio, is t i = tract acres / farm acres. Both of these are used in calculating the current JAS estimate for the number of farms, which is defined as follows, The results in Table 1 show the total number of subtracts (or places of interest in the study), and the resulting number of farms and expanded number of farms by tract type (agricultural or nonagricultural tract). Henceforth, any mention of subtract or place of interest will refer to FNRP, and tract will refer to the operational JAS. Of the 17,191 subtracts in the study, 14.9 percent (or 2,559 subtracts) were identified as farm operations. More than half of these farms (1,503) were from agricultural tracts which were estimated during the JAS summary. These expanded to 256,613 farms, but since most of these agricultural tracts were counted as farms during the June Survey, the net increase in farms from the FNRP re-screening of them was only 5,210. The remaining 1,056 farms, which expanded to 576,163, were from tracts identified as nonagricultural during the JAS. The coefficient of variation (CV) associated with this latter indication is 10.9. It is important to note that as a result of the subsampling scheme used for the FNRP, JAS tract expansion factors (e i ) had to be adjusted by subsampling rates. This adjustment resulted in over 150 FNRP subtracts identified as farms receiving expansion factors exceeding 1,000. One very important note is that most of the farms added in the FNRP (86.1% of them) were farm operations identified in tracts that had been classified as non-agricultural without any potential for agriculture. Of the 2,559 subtracts qualifying as farm operations, 122 (4.8 percent) were from ACES segments. These ACES subtracts, which only occurred in nine states, expanded to 77,289 farms (9.3 percent of all expanded farms). Since the ACES subtracts contributed a proportionately small percentage of the farms identified by the study, all results presented in this report will include the ACES subtracts."}, {"section_title": "Re-screening of Estimated Agricultural Tracts (Refusals & Inaccessibles)", "text": "The survey period of the JAS (including summarization of the data) lasts one month. FOs have two weeks prior to the start of data collection to prescreen new and residential segments to identify tract operators and agricultural activity. Due to this limited timeframe, enumerators do not devote as much time as is probably needed to identify tract operators of non-agricultural tracts. The study focused on two types of tracts: 1) tracts classified as agricultural which refused or were inaccessible during the JAS data collection period and thus estimated, and 2) tracts identified as not having any agricultural activity. The farm status of inaccessible and refusal tracts from the JAS is based solely on observed and/or estimated data. It was important to evaluate these tracts further to determine whether they had been correctly classified. Based on the results of the FNRP, the number of farms from these tracts was underestimated by 5,210. The FNRP sample initially consisted of 1,652 estimated and inaccessible tracts which comprised 16.2 percent of the total FNRP sample. Through the re-screening and further follow-up, the study identified 60 additional places of interest (i.e., FNRP subtracts), resulting in three percent more subtracts in FNRP than in the original JAS. Table 2 below shows the total number of estimated and inaccessible subtracts in the study, their JAS farm status, their FNRP farm status, and the expanded number of farms from both the FNRP and the JAS. The study results confirmed the farm status of 92.1 percent of the tracts identified as farms during the JAS. The study also found, though, that 30.6 percent of the tracts identified as non-farms during the JAS should actually have been classified as farms. The expanded number of farms for the 1,503 FNRP farms from refusal and inaccessible estimated tracts is 256,613. By comparison, the June data for the 1,652 refusal and inaccessible tracts in the FNRP sample expanded to 251,403 farms. Therefore, the study results indicate that there should be an upward correction of about 2.1 percent or 5,210 farms to the total number of farms from the JAS from estimated tracts, indicating slightly more farms from the FNRP rescreening even for these. The farm status for over 80 percent of the tracts for which the JAS and FNRP farm status disagreed (37 and 125 in Table 2) was actually determined through data collection for both the JAS and the FNRP, rather than held in the office or estimated. Most of these farms were borderline ones with low values of sales. Also, many of them did not report sufficient sales to qualify them directly as a farm. Therefore, in order to have their final farm/non-farm status determined, $1,000 worth of points were calculated if they had enough agricultural inventory, both in the operational JAS and the FNRP. Additionally, most of them had a single place of interest in the tract, simplifying the screening process. It is important to examine how the farm/nonfarm status of these tracts was determined through the FNRP re-screening. Toward that end, Table 3 shows the final status of each of the JAS refusal and inaccessible tracts by their original refusal/inaccessible status on the JAS. Of the 728 JAS refusal tracts, 31.3 percent or 228 were completed via telephone, mail, or faceto-face interviewing. Although the study managed to convert a number of these refusals, a fairly high percentage of them were also nonresponse in the FNRP. About 17.0 percent of the JAS refusals remained refusals and 7.5 percent became inaccessible, 124 and 55 respectively. However, JAS refusals continue to be an issue of concern since 44.1 percent (321 reports) of all subtracts were held in the office and not part of any other data collection effort. The results were more encouraging for the original 984 JAS inaccessible tracts. The FNRP rescreening was completed for over half of these tracts via one of the three major modes of data collection employed. About 7.9 percent (78 subtracts) of the JAS inaccessible tracts were refusals for the FNRP re-screening, and only 16.1 percent (158 subtracts) remained as inaccessible. Even though 20.7 percent were held in the office and not part of any data collection effort, the overall results indicate that it might be possible to obtain responses for these tracts if more data collection time were available. For a majority of the JAS refusal and inaccessible tracts, FOs were able to get responses via mail or telephone. However, a substantial number of the inaccessible tracts were ultimately rescreened via face-to-face interviewing (See Table 4). As indicated in Table 5, subtracts and subsampling were not that much of a concern for refusal and inaccessible tracts, since most of the farms (97.5 percent or ) were found in JAS tracts with only one FNRP subtract. The subsampling did, however, identify about 7,500 more farming operations among JAS tracts having two to seven FNRP subtracts."}, {"section_title": "Re-screening of Non-Agricultural Tracts", "text": "In addition to the refusal and inaccessible tracts discussed in the previous sections of this report, the FNRP study focused on tracts which were identified as non-agricultural during the JAS screening procedures. In the June survey, each tract is screened to determine whether it is part of an agricultural operation. Even if there is no agriculture in the tract, it should be classified as agricultural if it is part of an operation with agricultural production elsewhere. Additionally, a non-agricultural tract is classified into one of the following three categories: has potential for agriculture, does not have potential for agriculture, or potential for agriculture is unknown. The rigorous re-screening undertaken for this post-survey effort focused heavily on obtaining mailable names and addresses (and phone numbers, if available) for all tracts in the study segments. The overall evaluation of the non-agricultural tracts confirmed that the operational screening efforts have resulted in misclassification of a substantial number of these tracts. The study found 1,056 JAS tracts that had been classified in June as non-agricultural, that were actually part of farming operations. These misclassified, non-agricultural tracts expanded to 576,161 farms. An even more surprising finding was that 85.7 percent (905 out of 1,056) of these farms were found in non-agricultural tracts identified as having no potential for agriculture (see Table 6). Recall that the agricultural potential of a non-agricultural tract is normally determined by the enumerators during the screening procedures of the JAS. The results of this study point directly to potential improvements in the screening questionnaire and to enhanced enumerator training guidelines. Overall the results are very encouraging, suggesting that with more time and resources a better quality screening of the non-agricultural tracts could be implemented, which would result in the proper identification of more farming operations.  Table 6 presents results by response category for the FRNP study. The overall completion rate for the study was 74.7 percent, with the completion rate for non-agricultural tracts slightly higher at 78.0 percent (12,075/15,479). Only 5.5 percent (58/1,056) of the farms from non-agricultural tracts were refusals and inaccessibles, which had to be estimated. Also, a small number (15) of these subtracts were linked to other JAS records. These were held in the office and their data were estimated. The concepts of subtracts and subsampling played a much more important role for the study of non-agricultural tracts. Recall that for a specific tract, all places of interest were interviewed if there were seven or fewer units in the June tract. For tracts with 8-20 places of interest present, enumerators were instructed to randomly interview 1/2 of them. For tracts with 20 or more places of interest present, enumerators were instructed to interview 1/6 of them.  Table 7 shows the results by the number of places of interest in each type of non-agricultural tract. It is evident that most of the unexpanded farms (77.7 percent or 820/1,056) were found in low density tracts (7 or fewer places of interest). Furthermore, 646 of these farms were found in tracts with only one place of interest. This indicates that better in-depth screening of these tracts and more effort in identifying the operator of the tract would yield the identification of more farming operations. A thorough screening of these 646 tracts would have added an estimated 207,238 more farming operations. On the other hand, farms found in high density tracts cannot be ignored as they also constitute a significant percentage of the misclassified farms. One of the issues to be addressed through this intensive re-screening was a concern over the potential impact of the \u00bd-acre rule. It was believed that farming operations might be missed during the screening as a result of this field enumeration efficiency. In the current operational procedures, enumerators are instructed to visually inspect residential areas of \u00bd acre or less per parcel for any agricultural activity. For these small parcels, if there is no clear indication of agricultural activity, the tract is identified as non-agricultural and no JAS questionnaire is completed. Table 8 shows the distribution of subtract acreage by type of non-agricultural tract. The results showed that there were only 34 farms identified from non-agricultural tracts which had \u00bd acre or less. These expanded to only 2,941 farms, indicating that the JAS is probably not missing a high number of farming operations as a result of the \u00bd-acre rule. As indicated in Table 9, the results of this study showed that most of the operations being misclassified or missed in the non-agricultural tracts are small farms with acreage between 1 and 24.9 acres (301 farms). These accounted for 334,740 expanded farms. Furthermore, for 28.9 percent of the 1,056 FNRP farms from non-agricultural tracts, the entire operation fell inside the subtract. These operations accounted for 58.3 percent of all expanded farms. The results for non-agricultural tracts by mode of interview, as displayed in Table 10, indicate that FOs were able to get a reasonable number of responses via mail and telephone. However, for logistical purposes, enumeration for the vast majority of the tracts with eight or more places of interest was conducted via face to face interviews, as FOs had been instructed. Only 23 percent of all subtracts with 8 or more dwellings (5,931) were conducted by means of other modes of data collection and not face to face interviews. Overall, the vast majority of the farms (86.1 percent or 500,338) were found in tracts that had been identified as having no potential for agriculture. Another supposition of this study was that the JAS was missing farms in agri-urban or commercial strata. However, the results in Table 11 show that the 697 total subtracts screened in these strata only identified 12 additional (4,416 expanded) farms. Although the JAS is missing farms in this type of stratum, these do not constitute a large percentage of the farms misclassified. The study did find a significant number of additional farms in the less than 15% cultivated stratum, indicating that current screening procedures more effectively identify agricultural operations in highly cultivated areas than they do in areas with less agriculture.  Table 12 presents the results of the non-agricultural JAS tracts in the FNRP by value of sales (including government agricultural payments). These results solidify the hypothesis that small farms are missed or misclassified more often, since most of the farms from non-agricultural tracts (630/1,056) had less than $10,000 in sales of agricultural products. These 630 farms represented 77.9 percent (389,700/500,338) of all farms from JAS non-agricultural tracts identified in the study. However, there were 47 non-agricultural tracts with no potential that reported over $500,000 in sales in FNRP. Interestingly, four of these reported over $5,000,000 in sales. These operations should certainly be on the NASS list frame; however, an extensive search using their name and address information revealed that three out of the four were not, indicating that larger farms are being missed as well. As mentioned previously, a farm is defined as a place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold during the year, and the computation includes any government agricultural payments received. To ensure a definitive determination of farm/non-farm status for each subtract in the survey, the survey instrument for the FNRP collected enough information to calculate dollar \"points\" for subtracts which did not report sufficient sales to qualify them directly as a farm. Any land operating arrangement with more than $1,000 worth of points based on agricultural inventory qualifies as a farm on the \"normally would have been sold\" sales criterion of the farm definition, even if it had no actual agricultural sales. Farming operations qualifying by this criterion are referred to as \"point farms.\" Table 13 shows that the vast majority of the expanded farms identified were from point farms.  The screening portion of the survey instrument for the FNRP study included ten screening questions designed to screen in as many respondents as possible to complete the four page questionnaire, which ultimately determines farm/nonfarm status. The results by screening question are presented in Table 14. From the table, it is clear that the most important questions that could be asked are Any Potential for Agriculture (Question 1), Any Hay or Pasture (Question 4), Any Livestock (Question 5), Any Government Agricultural Payments (Question 3), and Any Equine (Question 6), in that order. As shown in the table, there were 784 subtracts found in tracts which were classified as non-agricultural with NO potential for agriculture in June that answered that they had land with agricultural potential. These results suggest that it is important to ASK about land with agricultural potential, not just make a determination based on observation of the tract. Previous research by Manheimer and Hyman (1949) and Eckman (2009) also indicate that casual observation of units by enumerators is not always adequate and has led to misjudging and misclassifying units during screening procedures. This is especially true in the JAS screening, since observation can only indicate what\"s inside the segment, and farm status is determined by all land under that land operating arrangement, both inside and outside the segment. For FNRP, it is important to note that for face to face, telephone and CATI interviews, interviewers were instructed to complete the questionnaire as soon as they obtained a \"yes\" to any one of the screening questions. Thus, questions were not to be asked every time from every respondent. An analysis of the 160 FNRP reports from June non-agricultural tract mail respondents which were subsequently identified as farms showed most of the respondents (94.3 percent) answered the potential for agriculture screening question (Question 1) most often, skipped all other screening questions, and then proceeded to complete the rest of the questionnaire. NASS maintains an area frame for each state except Alaska. Frames are constructed one state at a time and used year after year until the frame is deemed outdated, generally in about 15 to 20 years. When a frame becomes outdated, a new frame is constructed to replace it. Analysis of age of frame effect on number of farms misclassified revealed that farming operations missed were reasonably spread regardless of year in which the frame was built (See Table 15). Newer frames (5 years or less) missed about as many farms as did much older ones (16 or more years)."}, {"section_title": "VII. COST ANALYSIS", "text": "An initial budget of $600,000 was allocated to FRNP for field data collection. It cost $412,000 to re-screen the 17,191 subtracts that were within the scope of the project. At the U.S. level, it cost $23.97 to screen each subtract and $161.04 for each (unexpanded) farm found. See Appendix E for cost estimates at the U.S. level and by state. In the operational 2008 JAS, the cost per tract was $43, and it cost an additional $23.97 to re-screen these tracts for FNRP. The cost estimates for each subtract, as presented here, are an over simplification, since they assume that the re-screening cost is the same for non-agricultural and estimated tracts. However, since there was already some information on estimated tracts, it was generally less costly to attempt a re-contact of these. The same amount of information was not available on nonagricultural tracts. In fact, a reasonable amount of time was allocated to finding good name and address information on these tracts. Thus, it is safe to conclude that re-screening of nonagricultural tracts comprised a larger portion of the overall cost per subtract ($23.97). It is important to note that a direct correlation should not be made between the cost per tract for FNRP and the operational JAS, since the methodology and procedures were different. In addition to the budget allocated for direct field enumeration expenses, it cost $92,000 to purchase the real estate information from First American Spatial Solutions, which was used in identifying name and address information for the places of interest in the study."}, {"section_title": "VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Determine the agricultural/non-agricultural status of each tract by asking the screening questions rather than by observation.", "text": "It is important that all tract operators be questioned whether or not there is any agricultural potential in the tract. 2. Add a question/column to the screening questionnaire similar to Question 1 of the Land Utilization Survey: Did you own, rent, or operate land with potential for agricultural production? Results of the FNRP showed that close to 63.3 percent of agricultural operations answered \"yes\" to this question indicating that potentially more non-agricultural tracts could be identified as agricultural during the screening procedures. If a question is not added, emphasize to enumerators and office staff that this should not be determined by enumerator observation (if at all possible) since land operated outside the segment cannot be observed. 3. Retain the \"\u00bd-acre rule.\" It appears that relatively few farm operations will be missed, especially given the resource savings, by continuing to employ the \"\u00bd-acre rule\"."}, {"section_title": "Provide better training for enumerators and field office (FO) survey administrators concerning screening procedures.", "text": "This should be a standard part of the mid-year training school. Additionally, emphasize that field enumerators and FO staff should utilize all tools available (including asking questions of the respondent\"s neighbors) to gain valuable information about agricultural producers in the segment. This way, enumerators will essentially ask for information about every person in the segment; thereby accounting for every farm in the segment. Training should emphasize proper drawing of boundaries and proper application of ownership/operator definition and identification. FO staff noted that when they conducted the follow-up interviews, it was obvious that several mistakes were made in June in identifying tract operators and/or tract boundaries. They found that the majority of wooded areas were not being allocated to the proper tract and/or owner/operator. Strengthen the section in the Survey Administration Manual which refers to screening and include more examples. This recommendation is already being adopted by the Survey Administration Branch. 5. Extend the screening period to start several weeks earlier than the usual start date to facilitate more intensive screening, FNRP results showed that this may reduce the number of refusal and inaccessible tracts for which data are estimated. Ensure that all FOs prescreen new segments and, for June 2010, potentially prescreen \"unknown\" operators from older segments. This recommendation was implemented beginning in June 2010."}, {"section_title": "Obtain better quality information on the non-agricultural tracts in order to facilitate more accurate screening.", "text": "Results of the post re-screening showed that the information obtained from the First American Spatial Solutions (FASS) was useful to the states in accomplishing this.

There were several FNRP subtracts which were linked to other JAS operations located in different segments or tracts.

During the 2007 Census of Agriculture it was discovered that a significant number of farms were missed in the previous year\"s area frame estimates of number of farms. The working assumption of NASS has been that the area frame is complete and that all farms and commodities are captured in the area frame expansions. This assumption is due to the theoretical completeness of the frame, the perceived quality of the personal enumeration utilized for the data collection, and the extensive training of field enumerators collecting the data. However, the 2007 census results showed that many of the smallest farms were not captured in either the area frame or on the census mail list. In addition, the 2007 Classification Error Survey (CES) showed that a significant number of small and minority farms added to the census mail list during the 2007 mail list development cycle were not correctly classified as farms in the area frame sample. Thus, estimates of farm numbers based on the area frame have under-estimated number of farms. This proposal is designed to test improvements to the operational process and outline research designed to improve the estimates by testing alternative procedures to measure the number of farms. The components of this are as follows: A The Area Frame Sample is allocated at the national level for farm numbers. This has resulted in many states having a smaller number of segments, with the national allocation of segments serving as a balance in support of both commodity and farm number estimation. To improve the estimation of farm numbers from the area frame, supplemental segments will be selected this year to augment the June 2009 sample size. The additional segments will be a subset of the ACES segments used in June 2007 to ensure the quality of the Not-on-Mail-List component of the 2007 Census of Agriculture results. The inclusion of the additional segments will supplement the national allocation and lower CVs for farm numbers, particularly for small farms. Many of these segments are located in the agri-urban strata where many small farms reside. Through the efforts of the Area Frame Section and the Survey Administration Branch (in costing out sample augmentation options), the attached worksheet provides an allocation of ACES segments (181) to use for June 2009. The worksheet also shows 122 segments being added for the new Native American strata in the southwestern states, per previous discussion at the October 2008 PPC meeting. The criteria used to determine where to add the ACES segments are as follows: 1. States with the largest difference between the \"fully adjusted\" Census indication and the four-year average JAS direct expansion for number of farms. 2. States with high CVs or those showing the greatest potential for improvement of CVs. States not considered were Native American states (AZ, CO, NM, NV, and UT), new frame states (MN, SD, WA), and states with a small number of farms. Also not considered were CA, MS and TX which were part of the Minority Agricultural Coverage Evaluation Survey (MACES). The MACES segments were added primarily to improve minority number of farm estimates by creating new substrata. Adding them back for this purpose would have resulted in an overly complex sample weighting process. Other comments: Plans are not to reprint the ACES photos, meaning the segments numbers will be same as they were during June 2007. Their complete 6 digit ACES segment numbers will be unique; however, the last 4 digits will not be unique. For the recommended states, only a portion of their 2007 ACES sample was allocated to minimize FO workload. Most of the allocation was distributed to the moderate to light cultivation strata (20s and 40s)."}, {"section_title": "B. Implement an Intensive Post-Survey Screening and Follow-up for Bias Reduction:", "text": "No changes to normal prescreening, screening or data collection will be implemented for the 2009 June Area Survey (including any additional segments added as outlined above). FOs will follow normal times and procedures, and they should continue to utilize FSA screening where history has shown it to be advantageous. However, an additional, post-survey screening will be conducted on all newly rotated-in 2009 June Area Survey and added ACES segments, which will focus on collecting quality names and addresses for all tracts. This additional, enhanced screening will be especially needed for tracts that were identified as non-ag, or were inaccessible or estimated for the June survey. The additional screening will be conducted through the most cost-effective way possible to collect these complete (and mailable) names and addresses for all tracts and occupied dwellings. This follow-up, intensive screening will occur after completion of the June Survey, and must be done in the most cost efficient manner possible, including coordination, where possible, with other field visits. The primary objective will be to identify quality names and addresses (and telephone numbers, as available) for all tracts not previously identified as farm operators --not to collect data. Therefore, if mailable names and addresses can be obtained, at least in part, through other means (e.g., tax records) in lieu of door-to-door canvassing, this much-less expensive, indirect method should be used. All tracts in the newly rotated-in June 2009 and added ACES segments previously coded as nonag or non-ag with potential or as inaccessible or estimated will subsequently be followed-up through an Agricultural Identification Survey (AIS) to determine their true farm status. The AIS instrument will utilize enhanced screening questions developed by Research and Development Division cooperators, Drs. Don Dillman and Danna Moore of Washington State University (WSU). This subsequent screening for farm/nonfarm determination will use mail, phone, EDR and phone follow-up to maximize response. The focus will be on a definitive determination of the farm status of each name in the most efficient manner possible. The AIS procedures being researched and developed by WSU cooperators will be designed to maximize mail and Internet response, in order to make this follow-up screening as efficient as possible. An estimate of the number of farms missed in the current operational procedures will be made from the number of additional operations identified in the enhanced screening, and a new estimate of the number of farms from the June Area Survey will be calculated. One of the under-pinning requirements of capture-recapture methodology is that all target population units have a non-zero probability of selection in each frame involvedhere list and area. All units innately had a non-zero probability of selection in the 2007 June Area survey, with the exception of any new operations formed after June that qualified as 2007 farms. The problem is murkier from the list side, since reduced list sampling is conducted for most surveys focusing solely on production agriculture. From the list standpoint, the requirement of non-zero probabilities of selection are probably best satisfied by the Census of Agriculture and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (Phase I), where small and limited resource farms are of concern. Some consideration will be given to possible additional data that could be collected on future June area surveys that would help with subsequent year capture-recapture estimation with the ARMS Phase I."}, {"section_title": "D. Analyze 2007", "text": "Census data for Not-on-Mail-List (NML) Tracts to Improve Future List Development A full census questionnaire was sent to all 2007 ag and non-ag with ag potential June Area tracts not found on the census list. The data were collected primarily to ensure the accuracy of the scrubbing process in determining the correct match/non-match status between the operations on the list and area sides, but they also have potential for shedding light on the characteristics of farming operations that were missed in the census list building process. Data mining and cluster analysis will be used to identify subgroups of the NML tracts to provide guidance into future, improved list building efforts. A Capture-Recapture Indication for the 2007 Census of Agriculture and an Estimator for its Variance Suppose both the full JAS area sample of farms and the Census-Mail-List (CML) respondents have already been separated into G mutually exclusive capture/recapture groups. These groups can be determined using logistic regression or data-mining techniques.* Let C g denote the estimate of the number for list farms in group g derived from the CML respondents, A g be the set of area-frame sample farms in group g, and L g be the subsample of A g containing only area-frame farms on the CML. If w k is the area-frame weight for area-sample farm k (including the tract-to-farm adjustment), and y k is the item value of interest for k (y k will usually be 1 for all farms, although there are other possibilities), then the capture-recapture indication for the ytotal is * The idea is to determine the characteristics that make a farm more or less likely to be on the CML from the Census responses of JAS area-sample farms (including ACES and MACES segments). Both area-frame and CML respondent farms are then put into capture/recapture groups by placing together farms with similar probabilities of being on the CML based solely on their characteristics. Note that C g and g k kL w are estimating the number of farms on the CML in group g, but the latter may be subject to an undercount.

Instead, define for every CML respondent in capture/recapture group g. Consider the CML-weighted total of the f values among all CML respondents.
