The discrimination ability of these predictors is evaluated in terms of their classification performances using support vector machines (SVM). Using only landmarks statistically discriminant between AD and NC in SSM showed a better separation between AD and NC. These predictors also showed better correlation to the cognitive scores such as mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging task. Since the hippocampus is affected by atrophy in the earliest stage of disease, it is possible to detect this effect through morphological analysis. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging provides an essential tool for the study of the brain's anatomy.\nThe result of hippocampal atrophy may result in tissue loss which causes the reduction of volume and the change in the shape of hippocampus. Hippocampal volumetry on MR images was shown to be a useful tool in AD diagnosis. 1 Hippocampal volume normalised by the total intracranial volume (TIV) has been previously used to classify AD from normal control (NC) subjects, as well as cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Shape information in the form of spherical harmonics (SH) has been used in AD diagnosis.

They usually rely on principal component analysis (PCA) to determine a lower dimensional subspace that accounts for the most variations. However, these modes of variations are not necessarily discriminant. In this study, we aim to improve the discrimination between AD and NC using shape information characterized by SSM. We use SSM to search for variations on the surface regions that are significantly discriminant between the two groups. The discriminant regions may be due to both volume and shape changes. We propose to use the morphological variation on these surface regions as variables to distinguish AD from NC cases. These variations are also correlated with the cognitive decline in AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": "The hippocampus segmentations used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research -approximately 200 cognitively normal elderly individuals 400 subjects with MCI, and 200 people with early AD. We use the hippocampal volumes segmented semi-automatically by SNT provided by ADNI. The hippocampal volumes were divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set consists of 60 AD subjects with average age 75.2(6.7) years old and 60 NC subjects with average age 77.0(4.8) years old.

In this study, the hippocampal volumes in the training set were first registered and aligned via rigid transformations, followed by a groupwise optimization and fluid regularization on the shape image 6 to establish the correspondence across the training set. Once the correspondence across the training set is established, the shapes can be aligned by using Procrustes analysis, either through rigid or similarity transformations. The volume information is preserved in rigid transformations. In this case, the variation in the training data will be partly driven by the volumetric change of hippocampus due to tissue loss. If the shape surfaces are aligned via similarity transformations, the shapes are rescaled to normalize the hippocampal volume. This enables the SSM to be more specific to the change in the shape per se rather than the variation in the size of hippocampus.\nGiven a training set {x i : i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n S } of n S shapes, in which the correspondence is established and the shapes are aligned rigidly or via similarity transformations, each of its shape containing n P landmarks can be represented as a 3n P -vector\n) is the position of the kth landmark point on the ith shape surface. A PCA can be performed on the data set (x 1 , x 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x nS ), and the shape data can be expressed as\nwhere W is the matrix consisting of eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and the elements in vector b i are the parameters characterizing the ith shape. More generally, for a shape vector x, which is aligned to the space of the SSM, the b descriptors can be calculated by least-square estimation\nsince W is orthonormal.\nAlthough the shape can be well approximated by SSM with parameters b, these descriptors might not reflect the inter-group discrimination. Instead of performing a PCA on the shape data consisting of all n P landmarks on the shape surface, only a subset of landmarks that are discriminant between the different groups are selected, and used in the PCA. For the kth landmark {p\n2 test can be used through a permutation scheme 7 in order to assess its statistical significance in discriminating the NC group from the AD group. Selecting only the m(< n P ) landmarks that are significantly discriminant on the labelled data, i.e. those landmarks with p-value below a threshold, the shape is represented by the subset of landmarks\nwhich is a projection mapping to the regions more relevant to the pathology. A SSM can thus be built concerning only the regions identified by the statistical test,\nwhere W is the matrix of eigenvectors describing the variation modes from significantly discriminant landmarks, and b i is the vector of coefficients of each mode. Likewise, for shape vector x, the coefficients of discriminant modes can be calculated as\nwhich can be used as features characterising the shape x.\nThus, we have four choices of building SSM on the given training set with established correspondence:\n\u2022 M RA using all the hippocampal landmarks, with shapes aligned via rigid transformation,\n\u2022 M SA using all the hippocampal landmarks, with shapes aligned via similarity transformation,\n\u2022 M RD using hippocampal landmarks significant against AD, with shapes aligned via rigid transformation,\n\u2022 M SD using hippocampal landmarks significant against AD, with shapes aligned via similarity transformation."}, {"section_title": "Representation of the test data", "text": "For a given shape not in the training set, the correspondence between the SSM landmarks and the shape surface points needs first to be established, so that the given shape can be represented in the same vector space as the training data. The target shape surfaces are usually generated from the segmentation, which can be smoothed using a windowed sinc function 8 with passband 0.1. The SSM is deformed with parameter b to fit the smoothed target surface, minimizing a distance metric between the SSM generated surface and the target.\nWe use an L 1 distance between two shapes which is less sensitive to outliers.\n9 Without the assumption of correspondences between two shape vectors x and y, the distance between their surfaces S(x) and S(y) can be defined in a symmetrical manner as\nwhere d p (p, S) is the Euclidean distance from the point p to the closest point on surface S. Thus we can fit the SSM to the target surface S(y) by the optimization of parameters using Powell's algorithm\nwhere T is a similarity transformation with 7 degrees of freedom. For the kth landmark p (k) \u2208 T y (x + Wb y ) generated by SSM, we can find the closest point on the surface p (k) \u2208 S(y) as the corresponding landmark point. By aligning the shape vector y = p (1) , p (2) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p (nP ) T to the shapes in the SSM through Procrustes analysis, we have the 3n P -D shape vector representing the surface S(y) in the same space as the shapes in the SSM, ready for further analysis.

SVMs are widely used in solving the classification problem. It usually maps the feature space to higher dimension via a kernel function, and finds the optimal hyperplane with the largest margin separating the classes. We use the classifier trained by the SVM to test the discrimination ability of the features. In this study, the radial basis function was used as the kernel of SVM. The features of each shape x for classification are the coefficient variation modes, as extracted from (3) or (6).\nIn order to avoid modelling noise, less significant components produced by PCA are not included in the feature set. A subset of features is selected using random forest by minimizing the out-of-bag (OOB) error.

Hotelling's T 2 test was performed on each SSM between the AD and NC groups, with the resulting significance maps shown in Fig. 2 . In the SSM where shapes are aligned rigidly, more landmarks appear to be significantly discriminant. This is driven largely by the hippocampal volume change between NC and AD. Since the effect of volume change is removed in SSM where shapes were aligned via similarity transformation, the significance of the shape difference between the two groups are thus more localized.\nA PCA was performed on the landmarks with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. For the purpose of comparison, conventional PCA on all the landmarks was also performed."}, {"section_title": "Discrimination between AD and NC", "text": "The first 15 principal components in each of the SSM were used for feature selection. These components explained approximately 90% of variations in the training set (see Table 1 ). The rest of modes individually contributed at most 1.0% of variation. Thus for a given subject, each choice of SSM (M RA , M SA , M RD and M SD ) yields 30 variation modes (15 left + 15 right). In addition to the shape variations, the hippocampal volume normalized by TIV was also used as independent features. The resulting SSMs were evaluated on a testing set of 117 subjects (39 AD and 78 NC), also from ADNI. The correspondence between the SSM landmarks and hippocampal surface was built by the method described in section 2.3. The results of the accuracy on the testing set are shown in Table 2 . When using all the points to perform the PCA, the features extracted from the SSM built using a rigid transform reflect largely the volume differences between the hippocampi, whereas the ones extracted from the SSM built using a similarity transform are a better reflection of local shape variations. This is effect results in the M RA yielding better classification results than M SA (77.8% vs 72.6%) as volume alone is a good discriminant (83.8%). Adding volume to the features extracted using M RA and M SA increased both of their accuracy, but to a much less extent for M RA (+6.0%) compared to M SA (+12.8%).\nRestricting the PCA to discriminant points on shapes aligned via similarity transformation produced better discrimination between NC and AD than using all the points. Using the shape variation on discriminant points extracted from M SD yielded better accuracy than the global variation incorporating both shape and volume characterised by M RA . The best classification results were obtained when volume was added as an additional feature to the shape features obtained using the SSM built using a similarity transform on the discriminant points (M SD )."}, {"section_title": "Correlation with cognitive scores", "text": "The cognitive state of the subjects was measured using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) maximum 85 points (with delayed recall). In the correlation analysis, Spearman's correlation coefficient \u03c1 was used to compare the hippocampal shape variation with ADAS and MMSE scores. The results of the correlation between the hippocampal shape variation (using the first principal component) and the cognitive scores are shown in Table 3 . The principal variation in the model using discriminant points are better correlated with cognitive scores. Although the principal components in the similarity aligned SSM explained much less variation in the data set, they are more correlated with the cognitive scores, and might indicate a better representation of the effect of the disease on the shape of the hippocampus.

The variation modes of the hippocampus among the population as modelled by the SSM can be used to classify AD against NC. The conventional PCA in SSM is performed on all the landmark points on the shape which is a good representation of the original shape data in a lower dimensional subspace, while it might be not discriminant between two groups. By applying a statistical test on the landmark points in the SSM, we can identify the regions on the hippocampal surface which are more discriminant between AD and NC groups. The PCA performed on this subset produced variation modes which were used as features for the classification between these two groups. The principal variation modes on these regions were more sensitive to the shape change from NC to AD, and better correlated with the measurements of cognitive decline."}]
