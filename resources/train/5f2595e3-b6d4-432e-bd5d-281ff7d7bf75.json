[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Network-level analysis based on anatomical, pairwise similarities (e.g., cortical thickness) has been gaining increasing attention recently. However, there has not been a systematic study of the impact of spatial scale and edge definitions on predictive performance. In order to obtain a clear understanding of relative performance, there is a need for systematic comparison. In this study, we present a histogram-based approach to construct subject-wise weighted networks that enable a principled comparison across different methods of network analysis. We design several weighted networks based on two large publicly available datasets and perform a robust evaluation of their predictive power under three levels of separability. One of the interesting insights is that changes in nodal size (spatial scale) have no significant impact on predictive power among the three classification experiments and two disease cohorts studied, i.e., mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease from ADNI, and Autism from the ABIDE dataset.

Although there has been great progress in the last few decades in accurately characterizing AD as well as its progression (Weiner et al. 2017 (Weiner et al. , 2013 , its translation to improvement of clinical trials continues to be a great challenge (Cummings, Morstorf, and Zhong 2014) . For any preventive or disease-modifying therapies to succeed, early detection is key, and much of the development of network-level detection techniques has occurred in the AD using the ADNI data sets.\nRegional and network-level analyses of features derived from multiple modalities such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) (Cuingnet et al. 2011; Bron et al. 2015; Duchesne et al. 2008; Dyrba, M., Barkhof, F., Fellgiebel, A., Filippi, M., Hausner, L., Hauenstein, K., Kirste, T. and Teipel, S.J. 2015) , positron emission tomography (PET) (Dukart et al. 2011; Herholz et al. 2002; Matthews et al. 2016 ) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) (Hojjati, Ebrahimzadeh, and Khazaee 2017; Abraham et al. 2017) are showing great promise in identifying differences between health and disease in the early stages, as well as establishing how they correlate with cognitive measures (Alexander-Bloch, Giedd, and Bullmore 2013; Tijms et al. 2013) . Multimodal predictive modeling methods typically demonstrate high prognostic accuracy (Sui et al. 2011; Arbabshirani et al. 2017 ) in many applications, owing to their training based on multiple sets of rich and complementary information related to disease. However, recent efforts in building more sophisticated machine learning strategies produced unimodal sMRI methods rivaling the state-of-the-art multimodal approaches (Weiner et al. 2017) . Although multi-modal approaches tend to be more sensitive in general and offer richer insight, the practical advantages of sMRI being non-invasive, cost-effective and widely-accessible in the clinic, make sMRI-based computer-aided diagnostic methods for early detection highly desirable.\nCortical thickness is a sensitive imaging biomarker that can be easily derived from sMRI to diagnose AD. However, its sensitivity to identify the prodromal subjects (such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) at risk of progressing to AD is limited (Cuingnet et al. 2011) . Network-level analysis of cortical thickness and gray matter features demonstrated its potential to provide novel insights or improve predictive power (Raamana et al. 2015) , and is gaining in popularity (Evans 2013; Wen, He, and Sachdev 2011; Reid and Evans 2013; Jason P. Lerch et al. 2006) . Thickness network features offer complementary information compared to the underlying fiber density (Gong et al. 2012 ) and have been shown to have potential for early detection of AD (Raamana et al. 2015; Wee et al. 2012; Dai et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2016) , as well as for subtype discrimination (Raamana, Wen, et al. 2014) , outperforming the non-network raw-thickness features.\nNetwork analysis studies in cortical thickness range from 1. group-wise studies building networks based on group-wise covariance/correlation in cortical thickness (Evans 2013; He and Chen 2007 ; Jason P. Lerch et al. 2006) , which may be used to characterize the properties of these networks (such as small-worldness) as well as provide useful insight into network-level changes between two diagnostic groups e.g. healthy controls (CN) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), 2. studies building individual subject-wise graphs based on within-subject ROI-wise (pairwise) similarity metrics (Raamana et al. 2015; Tijms et al. 2012; Wee et al. 2012; Dai et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2016) to enable predictive modeling. These studies resulted in disease-related insights into network-level imaging biomarkers and improved accuracy for the early detection of AD. However, these studies are based on distinctly different parcellation schemes of the cortex, vastly different ways of linking two different regions in the brain, and datasets differing in size and demographics.\nInsights derived from various brain network studies showed considerable variability in reported group differences (Tijms et al. 2013) , and widely accepted standards for network construction are yet to be established (Stam 2014) . There have been recent efforts into understanding the importance and impact of graph creation methods, sample sizes and density (van Wijk, Stam, and Daffertshofer 2010; Phillips et al. 2015) and their anatomical plausibility (Seidlitz et al. 2017) . However, these studies have been restricted to the choice of group-wise correlation methods to define the edges, or limited to understanding the group-wise differences in selected graph measures. But such important methodological analyses have not been performed in the context of building individual subject-wise predictive modelling. Hence, there is no clear understanding of the impact of different choices in subject-wise network construction and their relative predictive performance.\nGiven their potential for the development of accurate early detection methods (Raamana et al. 2015; Raamana, Wen, et al. 2014 ) demonstrated by outperforming non-network raw-thickness features, and the wide-accessibility of sMRI, thickness-based networks deserve a systematic study in terms of 1. how does the choice of edge weight or linking criterion (correlation (He and Chen 2007) , similarity (Raamana et al. 2015) affect the performance of the predictive models? See Table 3 for more details. 2. how does the scale of parcellation (size and number of cortical ROIs) affect the predictive performance?\nThese questions, analyzed in our systematic study, can reveal important tradeoffs of this emerging theme of research. In this study, we present a comparison of six different ways of constructing thickness-based, subject-wise networks and present classification results under varyinglevels of separability i.e. in discriminating AD from CN and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from CN in the ADNI dataset. In order to test whether these results generalize to new datasets, diseases and separability, we also perform the study in discriminating Autism (AUT) subjects from CN in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Based on two large publicly available datasets, we not only to replicate the results on an independent dataset, but also replicate analysis in the presence of a different disease and in a different age group."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In this section, we describe the datasets we study in detail, along with a detailed description of the preprocessing and the associated methods."}, {"section_title": "ADNI dataset", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org .\nWe downloaded baseline T1 MRI scans (n=671) from the ADNI dataset (Jack et al. 2008) , which has quality-controlled Freesurfer parcellation (version 4.3) of the cortical surfaces provided in the ADNI portal (B. Fischl and Dale 2000; Bruce Fischl et al. 2002) . The parcellation and cortical thickness values downloaded were carefully visually inspected for errors in geometry and range. When noticeable errors were found, we eliminated those (n=24) subjects, and no manual editing and corrections were performed. The thickness features from the remaining subjects for the control (CN) and AD groups (effective n=647) comprised the first set of subjects for our analysis in this study. The second set of subjects with a slightly lower level of separability (MCI subjects converting to AD in 18 months, denoted by MCIc) were chosen to match the benchmarking study (Cuingnet et al. 2011) as closely as possible (to enable comparison to the many methods included) based on data availability and quality control results. The demographics for the two sets are listed in Table 1 .

A random subset of cortical parcellations (n=227) have been visually inspected for errors in geometry estimation and value ranges to eliminate any subjects showing even a mild chance of failure. From the passing subjects (n=226), we randomly selected 200 subjects (100 samples per diagnostic group) whose demographics are presented in Table 2 and the subject IDs are listed in the Appendix. Owing to the random selection, they come from multiple sites, which is akin to the ADNI dataset used in this study. Previous research (Abraham et al. 2017) showed that the site heterogeneity has little or no impact on the predictive accuracy of network-level features derived from task-free fMRI data. The distribution of the sites represented in this study are shown in Appendix D.

Here, we use an adaptive version wherein the patch-size is controlled by number of vertices (denoted by m=vertices/patch), instead of choosing a globally fixed number of patches (say 10) per Freesurfer APARC label regardless of its size (which can vary widely resulting in vastly different patch sizes within the same subject). As we change m, the subdivision of the cortical labels is performed purely on the existing mesh, and neither the geometrical parcellation itself nor the vertex density are modified. Here, m can be taken as the size of the graph node (imagine the node as a small patch within different Freesurfer labels). Alternatively, m can be seen as the spatial scale of the graph analysis, whose impact is being assessed for different values of m. When m is small (say 100), this results in large number (273) of total patches (sum of number of patches for each aparc label) across the whole cortex, whereas it results in only 68 patches when it is very high (m=10000), as such a large patch covered the full extent of all the 68 Freesurfer APARC labels currently defined on fsaverage cortical parcellation. We have analyzed the following values of m= 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000 and 10000, which resulted in the following total number of non-overlapping patches in the whole cortex: 273, 136, 97, 74 and 68 respectively.

Many of these previous studies relied on summarizing the thickness distribution in a given ROI (e.g. using mean within the entire Freesurfer label as in (Tijms et al. 2012 )) or within a patch (Freesurfer label subdivided further as in (Raamana et al. 2015) ), before constructing the networks. Although such approaches reduce the dimensionality and provide us with smooth features, they do not utilize the rich description and variance of the distribution of features. Moreover, studies thus far computed characteristic features from a binary network (by applying an optimized threshold (Raamana et al. 2015) ) or using a vector representation of weighted graphs (vector of distances in the upper triangular part of the edge weight matrix, as they are symmetric (Tijms et al. 2012) ). Here, in order to enable a principled comparison across the different edge weights (and to avoid the optimization of an arbitrary threshold required to binarize the edge weight matrix), we study weighted-networks only, whose derivation is described below."}, {"section_title": "Histogram WEighted NETworks (HiWeNet)", "text": "In this section, we describe the method employed in constructing the Histogram WEighted NEtworks (HiWeNet) based on cortical thickness. First, to improve the robustness of the features, 5% outliers from both tails of the distribution of cortical thickness values are discarded from each patch at a given scale m (see Appendix for more information). The residual distribution is converted into a histogram by binning into uniformly spaced n = 100 bins. Then the histogram counts are normalized using for k = 1 : N, where hi is the histogram of patch i. This method (illustrated further in Figure 1 ) enables the computation of the pairwise edge-weight (distance between the histograms, denoted by EW) for the two patches i and j. A variety of histogram distances as listed in Table 3 are studied in this paper to analyze their impact on predictive power. Table 3 ). The four smaller subpanels on the left show typical distributions of cortical thickness values for four random pairs of patches (in green and red) in a given subject (shown on cortical visualization on right). They demonstrate the means and shape of these distributions can vary substantially as you traverse across different pairs of cortical patches. The large panel in the middle illustrates the type of binning used to construct the histogram from each patch.\nTo analyze the relative benefit of HiWeNet, we compare the histogram-based methods to three commonly used inter-nodal weights based on descriptive summary statistics (denoted as MD, EMD and RS in Table 3 ). Once the edge weight matrix is computed (which is symmetric), we extract the upper-triangular part of the matrix and vectorize it (of length n*(n-1)/2, where n is the number of patches on the cortex for a given number of vertices/patch m). The vectorized array of edge weights (VEW) forms the input to the classifier. Each element of VEW corresponds to a unique edge in the matrix of pairwise edges. In addition, in Appendix C, we present and analyze the performance of an alternative network-representation method."}, {"section_title": "Note on test-retest reliability", "text": "The reliability of this network approach developed in HiWeNet (pairwise distances between ROIs) boils down to the reliability of the method to measure cortical thickness at the vertexlevel, as the remaining parts of algorithm are deterministic. Several studies have previously shown that cortical thickness estimation (and Freesurfer as a tool) have high test-retest reliability (Han et al. 2006; Iscan et al. 2015) and it has no impact on brain-behaviour relationships (Dickerson et al. 2008 ). In addition, given our choice of employing distance between thickness distributions over relatively large patches (1000 vertices or more), small changes in thickness (e.g. 0.2mm) would be absorbed into the distance calculations, and hence are unlikely to change the results presented herein."}, {"section_title": "Open source software", "text": "Almost all of the computational code related to this study had been implemented in Matlab.

Note this python package has not been used to produce the current results, but has been re-implemented by Raamana in Python to contribute to open source and also to make it accessible to broader audience who may not have access to expensive Matlab licenses. We have also published the original matlab code for the computation of adjacency matrices used for this study, within the the hiwenet python package.\nFurther, in order to make this research even more accessible, we have implemented the entire workflow of morphometric network extraction as a seamless pipeline called graynet, implemented entirely in Python (Raamana and Strother 2018) . Using this tool would enable those without much software engineering experience to simply run Freesurfer and then run graynet to get started with morphometric network analyses.

Thanks to the relatively large sample sizes, we could employ a repeated nested split-half cross-validation (CV) scheme, with 50% reserved for training, in order to maximize the sizes of training and test sets. Moreover, in each iteration of CV, all the methods are trained and assessed on the exact same training and test sets, in order to \"pair\" the performance estimates. This technique is shown to produce reliable and stable estimates of differences in predictive performance across different methods (Dietterich 1998; Burman 1989; Dem\u0161ar 2006) , instead of pooling multiple sets of performance distributions estimated separately on different training and test sets for each method independently.

This scheme is repeated N=200 times, to obtain the N paired estimates of classification performance. 2) In each CV run, a) feature selection (from VEW) on one split (training set of size Ntrai n) is performed based on t-statistic based ranking (based on group-wise differences in the training set only), selecting only the top Ntrai n/10 elements. The frequency of selection of a particular element (which is an edge in the cortical space) over different CV trials by the t-statistic ranking is an indication of its discriminative utility, and will be visualized to obtain better insight into the process. b)Support vector machine (SVM) is chosen as the classifier to discriminate the two groups in each experiment. SVM is optimized in an inner split-half CV applied to the training set via a grid search. We have employed the following ranges of values in the grid search for the margin control parameter C = 10 p ; p = 3 : 5 and the kernel bandwidth = 2 q ; q = 5 : 4. c) The optimized SVM is tested on the second split (test) to evaluate its performance.\n3) The process in Step 2 is repeated N=200 times (Varoquaux et al. 2016; Raamana et al. 2015) to obtain 200 independent estimates for each method being compared. 4) In this study, we measure the performance by area under the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (denoted by AUC), whose distributions for different methods are shown in Figure 3 .\nThe results in study were produced using Raamana's programming library implemented in Matlab based on the builtin statistics and machine learning toolbox.\nOpen source tool to evaluate predictive utility: In order to enable much wider audience (those without access to a Matlab license, or those who do not have the necessary programming skills), we have also built an open source tool called neuropredict . Once the researchers run Freesurfer successfully, they can run graynet (Raamana and Strother 2018) , which produces the necessary single-subject morphometric networks.

The seed-based network visualizations are produced for each edge weight method separately for m=2000, identical to the network construction method described in the Methods section: compute histogram-distance between the thickness distribution of the seed and all the other ROIs, averaging this edge weight across all the healthy subjects, and retaining only the strongest edges (top 5%).\nTo make the comparison across the three datasets easy, they are grouped for each metric e.g. for median difference (MD), the comparison is shown below for healthy controls.

This pair-wise link frequency can be mapped back to individual cortical patches for intuitive visualization, identifying most discriminative regions (MDRs).

Each color on the cortex represents a particular EW metric (labelled on the colorbar) that led to its selection, and when multiple methods selected the same region (indicating additional importance), we painted it red and labelled it \"Multiple\". Note the input to the SVM classifier was a vector of edge weights (from upper-triangular part of the edge weight matrix), and hence the selection of a particular edge leads to highlighting both the regions forming the link. Moreover, the importance of a particular node (cortical patch) could be accumulated from its multiple links, if any. Fig. 5 shows the red MDRs (identified by multiple methods as MDR) cover a large cortical area, which is not unexpected, given the changes caused by full AD are known to be widespread over the cortex. In Fig. 6 , we observe the MDRs in areas consistently identified with progressive MCI or early stage AD such as middle temporal lobe, cingulate (anterior and inferior), cuneus and precuneus.

Especially, in challenging classification experiments such as CN3 vs. AUT. It would be ideal to evaluate the predictive performances on additional independent validation/replication datasets (such as AIBL). Such a broadening of scope for the study is not only computationally very intensive, but we believe studying the above is unlikely to change the conclusions. It would be nevertheless useful to quantitatively support it.\nIt would also be interesting to study the impact of different atlas choices (other than fsaverage, such as MNI152), parcellation (such as (Destrieux et al. 2010) ) and subdivision schemes (functional or geometric or multimodal) Glasser et al. 2016) , potential neuroimaging artifacts and confounds (Churchill et al. 2015; J. P. Lerch, van der Kouwe, and Raznahan 2017) , but this would be demanding not only computationally but also in expert manpower for quality control (typically unavailable). It would also be quite interesting to replicate this study in the context of differential diagnosis (Raamana, Rosen, et al. 2014) . A cross-modal comparison (Reid et al. 2015) , in terms of predictive performance, with networklevel features derived from modalities such as task-free fMRI would also be interesting."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have studied six different ways of constructing weighted networks derived from cortical thickness features, based on a novel method to derive edge weights based on histogram distances. We performed a comprehensive model comparison based on extensive crossvalidation of their predictive utility and nonparametric statistical tests. This has been studies under three separabilities (ranging from pronounced, mild and to subtle differences) derived from two independent and large publicly available datasets.\nSome interesting results of this study based on the individual-subject classification results are:\n\u2022 the simpler methods of edge weight computation such as the difference in median thickness are as predictive as the sophisticated methods relying on the richer descriptions based on complete histograms. \u2022 within a given method, the impact of a spatial scale m on predictive performance is not significant. The most popular way of computing edge weights in group-wise analysis i.e. histogram correlation, is shown to be the least predictive of disease-status in the context of individualized prediction via HiWeNet .  011_S_0053  137_S_0366  012_S_0689  114_S_0979  024_S_1171  041_S_1435  098_S_0884   067_S_0076  116_S_0370  012_S_0712  016_S_0991  067_S_1185  023_S_0078  002_S_0938   023_S_0083  114_S_0374  012_S_0720  100_S_0995  109_S_1192  098_S_0149  130_S_0956   023_S_0084  116_S_0392  033_S_0733  013_S_0996  013_S_1205  128_S_0167  029_S_0999   123_S_0088  032_S_0400  128_S_0740  036_S_1001  126_S_1221  100_S_0190  094_S_1027   123_S_0091  027_S_0404  100_S_0747  002_S_1018  067_S_1253  128_S_0216  027_S_1081   023_S_0093  136_S_0426  021_S_0753  141_S_1024  027_S_1254  022_S_0219  094_S_1090 123_S_0094 "}, {"section_title": "CN1 subjects used in", "text": ""}]
