[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is no longer much controversy about the effectiveness of early intervention services for children with disabilities and children living in poverty (Guralnick, 1997). Two decades of research has indicated that high quality early intervention services can have positive impacts on both groups of children. Two significant reviews of research, the National Research Council's report Neurons to Neighborhoods (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) and RAND's analysis of early childhood interventions, Investing in Our Children (Karoly et al., 1998) indicate that high quality early intervention progams can have very positive results for those children who receive services. Those results can include such benefits as increases in both short and long term academic achievement, reductions in grade retention rates, reductions in special education referrals, and even reductions in such risk as teen-age pregnancy. Some studies of the highest quality programs such as the Perry Preschool Program of Ypsilanti, Michigan show that early intervention programming can have long-term positive outcomes (Schweinhart & Weikart, 1980). The Perry Preschool study found that participation in the early intervention program was related to increased high school graduation rates, increased levels of income earnings as young adults, and decreased welfare program participation (Schweinhart, Barnes, & Weikart, 1993). However, even the best early intervention programs, sometimes show mixed results. An earlier review of the Perry Preschool program found that the early intervention services were not related to reduction of grade retention rates for children living in poverty. Tliis report details the outcomes of children enrolled in two different types of early intervention programs serving young children with disabilities and young children living in poverty when compared to their peers. The results are striking and encouraging."}, {"section_title": "Investing in Better Outcomes April 2002", "text": "Delaware's Early Intervention Efforts Delaware has been providing early intervention services to young children since the early 1980s. However, widespread availability of comprehensive early intervention services, in the form of programming for infants and toddlers with disabilities, preschoolers with disabilities, both mild and moderate, and four-year-olds living in poverty occurred in the 1990s. In the early part of the decade, Delaware legislated the Programs for Children with Disabilities and began serving three-and four-year-olds with mild delays in addition to preschoolers with moderate and severe disabilities, who had been served since the 1980s. The programs for Children with Disabilities (PCD) differed from the traditional preschool special education programs in that there was more flexibility in how children could be served. Services were provided by each school district or could be provided through a contractor arranged for by school districts. With the institution of these changes, preschool special education (PSE) programs now provided intervention programming for children with disabilities as wide ranging as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, fragile X syndrome, communication disorders, and developmental delays. In the mid-1990s, Delaware began to provide comprehensive early childhood programming for all children aged four who were living in poverty. The Early Childhood Assistance Programs (ECAP) are modeled after the federal Head Start program and use the Head Start Performance Standards as their program standards. In combination with federal Head Start funding, the ECAPs made Delaware one of the first states to provide comprehensive four-year-old early childhood programming for every child living in poverty. To oversee this flourishing activity in the area of early intervention, an innovative governmental structure was created. The Delaware Interagency Resource Management Committee' ([RMC), an interdepartmental committee designed to oversee some of the resources allocated to Delaware's early intervention programs, was formed in 1992. The IRMC was and is currently charged with overseeing three major early intervention programs: 1) the Birth to Three Early Intervention System for very young children with disabilities and their families, 2) the statefunded Early Childhood Assistance Programs (ECAP) for four-year-olds living in poverty and their families, and 3) the Preschool Children with Disabilities programs operated through local school districts for three-and four-year-olds with mild disabilities that included developmental delays and speech and language delays. Once formed, one of the first questions asked by the IRMC members was about the impact that such programs have on children's long-term outcomes. Committee members wanted to know what academic, behavioral, and social impact these early intervention programs were having on children who were living in poverty and children who had disabilities."}, {"section_title": "The Genesis of a Longitudinal Study", "text": "prompted by the IRMC members' questions about the impact of early intervention progranuning, the Delaware Early Childhood Longitudinal Study was born. In the Spring of 1997, a team of researchers, policy analysis, and program managers at the University of Delaware Center for Disabilities Studies and the Delaware Departments of Education, Health and Social Services and Services for Children, Youth, and their Families designed and proposed a study to follow a goup of children as they entered kindergarten in the Fall of 1997. The study was designed to follow the children from their kindergarten experience through their third grade year, coinciding with their participation in the 3rd grade Delaware State Testing Program (DSTP). One of the primary questions of the study asked how did children with disabilities or living in poverty who received early intervention programming compare to children in similar situations who did not receive early intervention services? The IRMC approved the study and the work was begun in the fall of 1997."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "The Delaware Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (DeCLS) was designed as a retrospective, two-group, post-test only design (see Campbell & Stanley, 1963). That is, it was designed to ensure that there was no bias in the sampling process and that there was a group of children to whom the intervention group could be compared. A stratified random sampling process was used to select 717 kindergarten students entering school in the fall of 1997 in eight of Delaware's school districts. The random selection increased the likelihood that the two groups of students compared would be equal in characteristics except for their early intervention experiences."}, {"section_title": "Investing in Better Outcomes", "text": "April 2002"}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Astratified random sample of kindergarten students from eight school districts throughout the state was selected for inclusion in the DeCLS. The sample was stratified according to socioeconomic level and presence of disability. The randomized sample included 217 kindergarten students with active Individualized Education Plans (LEPs), 250 students who qualified for free lunch at the start of kindergarten, and 250 students from the general student population who did not have a disability and did not qualify for free lunch (see Table 1). Found within the randomized sample of kindergarten students were children who had received early intervention services during their preschool years. Forty-nine (49) of the 717 children had received either ECAP or federal Head Start services when they were four years of age. Eighty-nine (89) of the children had received services from the local school district preschool special education (PSE) programs when they were three and/or four years of age. Five children had received services from the Birth to Three Early Intervention System and specifically from Child Development Watch2 (see Table 2). Outcomes Measured Success of students can be measured in many ways. For the purposes of this study, the outcome variables measured included academic as well as behavioral variables. The outcome measures collected for this study included: annual year-end grades annual grade promotion/retention formal behavioral reports referrals to and enrollment in special education services referrals to and enrollment in other school services third grade Delaware State Testing Program results in reading and math Analysis Comparisons of the outcomes for students who received early intervention services and those who did not receive early intervention services were conducted at the conclusion of the 2001-2002 school year. These comparisons were conducted using statistical analyses such as analysis of variance or means testing such as t-tests. These statistical tests measure for the differences between groups. At the end of the 2001-02 school year (the fourth year of the study), an analysis of the number of students remaining in the study who had received early intervention services was conducted. At the same time, comparable comparison groups of students to those who received the ECAP/Head Start or PSE services were determined. These analyses revealed there were 506 of the original 717 students who remained available to the study. This is an attrition rate of 29.4% or 211 students. This is a comparable rate of attrition to other similar longitudinal studies. The 211 students who were not available at the end of the studywere either no longer living in Delaware or were no longer attending Delaware public schools. Fifty-two (52) of the 506 students who remained in the study were not in third grade during the 2001-02 school year and had been retained at least one grade. These 52 students did not participate in the 3rd grade DSTP in March 2001. A total of 454 (63.3%) of the original 717 students did participate in the March 2001 DSTP. F'or purposes of comparative analysis, the 42 students who received ECAP or Head Start services when they were four years of age in 1996-97 and remained in the study at the end of the 2001-2002 school year were compared with 109 students who were living in poverty at the time they began kindergarten who did not receive ECAP or Head Start services. Also for purposes of comparative analysis, the 72 students who received PSE services when they were three and four years of age in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and began the 1997-98 school year in kindergarten with an IEP were compared with 51 students who began kindergarten in 1997-98 and were identified as needing special education services while in kindergarten, first, or second grade. In addition to the comparison goup analyses, grade retention rates for the groups of students receiving ECAP and PSE services during their preschool years were also compared to all 506 students for whom information was available.

Over 71% of this group of students (71.8%) also met or exceeded the standard in mathematics according to the March 2001 DSTP. Both the reading and math percentages are virtually equal to the overall state percentage. Despite the challenging social emotional factors in these children's lives, including such challenges as foster care, living in poverty, and violence in the family, this group of children still met or exceeded the state standards in reading and math at the same rate as students throughout the state.

While records indicated that no child began public school services until their immunization records were complete, records did show that school personnel worked with these families to complete the children's immunizations and to secure updated health reports. The lack of up-to-date immunizations and health reports at the time of kindergarten entry was highly correlated with living in poverty an.d not being enrolled in an ECAP or Head Start program. Twenty of the 21 students fit this profile. Of these 21 students, only 47.6% met or exceeded the standard in reading according to the March 2001 DSTP. Only 42.9% met or exceeded the standard for mathematics according to the March 2001 DSTP. Both of these rates are significantly lower than the statewide rates for students living in poverty (p. < .01). While it is unclear that lack of immunization and on-going health care has a direct link to academic outcomes, those children who did not have immunizations or complete health reports at the start of kindergarten had significantly poorer performance on their third gade reading and math DSTP exams in March 2001. ECAP, Head Start, and preschool special education services provide instruction and support that has a significant impact on children's academic performance and can address the achievement gap for students living in poverty and students with disabilities. Investing in Better Outcomes April 2002"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "At the conclusion of third grade, after four years 'of public education, students who received early intervention services through the state funded Early Childhood Assistance Programs, the federally funded Head Start programs, or the state and federally funded Preschool Children with Disabilities programs were showing significantly better academic outcomes in comparison to comparable students who did not receive these early intervention services. It is clear that those children living in poverty who receive ECAP and Head Start services perform better academically four years after receiving those services than those children living in poverty who did not participate in ECAP or Head Start services. Likewise, those students with disabilities who were identified in their preschool years and who received special education preschool services when they were three and four years old performed better academically four years after receiving those services than those children who were not identified as needing special education services until they entered kindergarten or later. With a significant achievement gap documented for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (Delaware Education Research and Development Center, 2002), early intervention services such as the statefunded Early Childhood Assistance Programs, the federally funded Head Start programs, and the' jointly funded preschool special education programs are one of the strategies to address this gap. The state-funded Early Childhood Assistance Programs, the federally funded Head Start programs, and the jointly funded preschool special education programs are an investment in children for better academic outcomes. They are an investment in Delaware's future.
