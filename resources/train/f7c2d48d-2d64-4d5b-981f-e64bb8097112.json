[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: The APOE \u03b54 allele is the most significant common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).

We report a rare variant association analysis of genes in the vicinity of APOE with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging biomarkers of LOAD."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The number of individuals with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is rapidly increasing and predicted to triple by 2050 with the increasing population of aging adults [1] . The heritability of LOAD was predicted to be up to 80% based on twin studies [2] and large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently led to the identification and confirmation of approximately 22 LOAD-associated genes including APOE (Apolipoprotein E), the best established and most significant susceptibility gene for LOAD [3] . The association of APOE with LOAD has been replicated and validated in many studies from different populations [4] . The APOE \u03b54 allele increases an individual's risk for developing LOAD and also reduces age-at-onset in patients with LOAD in a dose-dependent manner, while the APOE \u03b52 allele appears to reduce the risk for LOAD [5] . Furthermore, GWAS studies have repeatedly identified several susceptibility loci for LOAD near the 19q13 on the chromosome 19 including APOE and TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog) [3, 6] . In particular, TOMM40 has the second most significant SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) associated with LOAD and multiple LOAD-related neuroimaging phenotypes in the 19q13 region [7] [8] [9] . However, conditional analyses strongly suggested that this effect is due to APOE [10, 11] . As APOE and TOMM40 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), it is not easy to attribute an APOE-independent role of TOMM40 in the risk of LOAD development, although TOMM40 is essential for protein trafficking into mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction has been widely implicated in LOAD pathophysiology. Several groups investigated the association between a variable length poly-T polymorphism (poly-T) at rs10524523 within TOMM40 and LOAD, and yielded contrasting results [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Recently, Jun et al. comprehensively evaluated the association of risk and age at onset of LOAD with common SNPs (MAF (minor allele frequency) > 5%) and poly-T repeat in the APOE region using approximately 23,000 cases and controls, and found no significant independent association after adjusting for APOE genotype [16] . Highly significant results, after adjusting for APOE genotype, are unlikely in view of the very strong LD in this region.\nUp to 50% of LOAD heritability remain unexplained by all of the known LOAD susceptibility genes including APOE and a substantial missing heritability for LOAD remains to be identified [17] . The advent of high throughput next generation sequencing such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify variation in human genes has created unprecedented opportunities to discover genetic factors that influence disease risk in the field of human genetics [18, 19] . Several recent reports show that deep re-sequencing of GWAS-implicated loci and WGS-based association studies can identify independent functional rare variants with large effects on diseases including LOAD pathogenesis [20] [21] [22] .\nTwo neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Studies have shown decreased concentrations of the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 peptide and increased concentrations of total tau (t-tau) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in AD compared with cognitively normal elders [23, 24] . Here we performed a gene-based association analysis of rare variants within genes in the vicinity of APOE with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and LOAD-related neuroimaging markers using a WGS data set (N = 757) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results strongly suggest rare variants in the region surrounding APOE on chromosome 19 were significantly associated with LOAD-related CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and neuroimaging biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "All individuals included in this study were participants of the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) initiated in 2004, especially its subsequent extensions (ADNI-GO/2).

Among 4,017 variants, there are 147 exonic and 2,159 intronic variants. Of 147 exonic variants, we found 1 frameshift and 3 nonframeshift indels, 72 nonsynonymous and 51 synonymous SNPs, and 20 unknown variants.\nAssociation of rare variants near the APOE region with CSF A\u03b2 Gene-based association analysis of rare SNPs near the APOE region identified three genes (TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1) that achieved a genome-wide significant association with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 (p < 5 \u00d7 10\n) ( Table 2 ) and the most significant association was between APOC1 and CSF A\u03b2 . After controlling for APOE genotype and adjusting for multiple comparisons based on a Bonferroni threshold (p < 0.05/12 = 0.0042), 4 genes (CBLC, BCAM, APOE, and RELB) remain significant. The strongest significant association was observed at the BCAM gene (p = 0.0006). There were about 10% short indels of all rare variants near the APOE region.

A polygenic risk score of all rare variants in 3 genes (CBLC, BCAM, RELB) was associated with multifocal brain atrophy, predominantly in the temporal and bilateral frontal lobes (Fig. 1d ).

Our results indicated that four genes (CBLC, BCAM, APOE, and RELB) remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, gene-based association analysis of common variants identified one significant gene BCL3. Whole-brain surface-based analysis identified highly significant clusters associated with rare variants of CBLC in temporal lobe regions including the entorhinal cortex and frontal lobe regions.\nBCL3 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3) gene functions as a transcriptional co-activator involved in cell replication and apoptosis that activates through its association with NF-\u03baB homodimers [35] . BCL3 gene is associated with genetic linkage with late-onset Familial Alzheimer's disease as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia [36] [37] [38] . RELB (RELB proto-oncogene, NF-\u03baB subunit) gene is a member of NF-\u03baB family of transcriptional factors. Among its related pathways are immune system and interleukin-3, 5 and GM-CSF signaling. NF-\u03baB plays a central role in the inflammatory and immune responses and controls cell proliferation and protects the cell from apoptosis [39] . NF-\u03baB is a major transcription factor and activated in AD patients. Amyloid beta accumulation is a potential activator of NF-\u03baB in primary neurons [40] . CBLC (Cbl proto-oncogene C, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) gene is the member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Cbl proteins play an important role in cell signaling through the ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of the tyrosine kinases. BCAM (basal cell adhesion molecule) gene encodes a glycoprotein expressed on cell surfaces [41] . BCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein, laminin \u03b1-5. BCAM may play a role in intracellular signaling. BCAM is related to the Lutheran glycoprotein, which is a specific marker of brain capillary endothelium, which forms the blood brain barrier (BBB) in vivo [42, 43] .\nADNI is a unique cohort and the only large WGS data set of LOAD with CSF A\u03b2 and neuroimaging data also available. However, a limitation of the present report is that we used a modest sample size (n = 757) of whole genome sequencing data for genetic analysis. Therefore, validation in independent and larger cohorts is warranted.\nIn conclusion, we used whole genome sequencing to perform an association analysis of rare variants within genes near the APOE region with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and neuroimaging biomarkers of LOAD. Importantly, our results implicate this region or these genes contain additional explanatory information with regard to LOAD endophenotypes above and beyond that conferred by APOE genotype. Overall, combining whole genome sequencing and LOAD-related quantitative endophenotypes adds to the growing understanding of the genetics of LOAD and holds promise for discovery of rare variants involved in neurodegeneration and other brain disorders, further nominating novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
