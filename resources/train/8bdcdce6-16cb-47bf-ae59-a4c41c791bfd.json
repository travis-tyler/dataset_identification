Several linkage studies for major depressive disorder have been performed and these identified only one relevant locus (3, 4) . In addition, hundreds of candidate genes have been investigated in association studies, but only six variants have been confirmed in meta-analyses (5, 6) . Recent efforts to find new candidate genes via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also been largely unsuccessful (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Genome-wide association studies identified interesting regions, but associations with MDD reached standard levels of genomewide significance at only one locus (15) . Furthermore, only few previously reported candidate genes were replicated in genomewide association studies (7, 13, 16) .\nDepression exists on a continuum of varying severity and duration. Depressive symptoms (measured on a continuous scale) and MDD (measured on a dichotomous scale) are associated with similar patterns of risk factors suggesting shared etiology with varying severity (17) . The ability to detect genetic predictors might, therefore, be improved by analyzing depression quantitatively (18) , defining MDD as a diagnostic entity applied to the extreme of the depression continuum (19) . Using the phenotypic variation within cases and control subjects by analyzing depression quantitatively has been shown to greatly increase the power to detect genetic variants (20) . In fact, a GWAS of the depression facet of personality (a continuous trait) identified several candidate genes. However, the sample size was small and findings remain to be confirmed (21) .\nIn the current study, we exploit the entire continuum of depression, defined as the number and severity of depressive symptoms a person experiences. We assessed depressive symptoms with one of the most widely used instruments in the general population, namely the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. This scale assesses the following major dimensions of depression: depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. The CES-D detects cases of MDD with high sensitivity and specificity (22) and has proven to be relatively stable over time (82% of older adults had stable CES-D scores over four measurement rounds in 10 years) (23, 24) . In addition, a high CES-D score, like a diagnosis of MDD, is associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality (25, 26) . Moreover, heritability estimates of depressive symptoms, as measured with the CES-D, range from 15% to 34% (27) (28) (29) .\nWe present the results of a meta-analysis combining genomewide association results of depressive symptoms from 17 population-based studies of European ancestry (n = 34,549). In addition, we sought to replicate our findings in five samples that used instruments other than the CES-D to quantify depressive symptoms (n = 16,709).

In studies with multiple CES-D assessments, the round with the largest number of participants (generally the first examination round) was chosen. Persons with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were excluded, based on records, interviews, or medication use (these disorders probably have a distinct genetic component).

We, thus, did not exclude these persons from the analysis, but we chose to adjust their total depressive symptoms score for medication use. However, response to antidepressants is highly variable. In addition, information on compliance is often not available in population-based studies. We therefore used a nonparametric imputation algorithm to adjust the CES-D score for treatment effect. We made two assumptions: the CES-D score of a person using antidepressants is a rightcensored value, i.e., the score is lower than the untreated value would be; and persons with a high CES-D score, on average, responded less to their medication than persons with a lower CES-D score. We replaced the score of a person on antidepressants with the mean depressive symptom score of all persons using antidepressants that had the same or a higher depressive symptom score. This procedure was performed separately for men and women and was based on an algorithm used for adjustment of blood pressure for persons on antihypertensive drugs (46) .

Although replication with other instruments than the CES-D might introduce some heterogeneity, all instruments measure depressive symptoms. Further, a positive replication would ensure that our top hits are not instrument-dependent.\nAge, Gene, Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES) (49), the ARIC 3 study (31) (50), and the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) (51,52) measured depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Maastricht Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), respectively. The BDI-II, GDS, and PHQ-9 aim to screen for depression and are highly correlated (53, 54) . The BDI-II is based on the DSM-IV criteria for MDD and comprises 21 items on a scale of 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 is, like the BDI-II, based on the DSM-IV criteria for MDD, but it consists of nine items on a scale of 0 to 3 to assess depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. The GDS was specifically designed to screen for depression in older adults and comprised 15 items answered with \"yes\" or \"no.\" The Maastricht Questionnaire (21 items), although designed to measure vital exhaustion, correlates with measures of depressive symptoms (55) and was previously used to assess depressive symptoms (56, 57) .\nReplication was considered significant if the Bonferronicorrected p value for testing seven SNPs was \u00a3.050 (uncorrected p value \u00a3 7.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 )."}, {"section_title": "Pathway Analysis", "text": "Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) (58) was used to identify and classify biological processes among the SNPs associated with p values \u03fd 10 \u00c04 from the overall meta-analysis (n \u00bc 51,258).

In line with the population-based design of the studies, median depressive symptoms scores ranged between 2 and 10 for the CES-D 20-item version. This is well below the cutoff of 16 at which major depression cases in older adults can be identified with high specificity and sensitivity (22) . The percentage of persons scoring above this cutoff varied between 4.7% and 27.1%.

On average, CES-D scores for persons on antidepressants more than doubled after imputation.\nNone of the 17 tested candidate genes were replicated in the current study (Table S4 in Supplement 1).

A meta-analysis of 17 studies (n \u00bc 34,549) with depressive symptoms measured by CES-D was performed (Q-Q and Manhattan plots in Figure S1 in Supplement 1). The total number of SNPs analyzed was 2,391,896. No association reached the prespecified genomewide significance level of 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 for the association with the depressive symptom score. However, we identified 117 SNPs with a p value \u03fd 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , which included seven independent top SNPs (R 2 \u03fd .05 in 500 kb, Table 2 ). The SNP with the lowest p value was rs8020095 (p \u00bc 1.05 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 ) and maps to an intronic region of GPHN on chromosome 14. Of the seven top SNPs, none had a heterogeneity p value (tested by Cochran's Q) below .05 in the discovery meta-analysis.\nWe reran the analysis for the independent top SNPs excluding people on antidepressants; p values of the top SNPs shifted toward one (e.g., rs8020095 p value 1.56 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 , rs161645 p value 1.71 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 ). Adding five points to the total score for people using antidepressants in a subsample (RS-I, RS-II, RS-III, n \u00bc 7925) resulted in the same top SNPs and similar p values for the top SNPs tested here.\nReplication Table 2 presents the results of the replication analysis and the overall meta-analysis across discovery sample and replication sample. The mean observed to expected variance ratio for the seven top SNPs across all cohorts ranged between .91 and .98 (Table S2 in Supplement 1). In the replication sample, an SNP on chromosome 5 showed an association with depressive symptoms (5q21, rs161645, p \u00bc 9.19 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , Table 2 ), but this association did not reach the predefined threshold for multiple testing (corrected for multiple testing p \u00bc .064).

An association plot of the 5q21 region is presented in Figure 1 .\nIn contrast, the strength of the associations of the other top SNPs with depressive symptoms was attenuated, as judged by the p value. All SNPs with a p value \u03fd 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 from the overall meta-analysis (n \u00bc 51,258) are presented in Table S3 in Supplement 1."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this GWAS of depressive symptoms, we combined the results of 17 population-based studies with 34,549 individuals to find common variants for depressive symptoms. Including the five replication studies, this effort comprised data from 51,258 independent individuals. Of the seven SNPs we attempted to replicate, we found suggestive evidence for the observed association of one SNP in the 5q21 region with depressive symptoms. This region reached genome-wide significance when tested over all studies (n \u00bc 51,258).\nAlthough evidence shows that depression can be well represented by a continuum of depressive symptoms, we observed a genome-wide significant hit in this large GWAS only when pooling all studies with depressive symptoms. This difficulty of finding signals is in line with GWAS of major depression. Nine GWAS of depression, of which the largest comprised $6000 MDD cases and $ 7000 control subjects, yielded only one genome-wide significant finding (15) .\nThe approach of studying depression on a continuum has the advantage that not only information on extremes is used but that all available information is exploited. Van der Sluis et al. (20) showed that if the phenotypic variation among cases, as well as the variation among control subjects, is used, this greatly increases the power to detect genetic variants. However, studying depression along a continuum in population-based studies implies that many individuals have a low depressive symptoms score and that few persons score high. Therefore, it remains to be validated whether the results presented here are generalizable to clinical depression cases. In addition, the CES-D measures current depressive symptoms and not remitted depressive symptomatology. This introduces false-negatives, but in this population-based approach in which low depressive symptomatology is overrepresented, the resulting bias would be conservative. Furthermore, the distribution of depressive symptoms differed between cohorts. We therefore performed a p value based meta-analysis, which is a valid approach, but has the consequence that we cannot draw conclusions on effect sizes. NCBI: number of genes in a biological process (reference). Observed: number of genes that belong to a biological process among the GWAS results. Expected: expected number of genes that belong to a biological process in the GWAS results. Over/under: overrepresentation or underrepresentation of the genes in the results.\nGWAS, genome-wide association studies; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information.\na A Bonferroni-correction was applied to correct for multiple testing. Differences in depressive symptoms distribution do not impact on the validity of the findings. People with high depressive symptoms are more likely to carry risk variants, but this should not depend on the number of people with a high score. Furthermore, the distribution of I 2 , a measure of heterogeneity (60) , of the results combining all samples did not differ from the distribution of I 2 of the results when samples with low or high depression prevalence were meta-analyzed separately. No excess heterogeneity was observed, which suggests that depressive symptoms can be analyzed linearly. However, some genetic main effects may be more detectable in very homogeneous populations. Observed differences in distributions of depressive symptoms may have resulted from environmental factors, and if these, in turn, interact with specific genetic variants, only very homogeneous studies could also detect a genetic main effect. Environmental factors, like education level, differed among cohorts. In observational research, one would have controlled for such possible confounders. In genetic studies, confounding by environmental factors is unlikely to occur (61), but controlling for environmental factors can also be done to increase precision, i.e., reduce the variance in depressive symptoms (62) . However, environmental factors explain very little variance in depressive symptoms. Therefore, the benefit of performing additional controlled analyses will be negligible and offset by running several models with the risk of multiple testing.\nIn the current study, depressive symptom scores for people using antidepressants were imputed to take into account the high variability in response to antidepressants. In an analysis of depressive symptoms, people on antidepressants, who most likely had depression or depressive symptoms, are particularly informative. Therefore, excluding this group a priori may have changed the results. In a subsample, the imputation algorithm used in the current study yielded similar results as adding an arbitrary score of five points to the depressive symptom scores of people using antidepressants.\nThis study was performed in older adults. Cerebrovascular burden and cognitive impairment, which have a relatively high prevalence in old age, are known to be associated with depressive symptoms. In addition, while a high CES-D score indicates depressive symptoms, it can also be suggestive of, for example, anxiety (63) . In other words, the level of depressive symptoms is a clinically heterogeneous phenotype. However, the genetic background of clinically heterogeneous phenotypes like anxiety and depression may be more uniform than the clinical presentation suggests (64) . In addition, while nongenetic determinants of depression may differ with age, genetic determinants were shown to be stable at different ages (65, 66) . Therefore, the results presented here are presumably generalizable to younger populations.\nWe combined results from studies that measured depressive symptoms with instruments other than the CES-D to replicate the association between depressive symptoms and seven independent top SNPs. In an overall meta-analysis, we tested whether any variation introduced by different instruments was offset by the increased power. In the replication effort, one SNP (5q21 region) reached a p value below .05 but did not pass this threshold when controlling for multiple testing. Another SNP in the 5q21 region, however, reached genome-wide significance when the association across discovery and replication studies was tested (n = 51,258). The 5q21 region resides in a gene desert with the closest gene, NUDT12, lying more than 1000 kb away. NUDT12 has not been previously implicated in psychiatric disorders.\nAlthough we observed suggestive association of the 5q21 region with depressive symptoms, genome-wide significance was observed only after pooling the results of the discovery and replication studies. Also, we could not replicate associations with candidate genes that previously have been reported to be associated with depression. Several explanations are plausible.\nA first explanation for these observations is that the top SNPs identified in this study are false-positive findings. However, the discovery set was large and although we did not find any genome-wide significant hits, true hits are expected to be found among the top findings. A pathway analysis on the results of the overall meta-analysis showed that biological processes that play a role in depression were overrepresented among our top hits.\nSecond, the replication sample was smaller than the discovery sample and may be underpowered to detect true effects with moderate effect sizes, which might have been overestimated in the discovery analysis (winner's curse). Indeed, we found suggestive evidence of association for only one of seven SNPs, but the direction of association was compatible for five out of seven SNPs.\nThird, lack of replication might be related to heterogeneity of the replication phenotype. In the replication approach, we combined the results of studies that measured depressive symptoms with different instruments. Instruments were also administered at different time points across studies. However, the instruments have been reported to be highly correlated (correlations between .77 and .86) and relatively stable genetic determinants over the life span were observed in an Australian Twin study (53, 54, 65, 67, 68) .\nSeveral other factors can hinder the search for common variants associated with depressive symptoms. Population stratification, for example, can result in false-positive findings. To avoid population stratification, only individuals from European descent were included. Including only individuals from European descent also minimized measurement error caused by cultural differences in responses to the CES-D (69). Other possible explanations are the presence of genetic heterogeneity (70) , gene-gene interactions (71) , and gene-environment interactions. The interaction between candidate genes and life events has been repeatedly studied for depression (72) . However, to study this phenomenon in a genome-wide approach requires much larger data sets (13) . In addition, it is suggested that the gain of gene-environment interaction studies over studies of main effects for complex diseases like depression is minimal (73) . The study described here focused on common genetic variation, but rare variants or copy number variations not tagged by SNPs might play a role in depression (74, 75) . Using a larger reference panel, like the haplotypes generated by the 1000 Genomes Project, would have improved the yield of rare variants. Harmonizing imputation reference and imputation tools might have further increased the power of the study to detect associations. Also, not single SNPs, but many SNPs collectively, each with a very small effect, may affect the susceptibility for depressive symptoms (66) .\nIn conclusion, the efforts of a large collaboration to identify common variants associated with depressive symptoms yielded no genome-wide significant hit in the discovery sample. In the replication approach, we found suggestive evidence for a SNP in the 5q21 region. When analyzing the discovery and replication samples, one genome-wide significant hit in this region was observed. Further investigation of the 5q21 region is necessary to verify the association with depressive symptoms and to pinpoint the possible functional variant. Such a future study of depressive symptoms could analyze this phenotype stratified by gender and incorporate longitudinal information with repeated measures of depressive symptoms to provide more power to our search for potential candidate genes."}]
