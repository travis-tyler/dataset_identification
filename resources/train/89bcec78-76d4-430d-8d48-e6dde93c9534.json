Girls had improved performance and boys did not in four countries, whereas there was no country in which boys improved and girls did not. Both girls and boys improved in five countries and Ontario province. Reflecting declines in achievement across assessments, both genders had lower achievement in TIMSS 2003 in seven countries and Quebec province as did the girls in Belgium (Flemish). \u2022 At the fourth grade, the TIMSS 2003 results by gender paralleled those at the eighth grade. Girls had significantly higher average achievement in Singapore, Moldova, the Philippines, and Armenia. Boys had higher average achievement in the Netherlands, the United States, Italy, Cyprus, Scotland, and in the two Canadian provinces. \u2022 The fourth-grade trend results for the genders mirror the overall results, showing more countries with improvements than declines and consistency between girls and boys. Both boys and girls improved in six countries and Ontario province, while both declined only in Norway and Quebec province.\n\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, all participants emphasized understanding mathematical concepts and principles followed by mastering basic skills. At the fourth grade, mastering basic skills was emphasized most, followed by understanding concepts and principles. \u2022 In relation to the TIMSS assessment at the eighth grade, on average, participants reported that nearly all the number topics (96%) were included in their curricula, 78 percent of the measurement topics, 67 percent of the geometry topics, 63 percent of the algebra topics, and 39 percent of the data topics. \u2022 At the fourth grade, on average, 81 percent of the measurement topics assessed were included in the participants' curricula, 68 percent of the number topics, 62 percent of the data topics, 54 percent of the patterns and relationships topics, and 38 percent of the geometry topics. \u2022 At the eighth grade, across countries on average, teachers reported that 95 percent of the students had been taught the number topics, 78 percent the measurement topics, 69 percent the geometry topics, 66 percent the algebra topics, and 46 percent the data topics. \u2022 At the fourth grade, across countries on average, teachers reported that 86 percent of the students had been taught the measurement topics, 80 percent the data topics, 79 percent the patterns and relationships topics, 77 percent the number topics, and 55 percent the geometry topics.\n\u2022 Seventy percent of the eighth-grade students, on average, had mathematics teachers with a mathematics major and more than half (54%) with a major in mathematics education or both. At the fourth grade, teachers typically studied primary or elementary education (80% of the students with such teachers, on average). \u2022 At both grades, schools reported that their professional development programs emphasized improving content knowledge and teaching skills. More than 80 percent of students were taught mathematics by teachers having at least some professional development training in these areas. \u2022 Across the five mathematics content areas assessed, teachers reported being ready to teach nearly all the major topics tested by TIMSS. Almost all of the eighth-grade students were taught by such teachers -90 percent or more for 15 out of 18 topics (all but three data topics). Similarly, 90 percent or more of the fourth-grade students were taught by teachers reporting readiness for teaching 14 of the 16 topics (exceptions were two geometry topics).\nThese students had higher average achievement than did students whose teachers used only multiple-choice tests or a combination."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Mathematics Achievement", "text": "\u2022 At the eighth grade, several countries showed significantly higher average achievement in 2003 compared to the previous assessments in 1995 and 1999. Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Latvia (LSS), 1 Lithuania, and the United States, as well as the benchmarking Canadian province of Ontario, showed a pattern of improvement from assessment to assessment with significant change over the 8-year period from 1995 to 2003. Of the countries participating only in the 1999 and 2003 assessments, Israel and the Philippines showed significant improvement. \u2022 At the eighth grade, countries showing a decrease in average achievement in 2003 compared to previous assessments (1995, 1999, or both) included Japan, Belgium (Flemish), the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Bulgaria, Norway, Cyprus, Macedonia, Iran, and Tunisia as well as the benchmarking Canadian province of Quebec. \u2022 At the fourth grade, many countries showed significant gains in average achievement between 1995 and 2003, including Hong Kong SAR, Latvia (LSS), England, Cyprus, New Zealand, and Slovenia as well as the benchmarking province of Ontario.

There were large differences across countries in the percentages of students reaching the various benchmarks. At the eighth grade, students reaching the advanced benchmark used algebraic, geometric, and measurement concepts in complex EXECUTIVE SUMMARY problem situations. At the other end of the performance continuum, those reaching the low benchmark demonstrated some basic mathematical knowledge. \u2022 The highest performing countries -Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Korea and Hong Kong SAR -had about one-third of their students or more (from 31 to 44%) reaching the advanced benchmark followed by Japan with 24 percent. In contrast, all other countries had 11 percent or less of their students reaching the advanced benchmark, including 19 of the lowest-performing countries with 1 percent or less. \u2022 The nine highest-performing countries and the two Canadian provinces had 95 percent or more of their students reaching the low benchmark whereas the eight lowest-performing countries had less than half their students reaching the low benchmark. At the fourth grade, students reaching the advanced benchmark used understanding of fractions and decimals, measurement concepts, and data interpretation in a wide variety of relatively complex situations. Those reaching the low benchmark demonstrated some mathematical knowledge. \u2022 With fewer and more homogenous countries at the fourth grade, Singapore had 38 percent of its students reaching the advanced benchmark followed by 21 to 22 percent of the students in Hong Kong SAR and Japan. Five of the lowest-performing countries had 1 percent or less of their students reaching the advanced benchmark. \u2022 Eight countries as well as the US state of Indiana had 95 percent or more their students reaching the low benchmark and all except four countries had at least three-fourths of their students reaching this level.

Higher levels of parents' education were associated with higher student achievement in almost all countries. Also, students expecting to finish university had substantially greater average mathematics achievement than those without university expectations. \u2022 At both the eighth and fourth grades, in general, students from homes where the language of the test was always or almost always spoken had higher average achievement than those who spoke it less frequently. \u2022 At both the eighth and fourth grades, across countries on average, there was a clear-cut relationship between number of books in the home and mathematics achievement. \u2022 Mathematics achievement was positively related to computer usage, particularly at eighth grade, with average achievement highest among students reporting using computers at home and at school. Next highest was achievement among students using computers at home but not school, followed by students using computers at school but not home, and then those using computers at other places or not using them at all. At both grades, the percentages of students reporting that they did not use a computer at all varied dramatically across countries -from one percent or less to as many as two-thirds at the eighth grade and three-fourths at the fourth grade."}, {"section_title": "The Mathematics Curriculum", "text": "\u2022 Most countries had mathematics curricula defined at the national level (except Australia and the United States) and often supported by ministry directives, instructional guides, school inspections, and recommended textbooks."}, {"section_title": "Teachers of Mathematics", "text": "\u2022 Mathematics teachers reported considerable teaching experience. At both the eighth and fourth grades, on average, students were taught by teachers with 16 years of experience. \u2022 On average, 76 percent of the eighth-grade students and 65 percent of the fourth-grade students were taught by teachers with at least a university degree."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Instruction", "text": "\u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, teachers reported that 27 percent of the instructional time was devoted to algebra, 26 percent to geometry, 21 percent to number, 10 percent to each of measurement and data, and 6 percent to other. At fourth grade, the profile was different, with number receiving 38 percent of the instructional time. Patterns and relationships, measurement, and geometry each were given 13 to 16 percent, data 9 percent, and other 6 percent. \u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, teachers reported asking 62 percent of students to practice numerical operations and 43 percent to work on fractions and decimals in at least half their lessons. At the fourth grade, teachers reported an overwhelming emphasis on having stu-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY dents practice numerical operations (82% of students in half or more of the lessons). \u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, for 45 percent of students, teachers reported devoting some time in at least half their lessons to asking students to decide what procedures to use for solving complex problems. \u2022 At both eighth and fourth grades, the textbook was often the foundation of mathematics instruction. On average, about two-thirds of students at both grades had teachers who reported using a textbook as the primary basis for their lessons, and another third as a supplementary resource. \u2022 On average, the three most common instructional activities were teacher lecture, teacher-guided student practice, and students working on problems on their own (totaling 59% of the time at eighth grade and 61% at fourth grade). \u2022 Policies about calculator usage varied dramatically from country to country. At the eighth grade, in 10 countries nearly all the students (98% or more) were permitted to use calculators. In contrast, less than half were permitted to use calculators in seven countries. At fourth grade, on average, more than half the students were not permitted to use calculators. Only five countries reported permitting widespread calculator usage (at least 90% of students). \u2022 The percentages of eighth-grade students asked to use calculators in half their lessons averaged from 27 percent for checking answers to 14 percent for exploring number concepts. Relatively few fourthgrade students were asked to engage in any calculator activities in as many as half their lessons. \u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, 56 percent of students were taught by teachers who used only or mostly constructed-response tests."}, {"section_title": "School Contexts for Learning and Instruction", "text": "\u2022 At the eighth grade, average mathematics achievement was 57 points higher for students in schools with few students from economically disadvantaged homes than for students attending schools with more than half their students from disadvantaged homes. At fourth grade, the difference was 47 points. \u2022 At both eighth and fourth grades, there was a strong positive relationship between the principals' perception of school climate (based on seven questions about behaviors of teachers, parents, and students) and average mathematics achievement. Asked the same seven questions, teachers had a somewhat more gloomy view of school climate than principals, but the relationship with achievement still was positive. \u2022 Teachers were asked about the safety of their schools' neighborhoods, how safe they felt in their schools, and the sufficiency of security policies and practices. On average, 72 percent of eighth-grade students and 75 percent of fourth-grade students attended schools characterized as safe by their teachers. At both grades, there was a positive relationship between school safety and mathematics achievement. TIMSS 2003 is the most recent in a very ambitious series of international assessments conducted in nearly 50 countries to measure trends in mathematics and science learning. The aim of TIMSS, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, is to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics and science by providing data about students' achievement in relation to different types of curricula, instructional practices, and school environments. The variation across the nearly 50 participating countries provides a unique opportunity to study different approaches to educational practices and how these can improve achievement. TIMSS is a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of International Achievement (IEA), an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of cross-national achievement since 1959. Conducted first in 1995 and then in 1999, the regular four-year cycle of TIMSS studies provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to obtain comparative information about their students' achievement in mathematics and science. Even more important, TIMSS also collects a rich array of contextual information about how mathematics and science learning takes place in each country. TIMSS asks students, their teachers, and their school principals to complete questionnaires about the curriculum, INTRODUCTION schools, classrooms, and instruction. This data gives policy makers, curriculum specialists, and researchers a dynamic picture of implementation of educational policies and practices around the world, providing an invaluable perspective from which to consider educational reform and improvement. TIMSS results, which were first reported in 1996, have stirred debate and spurred reform efforts around the world. 1 TIMSS 1995 compared the mathematics and science achievement of students in 41 countries at five grade levels. TIMSS 1999 was designed to provide trends in eighth-grade mathematics and science achievement. Also, 1999 represented four years since the first TIMSS, and the population of students originally assessed as fourth-graders had advanced to the eighth grade. Thus, TIMSS 1999 also provided information about whether the relative performance of these students had changed in the intervening years. TIMSS 2003 was administered at the eighth and fourth grades. For countries that participated in previous assessments, TIMSS 2003 provides three-cycle trends at the eighth grade (1995,1999,2003) and data over two points in time at the fourth grade (1995 and 2003). In countries new to the study, the 2003 results can help policy makers and practitioners assess their comparative standing and gauge the rigor and effectiveness of the mathematics and science programs."}, {"section_title": "Who Conducts TIMSS?", "text": "TIMSS is a major undertaking of the IEA, and together with PIRLS, comprises the core of IEA's regular cycle of studies. 2 The IEA delegated responsibility for the overall direction and management of the project to the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College. Headed by Michael O. Martin and Ina V.S. Mullis, the study center is located in the Lynch School of Education. In carrying out the project, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center works closely with the IEA Secretariat in Amsterdam, the IEA Data Processing Center in Hamburg, Statistics Canada in Ottawa, and Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "To coordinate the TIMSS project nationally and to work with the international team, each participating country designates an individual to be the National Research Coordinator (NRC). The NRCs have the formidable task of implementing the TIMSS study in their countries in accordance with the TIMSS guidelines and procedures. The quality of the assessments depends on the work of the NRCs and their colleagues in carrying out the very complex sampling, data collection, and scoring tasks involved. Continuing the tradition of superlative work established in 1995 and 1999, the TIMSS 2003 NRCs performed their many tasks with great dedication, competence, and energy, and should be commended for their commitment to the project and the high quality of their work (see Appendix G for a list of the TIMSS 2003 NRCs).\nHaving valid and efficient samples in each country is crucial to the quality and integrity of the study. The accuracy of the survey results depends on the quality of the sampling information available, and particularly on the quality of the samples. TIMSS developed procedures and guidelines to ensure that the national samples were of the highest quality possible. Standards were established and well-documented for coverage of the target population and participation rates. For the most part, the national samples were drawn in accordance with the TIMSS standards, and achievement results can be compared with confidence. Countries that deviated from the guidelines are specially noted in this report.\nAbout one-third of the eighth-grade questions were in the constructed-response format, requiring students to generate and write their answers. These questions, some of which required extended responses, were allotted about 40% of the testing time. At the fourth grade, more than two-fifths of the items were in constructed response format, accounting for almost half of the testing time. Chapter 2 of this report contains example items illustrating the range of mathematics concepts and processes covered in the TIMSS 2003 tests. Appendix A contains more information about test development for TIMSS 2003. To guide questionnaire development, the TIMSS frameworks document also describes the contextual factors associated with students' learning in mathematics and science. A special effort was made for TIMSS 2003 to reduce burden for students, teachers, and schools and to address emerging policy concerns. In particular, TIMSS worked to examine curricular goals; the educational resources and facilities provided; the teaching force and how it is educated, equipped, and supported; classroom activities and characteristics; home support and involvement; and the experiences and attitudes that students themselves bring to the educational enterprise.\n"}, {"section_title": "Which Countries Participated in TIMSS 2003?", "text": "Exhibit 1 shows the 49 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003. The decision to participate in any IEA study is coordinated through the IEA secretariat in Amsterdam and made solely by each member country according to its own data needs and resources. Exhibit 1 shows that 23 countries also participated in TIMSS 1995 and TIMSS 1999. For these participants, trend data across three-points in time are included in this report. Eleven countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1999 only, while three countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1995. These countries have trend data for two points in time. TIMSS 2003 is proud to welcome 12 new participating countries to the study. TIMSS 2003 is equally proud of its fledgling benchmarking program, whereby regions or localities of countries can participate in the study to compare to international standards. TIMSS 2003 included four benchmarking participants (one US state, two Canadian provinces, and Spain's Basque Country) in addition to its 49 countries. At the eighth grade, results are presented for 46 countries and four benchmarking participants. At the fourth grade, results are presented for 25 countries and three benchmarking participants. Argentina was unable to complete the steps necessary to have its data available For the sake of comparability across countries and across assessments, all testing was conducted at the end of the school year, except in Korea. As noted in the Exhibits in this report, Korea tested the same cohort of students as other countries, but later in 2003 at the beginning of the next school year. The seven countries on a Southern Hemisphere school schedule (Australia, Botswana, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa) tested in October through December of 2002, which was the end of the school year there. The remaining countries tested towards the end of the 2002-2003 school year, most often in April, May, or June of 2003."}, {"section_title": "What Is the Comparability Across the Grades and Ages Tested?", "text": "Exhibit 2 contains information about the grade(s) tested in each country. Because TIMSS studies the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction on student learning, it is designed to assess mathematics and science achievement at the same point in schooling across countries. More specifically, TIMSS tries to assess students at two points -at the end of four years of formal schooling and at the end of eight years of formal schooling. Exhibit 2 reveals that, with few exceptions, the grade(s) tested in each country represented the eighth year of formal schooling and the fourth year of formal schooling. Thus, solely for convenience, the report usually refers to the grade tested as the eighth or the fourth grade, respectively. As can be seen from the first two columns in Exhibit 2, countries have different policies and practices about the age of entry to primary school. This information is extremely valuable and important in considering the achievement results, since differences in these policies can affect achievement through the grades. Everything else being equal, INTRODUCTION students who start their formal schooling at a younger age will be younger than their counterparts at the grades assessed and those who start their schooling at an older age will be older. Again, everything else being equal, students who are older may be considered more mature. In many countries, students must be 6 years old to start school and they do start school at that age. In several countries, students must be six, but they do not need to start school at that age and can wait. In this case, students or their parents may wait, most often for economic reasons, so that the older students may come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Also, in a number of countries children must be 7 years old. On the other hand, in several countries some or all of the students are younger than six when they start school, including Australia, Cyprus, England, Jordan, Scotland, and Tunisia. Besides the age of entry, policies on promotion and retention also can affect how old students are when they reach a particular grade. If students have been retained, they will be older when they are assessed. Most often, it is the lower achievers who are retained and consequently the older students have lower achievement. Consistent with most educational endeavors, the interaction between grade and age in school is complicated. As can be seen from Exhibit 2, the variation in policies and practices across the countries assessed resulted in a considerable range in the average age of the students assessed. At the eighth grade, for example, Scotland with an additional year of schooling because they start school at such a comparatively early age (4.5 to 5.5 years old), had the youngest students assessed -13.7 years old on average. At the other end of the spectrum, students in Ghana start school closer to age 7 and may be retained because of attendance problems; as a result they were the oldest students assessed at 15.5 years old. Despite this wide range, however, eighth-grade students in most countries were between 14 and 15 years old. Similarly, fourth-grade students averaged between 10 and 11 years old, even though those in Scotland were 9.7 years old and those in Latvia had an average age of 11.1. If students fail any subjects they are promoted with negative marks for those subjects, students with more than 5 negative marks are retained Grade VIII 14.9"}, {"section_title": "Morocco", "text": "Children must be 7 years old 7 Automatic except for students in grade 6 who must pass provincial exams 2\u00b0 secondary 15.2\nChildren must be 7 years old 7 Automatic 4\u00b0 primary 11.0"}, {"section_title": "Netherlands", "text": "Children must be 6 years old 6 Essentially automatic, but students can be retained if have serious learning difficulties or fall behind because of illness Grade 8 14.3\nChildren must be 6 years old 6 Essentially automatic, but students can be retained if have serious learning difficulties or fall behind because of illness Grade 4 10.2"}, {"section_title": "New Zealand", "text": "Children must attend primary school from their 6th birthday, but have the right to be enrolled from age 5 Almost all start on or near 5th birthday Automatic Year 9 8.5 -9.5 14.1\nChildren must attend primary school from their 6th birthday, but have the right to be enrolled from age 5 Almost all start on or near 5th birthday Automatic Year 5 4.5 -5.5 10.0"}, {"section_title": "Norway", "text": "Children begin school the year they become 7 years old 7 Automatic Grade 8 (these students started in Grade 2) 13.8 Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM units,\" and \"instruments to measure length, area, mass/weight, angle, and time.\" Less often included in participants' intended curricula were \"calculating areas and perimeters of squares\" and \"estimating length, area, volume, weight, and time.\" Regardless of whether they were in the intended curriculum or not, the measurement topics were widely taught, with no fewer than 80 percent of students being taught each one. Although there are 11 geometry topics in the TIMSS fourthgrade mathematics assessment, their inclusion in participants' curricula varies widely, as does the percentage of students taught each of the topics. Exhibit 5.16 shows that only one geometry topic -\"angles greater than, equal to, or less than a right angle\" -was included in the intended curriculum of more than half the participants, and that three topics -\"congruent triangles,\" \"similar triangles,\" and \"translation, reflection, and rotation\" -were included by very few participants indeed. The percentage of students taught the geometry topics also was generally lower than in areas such as number or measurement. Percentages ranged from 74 percent for the aforementioned angles topic to just 33 percent for \"translation, reflection, and rotation.\" For many countries, geometry topics not included in the fourth-grade curriculum were intended for later grades. As shown in Exhibit 5.17, three of the seven TIMSS data topics were included in the intended fourth-grade mathematics curriculum of more than half the participating entities. Furthermore, these three topics, \"organizing a set of data by one characteristic,\" \"reading data directly from tables, pictographs, and bar graphs,\" and \"display data using tables, pictographs, and bar graphs,\" were each taught to more than 85 percent of students. \"Comparing and matching different representations of the same data\" was in the curriculum of the fewest participants (11), yet was taught to 65 percent of students, on average.

Exhibit 7.11 shows the number of countries with national policies on calculator use, the percentages of students not permitted to use calculators in mathematics class, and the percentages of students using calculators for various activities in about half of the lessons or more. At the eighth grade, 29 countries and all four benchmarking participants reported that their official curriculum contained statements about using calculators. According to their teachers, the percentages of students not permitted to use calculators varied dramatically from country to country. More than half the eighth-grade students were not permitted to use calculators in Bahrain, Cyprus, Ghana, Iran, Jordan, Romania, and Saudi Arabia. The countries permitting calculator use for essentially all eighth-grade students (98% or more) included Egypt, Hong Kong SAR, Lithuania, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, the Palestinian National Authority, Scotland, Sweden, and England. The percentages of eighth-grade students asked to use calculators in at least half of their lessons for each of four different activities reveal that, on average, internationally, teachers asked the most students to use calculators for checking answers (27%), performing routine computations (29%), and solving complex problems (31%). Only 14 percent, on average, were asked to explore number concepts. At the fourth grade, 14 participants reported that their national or regional mathematics curriculum contained statements about using calculators. Compared to eighth grade, teachers in the TIMSS countries reported that greater percentages of fourth-grade students were not permitted to use calculators -57 percent, on average. The countries permitting widespread calculator usage (90% of the students or more) at the fourth grade included Australia, Cyprus, England, New Zealand, and Scotland. However, even in those countries, teachers reported asking relatively small percentages of students to do any calculator activities in half the lessons or more.\nGrade 8  A dash (-) indicates comparable data are not available.\nGrade 8 \nGrade 8 \"An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students.

Topic areas are elaborated with objectives specific to the eighth and fourth grades. In general, the mathematics topic areas are number, algebra, measurement, geometry, and data. Developing the TIMSS tests for 2003 was a cooperative venture involving all of the NRCs during the entire process. The TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center began the process with an item-writing workshop for NRCs and their colleagues. Through a series of efforts, countries then submitted items that were reviewed by mathematics subject-matter specialists. Participating countries field-tested the items with representative samples of students, and all of the potential new items were reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee. The NRCs had several opportunities to review the items and scoring criteria. The resulting TIMSS 2003 mathematics tests contained 194 items at the eighth grade and 161 items at the fourth grade."}, {"section_title": "How Do Country Characteristics Differ?", "text": "International studies of student achievement provide valuable comparative information about student performance, instructional practice, and curriculum. It is important, however, to consider the results in light of country-wide demographic and economic factors. Some selected demographic characteristics of the TIMSS 2003 countries are presented in Exhibit 3. As can be seen, countries range widely in population size and in geographic area. Countries also vary widely on indicators of health, such as life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate. The economic indicators, such as gross national income per capita, reveal there is great disparity in the economic resources available to countries. Finally, there are differences in enrollment rates and pupilteacher ratios. For the enrollment rates, figures only were available INTRODUCTION for primary and secondary school and not specifically for fourth and eighth grades. For the fourth grade, it can be seen that the countries generally had 90 percent or more of their children enrolled in primary school. The figures pertinent to the eighth grade in particular were not available, but they most certainly would be higher than those provided for the secondary school.

Given the matrix-sampling approach, scaling averages students' responses in a way that accounts for differences in the difficulty of different subsets of items. It allows students' performances to be summarized on a common metric even though individual students responded to different items in the mathematics test. For more detailed information, see the \"IRT Scaling and Data Analysis\" section of Appendix A. 2 Argentina was unable to complete the necessary steps on schedule for their data to appear in this report.

The international average of 467 at the eighth grade was obtained by averaging across the mean scores for each of the 46 participating countries. The mean scores for the four benchmarking participants were not included in calculating the average. 3 At the fourth grade, the international average of 495 was obtained by averaging across the mean scores for the 25 participating countries. It should be noted that the results for the eighth and fourth grades are not directly comparable. While the scales for the two grades are expressed in the same numerical units, they are not directly comparable in terms of being able to say how much achievement or learning at one grade equals how much achievement or learning at the other grade. Comparisons only can be made in terms of relative performance. 4 At the eighth grade, with such a large number of participating countries, it is not surprising that the results reveal substantial differences in mathematics achievement between the highest-and lowestperforming countries, from an average of 605 for Singapore to 264 for South Africa. Twenty-six countries (including England) and the four benchmarking participants achieved average mathematics scores that were significantly above the international average and18 countries scored below the international average. Romania and Moldova performed about the same as the international average. At the fourth grade, the range in achievement was from 594 in Singapore to 339 in Tunisia. Fourteen countries and the three benchmarking participants performed above the international average. Moldova, Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland performed at about the international average. Seven countries achieved below the international average. For both the eighth and fourth grades, Exhibit 1.1 illustrates the broad range of achievement both within and across the countries assessed. It shows a graphical representation of the distribution of student performance within each country. Achievement for each country is shown for the 25th and 75th percentiles as well as for the 5th and 95th percentiles. 5 Each percentile point indicates the percentage of students performing CHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS below and above that point on the scale. For example, 25 percent of the eighth-grade students in each country performed below the 25th percentile for that country, and 75 percent performed above the 25th percentile. The range between the 25th and 75th percentiles represents performance by the middle half of the students. In most countries, the range of performance for the middle group was between 100 and 130 scale-score points. In contrast, performance at the 5th and 95th percentiles represents the extremes in both lower and higher achievement. The range of performance between these two score points, which includes 90 percent of the population, is approximately 270 to 300 points in most countries. The dark boxes at the midpoints of the distributions show the 95 percent confidence intervals around the average achievement in each country. 6 As well as showing the wide spread of student achievement within each country, the percentiles also provide a perspective on the size of the differences among countries. Even though performance generally differed very little between one country and the next higher-or lower-performing country, the range in performance across the participating countries was very large at both grades. For example, Singaporean students had the highest average achievement at both grades, with their average eighth-grade performance exceeding performance at the 95th percentile in the lower-performing countries such as Botswana, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, and South Africa. Similarly, at the fourth grade, average performance in Singapore exceeded performance at the 95th percentile in Iran, the Philippines, Morocco, and Tunisia. This means that only the most proficient students in the lower-performing countries approached the level of achievement of Singaporean students of average proficiency. To aid in interpretation, Exhibit 1.1 also includes the years of formal schooling and average age of the students in each country. Equivalence of chronological age does not necessarily mean that students have received the same number of years of formal schooling or studied the same curriculum. For example, as described in the introduction, 14  countries have different policies about the age at which students begin formal schooling and different policies about promotion and retention from grade to grade.\nAt both the eighth and fourth grades, Singapore was the topperforming country having significantly higher mean achievement than the rest of the participating countries. At the eighth grade, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong SAR, and Chinese Taipei had significantly higher mean achievement than all of the other participating countries except Singapore. Japan also performed very well, with significantly higher achievement than most other participating countries, as did Belgium (Flemish), the Netherlands, Estonia, and Hungary. At the fourth grade, in addition to Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Chinese Taipei had significantly higher average achievement than most of the other participating countries as did Belgium (Flemish)."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Mathematics Achievement", "text": "At the eighth grade, the aim was that the students assessed would have had eight years of formal schooling. Most notably, students in Norway, most of Slovenia, and parts of the Russian Federation had fewer years of formal schooling than their counterparts in other countries, while those in England, Scotland, New Zealand, and parts of Australia had more years of schooling. Even though the students assessed at the eighth grade typically averaged between 14 and 15 years old, the variety of countries assessed and their situations also resulted in a considerable range in the average age of the students assessed. To illustrate how education policies can affect the interaction between age and number of years of schooling, it is interesting to note that Scotland, one of the few countries with an additional year of schooling, starts formal schooling at an early age and had the youngest students assessed-13.7 years old on average. Other countries assessing students younger than 14 years old included Slovenia, Norway, and Cyprus with 13.8 and Australia, Jordan, and Italy with 13.9. Students in the Balkans and some Eastern European countries start school later and tended to be older, particularly in Estonia with an average of 15.2. Students also were older in several African countries including Botswana and South Africa both averaging 15.1, Morocco averaging 15.2, and Ghana averaging 15.5. In these countries, it is not unusual for students to start school at an older age and also perhaps to find it necessary to interrupt their schooling. At the fourth grade, the aim was to assess students having had four years of formal schooling and this was the case for the most part. However, some students in Slovenia and parts of the Russian Federation had only three years of formal schooling, and students in England and Scotland as well as some in Australia and New Zealand had five years. In terms of chronological age, students in most countries averaged between 10 and 11 years old. Consistent with the patterns at the eighth grade, students were somewhat younger in Scotland, averaging 9.7 years old; Italy, CHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS Slovenia, and Norway, averaging 9.8; and Australia and Cyprus, averaging 9.9. The students in the Balkan and Eastern European countries were somewhat older, especially in Latvia with an average age of 11.1. As a reminder that not all countries are equally well equipped to meet the challenge of educating their young people, Exhibit 1.1 includes the value for each country on the Human Development Index provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 7 The index has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 1.0. Countries with high values on the index enjoy long life expectancy, high levels of school enrollment and adult literacy, and a good standard of living as measured by per capita GDP. For example, TIMSS countries with index values greater than 0.9 included Australia, Belgium (Flemish), England, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and the United States. All except Norway have average eighth-grade mathematics achievement above the international average. However, not all countries above the international average had an index value as high as this. Exhibit 1.2 shows how a country's average achievement in mathematics compares to achievement in the other countries. This figure shows whether or not the differences in average achievement between pairs of countries are statistically significant. Selecting a country of interest and reading across the table, a circle with a triangle pointing up indicates significantly higher performance than the comparison country listed across the top; absence of a symbol indicates no significant difference in performances; and a circle with triangle pointing down indicates significantly lower performance. The data in Exhibit 1.2 reinforce the point that, when ordered by average achievement, adjacent countries usually did not significantly differ from each other, although the differences in achievement between the highperforming and low-performing countries were very large. Because of this wide range in performance, the pattern for a number of countries was one of having lower mean achievement than some countries, about the same mean achievement as other countries, and higher mean achievement than a third group of countries.

At the eighth grade, 35 countries and three of the benchmarking participants have data from one or both of the previous TIMSS assessments conducted in 1995 and 1999. Well over half of the countries and two of the benchmarking entities, the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, have participated in all three assessments. Of these, 18 countries as well as Ontario and Quebec have trends in mathematics achievement for their eighth-grade students across three points in time-1995, 1999, and 2003. For several three-time participants, not all the results are presented because they were not strictly comparable. For example, changes in policy about age of school entry complicated trend data collection in Australia and Slovenia so their 1999 data are not shown. Also, the 1995 data are not shown for Israel, Italy, and South Africa since the characteristics of their samples were not completely known in that first assessment. Twelve countries and the US state of Indiana can monitor changes in performance between 1999 and 2003, and five countries between 1995 and 2003, including Australia, Sweden, Scotland, Slovenia, and Norway. At the fourth grade, 15 of the TIMSS 2003 Trends in Mathematics Achievement (\u2026Continued) \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9). Trend notes: Because of differences in population coverage, 1999 data are not shown for Australia and Slovenia, and 1995 data are not shown for Israel, Italy, and South Africa. Korea tested later in 2003 than in 1999 and 1995, at the beginning of the next school year. Similarly, Lithuania tested later in 1999 than in 2003 and 1995. Data for Latvia in this exhibit include Latvian-speaking schools only. ( ) Standard errors appear in parentheses. Because results are rounded to the nearest whole number, some totals may appear inconsistent. countries and Ontario and Quebec also participated in TIMSS 1995. Since TIMSS was not conducted at the fourth grade in 1999, these participants can track changes in student achievement over an eight-year period, between 1995 and 2003. For the countries participating in assessments prior to TIMSS 2003, Exhibit 1.3 compares average achievement between the years. 8 Countries are presented in descending order according to their average TIMSS 2003 achievements. At the eighth grade, a number of countries had significantly higher achievement in TIMSS 2003 than in previous assessments. Most notably, Korea, Hong Kong SAR, the US, Latvia (LSS), Lithuania, and Ontario have shown a pattern of improvement with significant change over the 8-year period. For Lithuania, the increase between 1995 and 1999 also was significant. Israel and the Philippines showed significant improvement from 1999 to 2003. Countries showing a decrease at the eighth grade in TIMSS 2003, from 1995, 1999, or both, included Japan, Belgium (Flemish), the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Bulgaria, Norway, Cyprus, Macedonia, Iran, Tunisia, and Quebec. At the fourth grade, many countries had significant increases in average achievement between 1995 and 2003. Participants showing improved performance included Hong Kong SAR, Latvia (LSS), England, Cyprus, New Zealand, Slovenia, and Ontario. Several participants showed significant declines, including the Netherlands, Norway, and Quebec. A number of countries showed remarkable changes in mathematics achievement over the eight-year period covered by the TIMSS assessments, some of which may be the result of societal or educational changes during this time. For example, the political changes in Eastern Europe more than a decade ago spawned far-reaching educational reform initiatives that have changed the face of education in many countries in the region. The achievement growth in Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the strong performance of Estonia in its first TIMSS appearance, may reflect the efforts at improvement in those countries. In contrast, countries in the region where reform efforts seem to have been less successful include Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic, each of which show large decreases over the period. What Are the Gender Differences in Mathematics Achievement? Exhibit 1.4 shows gender differences in eighth-and fourth-grade mathematics achievement in 2003. It presents average achievement separately for girls and boys for each of the TIMSS 2003 countries, as well as the difference between the means. Countries are shown in increasing order of this gender difference. The gender difference for each country is shown by a bar indicating the amount of the difference, whether the direction of the difference favored girls or boys, and whether the difference is statistically significant (indicated by a darkened bar). On average, across all countries, there was essentially no difference in achievement between boys and girls at either the eighth or fourth grade, although the situation varied from country to country. In many countries the results paralleled the international pattern and the gender difference was negligible. However, at the eighth grade, countries where girls had significantly higher achievement included Serbia, Macedonia, Armenia, Moldova, Singapore, the Philippines, Cyprus, Jordan, and Bahrain. Participants where boys had significantly higher achievement included the United States, Italy, Hungary, Lebanon, Belgium (Flemish), Morocco, Chile, Ghana, Tunisia, US state of Indiana and Quebec province. At the fourth grade, girls had significantly higher average achievement in Singapore, Moldova, the Philippines, and Armenia. Boys had higher average achievement in the Netherlands, the United States, Italy, Cyprus, Scotland, and in the two Canadian provinces. Achievement differences between TIMSS 2003 and 1995 and 1999 are presented separately for girls and for boys in Exhibit 1.5. At the eighth grade, both boys and girls had significantly higher achievement in 2003 in Israel, Lithuania, the Philippines, the United States, and Ontario. Girls showed improved performance compared to previous \ufffd \u2020 Met guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included (see Exhibit A.9). \u2021 Nearly satisfied guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included (see Exhibit A.9). \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9)."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "National Desired Population does not cover all of International Desired Population (see Exhibit A.6). The TIMSS mathematics achievement scale summarizes student performance on test items designed to measure a wide range of student knowledge and proficiency. In order to provide meaningful descriptions of what performance on the scale could mean in terms of the mathematics that students know and can do, TIMSS identified four points on the scale for use as international benchmarks. Selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally, the advanced benchmark is 625, the high benchmark is 550, the intermediate benchmark is 475, and the low benchmark is 400. TIMSS worked with the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee to conduct an ambitious scale-anchoring exercise to describe performance at these benchmarks. Exhibit 2.1 summarizes what eighth-and fourth-grade students scoring at these benchmarks typically know and can do. At the eighth grade, performance ranged from using relatively complex algebraic and geometric concepts and relationships at the advanced CHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS benchmark to having some basic mathematical knowledge at the low benchmark. At the fourth grade, students at the advanced benchmark showed the ability to solve a variety of problems whereas those at the low benchmark demonstrated an understanding of whole numbers, the properties of basic geometric shapes, and how to read simple bar graphs. More detailed descriptions appear in the remaining sections of the chapter, together with example test items illustrating performance at each benchmark. Exhibit 2.2 displays the percentage of students in each participating country that reached each international benchmark. Both the eighth-and fourth-grade results are presented in decreasing order by percentage reaching the advanced benchmark. In general, the highperforming countries had greater percentages of students reaching each benchmark, and the low-performing countries had lesser percentages. Among the high performers at the eighth grade, for example, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Korea, and Hong Kong SAR had about one-third or more of their students reaching the advanced benchmark, about two-thirds to three-fourths reaching the high benchmark, around 90 percent reaching the intermediate benchmark, and almost all (96 to 99 percent) reaching the low benchmark. In contrast, low-performing countries had almost no students reaching the advanced benchmark, from 0 to 4 percent reaching the high benchmark, less than 20 percent reaching the intermediate benchmark, and about half or fewer reaching the low benchmark. At the fourth grade, 38 percent of the Singaporean students performed at or above the advanced benchmark, followed by about one-fifth of the students from Hong Kong, SAR and Japan. In all three of these top-performing countries, nearly all fourthgrade students, from 97 to 99 percent, reached the low benchmark. For the lowest-performing countries, Tunisia and Morocco, very few, if any, fourth-grade students reached the advanced benchmark, about 1 percent reached the high benchmark, 8 to 9 percent the intermediate benchmark, and 28 to 29 percent the low benchmark. CHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS Although Exhibit 2.2 is organized to draw particular attention to the percentage of high-achieving students in each country, it conveys information about the distribution of middle and low performers also. For example, even though the Netherlands does not have the highest percentages at the advanced benchmark (10 percent at eighth grade and 5 percent at fourth grade), it appears to do an excellent job of educating all of its students, since 97 percent of the eighth-grade students and 99 percent of the fourth-grade students reached the low benchmarks at their respective grades. It should be noted that at the eighth grade, a number of countries, as well as three of the benchmarking participants, have less than 6 percent of their eighth-grade students reaching the advanced benchmark but have 90 percent or more reaching the low benchmark. Exhibits 2.3 and 2.4, for the eighth and fourth grades, respectively, provide information on the changes in student performance between the previous assessments and TIMSS 2003. The exhibits show the percentage of students reaching each international benchmark (advanced-625, high-550, intermediate-475, and low-400) in each of the years. In general, the patterns in overall achievement are reflected in the benchmarks. For example, at the eighth grade the decrease in performance in the Slovak Republic or in Bulgaria is also apparent at all four benchmarks, implying a decrease (at most levels) of the proficiency distribution. In Japan, however, the decrease is reflected at the three top benchmarks but not at the low benchmark. In contrast, the increase for Korea appears mainly at the two middle benchmarks, and for the Philippines at the two lower benchmarks. At the fourth grade, the general improvements between 1995 and 2003 also are reflected generally at the benchmarks. However, the pattern across the countries indicates more improvement at the lower parts of the distributions than at the advanced benchmark.\nNational Desired Population does not cover all of International Desired Population (see Exhibit A.6).\nNational Desired Population does not cover all of International Desired Population (see Exhibit A.6).

It then describes fourth-grade achievement at each of the international benchmarks together with examples of the types of items typically answered correctly by students performing at the benchmark. At both the eighth and fourth grades, the analysis of performance at these benchmarks in mathematics suggests that three primary factors appeared to differentiate performance among the four levels: \u2022 The mathematical operation required; \u2022 The complexity of the numbers or number system; \u2022 The nature of the problem situation. For example, there is evidence that students performing at the lower end of the scale could add, subtract, and multiply whole numbers. In contrast, students performing at the higher end of the scale solved non-routine problems involving relationships among fractions, decimals, and percents; various geometric properties; and algebraic rules.\nFor the scale-anchoring analysis, the results of students from all the TIMSS 2003 countries were pooled, so that the benchmark descriptions refer to all students achieving at that level. (That is, it does not matter which country the students are from, only how they performed on the test.) Criteria were applied to the TIMSS 2003 achievement scale results at the eighth grade to identify the sets of items that eighth-grade students reaching each international benchmark were likely to answer correctly and that those at the next lower benchmark were unlikely to answer correctly. 1 Similarly, criteria were applied to the TIMSS 2003 achievement scale results at the fourth grade to identify the sets of items that fourth-grade students reaching each international benchmark were likely to answer correctly and that those at the next lower benchmark were unlikely to answer correctly. The sets of items produced by the analysis represented the accomplishments of students reaching each successively higher benchmark, and were used by a panel of subject-matter experts from the TIMSS countries to develop the benchmark descriptions. 2 The work of the panel involved developing a short description for each item of the mathematical understandings demonstrated by students answering it correctly, summarizing students' knowledge and understanding across the set of items for each benchmark to provide more general statements of achievement, and selecting example items illustrating the descriptions.\nNot surprisingly, this was true for items assessing a range of cognitive skills -recall, ability to carry out routine procedures, and ability to solve routine and non-routine problems. The TIMSS 2003 results support the premise that successful problem solving is grounded in mastery of more fundamental knowledge and skills."}, {"section_title": "How Were the Benchmark Descriptions Developed?", "text": "To develop descriptions of achievement at the TIMSS 2003 international benchmarks, the TIMSS International Study Center used the scaleanchoring method. Scale anchoring is a way of describing students' performance at different points on the TIMSS 2003 achievement scales at eighth and fourth grades in terms of the types of items students at those grades, respectively, answered correctly. It involves an empirical component in which items that discriminate between successive points on the scale are identified, and a judgmental component in which subject matter experts examine the content of the items and generalize to students' knowledge and understandings."}, {"section_title": "How Should the Descriptions Be Interpreted?", "text": "In general, the parts of the descriptions that relate to the mathematical concepts or familiarity with procedures are relatively straightforward. It needs to be acknowledged, however, that the cognitive behavior necessary to answer some items correctly may vary according to students' experience. An item may require only simple recall for a student familiar with the item's content and context, but necessitate problem-solving strategies from a student unfamiliar with the material. Nevertheless, the descriptions are based on what the panel believed to be the way the CHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS great majority of eighth-or fourth-grade students could be expected to perform when responding to the item. It also needs to be emphasized that the descriptions of achievement characteristic of students at the international benchmarks are based solely on student performance on the TIMSS 2003 items. Since those items were developed in particular to sample the mathematics domains prescribed for this study, neither the set of items nor the descriptions based on them purport to be comprehensive. There are undoubtedly other mathematics curriculum elements on which students at the various benchmarks would have been successful if they had been included in the assessment. Please note that at both grades, students reaching a particular benchmark demonstrated the knowledge and understandings characterizing that benchmark as well as the competencies of students at the lower benchmarks. The description of achievement at each higher benchmark is cumulative, building on the description of achievement demonstrated by students at the next lower benchmark. Finally, it must be emphasized that the descriptions of the international benchmarks are provided as one possible way of beginning to examine student performance. Some students scoring below a benchmark may indeed know or understand some of the concepts that characterize a higher level. Thus, it is important to consider performance on the individual items and clusters of items in developing a profile of student achievement in each country. Several example items are included for each benchmark to complement the descriptions by giving a more concrete notion of the abilities students were able to demonstrate. Each example item is accompanied by the percentage of correct responses for each country as well as the international average. In general, at each grade, the five or six countries scoring highest on the overall test also scored highest on each of the items used to illustrate benchmarks. Likewise, the five or six countries with the lowest mean achievement also tended to have consistently low percentages of correct responses on the illustrative items."}, {"section_title": "Item Examples and Student Performance", "text": "Beginning with the eighth grade and then for the fourth grade, the remainder of this chapter describes each benchmark and presents two example items illustrating what students know and can do at that level.

To examine the emphasis placed on that goal, TIMSS asked eighth-grade students and teachers about how often students were asked to do the following three activities -relate what was being learned in mathematics to their daily lives, explain their answers, and decide procedures for solving complex problems. Exhibits 7.7 and 7.8 present students' and teachers' reports, respectively. In most of the countries, students reported a moderate emphasis on doing these types of problems in mathematics class. About two-thirds (67 percent), on average, internationally, said they were asked to explain answers in at least half their lessons, and more than half (53%) reported deciding problem-solving procedures this frequently. Students reported the least attention to relating mathematics to their daily lives (44%). On average, internationally, teachers reported more emphasis on explanations than did the students. They reported asking about three-fourths of the students (78%) to explain answers in at least half the lessons. Perhaps as a matter for some concern, the teachers reported somewhat less emphasis on problem-solving procedures (45%) than did the students. Teachers reported half the students were asked to relate mathematics to their daily lives in at least half the lessons. ( ) Standard errors appear in parentheses.

The amount of time students spend on homework assignments is an important consideration in examining their opportunity to learn mathematics. Exhibit 7.13 presents the index of teachers' emphasis on mathematics homework. Students in the high category had teachers who reported giving relatively long homework assignments (more than 30 minutes) on a relatively frequent basis (in about half the lessons or more). Those in the low category had teachers who gave short assignments (less than 30 minutes) relatively infrequently (in about half the lessons or less). The medium level includes all other possible combinations of responses. The results show substantial variation across countries in the emphasis placed on homework. At the eighth grade, more than 70 percent of the students in Romania and Italy were in the high category. For the majority of countries, most students were in the medium category. More than half the students were in the low category in Sweden, Belgium (Flemish), Korea, Japan, and Scotland. It can be noted, however, that students in Japan and perhaps Korea may be more likely to spend extra time in tutoring and special schools than doing homework. 1 At the eighth grade, there was a slight, but noticeable positive relationship between teachers assigning more homework and students having higher mathematics achievement. At the fourth grade, teachers reported giving homework much less frequently than at eighth grade. On average, internationally, only 14 percent of the fourth-grade students were in the high category. About half (49%) were in the medium category and 37 percent were in the low category. The fourth-grade students in the high category had the lowest mathematics achievement, on average, suggesting that homework often was being used for remedial purposes. Exhibit 7.14 presents eighth-grade teachers' reports about how they usually use homework in their mathematics instruction. Internationally, the eighth-grade mathematics teachers reported always or CHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS almost always monitoring whether homework was completed (for 78 percent of the students, on average). For more than half the eighthgrade students, on average, teachers reported always or almost always correcting assignments and giving feedback to students, but for about one-third, on average, the students corrected their own homework in class. About one-fourth of the students, on average, had teachers that reported using homework as basis for class discussion (27%) and to contribute toward grades or marks (25%). As shown in Exhibit 7.15, eighth-grade teachers reported substantial variation across countries in the frequency of testing in mathematics class. On average, internationally, nearly half the students (47%) reported having a mathematics test or examination every two weeks or more and another 40 percent reported such testing about once a month. Testing every two weeks or more for most students (80% or more) was reported by eighth-grade teachers in Bahrain, Belgium (Flemish), Chinese Taipei, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, and the Canadian province of Quebec. Even though the international average was low (14%) for infrequent testing, there were countries where teachers reported testing only a few time a year or more for half or more of the eighthgrade students, including Scotland, Slovenia, Sweden, and England. Exhibit 7.16 presents eighth-grade teachers' reports about the types of test formats they use for mathematics tests in relation to average mathematics achievement. On average, internationally, more than half the eighth-grade students (56%) had teachers who used only or mostly constructed-response tests or examinations. These students had higher mathematics achievement, on average, than did students whose teachers used some constructed-response and multiple-choice items or only multiple-choice items. However, very few students (12%, on average) had teachers who reported using only or mostly multiplechoice testing. \n\n\nAn \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students. An \"s\" indicates data are available for at least 50 but less than 70% of the students. Some school resources are specific to mathematics, but many are general resources that improve learning opportunities across the curriculum. All the available resources, however, can work together to support mathematics learning and instruction. To measure the extent of school resources in each of the participating countries, TIMSS created an index of availability of school resources for mathematics instruction. As described in Exhibit 8.3, the index is based on schools' average response to five questions about shortages that affect general capacity to provide instruction and five questions about shortages that affect mathematics instruction in particular. Students were placed in the high category if principals reported that shortages, both general and for mathematics in particular, had no or little effect on instructional capacity. The medium level indicates that one type of shortage affects instruction some or a lot, and the low level that both shortages affect it some or a lot. Since TIMSS results in 1995 and 1999 showed that students in schools that reported being generally unaffected by a lack of resources had higher average mathematics achievement than those in schools where across-the-board shortages affected instructional capacity some or a lot, TIMSS 2003 reported information on trends in school resources. Exhibit 8.3 shows changes in the percentages of eighth-grade students in the high, medium, and low categories for 1995, 1999, and 2003, and for the fourth-grade students for 1995 to 2003. At the eighth grade, the trend suggests similarity between 1995 and 2003 with a dip in available resources in 1999. Consistent with this overall pattern across countries, the results at the eighth grade show 14 countries having significantly more students in the high category in 2003 than in 1999. At the fourth grade, the results for the participating countries were even more positive. Nine of the countries showed significant increases in the high category and none showed a decrease.

More specifically, they were asked to generalize from the first of several terms of a sequence growing in two dimensions to find a specified term. The problem was presented in three parts, A, B, and C. For parts A and B, students were given a geometric pattern and then asked to indicate how many triangles would be in the 3 rd , 4 th , and 7 th figures, respectively, if the pattern were extended. In part C, students were asked to explain a way to find the number of triangles in the 50 th figure that did not involve drawing or counting it. The achievement results are shown for part C.

Given verbal descriptions of data or problem situations, they can use that information to complete bar graphs and a two-by-two table. They can also use information to identify the number of symbols needed to complete a pictograph when the symbol represents more than one unit.  \n\nThe answer shown illustrates the type of student response that was given full credit.\nAn \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students.

As shown in Exhibit 7.9, the textbook is often the foundation of mathematics instruction at both the eighth and fourth grades. On average, internationally, nearly two-thirds of the eighth-and fourth-grade students (65-66%) had teachers who reported using a textbook as the primary basis of their lessons. For another 32 percent of the eighthgrade students and 29 percent of the fourth-grade students, teachers reported using textbooks as a supplementary resource. Exhibit 7.10 presents a profile of the activities most commonly encountered in mathematics classes around the world, as reported by mathematics teachers. At the eighth grade, the three most predominant activities, accounting for 59 percent of class time, on average, internationally, were teacher lecture (19 % of class time), teacher-guided student practice (22 %), and students working on problems on their own (18%). At the fourth grade, these activities accounted for approximately about the same percentage of time as at the eighth grade (61%). The distribution was slightly different, though, since problem-solving activities with teacher guidance (22%) and on students' own (23%) accounted for nearly half the time. Teachers reported that 16 percent of the time, on average, was devoted to teacher lecture.

Further, the students had to draw the irregular figure on a grid so that it had the correct area. This was relatively difficult for the fourth-grade students in TIMSS 2003, with 29 percent answering correctly, on average, internationally. About two-thirds of the fourth-grade students in Japan and Chinese Taipei responded correctly. \nCountry average significantly higher than international average h i * The item was answered fully correctly by a majority of students reaching this benchmark. \u2020 Met guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included (see Exhibit A.9). shows that these fourth-grade students were able to select the expression that represented the situation in a word problem involving multiplication.

In geometry, students used the simple properties of triangles and rectangles to solve problems. Example Item 4 presented in Exhibit 2.21 shows that students can compose triangles to make other shapes, including a larger triangle and a square. Students were given square tiles divided diagonally into one white and one black triangle and ask to use the tiles in answering a set a of questions. In part A, students were asked to make a large triangle and in part B to make a black square. The achievement results are presented for part B. Forty-two percent of the fourth-grade students, on average, internationally performed this task correctly. Japan had the best performance, with 71 percent correct.

In the number content area, students demonstrated the ability to recognize and translate between different representations of whole numbers, including number line, pictorial representations, and expanded notation. As illustrated by Example Item 5 in Exhibit 2.23, fourth-grade students reaching the intermediate benchmark recognized which figure had two-thirds shaded parts. Fifty-seven percent of the fourth-grade students, on average, internationally answered the question correctly. In Singapore, 93 percent answered correctly followed by 86 percent in Hong Kong, SAR. In the data content area, the fourth-grade students completed a bar graph based on the solution of a word problem (see Example Item 6 in Exhibit 2.24). Indeed fourth-grade students in many of the participating countries performed this task successfully.

At both grades, the benchmark descriptions and example items strongly suggest a gradation in achievement, from the top-performing students' ability to generalize and solve non-routine or contextualized problems to the lower-performing students being able primarily to use routine, mainly numeric procedures. The fact that, even at the intermediate benchmark, students demonstrate only limited achievement in problem solving beyond straightforward one-step problems may suggest a need to reconsider the role, or priority, of problem solving in mathematics curricula. In looking across the item-level results, it also is important to note the variation in performance across the topics covered. For example, on just the few items (15) presented in this chapter, there was a substantial range in performance for many countries. While some countries consistently registered high or low performance, and others had results consistently near the international average, a number of countries performed significantly above the international average on at least one item, and significantly below the international average on at least one item. Such results may reflect intended differences in emphasis in national curricula. It is likely, however, that such results may be unintended, and the findings will provide important information about strengths and weaknesses in intended or implemented curricula. At the very least, an in-depth examination of the TIMSS 2003 results may reveal aspects of curricula that merit further investigation.

Relative achievement is shown among the content areas for each country and results are presented by gender. Trends from 1999 are shown for the eighth grade (insufficient items are available from 1995 to report trends within content areas). The TIMSS 2003 mathematics assessments at the eighth and fourth grades were designed to allow as fair comparisons as possible among participating countries. Considerable effort was devoted to updating the mathematics framework newly published in the TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Specifications 2003. 1 IEA gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the US National Science Foundation in helping to fund this work, which took about two years, including a special international expert panel, iterative reviews by the NRCs, and a curriculum questionnaire completed by the countries.

Following on the framework CHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE MATHEMATICS CONTENT AREAS development, also with additional funding from the US National Science Foundation, an enormous, collaborative test development effort involving the participating countries occurred at both grades to reflect the framework and its new emphasis on problem solving. Nevertheless, curriculum data collected as part of TIMSS 2 indicate differences in the grade level at which particular topics are introduced and in the teaching emphases given some topics. In addition, within countries there can be variation among teachers in the relative emphasis given particular topics.

Correspondingly, countries scoring lowest on the overall tests tended to have low-average performance across all five content areas. At the eighth grade, the differences in average achievement between the highest-and lowest-performing countries were greatest for geometry and measurement (351 and 349 scale-score points, respectively), next for number (344), then algebra (322), and least for data (286). In contrast to the consistency in performance across content areas displayed by the higher-and lower-performing countries overall, performance varied substantially for some middle-performing countries. For example, Armenia performed significantly above the international average in all the content areas except data, where, in contrast, it performed below the international average. At the fourth grade, with fewer and less variable countries, the differences in achievement within the content areas were smaller between the highest-and lowest-performing countries. Interestingly, the largest difference by far -285 scale-score points -was in data (which had the least difference at the eighth grade). Countries did report considerable differences in instructional emphasis given to this content area, especially at the fourth grade.

For each country, Exhibit 3.2 displays the difference between average performance in each content area and average performance overall. The profiles reveal that many countries performed relatively better or worse in several content areas than they did overall. At the eighth grade, for example, it can be seen that Botswana performed relatively worse in geometry than in the other four content areas. At the fourth grade, Norway performed relatively less well in number and in patterns and relationships, and relatively better in the areas of measurement, geometry, and data. Differences in relative performance may be related to one or more of a number of factors, such as emphases in intended curricula or widely used textbooks, strengths or weaknesses in curriculum implementation, and the grade level at which topics are introduced. Differences in the match between the implemented curriculum and content measured by the test may also be a factor. The profiles of relative performance reveal more variation across the content areas in some countries than in others. Average achievement across content areas showed considerable variation in several countries. For example, at the eighth grade, considerable variation of 60 or more scale-score points (one area at least 30 above and one 30 below) was found in Lebanon, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the US state of Indiana. At the fourth grade, no countries had such large differences even though several had a particular strength or weakness. On the other hand, there were only a small number of scale points of difference between highest and lowest content area means in some countries, with the best example being Cyprus at both grades.

The most striking results at the eighth grade were the large number of significant differences favoring girls in algebra compared to those in measurement favoring boys. 3 In algebra, girls had higher average achievement than boys in 22 countries and one benchmarking participant compared to the boys having higher achievement in only 3 countries. On average internationally, the girls had an advantage of 9 points. In measurement, boys had higher average achievement than the girls in 13 countries and 2 benchmarking participants compared to the girls having higher achievement in only 2 countries. The overall difference was 6 points higher for boys, on average. For each TIMSS assessment, examining item statistics to detect any gender bias is an important stage of item selection. It is therefore reasonable to assume that where significant differences do occur, they result from differences in performance rather than problem situations favoring one gender or the other. For the other three content areas, there were essentially no gender differences, on average, internationally, even though there were differences within particular countries. In number, girls performed significantly higher in 10 countries and boys in 12 countries and 2 benchmarking participants. Girls had significantly higher achievement in 8 countries in both geometry and data, whereas boys had the better performance in 13 and 9 entities, respectively. At the fourth grade, the gender pattern was the same as the eighth grade in measurement. Boys had significantly higher achievement than girls in 12 countries and 2 benchmarking participants, whereas girls did not outperform boys in any country. The difference in achievement across countries was 5 points higher for boys. However, for patterns and relationships (the fourth grade equivalent for algebra), the results did not mirror those at eighth grade. Essentially, girls had higher achievement in 3 participating entities and so did boys. At the fourth grade, interestingly, the content area in which girls did better than boys across countries was geometry. The girls had higher achievement in 7 countries and the boys none.

Because for most children, parents are their first and probably most important educators, the level of education of the parents may be the most important educational resource in the home. Exhibit 4.1 summarizes eighth-grade students' reports of the highest level of education attained by their parents. Ordered alphabetically by country, this two-page display shows the percentages of students in each of five categories of parents' educational level, together with their average mathematics achievement. Standard errors for percentages and averages also are shown. The education level of the parent with most education was used in assigning students to categories. Although response rates to questions in the TIMSS questionnaires generally were high, students in some countries had difficulty in answering specific questions, particularly those about their parents' level of education. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point. For a country where responses are available for at least 70 but less than 85 percent of the students, an \"r\" is included next to its data. Where responses are available for at least 50 but less than 70 percent of the students, an \"s\" is included. Where responses are available for less than 50 percent, an \"x\" replaces the data. Exhibit 4.1 reveals great diversity in levels of parental education within and across the TIMSS countries. On average across countries, the percentages of eighth-grade students reporting that the highest level of education attained by either parent was as follows: finished university -28%; finished post-secondary education but not university -17%; finished upper secondary -28%; finished lower secondary -15%; and no more than primary (includes not attending school at all) -12%. Countries with the highest percentages (40% or more) of students reporting university-educated parents included Armenia, Estonia, CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS MATHEMATICS Israel, Japan, Latvia, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States. Among benchmarking participants, Indiana and Ontario were included. In contrast, countries reporting the highest percentages (40% or more) of parents with no more than primary education included Botswana, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. The different educational approaches, structures, and organizations across the TIMSS countries make comparisons of educational levels difficult, and this is exacerbated by high levels of 'do not know' and missing responses in some countries. Nonetheless, Exhibit 4.1 makes it clear that higher levels of parents' education are associated with higher eighth-grade student achievement in mathematics in almost all countries. At 503 score points, the average mathematics achievement of students with university-educated parents was more than 90 points greater than the average of students whose parents had no more than primary education. As shown in Exhibit 4.2, students generally had high expectations for university education, particularly those who had a parent with a university education. More than half the eighth-grade students (54% on average across countries) reported that they expect to finish university, 30 percent do not expect to complete a university education, and a further 15 percent do not know. Students expecting to finish university had substantially greater average mathematics achievement than those without university expectations. Among those expecting to finish university, the average achievement of those students with a parent who finished university (21% of students) was 30 points greater than those without a university-educated parent (33%). Although speaking more than one language has advantages, TIMSS 1999 showed that, with some exceptions, countries with large proportions of students from homes where the language of the test (and consequently the language of instruction) is not often spoken had lower average mathematics achievement at eighth grade than those who spoke it more often. Exhibit   A tilde (~) indicates insufficient data to report achievement. An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students. An \"s\" indicates data are available for at least 50 but less than 70% of the students. An \"x\" indicates data are available for less than 50% of the students."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS MATHEMATICS", "text": "in relation to their average mathematics achievement, shows that this remains true for the TIMSS 2003 countries, and holds also for mathematics achievement at the fourth grade. At both eighth and fourth grades, students from homes where the language of the test is always or almost always spoken had higher average achievement than those who spoke it less frequently. Whereas in most countries a large majority of students at each grade are from homes where the language of the test is spoken frequently, on average, internationally about 21 percent of students were from homes where the language of the test was spoken only sometimes, or never. Countries where the majority of students speak the language of the test so infrequently included Botswana, Ghana, Indonesia, Lebanon, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa at the eighth grade, and Morocco, the Philippines, and Singapore at the fourth grade. Even though most of these countries had relatively low mathematics achievement, Singapore was a notable exception, with average achievement among those sometimes or never speaking the language of the test at home well above the international average for students always speaking the language of the test at home. Many countries tested in more than one language in order to cover their whole student population. These included Bahrain   the Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa, testing in all possible dialects and languages was prohibitive. Earlier IEA studies have shown that students from homes with extensive literacy resources have higher achievement than those from less advantaged backgrounds. For example, TIMSS 1999 has shown a consistent relationship between number of books in the home and student achievement in both mathematics and science at the eighth grade, 2 and PIRLS 2001 demonstrated a similar relationship with reading literacy at the fourth grade. 3 Providing further information on this topic, Exhibit 4.4 shows for each country at both eighth and fourth grades the percentage of students at each of five ranges of numbers of books in the home in relation to average mathematics achievement. This exhibit reveals a wide range both across and within each country. For example, the percentage of eighth-grade students reporting more than 200 books in their homes exceeded 30 percent in Australia, Estonia, Hungary, and Sweden, whereas in Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa, more than 30 percent of students were from homes with 10 books or less. The situation among fourth-grade students was similar. Across countries, on average, 15 percent of eighth-grade student were from homes with more than 200 books, 13 percent from homes with 101-200 books, 27 percent from homes with 26-100 books, 26 percent from homes with 11-25 books, and 18 percent with 0-10 books. There also was a clear-cut relationship, on average, between number of books in the home and mathematics achievement. Eighthgrade students reporting more than 200 books in their homes had an average score of 498 on the mathematics scale, compared with an average of just 429 for students reporting 10 books or less, a difference of 69 points. If anything, the difference at fourth grade was even larger, ranging from 521 for students reporting more than 200 books to 457 for students reporting 10 books or less. In addition to literacy resources such as books, TIMSS has found that having study aids such as a computer or a study desk or table at CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS MATHEMATICS home was associated with higher student achievement. Exhibit 4.5 shows the percentage of eighth-and fourth-grade students in each country that had a computer or study desk or table, together with their average mathematics achievement. About 60 percent of eighthgrade students, on average, reported having a computer at home, and a slightly greater percentage of fourth-grade students (65%). However, there were great differences between countries. For 17 of the participants -Australia, Belgium (Flemish), Chinese Taipei, England, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Sweden, the United States, Indiana, Ontario, and Quebec -virtually all eighth-grade students (90% or more) reported having a computer at home. In contrast, less than 20 percent of eighthgrade students in Armenia, Botswana, Egypt, Indonesia, Moldova, and Morocco reported having a computer. The mathematics achievement difference between students with a computer at home and those without was substantial on average -39 scale score points at eighth grade and 27 points at fourth grade. Perhaps not surprisingly, somewhat greater percentages of students reported having a study desk or table at home -83 percent and 80 percent at eighth and fourth grades, respectively. In many countries (20 at eighth grade and 9 at fourth grade), more than 90 percent of students reported having a study desk. Having such a study facility was associated with higher average mathematics achievement at both grades -a 35 point difference at eighth grade and a 27 point difference at fourth grade. Because having a computer at home does not necessarily mean that students have access to it, TIMSS also asked students where they actually use a computer -at home, at school, or some other place. Exhibit 4.6 summarizes these responses, presenting countries in order of the percentage of students that reported using a computer both at home and at school. At the eighth grade, 39 percent of the students, on average, across countries reported using a computer both at home and at school. Eighteen percent reported using a computer at home .\nbut not at school, percent using one at school but not at home, and 10 percent at some other place. Fourteen percent of eighth-grade students reported that they do not use a computer at all. At fourth grade, the results were similar to the eighth grade. Forty-three percent of the fourth-grade students reported using a computer both at home and at school, 20 percent at home but not at school, 11 percent at school but not at home, and 9 percent some other place. Eighteen percent reported that they did not use a computer at all. Interestingly, at both grades, the data indicate that students were somewhat more likely to use a computer at home than at school. Also, it should be highlighted that at both grades percentages of students reporting that they did not use a computer at all varied dramatically across countries. For example at the eighth grade, it varied from 0 percent in several countries (Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei) to about one-third (34 to 45%) in the Philippines, Ghana, Armenia, Indonesia, and Tunisia to about two-thirds (61-68%) in Botswana and Iran. Mathematics achievement was positively related to computer usage, particularly at eighth grade, with average achievement highest among students reporting using computers at home and at school (485 points). Next highest was achievement among students using computers at home but not school (470 points), followed by students using computers at school but not home (441 points). Countries with the greatest percentages of eighth-grade students using computers at home and at school included Hong Kong SAR, Chinese Taipei, Australia, England, and Indiana (80% or more), as well as Singapore, the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, Scotland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, and Cyprus (70% or more). At the fourth grade, countries with the greatest percentages (80% or more) of students using computers at home and at school included Chinese Taipei and Australia, as well as England, the Netherlands, Scotland, Hong Kong SAR, the United States, Singapore, and New Zealand.\n\nand England, where less than ten percent of students were at the high level of the index. In general, fourth-grade students reported being given less mathematics homework than did students at the eighth grade. Eighteen percent of fourth-grade students, on average, were at the high level of the index, 56 percent at the middle level, and 26 percent at the low level. Singapore was the country with the highest percentage of students in the high category-40 percent. Despite this, across countries, fourth-grade students in the medium category had the highest average mathematics achievement. This pattern suggests that, compared with their higher-achieving counterparts, the lower-performing students may be assigned more homework as a remedial strategy in an effort to keep up academically. To provide a fuller picture of how students spend their outof-school time on a school day, Exhibit 4.8 gives students' reports on how they spend their daily leisure time. The two most popular activities were watching television or videos and playing or talking with friends (each about two hours per day at eighth grade and a little less at fourth grade). Students reported spending more than one hour per day playing sports and working at jobs at home, and about one hour playing computer games and using the Internet."}, {"section_title": "Use of Computer", "text": "Background data provided by students. \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).

Well-chosen homework assignments can reinforce classroom learning, and, by providing a challenge, can encourage students to extend their understanding of the subject matter. Homework also provides students who are having trouble keeping up with their classmates an opportunity to review material taught in class. To summarize the amount of time typically devoted to mathematics homework in each country, TIMSS constructed an index of the time students spend doing mathematics homework that assigns students to a high, medium, or low level on the basis of the frequency and amount of mathematics homework they are assigned each week. Students at the high level reported that they were assigned more than 30 minutes of mathematics homework at least 3-4 times per week. Students at the low level were reportedly assigned not more than 30 minutes of mathematics homework twice per week. The middle level included all other response combinations. Exhibit 4.7 presents the percentages of eighth-and fourth-grade students at the various levels of this index across countries, and their average mathematics achievement. Countries are ordered by the percentage of students at the high level of the index. At the eighth grade across countries, on average, 26 percent of students were at the high level of the time spent on mathematics homework index, 54 percent at the medium level, and 19 percent at the low level. Students at the low level, on average, had lower achievement than the students in the high and medium categories. Countries with the greatest emphasis on homework the eighth grade included Romania, Italy, and the Russian Federation, where 50 percent or more of the students were at the high level of the index. In these countries, homework seems to be an important part of teachers' instructional strategy.

This index is based on students' responses to four statements about their mathematics ability: \u2022 I usually do well in mathematics; \u2022 Mathematics is more difficult for me than for many of my classmates; * * The response categories for this statement were reversed in constructing the index. \u2022 I learn things quickly in mathematics. Students who agreed a little or agreed a lot with all four statements, on average, were assigned to the high level of the index, while students who disagreed a little or disagreed a lot with all four, on average, were assigned to the low level. The medium level includes all other possible combinations of responses. The percentages of students at each level of this index, and their average mathematics achievement, are presented in Exhibit 4.9 for both eighth and fourth grades. On average, internationally, 40 percent of the eighth-grade students had high self-confidence in learning mathematics. The percentages ranged from a high of 59 percent in Israel to a low of 17 percent in Japan. Although there was a clear positive association between selfconfidence in learning mathematics and mathematics achievement, internationally and in every country, at the country level the relationship was more complex. It is noteworthy that the four countries with lowest percentages of students in the high self-confidence category -Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Korea -all had high average mathematics achievement. Since all of these are Asian Pacific countries, they may share cultural traditions that encourage modest self-confidence. At fourth grade, on average, internationally, 55 percent of students were at the high level of the self-confidence in learning mathematics index, compared with 33 percent at the medium and just 11 percent at the low. The countries with the greatest percentages included Slovenia, and Cyprus, each with 70 percent or more. Countries with relatively lower percentages included Japan and the Philippines, each with less than 40 percent at the high level. Again, there was a positive relationship, on average, between self-confidence in learning mathematics and mathematics achievement. Background data provided by students.

An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students. An \"s\" indicates data are available for at least 50 but less than 70% of the students. Students' motivation to learn mathematics can be affected by whether they find the subject enjoyable, place value on the subject, and think it is important for success in school and for future career aspirations. In addition, developing such positive attitudes towards mathematics among students is an important goal of mathematics education in many countries. To gain some understanding about the value eighth-and fourth-grade students place on mathematics, TIMSS created an index of students valuing mathematics. Students were asked to state their agreement with the following seven statements about mathematics: \u2022 I would like to take more mathematics in school; \u2022 I enjoy learning mathematics; \u2022 I think learning mathematics will help me in my daily life; \u2022 I need mathematics to learn other school subjects; \u2022 I need to do well in mathematics to get into the university of my choice; \u2022 I would like a job that involved using mathematics; \u2022 I need to do well in mathematics to get the job I want. Students who agreed a little or agreed a lot on average with all seven statements were assigned to the high level of the index, while students who on average disagreed a little or disagreed a lot with all seven were assigned to the low level. Students between these extremes were placed in the medium category. The percentages of students at each level of this index, and their average mathematics achievement, are presented in Exhibit 4.10 for both eighth and fourth grades. Across the participating countries, on average, students generally placed a high value on mathematics, with 55 percent in the high category, and a further 35 percent in the medium category. Only 10 percent of students were in the low category. Countries with large percentages of CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS MATHEMATICS students at the high level included Morocco, Botswana, Ghana, Egypt, and Jordan, with 80 percent or more in this category. Among countries where students reported placing less value on mathematics were Korea, Japan, and the Netherlands with less than 20 percent. Since these are countries with high average mathematics achievement, it may be that the students follow a demanding mathematics curriculum, one that leads to high achievement but little enthusiasm for the subject matter. Despite some high percentages for low performing countries and low percentages for high performing countries, students in the high category had higher average mathematics achievement than those in the medium and low categories. To provide more information on changes from 1995 and 1999 in an important component of the students valuing mathematics index, Exhibit 4.11 displays the percentages of eighth-grade students in 2003, 1999, and 1995 that \"agree a lot,\" \"agree a little,\" or \"disagree\" that they enjoy learning mathematics. Comparable data at fourth grade are shown for 2003 and 1995 only. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, there was a significant increase from 1995 and 1999 in the average percentage of students agreeing a lot that they enjoy learning mathematics, from 17 percent in 1995 to 25 percent in 1999 to 29 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, the upward trend from 1995 to 1999 in the percentage of students agreeing a lot that they enjoy learning mathematics appears to have leveled somewhat off in 2003  An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students.

Data are provided about whether the participating countries have national curricula and public examinations in mathematics, how the curriculum is supported and monitored within each country, whether countries differentiate the curriculum for students with different levels of ability, and the approaches and processes that are emphasized in the intended curriculum. The second part of the chapter presents data about the coverage of the TIMSS mathematics topics in the intended curriculum for each country, as well as teachers' reports about the mathematics topics actually taught to their students, also known as the implemented curriculum. In comparing achievement across countries, it is important to consider differences in students' curricular experiences and how they may affect the mathematics they have studied. Students' opportunity to learn the content, skills, and processes tested in the TIMSS 2003 mathematics assessment depends to a large degree on the curricular goals and intentions inherent in each country's policies for mathematics education. Just as important as what students are expected to learn, however, is what their teachers choose to teach them. The lessons provided by the teacher ultimately determine the mathematics students are taught."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM", "text": "This chapter presents information about the curricular goals in mathematics in the TIMSS 2003 countries and teachers' reports about the mathematics studied. Teachers' instructional programs for their classes are usually guided by an \"official curriculum\" that describes the mathematics education that should be provided. The official curriculum can be communicated by means of documents or statements of various types (often called guides, guidelines, or frameworks) prepared by the education ministry or by national or regional education departments. These documents or statements, together with supporting material such as instructional guides or mandated textbooks, are referred to as the intended curriculum. To collect information about the intended mathematics curriculum in each of the TIMSS 2003 countries, the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) responsible for implementing the study completed curriculum questionnaires, often with the assistance of curriculum specialists, and responded to followup queries. In many cases, teachers need to interpret and adapt the intended curriculum according to their perceptions of the needs, abilities, and interests of their students, and this evolves into the implemented curriculum. Research has shown that the implemented curriculum, even in highly regulated educational systems, is not identical to the intended curriculum. To collect data about the implemented curriculum, the mathematics teachers of the students tested in TIMSS 2003 completed questionnaires about whether the students had been taught the various mathematics topics included in the assessment.\nThe content area with the least coverage was data, with only 39 percent of the topics on average included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students. All eight topics were included in the curriculum of just two countries (New Zealand and the United States) and two benchmarking participants (Indiana and Ontario). In contrast, 30 participants had no more than half of the data topics in their curricula, and in four countries -Chinese Taipei, the Philippines, Syria, and Tunisia -none of the data topics was included. Consistent with few countries indicating that they had different curricula for students of different ability levels, the percentages of topics that were included in the intended curriculum for only the more able students were generally low, with only 6 percent of eighth-grade mathematics topics, on average, intended for the top track of students. The percentage ranged from 2 percent for number to 10 percent for data. Although the relationship between inclusion in the intended curriculum and student achievement was not perfect, it was notable that several of the higher-performing countries reported high levels of emphasis on the mathematics topics in their intended curricula and that those with the lowest levels of curricular coverage came from the lower half of the achievement distribution. For example, five of the six top-performing countries (Chinese Taipei being the exception) included 80 percent or more of the topics for all or almost all of their students, while the six countries with fewer than half of the topics in their curricula all had average mathematics achievement below the international mean. However, high-performing Chinese Taipei and the Netherlands had relatively low coverage of the mathematics topics (69 and 53 percent, respectively) in their intended curricula, whereas lower-performing Ghana and Bahrain had 96 and 89 percent of topics, respectively, included in their intended curricula. Clearly the intended curriculum is only one of the factors that impact achievement. At fourth grade, Exhibit 5.6 shows that on average, internationally, 59 percent of the TIMSS 2003 mathematics topics were included in the intended curricula for all or almost all students, and a further CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM 9 percent for only the more able students. More than eighty percent of the mathematics topics were included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students in Armenia, England, Italy, Moldova, the United States, Indiana, and Ontario. Although measurement had fewer topics than number at the fourth grade (6 vs 12), it had a greater percentage of topics included in the intended curricula of participating countries -81 percent for all or almost all students compared with 68 percent. Nineteen of the twentynine fourth-grade participants included at least five of the six measurement topics in their curricula. Comparable coverage of number topics (10 out of 12 topics) was reported in just 10 of the 29 participants. The data content area was next at fourth grade in terms of inclusion in the intended curriculum, with 62 percent of its topics, on average, intended for all or almost all students. Five or more of the seven data topics were included in the intended curricula of 19 participants for all or almost all students. For patterns and relationships, on average, 54 percent of the topics were included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students. At least four of the six topics in patterns and relationships were included in the intended curricula of 14 participants for all or almost all students. The content area with the least coverage was geometry, with only 38 percent of the topics on average included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students. In 17 of the 29 participants, fewer than half of the 11 geometry topics were included in the curriculum. As at the eighth grade, the percentages of topics included in the intended curriculum for only the more able students at fourth grade were generally low, consistent with few countries indicating that they had different curricula for different groups of students depending on ability level. Only 9 percent of fourth-grade mathematics topics on average were intended for the top track of students, with a range of 8 percent for measurement and geometry to 11 percent for patterns and relationships. At the fourth grade, as at the eighth grade, the relationship between the coverage of the TIMSS mathematics topics in participants' intended curricula and student achievement in mathematics is a moderately positive one. Higher-performing countries had generally greater levels of coverage, and lower-performing countries lesser levels. For example, high-performing Singapore and Japan had 71 and 69 percent, respectively, of mathematics topics included in their intended curricula for all or almost all students, whereas low-performing Morocco and Tunisia had just 21 and 19 percent, respectively. However, as at the eighth grade, this relationship did not hold true for all countries at the fourth grade. For example, higher-performing Hong Kong, SAR and Belgium (Flemish) had 52 and 38 percent, respectively, of mathematics topics overall included in their intended curricula for all or almost all students, and lower-performing Iran had 60 percent included in its intended curriculum.\nThe algebra topics were included in their intended eighth-grade curricula by somewhat fewer participants, as shown in Exhibit 5.9. The most frequently reported topic -\"sums, products, and powers of expressions containing variables\" -was included for all or almost all students in 42 of the participating entities. In contrast, \"attributes of a graph\" was included in the intended curriculum of just 19 participants. Although when most topics were included, they were intended for all or almost all students, \"simple linear equations and equalities, and simultaneous (two variables) equations\" and \"proportional, linear, and nonlinear relationships\" were intended for the top-track students only in 9 and 7 entities, respectively. Countries frequently indicated that algebra topics would primarily be taught in later grades. Exhibit 5.9 also shows that the percentages of students whose teachers reported having taught the algebra topics generally is in line with the inclusion of the topics in the intended curriculum. The percentage of students ranged from 88 percent for \"sums, products, and powers of expressions containing variables\" to 44 percent for \"attributes of a graph.\" As noted earlier in this chapter, most TIMSS participants included good coverage of measurement in their eighth-grade intended curriculum. Exhibit 5.10 provides more detail, showing that five of the eight measurement topics are included in the intended curriculum of at least 40 of the participants. These topics include standard units of measure, relationship among conversion units, using standard measurement tools, estimation of measurements, and measurement formulas. Also, teachers reported that these topics had been well covered in the classroom, with more than 80 percent of students having been taught each one, on average. The other three topics were included in fewer participants' curricula and had received less attention in the classroom. \"Precision of measurements\" was included in the intended curriculum of just 22 participants, and on average, 57 percent of students had teachers reporting that the topic had been taught. With 13 topics, geometry was the TIMSS mathematics content area with the most topics. However, as shown in Exhibit 5.11, just three   An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70 but less than 85% of the students.

An \"x\" indicates data are available for less than 50% of the students.\nAt the fourth grade, 12 of the 42 TIMSS mathematics topics were in the number content area. As shown in Exhibit 5.13, there was generally good coverage of the topics both in the intended curriculum and in the classroom. Five of the topics -\"whole numbers including place value and ordering,\" \"represent whole numbers using words, diagrams, or symbols,\" \"properties of whole numbers,\" \"computation with whole numbers,\" and \"estimation with whole numbers\" -appear in the intended curricula of almost all participants and have been taught to almost all students (more than 90%). Four of the number topics appear in the intended curricula of less than half the participants -\"equivalent fractions,\" \"compare and order fractions,\" \"adding and subtracting fractions with the same denominator,\" and \"simple and proportional reasoning.\" These topics were taught to between one half and twothirds of the students, on average. As shown in Exhibit 5.14, of the six TIMSS patterns and relationships topics, only \"missing number in an equation\" was included in the intended fourth-grade curriculum of almost all TIMSS participants. Practically all students had been taught this topic, including those in the countries where it was not part of the intended curriculum! \"Patterns of numbers or shapes\" and \"pairs of numbers following a given rule\" were in the intended curriculum of at least half of the participants, and were taught to 81 percent and 76 percent of students, respectively. \"Simple equations\" and \"finding a rule for a relationship given some pairs of numbers\" were included in the curriculum of relatively few participants (10 and 12, respectively) but were taught to surprisingly large percentages of students (87% and 71%). As described earlier in this chapter, the fourth-grade mathematics curriculum included a strong emphasis on measurement topics in many countries.

Some countries, on the other hand, have less centralized systems, with CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM such decisions made at the regional or local level. Centralized decision making can add coherence and uniformity to curriculum coverage, whereas less centralized decision making may give a school or teacher more flexibility in tailoring instruction to the needs of students. Exhibit 5.1 shows that, of the 47 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003 at the eighth grade, 1 all but 3 reported that the specifications for students' curricular goals in mathematics at this level were developed as national curricula. In Australia and the United States, curricula were determined at the state level. In Belgium (Flemish), although there was no national curriculum, there were officially defined final attainment levels, and school boards developed their own curricula based on these. Among benchmarking participants, the US state of Indiana and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec had system-wide curricula determined at the state and provincial level, respectively, while in the Basque Country of Spain, 55 percent of the curriculum was determined at the national level and 45 percent at the community level. In the recent past, it has become common for countries' intended curricula to be updated regularly. At the time of the TIMSS 2003 testing, the official eighth-grade mathematics curriculum in 27 of the participants had been in place for five years or less, and more than half of those were in revision. Of the 24 participants with an eighthgrade mathematics curriculum of more than five years standing, 18 were revising it at the time of the assessment. For Australia and the United States, with less centralized educational systems, curriculum renewal varies by state and is a generally ongoing process. At the time of the TIMSS 2003 assessment, the official fourthgrade mathematics curriculum had been in place for five years or less in 20 of the participants, and nearly half of those were in revision. Of the nine participating entities with a fourth-grade mathematics curriculum of more than five years standing, five were revising it at the time of the assessment. As at the eighth grade, curriculum renewal in Australia and the United States varied by state and was generally an ongoing process. Public examinations with consequences for individual students are another common feature of many countries' educational systems. Although public examinations can provide information of interest to national and regional policy makers, their main purpose is to make decisions about individual students, such as promotion from one grade to another, entry to a higher school system, or graduation from secondary school. Among all TIMSS 2003 participants, 39 countries and one benchmarking entity reported having public examinations in mathematics at one or more grades. Grade 12 was the most prevalent, with 33 countries giving students public examinations in mathematics at this level."}, {"section_title": "How Do Countries Support and Monitor Curriculum Implementation?", "text": "Education systems use different ways to achieve the best match between the intended and the implemented curriculum. The use of public examinations as a mechanism to support and monitor implementation of the intended curriculum is prevalent among many countries, as noted above. Another way to help ensure alignment is to develop instructional materials, such as textbooks, instructional guides, and ministry notes, tailored to the curriculum. In addition, countries can also monitor curriculum implementation by means of national assessments CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM based on student samples, and by systems of school inspection or audit. The different methods used by the TIMSS 2003 countries are shown in Exhibit 5.2, first for countries that participated at the eighth grade and then for those at the fourth grade. Of the methods for supporting and monitoring curriculum implementation shown in Exhibit 5.2, at the eighth grade, 12 participants reported using all 7, and an additional 22 used 5 or 6. The most widely used methods were ministry notes and directives (42 participants), instructional or pedagogical guides (41 participants), and a system of school or audit (40 participants) The use of mandated or recommended textbooks as a means of supporting eighth-grade mathematics curriculum implementation was reported by 38 participants. Curriculum evaluation during or after implementation was used by 35 participating entities, and the use of specifically developed or recommended instructional activities by 33 participants. The least widely used method was national assessments based on student samples (25 participants). At the fourth grade, four participants reported using all seven methods shown in Exhibit 5.2 to support and monitor curriculum implementation, and 16 participants used five or six. The most widely used methods were instructional or pedagogical guides (24 participants), ministry notes and directives (24 participants), and curriculum evaluation during or after implementation (23 participants). A system of school inspection or audit as a means of monitoring fourth-grade mathematics curriculum implementation was used by 21 participants. The use of specifically developed or recommended instructional activities was reported by 21 participants and mandated or recommended textbooks by 20 participants. Similar to the eighth grade, the least widely used method at the fourth grade was national assessments based on student samples (12 participants). An additional method countries often use to support curriculum implementation is to provide mathematics teachers with specific preparation in how to teach the intended curriculum as part of their pre-service and/or in-service education. These data are given in Exhibit 6.5 of the next chapter."}, {"section_title": "How Much Instructional Time is Intended for Mathematics?", "text": "Many countries designate in their intended curriculum the percentage of total instructional time that should be devoted to mathematics and other subjects at different grade levels. The percentage of instructional time designated for mathematics in the intended curriculum for grades 2, 4, 6, and 8 is shown in Exhibit 5.3 for all TIMSS 2003 participants. These data provide a good estimate of students' intended instructional time for mathematics across the primary and middle school years. The general pattern across countries shows that the percentage of time remains the same or decreases from grade 2 to grade 4, from grade 4 to grade 6, and from grade 6 to grade 8, with the largest decline usually between grades 6 and 8. Interestingly, the reverse pattern holds for science. 2 Where increases occurred in the percentage of instructional time designated for mathematics, they generally were between grades 2 and 4. Not all countries conformed to this general pattern, however. The percentage of total instructional time specified for mathematics ranged from 10 to 25 percent at second grade, from 12 to 29 percent at fourth grade, from 11 to 25 percent at sixth grade, and from 8 to 25 percent at eighth grade. Schools' and teachers' reports of the percentage of instructional time actually devoted to mathematics at grades 4 and 8, shown in Exhibit 7.3, generally correspond with the intended percentages reported in Exhibit 5.3, although slightly more so at eighth grade than at fourth grade.   The challenge of maximizing opportunity to learn for students with widely varying abilities is met differently in different countries. Exhibit 5.4 indicates how countries addressed this issue in organizing the intended mathematics curriculum, first for countries that participated at the eighth grade and then for those at the fourth grade. The most common approach at the eighth grade, reported by 38 participants, was to have the same intended curriculum for all students with no grouping of students. Nine countries reported having one curriculum for all students, but at different difficulty levels for groups of students with different ability levels. Four countries -Belgium (Flemish), the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, and Singapore -had different curricula for different groups of students according to their ability level. At the fourth grade, all participants reported having just one curriculum for all students, and in most cases with no grouping by ability level. Five countries, Australia, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States, had just one curriculum for all students, but provided different levels of difficulty for students of differing ability levels. Exhibit 5.5 indicates the relative emphasis given to various aspects of mathematics instruction in the intended curriculum of participating countries, for both eighth and fourth grade. At the eighth grade, as might be anticipated for students at this point in their education, \"a lot of emphasis\" was most commonly placed on understanding mathematical concepts and principles (32 participants) and mastering basic skills (30 participants). Not a single participant reported giving \"very little\" or \"no\" emphasis in the intended curriculum to understanding mathematical concepts and principles, and mastering basic skills received very little or no emphasis in only five countries. Applying mathematics in real-life contexts was given a lot of emphasis in the intended eighth-grade curriculum of 17 participants. Botswana, the Netherlands, and South Africa reported placing more emphasis on this approach than on mastering basic skills or understanding mathematics concepts. Communicating mathematically received a lot of emphasis in 13 participating entities, and reasoning mathematically in 14 entities. Relative to the other approaches and processes, participants reported placing less emphasis on integrating mathematics with other subjects, deriving formal proofs, and incorporating the experiences of different ethnic/ cultural groups. Only two countries -Ghana and South Africa -reported placing a lot of emphasis on this multicultural approach in the intended curriculum. In the intended mathematics curriculum at the fourth grade, most emphasis was placed on mastering basic skills and understanding mathematical concepts and principles, with applying mathematics in real-life contexts next in terms of emphasis. Communicating mathematically and reasoning mathematically were given a lot of emphasis in about half the participants. Integrating mathematics with other subjects and incorporating the experiences of different ethnic/cultural groups were given least emphasis in the fourth-grade mathematics curriculum. National Research Coordinators were asked to indicate whether each of the TIMSS 2003 mathematics topics was included in their countries' intended curriculum through the target grade (eighth or fourth grade), and if so, whether the topics were intended to be taught to \"all or almost all students\" or \"only the more able students.\" They were also asked to indicate the grade(s) at which each topic was primarily intended to be taught to students. Exhibit 5.6 shows that, for most countries, a great deal of the mathematics content addressed by the TIMSS 2003 assessment was included in their intended curricula. On average, across participants at CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM the eighth grade, 70 percent of the assessment topics were intended for all or almost all students, and a further six percent for only the more able students. In only six countries were less than half of the topics included in the eighth-grade curriculum: Botswana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco, the Philippines, and Tunisia. Not surprisingly, at this level, the content area with the greatest coverage was number, with 96 percent of the topics, on average, included in participants' intended curriculum for all or almost all students. For all but three participants, at least nine of the ten topics in number (90%) were included in the curriculum. The mathematics content area with the next greatest coverage was measurement, with 78 percent of the topics, on average, included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students. Sixteen participants included all eight measurement topics in their curricula, and a further 30 participants included seven of the eight topics. Countries with low emphasis on measurement in the curriculum included Botswana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia, where at least half of the measurement topics were not included in the curriculum. Geometry and algebra had similar levels of coverage across participating countries, with about two-thirds of the topics (67 percent of the geometry topics and 63 percent of the algebra topics) included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students. In geometry, relatively high levels of coverage (11 of 13 percent of the topics) were reported for the intended curricula of 21 participants, although there also were several (Botswana, Indonesia, Latvia, Morocco, the Philippines, South Africa, Sweden, and Tunisia) where fewer than half of the geometry topics were included in the eighth-grade curriculum. For algebra, most of the topics (5 out of 6) were included in the intended curricula of 22 participants. However, in 14 of the TIMSS participants, no more than half of the algebra topics were included. One country, Chile, included none of the algebra topics in its intended curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Are the TIMSS Mathematics Topics Taught in School?", "text": "The previous section described the coverage of the TIMSS mathematics topics in participating countries' intended curricula at the eighth and fourth grades, with a focus on the percentage of topics that were included in countries' intended curricula for all or almost all students. This section describes the coverage of the TIMSS topics in countries' implemented curricula at the eighth and fourth grades, based on teachers' reports of the percentage of students actually taught these topics. To gather information about mathematics coverage in the implemented curricula of participating countries, the mathematics teachers 5 of the students assessed were asked to indicate whether each of the TIMSS 2003 mathematics topics was \"mostly taught before this year,\" \"mostly taught this year,\" or \"not yet taught or just introduced.\" Exhibit 5.7 presents for eighth and fourth grade the percentage of students whose teachers reported that the students had been taught the TIMSS mathematics topics either prior to or during the year of the assessment. The CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM exhibit shows for each TIMSS participant, averaged across mathematics content areas, the percentage of students whose teachers reported that the students had been taught each topic. The topics were listed in a questionnaire completed by the mathematics teachers of the students who took the TIMSS 2003 test. 6 Although generally teacher participation was high, sometimes teachers did not complete the questionnaire assigned to them, so most countries had some percentage of students for whom no teacher questionnaire information is available. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point. For a country where teacher responses are available for at least 70 but less than 85 percent of the students, an \"r\" is included next to its data. Where teacher responses are available for at least 50 but less than 70 percent of students, an \"s\" is included. Where teacher responses are available for less than 50 percent, an \"x\" replaces the data. Exhibit 5.7 shows that, according to their teachers, on average 72 percent of the eighth-grade students tested in TIMSS 2003 had been taught the TIMSS mathematics topics. In Armenia and Macedonia almost all students (90 % or more) had been taught the topics, as had the majority of students in every country except Botswana. Consistent with the information on the intended curriculum presented in the previous section, number was the content area with the greatest coverage, with 95 percent of students across countries having been taught the TIMSS number topics by the eighth grade. This was followed by measurement (78%), geometry (69%), algebra (66%), and data (46%). All but 5 countries had 90 percent or more of their students taught the number topics, while 25 participating entities had less than half their students taught the data topics. The agreement between the average percentages of TIMSS topics in countries' eighth-grade intended mathematics curricula and the percentages of students actually taught the TIMSS mathematics topics by the eighth grade is rather striking.

CHAPTER 5: THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM no difference for measurement, two percentage points for geometry, and seven percentage points for data. Although there was great agreement between coverage in the intended curriculum and the implemented curriculum internationally at the eighth grade, there was wide variation among individual countries. Agreement between the percentage of TIMSS mathematics topics included in a country's intended curriculum and the percentage of students taught the TIMSS mathematics topics in that country by the eighth grade was within 5 percentage points in 19 countries spanning the entire spectrum of achievement: Australia, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Chinese Taipei, Egypt, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Iran, Jordan, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Moldova, New Zealand, the Palestinian National Authority, Romania, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore. However, there were also several participants where the level of agreement between coverage of the intended and implemented curricula was much less. At the fourth grade, Exhibit 5.7 shows that internationally, on average, 73 percent of the students tested in TIMSS 2003 had been taught the TIMSS mathematics topics, with the percentage ranging from 88 percent in England and Moldova to 52 percent in Norway. The majority of students in every country had been taught the topics. Consistent with the data reported on the intended mathematics curriculum at the fourth grade (Exhibit 5.6), measurement was the content area with the greatest percentage of students taught the topics (86%). The percentages of fourth-grade students internationally, on average, taught the TIMSS mathematics topics in the content areas of data, patterns and relationships, and number were rather similar. A full 80 percent of the students across countries had been taught the data topics by the fourth grade, 79 percent of students had been taught the patterns and relationships topics, and 77 percent of students had been taught the number topics. Across countries, the range for data was from 90 percent in the United States to 54 percent in Norway, for patterns and relationships from 93 percent in Moldova to 53 percent in Norway, and for number from 97 percent in Singapore to 40 percent in Tunisia.

In particular, three topics -\"common fractions,\" \"decimal fractions,\" and \"computations with decimals\" -were included by all participants for all or almost all students. Exhibit 5.8 shows, however, that there was great variation among participants in the grade(s) at which the number topics were primarily intended to be taught.

These topics were: \"angles -acute, right, straight, obtuse, reflex, complementary, and supplementary,\" \"relationships for angles on a point or on a line,\" and \"properties of geometric shapes: triangles and quadrilaterals.\" Two other topics were included in most participants' curricula and taught to more than 80 percent of students: \"construct or draw triangles or rectangles of given dimensions,\" and \"properties of angle bisectors and perpendicular bisectors of lines.\" Inclusion of the other geometry topics in the intended curriculum was more varied, as was the percentage of students taught the topics. The topics with least coverage in the classroom were \"translation, reflection, rotation, and enlargement,\" and \"relationships between two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes,\" where less than half the students (47% and 41% , respectively) were taught the topics. In countries where geometry topics were not in the intended curriculum at eighth grade, they often were intended primarily for later grades.

These topics also were the only ones taught to more than half of the students (68 and 72 percent, respectively). TIMSS participants varied considerably in the extent to which they included the other data topics in their intended curriculum and taught them in the classroom. The two topics receiving least attention, in both the intended and implemented curriculum, were \"sources of error in collecting and organizing data\" and \"evaluating interpretations of data with respect to correctness and completeness of interpretation.\" These were included in the curriculum of just a few countries, and had been taught to relatively few students, on average (32% and 29%, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Patterns and Relationships Countries", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6", "text": "Teachers of Mathematics Since the teacher is central in creating a classroom environment that supports learning mathematics, Chapter 6 presents information about the preparation and background of mathematics teachers in the participating countries. The chapter begins with information about the licensing and/or certification requirements for teaching mathematics at the eighth and fourth grades in the TIMSS countries. The National Research Coordinators were responsible for providing this information as part of completing the Curriculum Questionnaire. The remaining sections of the chapter include information about the demographic characteristics of the teaching force and about teachers' educational background and preparation, including opportunities for professional development. To collect information from teachers, TIMSS administered a two-part questionnaire in which teachers were asked to provide information about their background and training and their instructional practices. Chapter 6 essentially presents teachers' responses to the first part of the questionnaire, while Chapter 7 presents information from the second part about classroom instruction. Because the sampling for the teacher questionnaires was based on participating students, teachers' responses do not necessarily represent all eighth-grade or all fourth-grade mathematics teachers in each country. Rather, they represent teachers of the representative CHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS samples of students assessed. It is important to note that when information from the teacher questionnaire is being reported, the student is always the unit of analysis. That is, the data shown are the percentages of students whose teachers reported on various characteristics or instructional strategies. Using the student as the unit of analysis makes it possible to describe the instruction received by representative samples of students and the characteristics of the teachers delivering that instruction. Although this perspective may differ from that obtained by simply collecting information from teachers, it is consistent with the TIMSS goals of providing information about the educational contexts and performance of students. The teachers who completed the questionnaires were the mathematics teachers of the students who took the TIMSS 2003 test. At the eighth grade, the general sampling procedure was to sample a mathematics class from each participating school, administer the test to those students, and ask their teacher to complete the questionnaire. At the fourth grade, students often only have one teacher for all subjects, so this teacher is their mathematics teacher and the one who completed the questionnaire. In either case, the information about teachers' characteristics and instruction is tied directly to the students tested. Sometimes, however, teachers did not complete the questionnaire assigned to them, so most countries had some percentage of students for whom no teacher questionnaire information is available. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point.

Countries were asked about five requirements, including supervised practical experience (practicum), passing an examination, obtaining a university degree, completion of a probationary period, and completion of an induction program. At the eighth grade, 70 percent of the TIMSS countries (33 out of 47) and three benchmarking entities required a university degree (or equivalent) and just as many participants required fulfillment of some type of practicum for certification as a mathematics teacher. In more than half of the countries (28 out of 47) and all of the benchmarking participants, certification required passing an examination. A probationary period was required in 23 countries and two benchmarking entities. Of the TIMSS countries, 11 required completion of an induction program as did two of the benchmarking entities. For the United States and Canada, it should be noted that requirements for certification vary across states and provinces. At the fourth grade, most of the TIMSS countries (19 out of 26) and all three of the benchmarking participants required some type of practicum for certification. Eighteen of the countries participating at the fourth grade and all three of the benchmarking participants required two or more of the following for certification -passing an examination, a university degree, or completion of a probationary period. Similar to the eighth grade, the fewest number of fourth grade participants required completion of an induction program. Exhibit 6.2 contains participants' reports about the organization or authority responsible for granting certification for mathematics teachers. Across participants at the eighth grade, universities or colleges were most likely to be responsible for granting certification (55% of the countries and Quebec province). The next most prevalent procedure was for the ministry of education to grant certification. A handful of participants reported using licensing boards and three (New Zealand, Scotland, and Syria) reported granting certification through a teacher organization. The responses at the fourth grade were similar, with ministries of education and universities/colleges being the organizations most often responsible for granting certification. Exhibit 6.3 presents a considerable amount of information about the background characteristics of mathematics teachers at the eighth and fourth grades, including their gender, age, certification status, and number of years of teaching experience. Typically, larger percentages of students were taught mathematics by female teachers than male teachers, particularly at the fourth grade. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, 58 percent of the students were taught mathematics by females and 42 percent by males, and similar percentages were found in a number of countries. However, at least 85 percent of students had female teachers in Armenia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Slovenia. By contrast, only in Egypt and Ghana were as many as 85 percent of the students taught mathematics by male teachers. At the fourth grade, on average, internationally, four-fifths of the mathematics teaching force was female. Across the participants, in each country, with the exception of Morocco and Tunisia at least 50 percent, and often a much higher percentage, of the fourth-grade students were taught by female teachers. Looking to the last column of Exhibit 6.3, it can be seen that, in general, the mathematics teaching force around the world is quite experienced. At both the eighth and fourth grades, mathematics teachers reported 16 years of teaching experience, on average, internationally. Given their years of teaching experience, it follows that the majority of the eighth-grade and the fourth-grade students were taught mathematics by teachers in their 30s and 40s. If there was a steady replenishing of the teaching force, one might expect approximately equivalent percentages of students taught by teachers in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s. Very few countries, however, had a comparatively younger teaching force at either the eighth or fourth grades. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, only 17 percent of students were taught by teachers younger than age 30. The five countries with CHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS the most students (more than 40 percent) taught by younger teachers were Botswana, Ghana, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore. The pattern was very similar at the fourth grade. On average, internationally, 19 percent of the students were taught by teachers younger than 30 years old, and with the exception of Singapore (41%), this percentage was usually well under 40 percent. At the other end of the age distribution, 23 percent of the eighth-grade students and 21 percent of the fourth-grade students internationally were taught by teachers age 50 or older. At the eighth grade, interestingly, the teaching force was relatively older in several countries. More than half of the students in Italy, Moldova, and Serbia had teachers at least 50 years of age. Finally, from Exhibit 6.3, it can be seen that teachers at both the eighth and fourth grades, reported having full certification rather than provisional or emergency credentials. Given the potential problem of teacher shortages for a variety of reasons, it is interesting to note that, on average, internationally, 88 percent of the eighth-grade students and 85 percent of the fourth-grade students were taught mathematics by certified teachers. Of course, the situation varied dramatically across the TIMSS countries. For example, in South Africa only 45 percent of the eighth-grade students and in Tunisia only 21 percent of the fourthgrade students were taught mathematics by a fully certified teacher.

Exhibit 6.7 presents teachers' reports about their professional development participation in six different aspects of mathematics teaching. The results were relatively consistent across the six topics -content, pedagogy, curriculum, technology, problem solving, and assessment. At the eighth grade, from 43 to 57 percent of the students, on average, internationally, were taught by teachers having participated in professional development in the area during the past two years. The highest percentages, 57 percent in both cases, were for the areas of content and pedagogy. At the fourth grade, on average, the percentages were somewhat lower, ranging from 33 to 47 percent. The highest percentages were for content (46%), pedagogy (47%), and problem solving (46%). The lowest percentage was for integrating information technology into mathematics (33%). Because opportunities for professional development do not necessarily have to be structured by the school, teachers also were asked about how often they interacted with their colleagues. More specifically, they were asked about discussing teaching strategies for particular concepts, preparing instructional materials, and classroom observations. As shown in Exhibit 6.8, on average, the results for the TIMSS participants were consistent across grades. Teachers of most students (80% or more) reported weekly or monthly interaction about instructional issues. In contrast, observing other teachers or being observed themselves was relatively infrequent (65% never)."}, {"section_title": "What Preparation Do Teachers Have for Teaching Mathematics?", "text": "Exhibits 6.4 through 6.8 present teachers' reports about their preparation to teach mathematics, including educational experiences before actually teaching and opportunities for developing their expertise after entering the profession (often referred to as pre-service and in-service training).

At the eighth grade, 59 percent of the students were taught by teachers with a university degree and another 17 percent by teachers who had coursework beyond the initial university degree. At the fourth grade, 52 percent of the students were taught by teachers with a university degree and another 13 percent by teachers with coursework beyond that degree. Despite a relatively well-educated teaching force, on average, the situation varied dramatically among countries. At the eighth grade, for example, at least half the students were taught by teachers with work beyond the initial university degree in Armenia, Australia, Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, and the United States. In contrast, 72 percent of the eighth-grade students in Morocco were taught by teachers only having completed secondary school. According to the results of the Curriculum Questionnaire, almost all of the students participating in TIMSS 2003 were supposed to be learning mathematics according to a national (for most countries) or regional curriculum. To gather some information about coherence between the intended curriculum and teacher preparation, the Curriculum Questionnaire also asked about specific teacher training in how to teach this curriculum -as part of either teachers' pre-service or inservice education. Exhibit 6.5 has the results. The majority of countries and benchmarking participants reported preparation in how to teach CHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS the intended curriculum as part of both pre-and in-service training, and most reported coverage in at least one of these places. Countries reporting no specific training in how to teach the intended curriculum included Chile, Korea, Moldova, Morocco, Norway, and Sweden. Teachers' reports about their major area or areas of study during their postsecondary education can be found also, in Exhibit 6.5. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, the majority studied mathematics education (54%) or mathematics (70%) or both (since teachers often reported that their study was focused in more than one area). For example, it was not uncommon for teachers in some countries to report pedagogy as a major area of study and mathematics as another major area. As might be considered, the situation was different at the fourth grade. Here teachers typically studied primary or elementary education (approximately 80 percent, on average). On average, for the primary education majors, about one-fourth (26%) reported specializing in mathematics, 4 percent in science, and half (50%) not having any particular specialization. Countries with more than half the fourthgrade students being taught by mathematics specialists were Latvia, Moldova, and the Russian Federation. In today's fast-paced world of frequent important discoveries and new technologies in the fields of pedagogy and mathematics, it is very important for teachers to continually update their knowledge. To provide context for considering this important part of teacher training in the TIMSS countries, Exhibits 6.6 through 6.8 contain information about teachers' opportunities for and participation in professional development activities. Exhibit 6.6 presents schools' reports about the opportunities provided to teachers in five major areas: supporting implementation of the official curriculum, supporting school-level goals, improving content knowledge, improving teaching skills, and using technology. Within each area, schools reported the frequency of teachers' involvement. At both grades, schools reported that their professional development programs emphasized improving content knowledge and teaching skills.

Across the five major content areas (number, algebra, measurement, CHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS geometry, and data), the eighth-grade teachers were asked about 18 topics (sub-areas). Exhibit 6.9 contains teachers' reports, indicating that the teachers of almost all the eighth-grade students felt ready to teach nearly all the topics. On average, internationally, the results ranged from 84 to 98 percent, with the results above 90 percent for all but three of the data topics (sources of error, data collection methods, and simple probability). At the fourth grade, the results were very similar. Teachers were asked about 16 topics, with the results ranging from 83 to 100 percent, on average, internationally. The results dipped below 90 percent for only two geometry topics, relationships between twoand three-dimensional shapes (88%) and translation, reflection, and rotation (83%). At the eighth grade, essentially all students in all countries were taught the number topics by teachers who felt ready to teach the topics. Teachers' reports for the algebra topics were similar, falling substantially below 90 percent of the students only in Tunisia (71 to 74%). In the measurement area, percentages ranged between 55 to 89 percent for at least one topic in a number of countries, including Belgium (Flemish), Botswana, Ghana, Iran, Japan, Moldova, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Tunisia. For geometry, readiness reports were uniformly above 90 percent with only few exceptions for particular topics in Chile, Hungary, Moldova, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, and Tunisia. Across the topics, the least amount of readiness was reported for the data topics. For almost all of the countries, for one or more of the data topics, fewer than 90 percent of the students were taught by teachers who felt ready to teach the topic. At the fourth grade, in general, almost all the students (at least 90%) in all the participating entities (except Tunisia) were taught by teachers who felt ready to teach the topics in number, algebra, measurement, and data.

To provide information about the environment of mathematics classrooms and the instruction that takes place, Chapter 7 presents teachers' reports from the second part of the teacher questionnaire about their mathematics classrooms and instructional practices, as well as students' reports about the classroom activities they do in learning mathematics. Data are presented about class size, various limitations on instruction, instructional time, instructional emphases given different mathematics topics, and classroom activities. Information also is presented about the use of calculators and computers in mathematics lessons, the role of homework, and the reliance on different types of assessment approaches. Teachers and the instructional approaches they use ultimately determine the mathematics students learn. Teachers structure the content and pace of lessons, introducing new material, selecting various instructional activities, and monitoring students' developing understanding of the mathematics concepts being studied. Teachers may help students use technology and tools to investigate mathematical ideas, analyze students' work for misconceptions, and promote positive CHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS attitudes toward mathematics. They may also assign homework and conduct informal as well as formal assessments to evaluate achievement outcomes."}, {"section_title": "How Do the Characteristics of Mathematics Classrooms Impact Instruction?", "text": "Because it can affect pedagogical strategies, class size data are shown in Exhibit 7.1. Teachers' reports about the sizes of their eighth-grade mathematics classes reveal that across countries the average class size was 30 students, but there was considerable variation -from more than 54 students in the Philippines to 20 students in Belgium (Flemish). At the fourth grade, classes typically were smaller. The average class size for the TIMSS participants was 26 students, ranging from 40 in the Philippines to 20 in Belgium (Flemish), Italy and Slovenia. The relationship between class size and achievement is difficult to disentangle, given the variety of policies and practices that countries have in determining class size. For example, countries and schools cannot always control class size. Because of this, the ability to cap class sizes can indicate the availability of more resources in general. As another complicating factor, smaller classes can be used for advanced or practical classes such as computer laboratories on one hand, and for remedial learning or students with special needs on the other. The complexity of this issue is evidenced in the TIMSS results that show a curvilinear relationship, on average, between class size and mathematics achievement at both the eighth and fourth grades. At the eighth grade, mathematics teachers were asked about the instructional impact of six characteristics of their students -differing academic abilities, range in backgrounds, students with special needs, uninterested students, low morale among students, and disruptive students. Responses were given on a four-point scale; \"not at all,\" \"a little,\" \"some,\" and \"a lot.\" TIMSS used the teachers' responses to construct an index and the results are presented in Exhibit 7.2. CHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS Students were placed in the high category, if, on average, teachers reported their classrooms were impacted only a little (or less) and in the low category, if, on average, these factors impacted instruction at least somewhat. The remaining students fell in the medium category. The results show that average mathematics achievement is related to the impact of student characteristics on classroom instruction, with lower achievement related to having more instructionally challenging and diverse students in the class. On average, internationally, 20 percent of the students were in such classrooms.

At the eighth grade, countries providing 150 or more hours per year were the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile. Countries providing fewer than 100 hours were Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Macedonia, and Cyprus. The percentage of instructional time at the eighth grade that was devoted to mathematics ranged from 17 percent in the Philippines to percent in Cyprus. At the fourth grade, even with fewer participating countries than at the eighth grade, a substantial number of countries provided 150 or more hours of mathematics instruction, including Italy, Belgium (Flemish), Scotland, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines.

According to the eighth-grade students, internationally, on average, considerable effort was devoted to working on the two activities most likely related to the number content area. Fifty-seven percent of the students reported being asked to practice numerical operations in at least half of their lessons and another 51 percent reported working on fractions and decimals at least this frequently. Fifty-five percent reported writing equations and functions in half their lessons. The smallest percentage of students spent time on data interpretation tasks in at least half their lessons (41%).

In general, research has shown that greater truancy is related to less serious attitudes towards school and lower academic achievement. To examine this issue, TIMSS developed an index of good school and class attendance based on schools' responses to three questions about the seriousness of students' absenteeism, arriving late at school, and skipping class. The high index level indicates schools reported that all three behaviors are not a problem. The low level indicates that two or more are a serious problem, or two are minor problems and the third a serious problem. The medium category includes all other possible combinations of responses. The results of the index for TIMSS 2003 are presented in Exhibit 8.6, which also contains trends between 1999 and 2003 at the eighth grade. At the eighth grade, the results show very little change, on average, in attendance problems. Considering the two assessments, the high category did show a small (statistically significant) increase from 21 percent in 1999 to 23 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of the students -58 to 59 percent -were in the medium category in both years, and about one-fifth (19-20%) were in the low category. Student attendance problems remain a serious problem in many countries, decreasing in five countries but increasing in four others during the same four-year period. At the fourth grade in 2003, 47 percent of students, on average, internationally, were in the high category, where principals had judged their schools to have few if any attendance problems.

Since school safety is central for providing an environment conducive to learning, TIMSS asked both teachers and students to characterize their perceptions of safety in their schools. More specifically, teachers were asked how much they agreed with three statements: \u2022 This school is located in a safe neighborhood; \u2022 I feel safe at this school; \u2022 This school's security policies and practices are sufficient. TIMSS used the teachers' responses to create an index, called the Index of Mathematics Teachers' Perceptions of Safety in the Schools. If their teachers agreed or agreed a lot to all three statements, then the students were placed in the high category. If their teachers disagreed or disagreed a lot to all three statements, then students were placed in the low category. All other combinations (some agreements and some disagreements) were placed in the medium category. Exhibit 8.7 contains the results for the Index of Mathematics Teachers' Perception of Safety in the Schools. On the positive side of things, across countries, about three-fourths of students in both grades were in the high category (72 percent of the eighth-grade students and 75 percent of the fourth-grade students). One-fifth were in the medium category (22 to 21 percent, respectively) and only 6 to 4 percent were in the low category. At both grades, there was a positive relationship between teachers' reports of school safety and mathematics achievement. TIMSS asked the students to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to whether each of the following five things had happened during the last month: \u2022 Something of mine was stolen; \u2022 I was hit or hurt by other students; \u2022 I was made to do things that I didn't want to do by other students; \u2022 I was made fun of or called names; \u2022 I was left out of activities by other students. TIMSS used students' responses to create the Index of Students' Perception of Being Safe in the Schools. Students who reported being in a safe environment, answering \"no\" to all five statements, were placed in the high category. Students who reported being in a much riskier school environment by answering \"yes\" to all five statements were placed in the low category. Students who answered \"yes\" to some statements and \"no\" to others were placed in the medium category. Exhibit 8.8 presents the results for the Index of Students' Perception of Being Safe in the Schools. Internationally, on average, eighth-grade students reported a greater sense of security than did fourth-grade students. Nearly half of the eighth-grade students (48%) were in the high category, 37 percent were in the medium category, and 15 percent were in the low category. It should be emphasized, however, that the feeling of safety was not universal. In several countries, more than one-third of the eighth-grade students were in the low category, including Jordan, the Philippines, Ghana, and South Africa. Eighth-grade students in the low category had lower average mathematics achievement than their counterparts in safer schools. At the fourth grade, across the participating countries, 35 percent of the students, on average, were in the high category, 42 percent were in the medium category, and 23 percent were in the low category. The two countries with more than one-third of the fourth-grade students in the low category were Chinese Taipei and the Philippines. At the fourth grade, there was a direct relationship between students' reporting being in safer schools and having higher mathematics achievement.

In all, 67 countries have participated in TIMSS at one time or another. Of the 49 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003, 48 participated at the eighth grade and 26 at the fourth grade. Yemen participated at the fourth but not the eighth grade. The exhibit shows that at the eighth grade 23 countries also participated in TIMSS 1995 and TIMSS 1999. For these participants, trend data across three points in time are available. Eleven countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1999 only, while three countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1995. These countries have trend data for two points in time. Of the 12 new countries participating in the study, 11 participated at eighth grade and 2 at the fourth grade. Of the 26 countries participating in  As shown in Exhibit A.2, the mathematics assessment framework for TIMSS 2003 is framed by two organizing dimensions or aspects, a content domain and a cognitive domain. The five content domains, number, algebra, measurement, geometry, and data, define the specific mathematics subject matter covered by the assessment, and the four cognitive domains define the sets of behaviors expected of students as they engage with the mathematics content. The cognitive domains include knowing facts and procedures, using concepts, solving routine problems, and reasoning. Developing the TIMSS assessments for 2003 was a cooperative venture involving all of the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) during the entire process. Although about half of the items in the 1999 eighth-grade assessment had been kept secure and were available for use in 2003 to measure trends from 1995 and 1999, the ambitious goals for curriculum coverage and innovative problem solving tasks specified in the Frameworks and Specifications necessitated a tremendous item development effort. To maximize the effectiveness of the contributions from national centers, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center developed a detailed item-writing manual and conducted a workshop for countries that wished to provide items for the international item pool. At this workshop, an item development \"Task Force\" consisting of the mathematics coordinator and two experienced mathematics item writers reviewed general item-writing guidelines for multiple-choice and constructed-response items and provided specific training in writing mathematics and science items in accordance with the TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Specifications 2003. In the weeks that followed, more than 2,000 items and scoring guides were drafted, and reviewed by the task force. The items were further reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee, a group of internationally prominent mathematics and science educators nominated by participating countries to advise on subject-matter issues in the assessment. Committee members also contributed enormously to the quality of the assessment by helping to develop tasks and items to assess problem solving and scientific inquiry. Participating countries field-tested the items with representative samples of students, and all of the potential new items were again reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee. The NRCs had several opportunities to review the items and scoring criteria. The resulting TIMSS 2003 mathematics tests contained 194 items at the eighth grade and 161 items at the fourth grade. Exhibit A.3 presents the number and percentage of items, the number of multiple-choice and constructed-response items, and the number of score points in each of the five mathematics content domains for eighth and fourth grades. Comparable information is presented for the four cognitive domains. About one-fourth of the eighthgrade items and more than two-fifths of the fourth-grade items were in constructed-response format, requiring students to generate and write their own answers. Some constructed-response questions asked for short answers while others required extended responses with students showing their work or providing explanations for their answers. The remaining questions used a multiple-choice format. In scoring the items, correct answers to most questions were worth one point. However, responses to some constructed-response questions (particularly those requiring extended responses) were evaluated for partial credit, with a fully correct answer being awarded two points (see later APPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS 2003 PROCEDURES: MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT section on scoring). The total number of score points available for analysis thus somewhat exceeds the number of items (215 and 169 score points for eighth-and fourth-grades, respectively). About 40% of students' testing time at eighth grade and almost half at fourth grade was allocated to constructed-response items. To ensure reliable measurement of trends over time, the TIMSS 2003 assessment included items that had been used in the 1995 and 1999 assessments as well as items developed for the first time in 2003. Exhibit A.4 shows the distribution of score points across content domains for both trend items and items used for the first time. Of the 215 score points available in the entire 2003 mathematics assessment, 23 came from items used also in 1995, 60 from items used also in 1999, and 132 from items used for the first time in 2003. At fourth grade, 37 score points came from 1995 items, and the remaining 132 from new 2003 items. Every effort was made to ensure that the tests represented the curricula of the participating countries and that the items exhibited no bias toward or against particular countries. The final forms of the test were endorsed by the NRCs of the participating countries. In addition, countries had an opportunity to match the content of the test to their curriculum. They identified items measuring topics not covered in their intended curriculum. The information from this Test-Curriculum Matching Analysis, provided in Appendix C, indicates that omitting such items has little effect on the overall pattern of results.   which is comparable to that in the 1995 and 1999 assessments. The booklets are organized into two three-block sessions (Parts I and II), with a break between the parts. The 2003 assessment was the first TIMSS assessment in which calculators were permitted, and so it was important that the design allow students to use calculators when working on the new 2003 items. However, because calculators were not permitted in TIMSS 1995 or 1999, the design also had to ensure that students did not use calculators when working on trend items from these assessments. The solution was to place the blocks containing trend items (blocks M01 -M06 and S01 -S06) in Part I of the test booklets, to be completed without calculators before the break. After the break, calculators were allowed for the new items (blocks M07 -M14 and S07 -S14). To provide a more balanced design, however, and have information about differences with calculator access, two mathematics trend blocks (M05 and M06) and two science trend blocks (S05 and S06) also were placed in Part II of one booklet each."}, {"section_title": "Background Questionnaires", "text": "As in previous assessments, TIMSS in 2003 administered a broad array of questionnaires to collect data on the educational context for student achievement.

National Research Coordinators completed four questionnaires. With the assistance of their curriculum experts, they provided detailed information on the organization, emphasis, and content coverage of the mathematics and science curriculum at fourth and eighth grades. The fourth-and eighth-grade students who were tested answered questions pertaining to their attitudes towards mathematics APPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS 2003 PROCEDURES: MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT and science, their academic self-concept, classroom activities, home background, and out-of-school activities. The mathematics and science teachers of sampled students responded to questions about teaching emphasis on the topics in the curriculum frameworks, instructional practices, professional training and education, and their views on mathematics and science. Separate questionnaires for mathematics and science teachers were administered at the eighth grade, while to reflect the fact that most younger students are taught all subjects by the same teacher, a single questionnaire was used at the fourth grade. The principals or heads of schools at the fourth and eighth grades responded to questions about school staffing and resources, school safety, mathematics and science course offerings, and teacher support."}, {"section_title": "Translation and Verification", "text": "The TIMSS data collection instruments were prepared in English and translated into 34 languages.

In addition to translation, it sometimes was necessary to modify the international versions for cultural reasons, even in the countries that tested wholly or partly in English. This process represented an enormous effort for the national centers, with many checks along the way. The translation effort included (1) developing explicit guidelines for translation and cultural adaptation; (2) translation of the instruments by the national centers in accordance with the guidelines, using two or more independent translations; (3) consultation with subject-matter experts on cultural adaptations to ensure that the meaning and difficulty of items did not change; (4) verification of translation quality by professional translators from an independent translation company; (5) corrections by the national centers in accordance with the suggestions made; (6) verification by the International Study Center that corrections were made; and (7) a series of statistical checks after the testing to detect items that did not perform comparably across countries. "}, {"section_title": "Population Definition and Sampling", "text": "Since it is a curriculum-based study, TIMSS 2003 had as its intended target population all students at the end of their eighth and fourth years of formal schooling in the participating countries. However, for comparability with previous TIMSS assessments, the formal definition for the eighth grade specified all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 13-yearold students at the time of testing, and for fourth grade, all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 9-year-olds. These correspond to the eighth and fourth grades in practically every country. 6 The selection of valid and efficient samples is crucial to the quality and success of an international comparative study such as TIMSS. The accuracy of the survey results depends on the quality of sampling information and that of the sampling activities themselves. For TIMSS, NRCs worked on all phases of sampling with the TIMSS sampling experts from Statistics Canada and the IEA Data Processing Center (DPC). NRCs received training in how to select the school and student samples and in the use of the sampling software. In consultation with the TIMSS sampling referee (Keith Rust, Westat, Inc.), the TIMSS sampling experts reviewed the national sampling plans, sampling data, sampling frames, and sample execution. The sampling documentation was used by the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center, in consultation with the sampling experts and the sampling referee, to evaluate the quality of the samples. In a few situations where it was not possible to test the entire internationally desired population (all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 13year-old or 9-year-old students at the time of testing), countries were permitted to define a national desired population that excluded part of the internationally desired population.

The United States and Morocco had overall participation rates after including replacement schools of just below 75 percent (73% and 71%, respectively), and were annotated accordingly. Despite extraordinary efforts to secure full participation, England's participation fell below the minimum requirement of 50 percent, and so their results were annotated and placed below a line in exhibits showing achievement. Because of scheduling difficulties, Korea was unable to test its eighth-grade students in May 2003 as planned. Instead, the students were tested in September 2003, when they had moved into the ninth grade. The results for Korea are annotated accordingly in exhibits in this report. At fourth grade, all participants achieved the minimum acceptable participation rates, although Australia, England, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the United States did so only after including replacement schools. Whereas countries achieved a high degree of compliance with sampling guidelines in 2003, occasionally countries' data were omitted from exhibits dealing with trends from earlier assessments because of comparability issues. Because of differences in population coverage, 1999 eighth-grade data for Australia, Morocco, and Slovenia and fourth-grade data for Italy are not shown in this report. Israel, Italy, and South Africa, experienced difficulties with sampling at the classroom level in 1995; consequently their eighth-grade data from that assessment are not shown in this report.  "}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Each participating country was responsible for carrying out all aspects of the data collection, using standardized procedures developed for the study. Training manuals were created for school coordinators and test administrators that explained procedures for receipt and distribution of materials as well as for the activities related to the testing sessions. These manuals covered procedures for test security, standardized scripts to regulate directions and timing, rules for answering students' questions, and steps to ensure that identification on the test booklets and questionnaires corresponded to the information on the forms used to track students. 7 Each country was responsible for conducting quality control procedures and describing this effort in the NRC's report documenting procedures used in the study. In addition, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center considered it essential to monitor compliance with standardized procedures. NRCs were asked to nominate one or more persons unconnected with their national center to serve as quality control monitors for their countries. The International Study Center developed manuals for the monitors and briefed them in two-day training sessions about TIMSS, the responsibilities of the national centers in conducting the study, and their roles and responsibilities. In all, 50 quality control monitors drawn from the 49 countries and four benchmarking participants participated in the training. 8 Where necessary, quality control monitors who attended the training session were permitted to recruit other monitors to assist them in covering the territory and meeting the testing timetable. All together, the international quality control monitors and those trained by them observed 1,147 testing sessions (755 for grade 8 and 392 for grade 4), 9 and conducted interviews with the National Research Coordinator in each of the participating countries. 10 The results of the interviews indicate that, in general, NRCs had prepared well for data collection and, despite the heavy demands of the schedule and shortages of resources, were able to conduct the data collection efficiently and professionally. Similarly, the TIMSS tests appeared to have been administered in compliance with international procedures, including the activities before the testing session, those during testing, and the school-level activities related to receiving, distributing, and returning material from the national centers."}, {"section_title": "Scoring the Constructed-Response Items", "text": "Because 40 to 50 percent of the test time was devoted to constructedresponse items, TIMSS needed to develop procedures for reliably evaluating student responses within and across countries. Scoring used two-digit codes with rubrics specific to each item. The first digit designates the correctness level of the response. The second digit, combined with the first, represents a diagnostic code identifying specific types of approaches, strategies, or common errors and misconceptions. Although not used in this report, analyses of responses based on the second digit should provide insight into ways to help students better understand mathematics concepts and problem-solving approaches. To ensure reliable scoring procedures based on the TIMSS rubrics, the International Study Center prepared detailed guides containing the rubrics and explanations of how to implement them, together with example student responses for the various rubric categories. These guides, along with training packets containing extensive examples of student responses for practice in applying the rubrics, were used as a basis for intensive training in scoring the constructed-response items. The training sessions were designed to help representatives of national centers who would then be responsible for training personnel in their countries to apply the two-digit codes reliably. To gather and document empirical information about the withincountry agreement among scorers, TIMSS arranged to have systematic samples of at least 100 student responses to each item scored independently by two readers. Exhibit A.10 shows the average and range of the within-country exact percent of agreement between scorers on the constructed-response items in the mathematics test for the TIMSS participants. The exhibit shows agreement for both the correctness score (the first digit) and for the two-digit diagnostic score. A high percentage of exact agreement was observed, with an overall average of 99 percent for correctness score and 97 percent for diagnostic score at both fourth and eighth grades. The TIMSS data from the reliability studies indicate that scoring procedures were robust for the mathematics items, especially for the correctness score used for the analyses in this report. The double scoring of a sample of the student test booklets provided a measure of the consistency within each country with which constructed-response questions were scored. TIMSS 2003 also took steps to show that those constructed-response items from 1999 that were used in 2003 were scored in the same way in both assessments. In anticipation of this, countries that participated in TIMSS 1999 sent samples of scored student booklets from the 1999 eighth-grade data collection to the IEA Data Processing Center, where they were digitally scanned and stored in presentation software for later use. As a check on scoring consistency from 1999 to 2003, staff members working in each country on scoring the 2003 eighth-grade data were asked also to score these 1999 responses using the DPC software. The items from 1995 that were used in TIMSS 2003 all were in multiple-choice format, and therefore scoring reliability was not an issue. As shown in Exhibit A.11, there was a very high degree of scoring consistency, with 98 percent exact agreement, on average, internationally, between the scores awarded in 1999 and those given by the 2003 scorers. There also was very high agreement at the diagnostic score level, with 93 percent exact agreement, on average. To monitor the consistency with which the scoring rubrics were applied across countries, TIMSS collected from the Southern-Hemisphere countries that administered TIMSS in English a sample of 150 student responses to 20 constructed-response mathematics questions. This set of 3,000 student responses was then sent to each "}, {"section_title": "Data Processing", "text": "To ensure the availability of comparable, high-quality data for analysis, TIMSS took rigorous quality control steps to create the international database. 11 TIMSS prepared manuals and software for countries to use in entering their data, so that the information would be in a standardized international format before being forwarded to the IEA Data Processing Center in Hamburg for creation of the international database. Upon arrival at the Data Processing Center, the data underwent an exhaustive cleaning process. This involved several iterative steps and procedures designed to identify, document, and correct deviations from the international instruments, file structures, and coding schemes. The process also emphasized consistency of information within national data sets and appropriate linking among the many student, teacher, and school data files. Throughout the process, the TIMSS 2003 data were checked and double-checked by the IEA Data Processing Center, the International Study Center, and the national centers. The national centers were contacted regularly and given multiple opportunities to review the data for their countries. In conjunction with the IEA Data Processing Center, the International Study Center reviewed item statistics for each cognitive item in each country to identify poorly performing items. On the fourth-grade mathematics test, two items were deleted for all countries. In addition, 7 countries had one or more items deleted (in most cases, one or two). Usually the poor statistics (negative point-biserials for the key, large item-by-country interactions, and statistics indicating lack of fit with the model) were a result of translation, adaptation, or printing deviations. At eighth grade, no mathematics items were deleted for all countries, but 17 countries had one or more items deleted (mostly one or two). Because of a major booklet printing error, more than 40 mathematics items had to be deleted for Ghana, which may have contributed to its low Cronbach's alpha reliability. APPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS 2003 PROCEDURES: MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT"}, {"section_title": "IRT Scaling and Data Analysis", "text": "The general approach to reporting the TIMSS achievement data was based primarily on item response theory (IRT) scaling methods. 12 The mathematics results were summarized using a family of 2-parameter and 3-parameter IRT models for dichotomously-scored items (right or wrong), and generalized partial credit models for items with 0, 1, or 2 available score points. The IRT scaling method produces a score by averaging the responses of each student to the items that he or she took in a way that takes into account the difficulty and discriminating power of each item. The methodology used in TIMSS includes refinements that enable reliable scores to be produced even though individual students responded to relatively small subsets of the total mathematics item pool. Achievement scales were produced for each of the five mathematics content areas (number, algebra, measurement, geometry, and data), as well as for mathematics overall. The IRT methodology was preferred for developing comparable estimates of performance for all students, since students answered different test items depending upon which of the 12 test booklets they received. The IRT analysis provides a common scale on which performance can be compared across countries. In addition to providing a basis for estimating mean achievement, scale scores permit estimates of how students within countries vary and provide information on percentiles of performance. As shown in Exhibit A.5, TIMSS has a complicated booklet design, with blocks of items appearing in different positions in different booklets. For example, the items in block M1 appear as the first block in Booklet 1, as the second block in Booklet 6, and as the third block in Booklet 12. This allows the booklets to be linked together efficiently, but also to monitor and counterbalance any position effect. In TIMSS 2003, the counterbalanced booklet design made it possible to detect an unexpectedly strong position effect in the data as the item statistics for each country were reviewed. More specifically, this position effect occurred APPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS 2003 PROCEDURES: MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT because some students in all countries did not reach all the items in the third block position, which was the end of the first half of each booklet before the break. The same effect was evident for the sixth block position, which was the last block in the booklets. The IRT scaling addressed this problem by treating items in the third and sixth block positions as if they were unique, even though they also appeared in other positions. For example, the mathematics items in block M1 from Booklet 1 (the first position) and from Booklet 6 (second position) were considered to be the same items for scaling and reporting purposes, but those in Booklet 12 (the third position) were scaled as items that were different and unique. The TIMSS mathematics achievement scale was designed to provide a reliable measure of student achievement spanning 1995, 1999, and 2003. The metric of the scale was established originally with the 1995 assessment. When all countries participating in 1995 at the eighth grade are treated equally, the TIMSS scale average over those countries is 500 and the standard deviation is 100. The same applies for the fourth-grade assessment. Since the countries varied in size, each country was weighted to contribute equally to the mean and standard deviation of the scale. The average and standard deviation of the scale scores are arbitrary and do not affect scale interpretation. To preserve the metric of the original 1995 scale, the 1999 eighth-grade assessment was scaled using students from the countries that participated in both 1995 and 1999. Then students from the countries that tested in 1999 but not 1995 were assigned scores on the basis of the scale. At the eighth grade, TIMSS developed the 2003 scale in the same way as in 1999, preserving the metric first with students from countries that participated in both 1999 and 2003, 13 and then assigning scores on the basis of the scale to students tested in 2003 but not the earlier assessment. At fourth grade, because there was no assessment in 1999, the 2003 and 1995 data were linked directly together using students from countries that participated in both assessments, and the students tested in 2003 but not 1995 were assigned scores on the basis of the scale.

There is one important difference in the way TIMSS 2003 reports significance tests compared with the practice in 1995 and 1999. In the previous assessments, significance tests in exhibits where the results of many tests are reported simultaneously were based on a Bonferroni procedure for multiple comparisons. The Bonferroni procedure was not used in TIMSS 2003. The procedure takes into account the number of comparisons being made, which is a function of the number of countries participating. Since this varies from assessment to assessment, the Bonferroni procedure makes it difficult to compare results from one assessment to the next. However, users of the reports should be aware that, following the logic of statistical hypothesis testing, on average, about five percent of statistical tests will be significant by chance alone."}, {"section_title": "Setting International Benchmarks of Student Achievement", "text": "In order to provide meaningful descriptions of what performance on the TIMSS mathematics scale could mean in terms of the mathematics that students know and can do, TIMSS identified four points on the scale for use as international benchmarks. Selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally, the advanced benchmark is 625, the high benchmark is 550, the intermediate benchmark is 475, and the low benchmark is 400. Although the fourth-and eighth-grade scales are different, the same benchmark points are used at both grades. In order to interpret the TIMSS scale scores and analyze achievement at the international benchmarks, TIMSS conducted a scale anchoring analysis to describe achievement of students at those four points on the scale. Scale anchoring is a way of describing students' APPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS 2003 PROCEDURES: MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT performance at different points on a scale in terms of what they know and can do. It involves a statistical component, in which items that discriminate between successive points on the scale are identified, and a judgmental component in which subject-matter experts examine the items and generalize to students' knowledge and understandings. 15"}, {"section_title": "Calculator Use in the TIMSS 2003 Mathematics Assessment", "text": "Because calculators were permitted in TIMSS for the first time in the 2003 assessment at the eighth grade (not the fourth grade), TIMSS placed all the trend items in the first half of the test and only permitted eighth-grade students to use calculators for the second half. Nevertheless, capitalizing on the counterbalanced TIMSS booklet design, one block of mathematics items was included in both the testing session before the break, when calculators were not permitted, and in the session after the break, when they were allowed. This enabled a comparison of the mathematics achievement of those students having a calculator available and those that did not. As shown in Exhibit A.14, calculator usage in the assessment was quite low. On average, internationally, 37 percent of students reported that they did not have a calculator for the test, and a further 47 percent that although they had them, they used them very little (39%) or not at all (8%). Most of the TIMSS mathematics items were designed so that they could be answered readily without the use of a calculator, and consequently having a calculator available may not be a great advantage. However, the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee identified five items in the calculator block for which a calculator should be and was helpful, and Exhibit A.14 presents for each country the average percent correct across these five calculator-sensitive items for students when they had a calculator and when they did not. On average, internationally, performance on the calculator-sensitive items was superior when students had calculators (66% correct with calculator vs 57% correct without a calculator). The difference was significant in almost every country where calculators were used. 15 The scale-anchoring procedure is described fully in Gonzalez, E.J., Galia, J., Arora, A., Erberber, E., and Diaconu, D.
