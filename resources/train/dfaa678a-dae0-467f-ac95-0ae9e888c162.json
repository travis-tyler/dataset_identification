[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Despite population growth and development at the rural-urban interface (RUI), agriculture continues to persist there. This resilience is partially a reflection of land use policies and market support programs designed to protect farm and ranch land that is vulnerable to nonfarm development. Studies examining the RUI primarily focus on the diversity of production and markets and do not discuss the diversity of operators. As the farmland protection and food systems movements continue to refine policy objectives and decide how to allocate scarce resources, it is critical to have up-to-date statistics on the health and vitality of agriculture at the RUI. Using the 2007 Census of Agriculture statistics, we examine (1) the spatial distribution by county of high-value production and marketing practices assumed to play a role in the persistence and vitality of agriculture at the RUI; and (2) the demographic characteristics of farmers in these counties. We find that only some types of highvalue production and marketing systems are more prevalent in metropolitan regions, including horses, nursery-greenhouse, and direct sales, while organic production, recreation sales, CSA farms, and valueadded farms are more likely to be concentrated in nonmetropolitan counties. We also find that farmers at the RUI are extremely diverse and that a substantial number of beginning and women farmers are found in nonmetropolitan counties, along with a small but notable number of African American, Hispanic and Native American farmers."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The rural-urban interface (RUI) is the relatively rural space on the edge of urbanized areas (Audirac, 1999) ; farms and ranches in these geographic areas are highly vulnerable to nonfarm development, yet they continue to thrive and significantly contribute to the U.S. agricultural economy. While RUI counties only represent 20 percent of all U.S. counties, they account for roughly 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural production (Jackson-Smith & Sharp, 2008) , 1 and produce the majority of the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nursery and greenhouse crops (American Farmland Trust [AFT], 2013; JacksonSmith & Sharp, 2008) . Since the 1970s the RUI has often been the focus of local, state and national debates over disappearing farmland, a shrinking farm population, land use policy, and local and regional food systems.\nStarting in the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS) published a series of reports and research studies documenting the complexity of agriculture at the RUI and the significant contributions metro farmers make to U.S. agricultural production. These research papers and reports examined farm size and type and ownership patterns, and aimed to understand the ways in which metro farmers have been able to persist and adapt to nonfarm development pressures (Heimlich & Brooks, 1989; Heimlich & Anderson, 2001) . Recognizing the importance and vulnerability of RUI agriculture, farm advocacy organizations, researchers, and policy-makers used these reports to develop a variety of land-based and market-based strategies designed to support farmers at the RUI ( AFT, 1997; Bryant & Johnston, 1992) . Today, farmland preservation and efforts to promote local and regional food systems as a viable economic livelihood for farmers (e.g., through on-farm valueadded strategies, promoting higher intensity production, etc.) have become mainstream; these efforts are no longer limited to community-or state-level campaigns but are now a part of federal farm policy (AFT, 2013; Clancy & Ruff, 2010; Lyson, 2004; Oberholtzer , Clancy, & Esseks, 2012) .\nAs the farmland protection and food systems movements continue to refine policy objectives and decide how to allocate scarce resources, it is 1 Sharp and Jackson-Smith (2008) represent RUI counties as \"counties with Urban Influence Codes (UIC) 1 through 4 (or 1,267 counties total), as well the a small number of counties in UIC categories 5-7 that experienced population growth above the national average of 13.15 percent between 1990-2000 (255 counties fall into this category). UIC codes are developed by the USDA-ERS and can be accessed online at http://www. ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rurality/urbaninf/\" (p. 10). critical that they have the latest statistics on the health and vitality of RUI agriculture. While there have been recent reports examining more macrolevel statistics that assess the overall production levels of RUI agriculture (Esseks, Oberholtzer, Clancy, Lapping, & Zurbrugg, 2009; Oberholtzer et al., 2012; Jackson-Smith & Sharp , 2008) , there has been little documentation of the specific production and marketing adaptations scholars identified as important for RUI policy and economic investment. For example, Hart (1998) and Heimlich and Anderson (2001) identified and argued that highervalue crops that can be intensively produced on smaller acreages, such as fruit and vegetables, are more likely to persist at the RUI and contribute to the viability and resiliency of agriculture at the RUI (Hart, 1998; Heimlich & Anderson, 2001 ). However, these statistics have not been updated or examined to understand changes in RUI agricultural production patterns.\nIn this paper we build on previous descriptive research to examine the degree to which these high-value production and marketing strategies assumed to thrive at the RUI (horse sales, nursery and greenhouse sales, recreation sales, organic sales, direct sales, community supported agriculture farms [CSAs] , and value-added farms) are in fact doing so. Given the increasing recognition of the diversity of American farmers and ranchers (U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service [USDA, NASS], 2008), we take the analysis one step further to ask who are the farmers in these counties? Beyond types of production at the RUI, little has been documented on the social differences within the farm population itself, yet this can have bearings on policies designed to stabilize the production landscape (Inwood, Clark, & Bean, 2013) . There has been a rich tradition in rural studies examining the link between ethnicity, race, gender, and farm structure. At the community level the number of women in agriculture support groups is increasing, and at the national level the 2008 farm bill required 10 percent of funds be set aside for beginning and/or socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, and/or small and medium-sized farms and ranches (Hardesty, 2010) . However, RUI scholars have largely neglected the relationship of farmer ethnicity, gender, and experience to farm structure and farm persistence.\nTherefore, this paper answers two basic questions: (1) What is the spatial distribution of production and marketing practices assumed to play a role in the persistence and vitality of agriculture at the RUI? and (2) who are the farmers in these counties? We first review the literature examining agriculture at the RUI and farmer diversity, and then present the results of a descriptive analysis of high-value production and marketing systems using 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture data."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Located beyond suburbia, the RUI is a mix of both rural and urban land uses and is socially and economically connected to an urban core (Audirac, 1999; Clark, McChesney, Munroe, & Irwin, 2009 ). The RUI is a complex landscape and is affected by a variety of processes, including both global agrifood systems pressures and stresses from local nonfarm urban-related development. At the local level, direct influences from land competition and rising nonfarm population, and indirect influences such as rising land rents, taxes, and increased regulation create increased constraints on farming (Bryant & Johnston, 1992; Fulton, Pendall, Nguyen, & Harrison, 2001; Heimlich & Anderson, 2001 ). Yet agricultural production at the RUI is substantial; RUI counties account for 78 percent of vegetable production and 91 percent of fruit production in the U.S. (AFT, 2013; Jackson-Smith & Sharp, 2008) .\nAn important theme implicit in many RUI models is the expectation that urban-oriented food and fiber production adaptation strategies (nursery and greenhouse, direct sales, horses, farmers' markets, CSAs, U-pick operations, agri-tourism, organic agriculture, etc.) are likely to emerge and succeed due to their proximity to urban markets (Bowler, 1999; Fennell & Weaver, 1997; Heimlich & Anderson, 2001; Lyson 2004 ). Heimlich and Brooks (1989) found a relationship between farm type and persistence at the RUI and identify three types of RUI farms, including (a) alternative enterprises (small in size with high-value outputs); (b) recreational enterprises (very small scale, operated by hobby farmers); and (c) traditional enterprises (large operations engaged in conventional commodity production). Research focusing on these various types of enterprises suggests that smaller-scale farms with higher-value outputs are the most likely to persist in metropolitan counties (Heimlich & Anderson, 2001; Hoppe & Korb, 2001) . Alternative enterprise types can include consumer-oriented, entrepreneurial activities with an emphasis on direct marketing and value-adding. While there in fact has been a rise in the number of farms oriented toward local and alternative markets (Barbieri & Mahoney, 2009; Inwood & Sharp, 2012; Sparks, 2012) , there has been little recent analysis to understand the spatial distribution of different types of specific urban oriented production and marketing systems across the RUI, particularly in agriculturally vibrant areas."}, {"section_title": "Farmer Diversity at the RUI", "text": "The structure of the farm business is not just a result of market and economic forces, but is shaped through the goals, values, and motivations of the farm family. These goals, values, and motivations are influenced by the demographic characteristics of the farm family (Colman & Elbert, 1984; Gasson, 1973; Gasson & Errington, 1993; Lobley & Potter, 2004; Salamon, 1992; Shucksmith & Herrmann, 2002) . The associations among gender, ethnicity, culture, length of time farming, farm structure, and development have been well documented in the literature (Imbruce, 2007; Sachs, 1996; Salamon, 1992; Wells & Gradwell, 2001 .\nAccounting for these differences is increasingly important considering the USDA, NASS report on the growing ethnic, racial, and gender diversity among U.S. farm and ranch operators, and the national investments being made in distinct subpopulations of farmers through the USDA Begin- "}, {"section_title": "Ethnicity and Race", "text": "The association between ethnicity, culture, farm structure, and development was well documented by Salamon (1992) , who identified a typology of Midwestern farmer types based on farm household ethnicities and their distinct agricultural or land ethics. Wells (1996) also has shown the linkage between ethnicity and farming subsystems in California strawberry production, finding that Japanese, Mexican and Anglo growers brought different sets of resources to their farms' development, and that the different social networks associated with each ethnic group created and reinforced farm management styles over time. Recent research on immigrant farmers from Southeast Asia in the Miami Metro region found that the unique motivations, social networks, and style of farming (intensive and diverse) has enabled these small family farms to thrive by taking advantage of niche markets and national distribution networks despite high land rents (Imbruce, 2007) . The increase in the number of Hispanic, Asian, Native American and African American farmers (USDA, NASS, 2007a) reinforces the need to understand how cultural nuances influence larger production patterns on the RUI landscape."}, {"section_title": "Gender and Sex", "text": "There has been considerable interest in understanding the gendered dimension of farm adaptation and production strategies particularly as it relates to alternative agriculture (Chiappe & Flora, 1998; Feldman & Welsh, 1995; Sachs, 1996; Wells and Gradwell, 2001) . Surveys of the wider female farm population have found women emphasize not only the environmental and economic benefits of sustainable agriculture, but are also more likely to emphasize the link between agriculture and community sustainability and well-being (Chiappe & Flora, 1998; Feldman & Welsh, 1995; Trauger, 2004; Trauger, Sachs, Barbercheck, Kiernan, Brasier, & Findeis, 2008) . Some of these gendered values have been correlated with specific farm structures, including the prevalence of, and preference for, cooperative farm markets, direct marketing, value-adding, and craft development among women operators as opposed to large-scale commodity agriculture activities. These trends are reinforced by McNally (2001) , who found that when women participated in the active management of the farm operation, the probability of observing on-farm retailing and recreation enterprises increased by 12 percent.\nThe research examining gender, race, and ethnicity in relationship to farm structure reveal that each farmer subgroup has a unique history and cultural legacy that influence their goals, motivations, and values, which in turn influence the way they structure their farm and envision their farms' future. These studies demonstrate that the structure of a farm business (wholesale, direct marketing, organic, etc.) is not just the result of economic forces, but also reflects specific values and goals of the farm family. As farm, food, and land policies incorporate the social differences of farmers, it is useful to understand how different subpopulations of farmers are spatially distributed across the RUI and non-RUI landscape."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To document urban-oriented production at the RUI, we first identified RUI counties. Counties in the U.S. were categorized as Metro and Nonmetro using the current U.S. Census definition. Metro counties are used as a proxy for the RUI, as metro counties are composed of central urban cores and include counties that contain rural lands, but have social and economic ties (measured by commuting patterns) to the urban core (Berube & Forman, 2002; Wolman, Galster, Hanson, Ratcliffe, Furdell, & Sarzynski, 2005) . To capture meaningful production at the RUI, counties were then classified as agriculturally important (AI) or non-agriculturally important (NAI), using an approach akin to the parameters described by Jackson-Smith and Jensen (2009). AI counties are in the top three quartiles of U.S. agricultural sales in 2007 and exhibit a healthy agricultural sector. Agricultural sales for NAI counties ranged from US$0 to US$19,379,000 in 2007. AI county sales in 2007 ranged from US$19,386,000 to US$3,730,546,000. As an indicator, AI uses the market value of agricultural product sold and the intensity of production measured via sales per acre of total farmland and cropland. Compared to the ERS farm-dependent county classification, the AI indicator is better able to pick up more intensive uses of farmland and agricultural output regardless of whether a county is large or small, or urban or rural, or if the regional economy is highly specialized or diversified (Jackson-Smith & Jensen, 2009).\nWe then classified counties as Metro-AI, Metro-NAI, Nonmetro-AI, or Nonmetro-NAI to achieve a more refined analysis for examining spatial distributions of specific production practices. We recognize classifying counties as AI or NAI introduces bias into the analysis, as a larger number of sales will automatically come from AI counties. While this bias does exist, the results are not necessarily predetermined. In fact, this classification brings forward subtle nuances that would have been overlooked if the analysis only focused on Metro versus Nonmetro.\nThe number of farms and sales values for horses, nursery and greenhouse, recreational services, organic agriculture, direct marketing, CSAs, and value-added production were obtained for each county (n=3080) in the U.S. from the 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture. Descriptive statistics (totals and percentages) were run to examine the distribution of these variables between the different county types. Due to the relatively small number of farms engaging in some of these activities, sales data was suppressed for some counties. In this paper suppressed sales are treated as missing. Initial analysis revealed the significance of California in organic production and direct sales. To better understand the spatial distribution of organic agriculture and direct sales, California was treated separately in the analysis in some cases. Finally, to understand if there is a spatial dimension to the increasing diversity of American farmers, we examined farmer demographics including race, sex, and beginning farmers. Finally, mapping the variables with GIS illustrates the regional patterns of the statistical findings."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The majority of U.S. counties are Nonmetro counties (65.2 percent) and are non-agriculturally important (73.5 percent) (table 1).

Nationally the horse industry directly contributes US$39 billion into the U.S. economy through feed crops, bedding, breeding, sales, racing, recreation, tourism, and shows (American Horse Council, 2005; Whiting, McCall, & Molnar , 2005) . This analysis found that horse sales are concentrated in metropolitan counties and AI counties (table 3) . Metro counties account for 82.6 percent of horse sales, compared to only 17.4 percent of sales occurring in Nonmetro counties (figure 2).

In addition to the presence of organic commodity production, the high number of organic farms in the Northeast (figure 4) may be reflecting a variety of factors, including the large demand for organic products in the region, the significant role organic price premiums have in supporting dairy farms in the Northeast (Parsons, 2011) , and the strength of the Northeast Organic Food and Farming Association, which over the years has become one of the major stakeholder and technical-assistance nonprofit organizations in the region."}, {"section_title": "Direct Sales", "text": "Both including and excluding California, direct sales occur more frequently in Metro and AI counties.

Direct sales are also primarily being generated in AI counties (89.4 percent including California and 87.8 percent excluding California). It is interesting to note that, excluding California, NAI counties account for 12.2 percent of direct sales; when including California, the amount drops negligibly. California counties represented five of the top 10 farms with direct sales.

We find that despite the threats from nonfarm development, farming at the RUI continues to significantly contribute to the U.S. agricultural economy. The persistence of agriculture at the RUI is a reflection of community and government efforts, land use policies, marketing programs, and decisions and adaptations made by individual farm families. Due to the design of the analysis, a greater number of sales were concentrated in AI counties compared to NAI counties. However, not all types of high-value production and marketing systems assumed to dominate in metropolitan regions were found in Metro-AI counties as one would expect. Horses, nursery and greenhouse, and direct sales were more prevalent in Metro regions, while organic production, recreation sales, CSA farms, and value-added farms were more likely to be concentrated in Nonmetro counties.\nThe analysis demonstrated that certain types of high-value production systems that directly feed into consumer needs and interests, such as horses and nursery and greenhouse, do in fact thrive at the RUI. However, the spatial concentration of these sectors in the RUI is also partially a reflection of their connection to larger regional economies. In the case of horses, the counties with the highest horse sales are also major horse-breeding and horse-racing centers. Parallel to horses, nursery and greenhouse production predominates in areas with a milder climate and longer growing season that supply other nurseries across the country that are in cooler climates with shorter growing seasons.\nThe vast majority of direct sales are in Metro-AI counties. When California is taken out of the analysis, the high number of counties with direct sales in the Northeast demonstrates the role that investments in community-based local food and regional food systems can have. A substantial number of direct sales are in Nonmetro-AI areas, and a small, but present, number are in NAI counties. This finding may reflect the challenge of disaggregating the different types of direct sales the census of agriculture captures under this one variable (Lev & Gwin, 2010) . Lev and Gwin (2010) note that livestock farmers are the majority of direct marketers (58 percent), but only account for 31 percent of direct marketing sales. Following up on Lev and Gwin's (2010) recommendations, as Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development ISSN: 2152-0801 online www.AgDevJournal.com federal policy focuses increasingly on local food systems, it important to evaluate whether more refined data points are needed in order to more accurately measure different types of direct marketing.\nAdditionally, this analysis examined how a state like California, which produces a large volume of high-value crops and has a significant number of RUI counties, can obscure other regional production patterns. Accounting for the effect of California enables RUI researchers to develop a more nuanced policy analysis when examining production and marketing patterns across the country.\nWhile farms just outside cities may be increasing the number of recreational opportunities they offer through agri-tainment initiatives, this analysis revealed that the bulk of recreational sales are coming from counties that have other outdoor recreation activities and scenic amenities, particularly in the West. Future research should examine how recreational sales play into multifunctional agricultural initiatives particularly at the RUI.\nOrganic products command a higher premium price. In this analysis organic sales were more concentrated in Nonmetro (taking out California) and AI counties, most likely reflecting the shift of commodity sectors into organic production. This follows the findings of the 2008 USDA Organic Production Survey, which found that 83 percent of organic sales are to wholesale markets (processors, millers, packers, distributors, wholesalers, brokers or repackers), while 10.6 percent are to direct-toretail and only 6.8 percent of sales are from directto-customer exchanges (farm stands, u-pick, farmers' markets and CSAs) (USDA, NASS, 2008) . Organic agriculture is important for soil health and ecosystem services, and can significantly contribute to farmer income and farm viability, particularly by adding value to commodity crops. However, organic as a production method itself may not be directly contributing to the economic vitality of RUI agriculture compared to broader local and regional food system development initiatives.\nThe RUI is a highly heterogeneous place, both in terms of production and farmer demographics. Currently the majority of RUI policies, programs, and campaigns focus on land policy and market diversity, and do not recognize social differences among farmers. Nor do these efforts recognize how cultural and historical legacies may enhance or complicate many of the initiatives directed towards agriculture at the RUI. As new policies and programs are developed to support different types of farmers, it is important to reflect on how the objectives and intended people-based outcomes match up to where the targeted farmers are located. This analysis demonstrated that farmers at the RUI are extremely diverse. However, it also found there are a substantial number of beginning and women farmers in Nonmetro-AI counties, and a small but notable number of African American, Hispanic and Native American farmers in Nonmetro-NAI counties. These findings reinforce the need for policy-makers and NGOs to analyze how specific initiatives will affect different types of farmers in different locations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The now mainstream interest in economic development through food and agriculture and in local and regional food systems has brought a new focus to both the significance of agricultural at the RUI and to the need for additional investment in these regions. Policy-making is often about resource distribution, and given the limited financial resources available, farm advocacy organizations, researchers, and policy-and grant-makers need baseline data to inform their priorities. This paper informs these debates by documenting current production and marketing systems assumed to thrive in agriculturally important RUI counties. We find that urban and consumer-oriented production and marketing systems are not just metro phenomena, but in fact are more prevalent in nonmetropolitan regions as in the case of organic agriculture and recreational sales. These findings, in combination with the regional distribution of nursery and greenhouse and horse sales, demonstrate that policy-makers need to take regional economies, climate, and distribution networks into account when establishing investment priorities. Future research should expand these initial observations to more closely examine the regional dimension to these production and marketing systems.\nThis paper also provides new information on the spatial distribution of operator demographics -an issue that has largely been overlooked by RUI scholars. Producers at the RUI are highly diverse, but regional differences do exist. There is a rich tradition in rural studies documenting the extent to which gender, sex, culture, and ethnicity play a role in farmer decision-making and farm structure. This analysis provides initial data on operator demographics at the RUI; additional research is needed to explore the intersection between operators' social and cultural factors and farm persistence and growth at the RUI. The degree to which investments made in production and marketing systems at the RUI are successful is tempered by the extent to which we recognize and incorporate the unique history and technical assistance needs of different types of operators. The next generation of RUI policy and research should build on its historic focus of land use and markets to now include people."}]
