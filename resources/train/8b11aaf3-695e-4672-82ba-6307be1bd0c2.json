[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health threat; however, despite decades of research, the disease mechanisms are not completely understood, and there is a significant dearth of predictive biomarkers. The availability of systems biology approaches has opened new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms at a pathway level. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has characterized the nature of pathway crosstalks in AD, or examined their utility as biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis. In this paper, we build the first computational crosstalk model of AD incorporating genetics, antecedent knowledge, and biomarkers from a national study to create a generic pathway crosstalk reference map and to characterize the nature of genetic and protein pathway crosstalks in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. We perform initial studies of the utility of incorporating these crosstalks as biomarkers for assessing the risk of MCI progression to AD dementia. Our analysis identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-enriched pathways representing six of the seven Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway categories. Integrating pathway crosstalks as a predictor improved the accuracy by 11.7% compared to standard clinical parameters and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status alone. Our findings highlight the importance of moving beyond discrete biomarkers to studying interactions among complex biological pathways."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is common knowledge that the prognostics of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of national importance. AD alone affects about 10% of the population over 65 years old [1, 2] , and is among the leading causes of death in patients over 75 years of age in the U.S. [3] . There is evidence suggesting that the progression to AD dementia begins years before it is clinically determined and is preceded by a phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), during which AD-related treatments are likely to be more effective. Thus, it is important to discover the mechanisms underlying risk of AD and to develop accurate biomarkers that reflect the complexity of the disease at an individual level. Although a number of biomarkers are currently being evaluated for use to predict AD or study disease progression (e.g., tau, p-tau181P, \u03b2-amyloid1- 42 , apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54), and microRNAs) [4] [5] [6] [7] , none of these markers are yet fully validated or approved for predicting the risk of AD. Indeed, AD is no longer seen as a disease of single discrete lesions, but as a perturbation of altered cortical networks by pathological processes in interlinked pathways. Hence, the application of systems biology methods to the discovery and characterization of novel biomarkers [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] has taken on greater promise and urgency.\nThe cellular mechanisms underlying many neurological disorders are complex, with crosstalks between multiple molecular pathways likely contributing to disease initiation and progression. In living organisms, pathways are said to crosstalk if they are linked together to perform biological functions as a system. Crosstalks can also be defined as interactions between signal transduction pathways, and usually take the form of protein or transmembrane interactions. A number of potential crosstalks have been noted in vitro in AD, such as those between amyloid and tau pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, the p53 signaling pathway, and apoptosis [21] [22] [23] . Another example is the reported crosstalk among MAPK, insulin, and calcium signaling pathways [24] . There is also evidence of crosstalk among pathways involved in the regulation of glycolysis metabolism, pathways involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and apoptosis [24] . The latter crosstalk is also associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [24] . Furthermore, the cellular signaling pathways in AD have been reported, such as Wnt signaling, 5 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, Sirtuin 1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-\u03b1, and possible crosstalk between these pathways has been discussed [25] . For a review of multiple interacting pathways in neurodegenerative disease, see [26] . In clinical AD research studies of diagnosis or prognosis, biomarkers are typically treated as discrete entities, in part because biological pathway crosstalks between genes or proteins have not yet been fully characterized at a systems biology level in AD.\nFrom the computational methodology standpoint, the study of pathway crosstalks is still in its infancy. Existing methods predict crosstalks between known metabolic pathways using chemical protein interaction networks [24, [27] [28] [29] . However, these computational methods do not take advantage of the different chemical evidence available, such as direct binding, the biochemical evidence, such as phosphorylation, and the functional evidence, such as transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the discovery, characterization, and utilization of pathway crosstalks as biomarkers for disease prognosis has not been investigated.\nHere, we use clinical, cognitive, and genetic data from a national cohort study, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), along with a systematic computational methodology to discover and characterize biological pathway crosstalks in subjects with MCI. We further examine the utility of these novel biomarkers to discriminate stable MCI from those who progress to AD dementia. The first part of the methodology (Figure 1 ), focuses on utilizing several existing evidence, such as chemical interaction, genetic interaction, domain interaction, and transcription factors, to identify potential pathway crosstalks. In the second part (Figure 2 ), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are used to find patient-specific pathway crosstalks as biomarkers. In the third part, we build and test initial prognostic models that use pathway crosstalks as biomarkers to predict patient progression from MCI progression to AD dementia (see Results). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such systematic characterization of biological pathway crosstalk biomarkers associated with the risk of AD.\nPolymorphisms (SNPs) are used to find patient-specific pathway crosstalks as biomarkers.

To have a more robust pathway crosstalk map, we incorporate a wide array of evidence. The scores from each of these evidence are then combined to build one generic pathway crosstalk reference map analogous to the \"Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\" (KEGG) pathway reference map.\nThe likelihood of a pathway pair crosstalking can be scored by utilizing one of two different methods. The first method is based on the presence of common elements, such as kinases and enzymes. The second method is based on the presence of interacting elements, such as chemically interacting proteins.

This essentially states that if there is a genetic interaction between pathways, one pathway covers for the defects in the other pathway.\nProtein domain: Protein function is closely related to fundamental units of protein structure called \"domains\". In the domain interaction network, a pair of proteins has an edge if they are associated with the same set of protein domains.

The QFAST methodology uses the product of the individual p-values as a test statistic to calculate the combined p-value; using the product of p-values as a test statistic has been shown to be a desirable method for information fusion [34] . One issue to consider is that some pathway pairs may not be scored by some of the evidence due to missing data. For those cases, we assign a p-value of 1 to denote that the particular evidence offers no information about those pathways crosstalking. The QFAST formula to calculate the combined p-value is Equation (3):\nwhere P i is the p-value obtained for evidence i, and n is the number of evidence.

Figure 3 depicts the distribution of SNP-enriched pathways amongst the six KEGG categories. The majority of enriched pathways are classified under Human Diseases (31%). This supports the well-established relationships between AD and multiple other cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, diabetes, obesity, and heart diseases are well-established risk factors of AD, so much so that AD has been referred to as type 3 diabetes. As such, finding SNP-enriched pathways for cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic diseases in individuals with MCI is anticipated [53] .\nSimilarly, the enrichment of metabolic pathways, organismal systems including nervous and immune system pathways, and common signaling pathways of the environmental information processing category is also expected and well-supported in the literature [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . Interestingly, several genetic information processing pathways, including cell cycle regulation and DNA replication and repair, were found to be enriched. Evidence for the roles of these pathways in AD has only recently begun to surface [69] [70] [71] .

However, given that the etiology of many diseases, including AD, is complex and likely involves the failure/dysregulation of many pathways that are involved in the normal functioning of multiple organ systems, such significant crosstalk between these two categories among MCI individuals is not unexpected.

As expected, our randomly generated pathway crosstalks shows worse performance than significant pathway crosstalks. The model accuracy is still moderately above a random guessing model, likely due to the presence of the clinical parameters. A similar trend was seen when investigating models with baseline clinical parameters and all AD biomarkers to determine the effects of randomized pathways.\nIn this work, we focus on the development of a novel computational methodology for the discovery of pathway crosstalks to be used as biomarkers for the prognosis of AD. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, we compared it with methods and results from prior studies in this area, which used ADNI-1 data. Although there is more recent data available, ADNI-1 data was used so that we could benchmark our methodology against these prior studies. In future work, we will continue our characterization efforts by incorporating the newer ADNI datasets as well as increasing the sensitivity of the proposed methodology through the use of the additive genetic model for the identification of patient-specific SNPs. There are also some limitations to our study. The ADNI is not a population-based study; it is essentially a biomarker cohort at research sites and our sample size was relatively small: we relied on a sample that was previously studied, since our initial goal was to examine the additive value of crosstalk biomarkers. We also did not incorporate other biomarkers such as tau, p-tau181P, \u03b2-amyloid1-42, APOE \u03b54, and microRNAs at this time, since our main focus was on methodological development for discovering and characterizing pathway crosstalks. However, the ADNI results have formed the basis for many current clinical prevention drug trials, and hence the ADNI is a highly relevant dataset. Moreover, its careful selection criteria and the way it makes available rich biomarker and genetic data and longitudinal cognitive data are enormous strengths. Indeed, the study of pathway crosstalks may yield novel insights into how AD pathological (e.g., beta-amyloid, tau) and neuronal loss (e.g., apoptosis, atrophy) mechanisms interact, and our methods lay the foundation for such future work.\nThe generic pathway crosstalk reference map was built using several different datasets, and hence the question arises as to whether all datasets should be treated equally. For simplicity, in this study, we treated all datasets equivalently. However, a modification to our information fusion method would allow us to introduce parameters to weigh evidence differently based on expert knowledge or trustworthiness. In the future, we would like to perform additional experiments to see the effects of these parameters on disease AD prognosis. This is non-trivial, as we would first need to define a weighting scheme and then develop additional methods to gauge the weights for different evidence."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "AD is a major public health challenge, and there remain substantial gaps in our knowledge of its biology and treatment targets. Fully characterizing AD at a systems biology level is a priority for these reasons. In this work, we demonstrate a new methodology to build a pathway crosstalk reference map using the combined power of several gene and protein knowledge antecedents, and use this to make AD-specific discovery pathway crosstalks by enrichment with patient-specific SNP information. Our pilot data documents the promise of utilizing those SNP-enriched pathway crosstalks to identify potential AD-linked mechanisms at a systems level. More specifically, we demonstrate a three-step methodology to build a generic pathway crosstalk reference map by combining several protein/gene evidence. We then used the identified pathway crosstalks from this map as potential AD biomarkers by enriching them with patient-specific SNP information. In an initial sample of at risk subjects, we found that utilizing SNP-enriched pathway crosstalks as additional features significantly improved the prediction accuracy of MCI progression to AD dementia progression.\nIn addition, we verified some previously identified pathways and identified some new pathway crosstalks that warrant further study. Furthermore, we built the prediction model including the identified pathways and crosstalks, and compared our model's outputs with a previous study. These prediction model comparison analyses show that the identified pathways and crosstalks can be used as significant biomarkers of MCI progression to AD dementia progression prediction with other clinical information. Additional analysis would be required to understand the biological mechanisms that explain the association of these pathways to AD.\nIn summary, this is the first report to our knowledge that characterizes biological crosstalk pathways in subjects at risk of AD using gene and protein knowledge antecedents and studies their potential utility as prognostic biomarkers. Further application of this methodology to the full ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 cohort as well as to other population studies is warranted, and may yield further insights into disease mechanisms as well as novel targets for biomarker development and drug discovery."}]
