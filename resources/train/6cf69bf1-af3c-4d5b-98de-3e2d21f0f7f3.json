Coastal environments are expected to be one of the ecosystems most severely impacted due to climate change effects on water level and weather events (Ashton et al., 2008;Bender et al., 2010;Harvey and Nicholas, 2008). Sea level rise combined with an increase in precipitation and extreme weather events is not only a potential danger for natural coastal environments, causing habitat destruction and a high level of erosion, but also for transportation infrastructure (CSIRO, 2007). Destructive consequences for manmade structures could include the flooding of tunnels, streets and urban areas within drainage basins as well as the washing out of bridges and roads along the shoreline. Oceanographers, coastal engineers and adaptation specialists use numerous hydrodynamic models to predict future flooding under sea level rise with or without considering a storm surge component. Some of the well-known models are: Delft3D (Vatvani et al., 2012), ADCIRC (Westerink et al., 2008), FVCOM (Yoon et al., 2014), MIKE (Sto. Domingo et al., 2010), andSLOSH (Murdukayeva et al., 2013). The alternative to hydrodynamic models is Geographical Information System (GIS) based models like HAZUS, developed and currently used by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). GIS models exclusively focus on spatial analysis and estimate vulnerable areas by considering the land elevation with respect to the sea level rise scenario chosen. This method of vulnerability assessment is also known as the 'bathtub approach' and has been used in multiple previous studies (Kont et al., 2008;van De Sande et al., 2012;McInnes et al., 2013). The advantage of this approach is the rapid identification of potential flooding hazards for a large area without requiring a long modeling process. However, in terms of accuracy, the lack of consideration for the flow dynamics process makes the GIS models over-estimate flooding with respect to hydrodynamic modeling (Seenath et al., 2015). The importance of reliable and easily accessible vulnerability studies on flooding driven by climate change is gaining more and more consideration for emergency coastal planning decisions (Bhaskaran et al., 2014). Climate change impacts will differ according to the region considered. As an example, the U.S. Atlantic coast is affected by a higher than average sea level rise due to variations given by glacial isotactic adjustments and oceanographic processes (Sallenger et al., 2012). Considering sea level rise based on the local scale justifies the creation of a new term: relative sea level rise. Along the U.S. Atlantic coast and the rest of the United States of America, the most impacted areas by relative sea level can be identified as Florida, Louisiana and the entire region between Massachusetts and Virginia (Engelhart et al., 2011). The Hampton Roads (Fig. 1) region in Virginia is a low-lying coastal area in the Southeast Chesapeake Bay. It is a metropolitan region located at the confluence of the James, Elizabeth, and Nansemond Rivers and is comprised of ten cities with a total population of 1.7 million. The Port of Virginia, located in Hampton Roads, is the second largest port on the East Coast. Norfolk, which also falls within the Hampton Roads area, is home to the largest naval base in the world (Kleinosky et al., 2007). The region has the second highest relative SLR in the U.S. (~7 mm/yr) behind New Orleans (Boon et al., 2010). Several factors including crustal warping, sediment compaction and groundwater withdrawal as well as the dynamics of the Gulf Stream contribute to this high rate of relative SLR. The transportation infrastructure in the Hampton Roads region is considerably susceptible to recurrent flooding due to the combined effects of precipitation and high tides, and SLR has exacerbated flooding in the region. A recent study shows that the region is experiencing an accelerated rate of minor flooding, and the transportation infrastructure in the region is increasingly subject to disruptions due to flooding events (Ezer and Atkinson, 2014). The effect of SLR on the coastal region is dynamic and includes an increase in storm surge flooding, wetland migration, and shoreline erosion (Passeri et al., 2015). It has been shown that the response of storm surge to increased sea level is nonlinear (Atkinson et al., 2013), thus flooding estimates accounting for SLR may vary by location following a dynamic process. This is due to the complex physics of the interactions between storm surge, tides, waves, and the overland flow as well as their interactions with the natural and urbanized landscape. In this context, the primary objective of my thesis will be to develop a hydrodynamic model to conduct a vulnerability analysis of flood-prone bridges in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. The bridges will be selected based on ground elevation and traffic flow. This thesis expands the earlier investigation by Castrucci and Tahvildari (2017) (Cialone et al., 2015). Loftis et al. (2016) used the subgrid-modeling approach (Neelz and Pender, 2007) to simulate the precipitation-and storm surge-driven flooding at NASA Langley Research Center. The approach allows for nesting high-resolution LiDAR elevation data in a lower resolution computational grid of the hydrodynamic model. They showed that flooding estimation improves by accounting for infiltration using land use data. The hydrodynamic model used in the study is the UnTRIM2 model (Casulli and Stelling, 2011). In a recent study, Sadler et al. 2017 This value increased to over 15% of major roads with a 99% tide (2.6 m) and to over 65% of major roads with the addition of a 100-year storm surge (4.5 m). The study uses the \"bathtub\" approach to add storm surge estimates to SLR projections. Consequently, earlier flooding studies have either used the \"bathtub\" approach (e.g. Sadler et al., 2017) or have used hydrodynamic models to focus on a small study area (Li et al., 2012;Loftis et al., 2016)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY", "text": "The hydrodynamic model of the region was developed based on the Delft3D model.

Sadler et al. 2017classified roads with an elevation lower than 3 meters as vulnerable to flooding since this threshold represents a feasible high tide water surface elevation in 2100 (Sadler et al., 2017). For the assessment of bridge vulnerability to direct storm surge flooding, a higher threshold (3.5 meters) was chosen as a potential vulnerable elevation.

The governing three-dimensional equations describing the water surface can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, and they account for the physical principle of conservation of volume, mass and momentum:  The three above equations describe the water level in shallow water conditions, assuming the vertical acceleration is smaller than the horizontal acceleration; thus, the vertical momentum equation is reduced to the hydrostatic pressure relation.

It is noted that in a domain with a variety of grid sizes, the simulation time step is governed by the smallest cell. Therefore, an efficient way to run the simulations using structured grids is to define multiple models with different domain extents that have nearly uniform grid cell sizes. In this approach, known as model nesting, the model with a lower resolution and a larger domain provides the boundary condition for a smaller nested model with a domain within the larger grid. It is noted that to produce high resolution output, meteorological forcing and boundary conditions must be provided to the model at high resolutions. In order to have a compromise between computational time and input/output resolution, the model was developed in three nested levels. The grid for the first level of nesting covers the largest domain and has the lowest resolution (Fig. 3). This grid is equidistant such that the distance between the center of each cell is the same. The cell size in this grid is 125\u00d7200 m 2 . Upon validation with the data, the output of Model 1 along with the data on James River discharge will serve as the boundary conditions for the model in the second level of nesting. The grid in this model covers a smaller domain within the first grid ( Fig. 4). It has a higher resolution with the cell size of around 30 ~ 90 \u00d7 30 ~ 90 m 2 .

The high resolution LiDAR Virginia topographic data developed by Dewberry was used for Model 3. In Models 1 and 2, which have larger domains, we used the freely available highest resolution bathymetric and topographic data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Table 2 summarizes the sources of the topographic/bathymetric data used in the study as well as the spatial resolution of each dataset. The elevation data from different sources did not have the same datum and coordinate system and as such, they were converted to a common coordinate system and vertical datum. While the bathymetric and topographic had the same resolution in Models 1 and 2, their horizontal resolution differed in Model 3 (topography: 0.76 m, bathymetry: 10 m). Therefore, it was necessary to adapt and merge the datasets using ArcGIS prior to adequately formatting the data for the Delft3D model using Delft3D-QUICKIN triangular interpolation.  Q1 and M4). The amplitudes and the phases of these harmonics were interpolated using the values from the TPXO global tide model (Egbert et al., 2002). The tide model has a 1/30\u00b0 resolution at the U.S. East Coast. Using Matlab, the tidal information was extracted at the Model 1 boundary; the location near the coastline helped Delft3D to adequately reproduce the tidal propagation in shallow water.

The reason why the action density spectrum ( , ) rather than the energy density spectrum ( , ) is considered relates to the presence of currents, in which action density is conserved whereas energy density is not. The evolution of the wave spectrum in the geographical space x with time t is described by the spectral action balance equation which for Cartesian coordinates is (e.g., Hasselmann et al., 1973): Equation 5 induced refraction with propagation velocity -space).

As seen in Fig. 7(a), Model 1 results for Hurricane Irene and the tidal elevations prior to the storm compared well with the buoy data. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.156 m. The only notable discrepancy occured at two tidal cycles prior to the storm peak. According to NOAA, Hurricane Irene's radius was hard to estimate due to the larger than normal size dimension of the cyclone and the absence of a particularly intense inner core during August 26-27 (Lixion et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the model was able to capture water levels at the storm peak very well. Model 2 was validated using the Sewells Point tide gauge. As seen in Fig. 7(b), the model results for tidal elevation and the storm surge compared well with the data. The RMSE was 0.155 m. The slight discrepancy observed at the peak may be attributed to the inadequacy in representation of the shallow bathymetry in the model. At the time of this thesis, no tide gauges data were available in the domains of Model 3; hence, the tide and storm surge validation of Model 3 were not possible.

All eight flood-prone bridges were selected because they were vulnerable to direct storm surge inundation. The difference between direct and indirect vulnerability was related to the drainage capacity provided in the considered location. The combination of high water due to storm surge and high tide submerge the outlets and cause the stormwater to back up in the drainage system and prevent the stormwater infrastructure from functioning properly. This effect creates or contributes to flooding even in areas not directly inundated by storm surge. Three SLR projections presented in a recent NOAA report (Sweet et al, 2017) were considered. This report added an extreme flooding scenario to earlier projections. The selected projections were based on the intermediate-low (IL), intermediate-high (IH), and extreme SLR scenarios. Table 3 summarizes these estimates for 2050 and 2100, the two time frames considered in this study. It should be noted that the study can readily be extended to other SLR estimates. The effect of SLR was added to the model by increasing the water level to the desired values at the boundaries of Model 1 and allowed enough time for the sea level change to propagate throughout the domain. This would change the boundary conditions for Models 2 and 3. In addition to flooding depth, the hydrodynamic model allowed for estimation of the flood duration at observation points placed during the model set up.  9. Sea Level rise scenario from NOAA Technical Report NOS COOPS083 (Sweet, 2017). The first flood-prone bridge studied was on US 58 Brambleton Ave. In Fig. 10, the extent of storm surge flooding driven by Hurricane Irene (2011) in the Hague area is depicted under correct sea level conditions and for selected SLR scenarios for 2050 and 2100. Highlighted as green, flooded under current sea level, the west side of the bridge was particularly vulnerable. (b) All the values present in the plots of Fig. 10 provide the measurements for flood duration and intensity; Tables 4 and 5 respectively report the data for all locations. In estimating the flood duration, the location was assumed to be flooded once the total water level (storm surge + tide + SLR) was higher than the elevation of the point. It should be noted that the hydrodynamic model did not account for drainage, infiltration, or evaporation; hence, if the water created a pond at a low-lying spot after the storm surge receded, the water level would remain at a constant non-zero value at that location. Therefore, the flooding was considered to be completed once the water level subsided and reached a value constant with time, even if the value was not zero. Observation points for flooding intensity and duration were inputted during the model set up at roads that provide access to the bridges. Flooding maps obtained through Model 2 and 3 differ in terms of accuracy due to the refinement level of the hydrodynamic grid. While a grid resolution of 2.5-3.5 \u00d7 2.5-3.5 m 2 can better capture topography and, thus, flooding for small neighborhood roads, a resolution of 9-10 \u00d7 9-10 m 2 revealed to be sufficient to reproduce the large access road elevations. (f) (e) James River was the second critical spot studied. Due to its length, the bridge could not be included in only one Model 3 domain, it had to be separated into two hydrodynamic models. Fig. 11 shows the extent of the flooding on both sides; the results indicate that the entry road located in Isle of Wight was the more vulnerable side of the bridge.  Shore Dr. was the more exposed bridge included in this study. Compared to the rest of the bridges, which are located in more sheltered areas around rivers banks, Shore Dr. connects two sides of an inlet which grants access for navigation in the Chesapeake Bay. Fig. 13 illustrates the vulnerability of this location, particularly on the west side.

Fig. 17 shows how the bathtub model significantly overestimated the extent of the flooding in streets farther from the waterfront, which would be clear based on the hydrodynamic model. Estimates from the \"bathtub\" approach have been done using the Delft3D model developed for this thesis. It is important to note how using the same model for both approaches gave the results a common base for comparison. Furthermore, Delft3D-FLOW engine accounted for hydraulic connectivity; therefore, only areas with lower elevation than the projected sea level and hydraulically connected to the waterfront got flooded.     Under the same water level condition, the results of the hydrodynamic model for the Hague neighborhood were compared to the widely used \"bathtub\" approach in a GIS model. The results indicate that the \"bathtub\" approach significantly overestimated the extent of the flooding in the selected area. This highlights the importance of the hydrodynamic analysis to estimate the storm surge. The Delft3D modeling suite has several modules that can be used to extend the present study beyond hydrodynamic analysis of storm surge. The present study does not take into account the effect of waves, and storm water runoff, which can potentially affect the results. The results of this study on the extent, intensity, and duration of flooding under different SLR projections would enable more accurate design and implementation of flood mitigation measures, such as seawalls or storm water infrastructure, and can inform planning and management of traffic flow in the transportation network in the region."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 6 RECOMMENDATION", "text": "The present study can be improved in several ways. Comparison between model results and data shows that the model can satisfactorily predict water level in the Chesapeake Bay during tidal cycles and extreme weather conditions caused by Irene-like storms. At the time of this thesis, no tide gauges were available within the Model 3 domains; therefore, no proper validation was possible for the I-64 WB/EB, US 17, VA 337, US 58 Brambleton Ave and James River Bridge locations. The main source of error for Model 3 may be introduced by the vicinity of the domain boundaries, which can cause a negative interaction between the boundary conditions. The City of Norfolk has recently installed a tide gauge in the Hague area that could be used to validate level 3 models in the future. The accuracy of model predictions for flooding over land is also not clear as there was no such data available for comparison at the time of this study. It would be recommended to measure water level over land during storm events and compare the model with such data. In addition, the Delft3D model estimates flow variables solving shallow water equations, which neglects the vertical acceleration component. In a flooded environment, the vertical acceleration component generated by the water flowing around submerged urban structures may become significant and no longer negligible. Furthermore, the effects of waves are not included in the model. Although the results from Model 1 at CBBT suggests that the impact of waves on storm surge may not be significant, they may provide a small contribution to the flooding extension in land. The flooding maps have a sensitivity between wet and dry of 10 cm; therefore, only areas with an equal or larger value compared to this threshold are considered as flooded by Delft3D. In addition to increased flooding risk, SLR can result in changes in morphology through erosion and a general shoreward shifting of swallow water coastal processes, such as breaking waves and currents. SLR effects on the shoreline can be simulated using the sediment transport and morphological module in the Delft3D modeling suite. These impacts of SLR were beyond the scope of this thesis but can be the subject of a future study. Although the present study focuses mainly on bridges, the developed model can be applied to other sensible spots located in coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and SLR or, on a larger scale, even include the entire transportation network in Hampton Roads, albeit in lower spatial resolution. This approach can enable us to identify the locations in Hampton Roads that are vulnerable to storm surge and SLR. "}, {"section_title": "VITA", "text": ""}]
