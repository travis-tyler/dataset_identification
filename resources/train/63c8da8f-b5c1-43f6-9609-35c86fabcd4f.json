[{"section_title": "", "text": "Temporally inconsistent and potentially unreliable global historical data hinder the detection of trends in tropical cyclone activity [1] [2] [3] . This limits our confidence in evaluating proposed linkages between observed trends in tropical cyclones and in the environment 4, 5 . Here we mitigate this difficulty by focusing on a metric that is comparatively insensitive to past data uncertainty, and identify a pronounced poleward migration in the average latitude at which tropical cyclones have achieved their lifetime-maximum intensity over the past 30 years. The poleward trends are evident in the global historical data in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres, with rates of 53 and 62 kilometres per decade, respectively, and are statistically significant. When considered together, the trends in each hemisphere depict a globalaverage migration of tropical cyclone activity away from the tropics at a rate of about one degree of latitude per decade, which lies within the range of estimates of the observed expansion of the tropics over the same period 6 . The global migration remains evident and statistically significant under a formal data homogenization procedure 3 , and is unlikely to be a data artefact. The migration away from the tropics is apparently linked to marked changes in the mean meridional structure of environmental vertical wind shear and potential intensity, and can plausibly be linked to tropical expansion, which is thought to have anthropogenic contributions 6 . Inconsistencies in the historical global 'best-track' data can introduce substantial uncertainty into global-mean measures of tropical cyclone activity. Since the introduction of geostationary weather satellites in the mid to late 1970s, measures of tropical cyclone frequency are generally considered to be accurate, and there is no observed trend in global frequency since that time 7, 8 . Comparatively, measures of tropical cyclone intensity are considered to be highly uncertain in the global data 3, 9 . Consequently, storm duration is also uncertain because identifying the moment when a cyclone forms (cyclogenesis) requires accuracy in intensity estimates, as the definition of cyclogenesis is entirely dependent on a nascent storm's intensity reaching a formally specified threshold. Similar uncertainty exists in identifying a cyclone's demise (cyclolysis). These uncertainties can project onto metrics such as power dissipation 10 and accumulated cyclone energy 11 , which are amalgamations of frequency, duration and intensity.\nBut measurements of a storm's position taken around the time that it reaches its lifetime-maximum intensity (LMI) are much less uncertain. By this time in a storm's evolution, it is more likely to have been detected and to be under close observation. Measurements of storm position at the time of LMI are also less sensitive to inaccuracy in measurements of intensity, as well as to known interregional differences in wind-averaging techniques 9 , because determining the absolute LMI is not critical-it is necessary only to know that the intensity has peaked. This also makes measurements of storm position at the time of LMI comparatively insensitive to temporal heterogeneity in the historical best-track intensity record 3 . It is this heterogeneity that has presented substantial challenges to trend detection in tropical cyclone metrics that require absolute measures of intensity 5 .\nHere we consider the 31-yr period 1982-2012. In this period, the global best-track data are considered most complete and at their highest quality in each basin 9 , and storm position is well monitored globally by geostationary satellites. This period also encompasses a recent satellite-based global tropical cyclone intensity reanalysis 3 , and is the interval over which the atmospheric reanalysis products [12] [13] [14] that provide information on the environmental changes that affect tropical cyclones are most reliable.\nWhen the annual-mean latitude of LMI is calculated from the besttrack data in the Northern and Southern hemispheres over this period (Fig. 1a, b , red lines), there are clear and statistically significant poleward trends in both hemispheres of 53 and 62 km per decade, respectively (Table 1 ). The positive contribution to these hemispheric trends from each ocean basin except that of the North Indian Ocean (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 ) suggests that the migration away from the tropics is a global phenomenon, although there are large regional differences in the trend amplitudes and their statistical power. These differences are probably due, in part, to regional differences in interannual to multidecadal variability 15 . The largest contribution to the Northern Hemisphere trend is from the western North Pacific Ocean, which is also the most active basin in terms of annual tropical cyclone frequency. By contrast, the North Indian Ocean has the lowest mean annual frequency, and the small equatorward trend there has a much lesser effect on the hemispheric trend. The North Atlantic Ocean and eastern North Pacific exhibit small poleward trends and also contribute little to the hemispheric trend. In the Southern Hemisphere, both the South Pacific and the South Indian Ocean regions contribute substantially to the poleward trend.\nWithin the period 1982-2009, the latitude of LMI can be reanalysed using a globally homogenized record of intensity (ADT-HURSAT 3 ). When this is done, the annual-mean time series exhibit similar variability and trends (Fig. 1a, b , blue lines), although the ADT-HURSAT-based trend has a greater amplitude than the best-track-based trend in the Northern Hemisphere and a lesser amplitude than the best-track-based trend in the Southern Hemisphere (Table 1) , where the trend is no longer significant with 95% confidence. However, when both hemispheres are considered together they depict a global migration away from the deep tropics, and the best-track and ADT-HURSAT data exhibit similar poleward trends of 115 and 118 km per decade, respectively (Table 1) . In this global view, the trends in the best-track and ADT-HURSAT data are consistent and both are statistically significant.\nAs found with the best-track data, the ADT-HURSAT-based time series exhibit large differences in trend amplitudes and statistical power when separated by ocean basin (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). The western North Pacific is the largest contributor to the trend in the Northern Hemisphere, and the eastern North Pacific also contributes significantly, unlike the best-track data from that region. The equatorward trend in the North Indian Ocean best-track data is not found in the ADT-HURSAT data, which shows essentially no trend in that region (the lack of any poleward trend in the North Indian Ocean might be expected given the confines of the basin and the close proximity of land to the north). In the North Atlantic, the best-track and ADT-HURSAT data sets both show essentially no trend. There are similar poleward trends in the best-track and ADT-HURSAT data from the South Pacific, but the ADT-HURSAT data in the South Indian Ocean exhibits a smaller, statistically insignificant trend.\nAlthough regional differences are evident, the migration of the mean latitude of LMI away from the deep tropics is observed in both hemispheres, which indicates that this is a global phenomenon. The genesis and subsequent intensification period of tropical cyclones, which precedes LMI and controls when and where LMI occurs, is strongly modulated by the environment that the storms move through in this period. Known major factors controlling tropical cyclone evolution are the environmental vertical wind shear and the potential intensity [16] [17] [18] . Potential intensity describes the thermodynamically based maximum tropical cyclone intensity that the environment will support, all other factors being optimal. Vertical wind shear is one of the key factors that inhibit a storm from achieving this maximum. Greater shear and lesser potential intensity each inhibits genesis and intensification, and vice versa, and increased shear in the deep tropics, decreased shear at higher latitudes, or both, can thus be plausibly linked to a poleward migration of the latitude of LMI. Decreased potential intensity in the deep tropics, increased potential intensity at higher latitudes, or both, could be expected to result in a similar migration. Here we explore these environmental factors using three different atmospheric reanalysis products, NCEP/NCAR 12 , ERAInterim 13 and MERRA 14 . All three products exhibit broad regions of increased shear in the deep tropics and decreased shear in the subtropics (Fig. 2) , which is consistent with the observed changes in the tropical cyclones. The changes in mean potential intensity are not as consistent among the different reanalysis products, particularly in the tropics, which is probably a result of spurious differences in upper tropospheric temperatures 19, 20 . However, the meridional structure of potential intensity change is generally consistent in showing greater increases at higher latitudes, and the MERRA data, in particular, also show a broad reduction of potential intensity in the deep tropics.\nThe observed changes in shear and potential intensity provide evidence that the global migration of tropical cyclones away from the tropics is being modulated by systematic environmental changes. Shifts in tropical cyclone tracks in most regions have also been linked to phase changes in El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation [21] [22] [23] [24] (ENSO), which can potentially contribute to the poleward trends in LMI identified here. To test this, we decrease the contribution of ENSO by regressing the LMI latitude time series onto an index of ENSO variability. When this is done (Fig. 3) , the amplitude of the interhemispheric migration rates is found to decrease only slightly in both the best-track and the ADT-HURSAT data, and the statistical power of the trends in fact increases. This makes it unlikely that natural ENSO variability has a role in the observed multidecadal poleward migration of LMI, although it plays a substantial part in its interannual variability.\nThe potential for contributions from natural variability occurring on decadal or longer timescales still exists, but quantifying this is difficult using relatively short observation records. We propose that there is a linkage between the poleward migration of LMI and the observed expansion of the tropics. The rate of expansion since 1979 varies considerably among existing studies 6 , but the rate of LMI migration identified here falls well within this range. This potential linkage between tropical cyclones and the expansion of the tropics further heightens interest in establishing the forcing mechanisms of the expansion, which are at present uncertain but are generally thought to have anthropogenic contributions 6 . The expansion of the tropics, as measured by the meridional Trends are deduced from the best-track and ADT-HURSAT data sets. The slope (kilometres per decade) and the 95% two-sided confidence bounds are shown. Positive slopes represent poleward migration.

Formal change-point analysis applied to the global time series of LMI latitude reveals a significant change point in 1996, providing further support for a linkage between the two independently observed phenomena.\nObserved changes in vertical wind shear and potential intensity over the past 30 yr seem to have resulted in a poleward shift, in both hemispheres, of the regions most favourable for tropical cyclone development (Fig. 2) , and an associated migration of tropical cyclone activity away from the tropics (Fig. 1) . If these environmental changes continue, a concomitant continued poleward migration of the latitude where tropical cyclones achieve their LMI would have potentially profound consequences for life and property. Any related changes in positions where storms make landfall will have obvious effects on coastal residents and infrastructure. Increasing hazard exposure and mortality risk from tropical cyclones 25 may be compounded in coastal cities outside the tropics, while being offset at lower latitudes. Tropical cyclones also have an important role in maintaining regional water resources 26, 27 , and a poleward migration of storm tracks could threaten potable water supplies in some regions while increasing flooding events in others. Given these motivating factors, further study of the poleward migration of tropical cyclone LMI identified here, and its potential link to the observed expansion of the tropics, is warranted."}, {"section_title": "METHODS SUMMARY", "text": "Best-track data were taken from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) v03r05 (ref. 28) . Following ref. 3, when a storm has overlapping data from multiple sources, we used the source with the greatest reported LMI. The homogenized intensity data were taken from the Advanced Dvorak Technique Hurricane Satellite (ADT-HURSAT) data set 3 . Vertical wind shear and potential intensity were calculated over water in the region spanning latitudes 35u S to 35u N. In the Southern Hemisphere, the longitude was confined to 30u-240u E, which excludes the region where storms are not observed to form or track. The wind shear is estimated as the magnitude of the vector difference of the respective horizontal wind velocities at the 250-and 850-hPa pressure levels. Potential intensity was calculated following ref. 29 . ENSO variability was decreased in the LMI latitude time series by regressing the series from the two hemispheres onto the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index 30 averaged over the most active periods of tropical cyclone activity (August-October in the north and January-March in the south), and analysing the residuals. None of the time series studied in this paper exhibited autocorrelation after detrending, as determined with the Durbin-Watson test statistic, and no corrections were necessary when calculating the confidence intervals.\nOnline Content Any additional Methods, Extended Data display items and Source Data are available in the online version of the paper; references unique to these sections appear only in the online paper.
