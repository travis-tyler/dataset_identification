[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019.\nSince then, it has rapidly spread across the world, and was finally declared as a Public Health Emergency of International determining host tropism and transmission capacity [3] [4] [5] . The S protein is cleaved into 2 subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 subunit directly recognizes and attaches to human receptor ACE2, while S2 fuses the host cell membrane with viral membranes allowing entry of SARS-CoV-2 [6] . In general, RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 undergo rapid mutation, enabling evolutionary and genetic diversity which result in alterations such as viral transmissibility, receptor affinity, host tropism, and pathogenicity.\nIn recent years, several studies based on mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome have attempted to understand phylogenetic relationships, host infectivity, human-to-human transmission, viral tropism, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV in humans. Firstly, the comparative evolutionary diversity in point mutations (synonymous-non-synonymous mutations) are suggestive that SARS-CoV-2 should to be classified into 3 major clades (S, G, and V) and other clades according to amino acid changes [7] [8] [9] . Secondly, the high affinity and stable structure of RBD/ACE2 have been associated with amino acid variations in the RBD such as the high affinity group (N354D, D364Y, V367F, and W436R) [10] , and the high ACE2-binding affinity and stability group (484-NGVEGFN-490, Q496N, and Q496Y) [11] . Thirdly, the deletion of 382 nucleotides towards the 3' end of the viral genome may have an impact on viral phenotype [12] , and the QTQTN motif adjacent to the polybasic cleavage site (RRAR, chain of amino acids) at the bridge between S1 and S2 may be related to host adaptation [13] . In addition, insertion of the RRAR which has been well known to determine high or low pathogenicity in avian influenza virus may be important in determining transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 [14] . Finally, primer-template mismatch has been known to affect the stability and functionality of polymerase.\nIn particular, the primer-template mismatch located in the primer 3' end region can interfere with polymerase active sites, and this may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the molecular diagnosis using primers or probes [15] . Therefore, we analyzed the mutations of the SARS- "}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The set of 4,254 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and acknowledgment files were downloaded from the EpiCoV browser (https://epicov.org/epi3) of the GISAID [16] .

The conserved region of Although it is not understood how these mismatches affect the stability of primer-template complexes, it is necessary to determine the interrelationships. On the other hand, the RRAR, which is located between S1 and S2 (681-685 amino acid position of the S gene), may be related to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is might be inferred from the mutations in the RBD and the polybasic cleavage site in the S gene that the mutations will provide important clues to understanding immunity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 109 types of synonymous and 182 types of non-synonymous mutation in the S gene ( Figure   7 ). D614G is a major non-synonymous mutation in G clade and accounts for 1,764 (13.0%) in a total of 13,537 non-synonymous mutations. Above all, it is located in the S1-S2 junction region near the polybasic cleavage site, but its biochemical and structural relationships with ACE2 has been unclear so far.

In particular, the V483A and G476S mutations have previously been reported to be related to human receptorbinding affinity in MERS and SARS-CoV research [20, 21] . We detected a R682Q mutation from the RRAR, where arginine residue was replaced by glutamine residue. The arginine residue is not only electrically charged but also strongly basic, while the glutamine residue is polar uncharged. Therefore, it is necessary to study how this biochemical difference may affect functional and structural changes of the proteins of S1 or S2. According to a recent study, the fact that a deletion of the QTQTN amino acid motif near the polybasic cleavage site is related to adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.\nHence, we tried to confirm whether some deletions occurred in this region (675-679 amino acid position of the S gene). We In the E gene known to be involved in viral budding along with the M gene, we confirmed a relatively small number of mutations in it. This means that there are high conserved regions, so it seems reasonable to infer that the preserved sequence is important to encode protein participating in viral reproduction. Like the region of RdRp, the E gene has been also used to design primers and probes for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 10 types of synonymous and 12 types of non-synonymous mutation in the E gene ( Figure 8 ).\nOf these mutations, 7 primer-template mismatch mutations "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "From the non-synonymous mutation is overall more frequent to avoid the variable hotspot regions as much as possible.\nOur results about genomic mutations of SARS-CoV-2 strains may be helpful for interpreting the potential relationships of pathogenicity, infectivity, and transmission between SARS-CoV-2 and human host."}]
