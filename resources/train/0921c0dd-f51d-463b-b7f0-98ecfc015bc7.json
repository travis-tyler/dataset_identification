Riverine loads of total nitrogen and total phosphorus that previously were calculated for the same sites in Mueller and Spahr (2006) Because riverine loads are reported on an annual basis in Mueller and Spahr (2006) , corresponding anthropogenic nutrient inputs also were estimated on an annual basis for this study. Equation 2 was used to estimate inputs during this annual time step. The purposes of this report are to (1) describe the estimation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs in the United States during 1992, 1997, and 2002 and (2) provide those estimates in a tabular dataset. Estimates of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as P) inputs, expressed in kilograms (kg), are provided for each county in the conterminous United States. Separate estimates are listed for biological fixation by crops (for nitrogen only), human consumption, crop production for human consumption, animal production for human consumption, animal consumption, and crop production for animal consumption. Estimates of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as P) inputs, expressed in kilograms, also are provided for the watersheds of 495 NAWQA surface-water sites in the conterminous United States. Separate estimates are listed for biological fixation by crops (for nitrogen only), animal consumption, human consumption, crop production for animal consumption, crop production for human consumption, animal production for human consumption, net import of food, and net import of feed.

Riverine loads of total nitrogen and total phosphorus that previously were calculated for the same sites in Mueller and Spahr (2006) also are provided in the watershed dataset."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of Anthropogenic Nutrient Inputs", "text": "In the following section, the estimation of each input source in equation 2 is described."}, {"section_title": "Waste", "text": "The variable Waste i-1 in equation 2 represents the waste from a previous time step that is used in the current time step to fertilize crops. Human waste is generally not used to fertilize crops, so waste inputs to the next time step are assumed to be composed solely of livestock manure. Livestock manure is subject to spillage, volatilization, runoff, and other losses after generation in the previous time step and before subsequent application to agricultural fields in the current time step. To account for those losses, annual estimates of recoverable manure nutrients were used as estimates of Waste i-1 . Nitrogen and phosphorus in recoverable manure were estimated at a Kellogg and others (2000) and at a six-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC6) level for 2002 (Robert Kellogg, U.S. Department of Agriculture, written commun., 2011) using the number of animal units for confined livestock, a factor for manure recoverability, and estimates of the pounds of nutrients per ton of manure after nutrient losses during collection, transfer, storage, and treatment:\nRecoverable manure nutrients (3) = tons of manure per animal \u00d7 number of confined animal units \u00d7 manure recoverability factor \u00d7 nutrients per ton of manure after losses Recoverability factors represent the proportion of the excreted manure that could reasonably be expected to be collected from confinement facilities and applied to the land surface (Kellogg and others, 2000) . Losses included volatilization of nitrogen, spillage, and runoff; only waste treatment technologies that are in common practice were considered in estimating these losses (Kellogg and others, 2000) . The derivation and limitations of the various factors used in equation 3 are further detailed in Kellogg and others (2000) . These estimates do not include the portion of manure from unconfined livestock that provides some degree of fertilization on pasturelands. In these areas, the estimates of Waste i-1 are likely biased low. The extent to which livestock operations use offfarm land to dispose of livestock waste is not available from the Census of Agriculture (Kellogg and others, 2000) , so the recoverable manure was assumed to be applied equally on all cropland and pastureland within each county or HUC6.\nIn the mass balance shown in equation 2, Waste i-1 represents waste inputs from the prior year, whereas Fert i , Fix i , Atm i , FoodImp i , and FeedImp i are represented as inputs from the current year. The time step associated with a cycle of nutrient inputs \u2192 crops \u2192 waste \u2192 outputs, however, does not perfectly align with the progression from January to December within a single year. Different crops are grown at different times throughout the year, and waste is generated on a continuous basis throughout the year. As a result, recoverable manure generated in a given year using crops grown in the previous year may be applied together with \"new\" inorganic fertilizer to some portion of the crops grown later in the same year. The true total amount of recoverable manure applied within a single 12-month period from January to December likely includes some of the manure generated in the previous 12-month period and some of the manure generated in the current 12-month period; annual estimates from either 12-month period would be imperfect representations of the true amount. The annual data provided by the Census of Agriculture does not provide sufficient resolution to determine the relative chronology of manure generation and crop production in a given 12-month period. In addition, the Census of Agriculture is only conducted every 5 years. Because of these data constraints, estimates of all inputs in equation 2 (including Waste i-1 ) were based on data from the same year. For correspondence with the timing of the Census of Agriculture and the estimates of riverine load from Mueller and Spahr (2006) , the inputs were estimated for 3 years-1992, 1997, and 2002."}, {"section_title": "Fertilizer", "text": "Nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from fertilizer (including farm and nonfarm uses) were derived from sales and expenditures data from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials and the U.S. Census of Agriculture as described in Ruddy and others (2006) .

Atmospheric ammonia and organic nitrogen largely are derived from volatilization of animal waste and fertilizer. Because these emissions may redeposit during the same year in close proximity to the emission source (Prospero and others, 1996) , deposition of ammonia and organic nitrogen were assumed to be recycled from other inputs in the same region and were not included as inputs in this study (Howarth and others, 1996; Jordan and Weller, 1996) .

A positive value, or a net import of food or feed, would lead to human and (or) livestock waste inputs to the watershed in excess of the human and (or) livestock waste derived from crops grown in the watershed. Therefore, positive values for net import of food or feed were considered \"new\" anthropogenic inputs and were included in equation 2. A negative value, or a net export of food or feed, indicates that some portion of the crops grown in the watershed were exported out of the watershed; because exported crops are derived from the initial inputs of fertilizer, fixation, atmospheric deposition, or recoverable manure in the watershed during the same year, they represent recycled nutrients and thus were excluded from equation 2.\nTotal imports of food or feed cannot be directly estimated. They can only be estimated via equations 4 and 5 as a net value-that is, as net import or export. This limitation can be illustrated with an example: let human consumption be 100 kg and crop production for human consumption be 75 kg. If all the crops produced for human consumption were consumed by people in the watershed, an additional 25 kg would be imported to meet the consumption needs of people in the watershed. However, there may be situations where some of the crops produced for human consumption in a watershed are exported, even when enough people are present in the watershed to potentially consume all of those crops. As an alternative scenario, let 15 kg of the 75 kg produced be exported to another watershed (say, potatoes exported to other parts of the Nation)-total import of \"new\" nutrients would then be 40 kg to compensate for this export. However, the net import, calculated from equation 4, is 25 kg in both scenarios. Because the actual value of exported crops is not known, the actual value of total imports cannot be directly estimated. Only net import can be calculated. Thus, the estimation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs to a watershed in equation 2 may be an underestimate.

When all individual components were not available, the total values for wheat and hay were used. these values are shown in table 4. Because pasture is grazed by livestock and typically is not harvested, percent of crop to animal feed was assumed to be 100, and loss during storage and processing was assumed to be zero for this study. Pasture acreage was derived from land cover code 81 (pasture/hayareas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures planted for livestock grazing or the production of seed or hay crops), so its inclusion may have resulted in an unknown amount of double-counting of inputs from seed or hay crops that were also included in crop production estimates through data on hay production from the Census of Agriculture.

The animal excretion rates used in Ruddy and others (2006) often exceed the animal intake rates reported in Van Horn (1998) and used here (table 6 ). There are several other published values for typical animal intake rates that could have been used instead (see comparison in Boyer and others, 2002) , but those in Van Horn (1998) were selected because they are based on the most recent agricultural practices in the United States (Boyer and others, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Determination of Individual Nutrient Inputs to the Watersheds of NAWQA Surface-Water Sites", "text": "For determination of total nutrient inputs to the watersheds of the NAWQA surface-water sites, county-level annual estimates of nutrient inputs were mapped to specific land uses within each county by using NLCDe 92 and then summed for the area within each watershed, using tools from Price and others (2010) . NLCDe 92 is a composite of USGS NLCD 92 (U.S. Geological Survey, 2000) and USGS enhanced Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data (Price and others, 2007) . NLCD 92 is based on interpretation of Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper imagery captured from the late 1980s through early 1990s and was supplemented with a variety of ancillary data (Vogelmann and others, 2001) . The LULC dataset represents conditions compiled from aerial photographs taken in the 1970s to mid-1980s (U.S. Geological Survey, 1990 . Countyor HUC6-level estimates of farm and nonfarm fertilizer, biological nitrogen fixation, recoverable manure, human and animal consumption, and crop and animal production were allocated by land use as shown in table 7. Atmospheric deposition was assumed to be distributed over the county, and an area-weighted sum was computed for each watershed. Although more recent land-cover data are available through NLCD01, only NLCDe 92 was used for allocation of nutrient inputs. Various methodological differences resulted in substantially different pixel-by-pixel labeling in the two NLCD datasets, much of which probably is not genuine land-cover change (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2007). County boundaries from 1990 were used for all spatial allocations. There were some significant changes to the counties during the 1990s and early 2000s (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002) , but only a few required data modification for allocation to the watershed. The human consumption value in 2002 for Broomfield County, Colo., was allocated by percent-estimated detached population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002) among the four counties from which land was used to create Broomfield County in 2001. Also, Miami-Dade, Fla., was processed as Dade, Fla.\nFollowing Spahr (2005, 2006) and as detailed in table 8, the mean of multiple years was used as the estimate of watershed inputs of fertilizer and atmospheric deposition, which were measured annually. This was done for correspondence with the riverine loads in Mueller and Spahr (2006) , which were reported as the mean of the annual loads estimated during the NAWQA high-intensity data collection period. The estimates of inputs of biological nitrogen fixation, recoverable manure, and net food and feed imports or exports were for a single year-the year of the Census of Agriculture closest to the NAWQA high-intensity data collection period."}, {"section_title": "Total Anthropogenic Nutrient Inputs to Watersheds", "text": "Once the individual inputs to each watershed had been quantified, anthropogenic inputs were calculated as There are important limitations in this estimation of total anthropogenic nutrient inputs. The equations do not include natural nutrient inputs, because the loss of anthropogenic inputs (those most likely to be managed) is of interest in the companion analysis of riverine export. The anthropogenic sources in these equations, however, do not include inputs from long-term storage of anthropogenic nutrients (such as inputs from soils or groundwater), the import of livestock manure for application to agricultural fields (such as from confined animal feedlots outside of the watershed), or the application of biosolids derived from the treatment of human waste to agricultural fields. Anthropogenic inputs from these sources therefore are routinely excluded from quantification of anthropogenic nutrient inputs to watersheds (for example, see Russell and others, 2008; Boyer and others, 2002; David and Gentry, 2002; McIsaac and others, 2002; Howarth and others, 1996; Jordan and Weller, 1996) . First, the origin (anthropogenic or natural) of nutrient inputs from long-term storage are difficult to identify even on a small scale; national-scale information does not currently (2010) exist. Second, because agricultural data from individual farms is not disclosed to protect the privacy of farm owners, the agricultural data used in this report are county level. In most cases, it is not economically feasible to transport manure throughout an entire county (Kellogg and others, 2000) , so transport of manure among counties is likely to be low compared to transport over smaller distances within counties. Third, biosolids are used on less than one percent of the Nation's agricultural land (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). There are other important limitations to this approach. The equations assume that nutrient mineralization and immobilization are in equilibrium. Because of limited information on crop uptake, animal intake, and animal excretion, certain crops or animals that are important in a given county or watershed might not be included in the estimation of total anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Lastly, the human consumption estimates were allocated equally across all urban land; a large proportion of human-waste inputs, however, likely enter watersheds in more localized areas through discharge from wastewater-treatment plants.\nMany previous studies using the net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI) or net anthropogenic phosphorus input (NAPI) approach for estimating anthropogenic nutrient inputs have assumed that livestock waste represents only the internal recycling of \"new\" inputs of fertilizer, biological fixation by crops, and atmospheric deposition (for example, see Russell and others, 2008; Boyer and others, 2002; David and Gentry, 2002; McIsaac and others, 2002; Howarth and others, 1996; Jordan and Weller, 1996) . In this study, livestock waste derived from prior (and therefore independent) inputs of fertilizer, biological fixation by crops, and atmospheric deposition is included as an input because it is ultimately used to grow crops together with \"new\" inputs of fertilizer, biological fixation by crops, and atmospheric deposition. This waste input term is represented by recoverable livestock waste, the proportion of excreted manure that could reasonably be expected to be collected from confinement facilities and subsequently applied to the land surface after losses from volatilization of nitrogen, spillage, and runoff. Because of the inclusion of recoverable livestock waste as an input, anthropogenic nutrient inputs estimated in this study are not directly comparable to anthropogenic nutrient inputs estimated using the \"NANI\" or \"NAPI\" approach. More generally, methods used to estimate nutrient inputs to watersheds vary considerably, depending in part on the objective of the studies. For example, some studies include livestock waste as an input-either as excreted manure (Bosch and Allan, 2008) "}, {"section_title": "Description of the County-Level Nutrient-Input Dataset", "text": "The county-level nutrient-input data described in this report are in the dataset Nutrient_input_county.xlsx that is available online at http: //pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2012/5241/excel/ Nutrient_input_county.xlsx .

Comparison between the animal intake and excretion rates used in this study and the animal excretion rates used in Ruddy and others (2006) . Per 1,000 animals. Table 7 . Land-cover classifications used for allocation of nutrient inputs within a county or hydrologic unit."}, {"section_title": "Livestock", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The purposes of this report were to (1) describe the estimation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs in the United States during 1992, 1997, and 2002 and (2) provide those estimates in a tabular dataset. Estimates of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as P) anthropogenic inputs are provided for each county in the conterminous United States in a tabular dataset. Separate estimates are listed for biological fixation by crops (for nitrogen only), human consumption, crop production for human consumption, animal production for human consumption, animal consumption, and crop production for animal consumption. Estimates of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as P) inputs also are provided for the watersheds of 495 National Water-Quality Assessment Program surface-water sites in the conterminous United States in another tabular dataset. Separate estimates are listed for biological fixation by crops (for nitrogen only), animal consumption, human consumption, crop production for animal consumption, crop production for human consumption, animal production for human consumption, net import of food, and net import of feed. Estimates of inputs from atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, and recoverable manure are also provided for each watershed so that final estimates of anthropogenic nutrient inputs may be calculated (county-level estimates of these sources already are available from previous studies). Riverine loads of total nitrogen and total phosphorus that previously were calculated for the same sites also are provided in the watershed dataset."}]
