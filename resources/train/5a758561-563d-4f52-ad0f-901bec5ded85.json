[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Deep phenotyping and longitudinal assessment of predementia at-risk states of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are required to define populations and outcomes for dementia prevention trials. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI) at-risk state of dementia, which emerges as a highly promising target for AD prevention. Methods: The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) is conducting the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE), which focuses on the characterization of SCD in patients recruited from memory clinics. In addition, individuals with amnestic MCI, mild Alzheimer's dementia patients, first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's dementia, and cognitively unimpaired control subjects are studied. The total number of subjects to be enrolled is 1000. Participants receive extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and biomaterial collection is perfomed. In this publication, we report cognitive and clinical data as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker results of the first 394 baseline data sets. Results: In comparison with the control group, patients with SCD showed slightly poorer performance on cognitive and functional measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive part, Clinical Dementia Rating, Functional Activities Questionnaire), with all mean scores in a range which would be considered unimpaired. APOE4 genotype was enriched in the SCD group in comparison to what would be expected in the population and the frequency was significantly higher in comparison to the control group. CSF A\u03b242 was lower in the SCD group in comparison to the control group at a statistical trend with age as a covariate. There were no group differences in Tau or pTau concentrations between the SCD and the control groups. The differences in all measures between the MCI group and the AD group were as expected. Conclusions: The initial baseline data for DELCODE support the approach of using SCD in patients recruited through memory clinics as an enrichment strategy for late-stage preclinical AD. This is indicated by slightly lower performance in a range of measures in SCD in comparison to the control subjects as well as by enriched APOE4 frequency and lower CSF A\u03b242 concentration."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for the successful use of future disease-modifying therapies and for nonpharmacological interventions of secondary prevention [1] . Prodromal AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD have been established as predementia AD stages and are currently widely used as inclusion conditions in clinical trials [2] . However, if preservation of unimpaired cognitive function is the goal, interventions need to start at even earlier stages of AD [3] . Thus, there is a need to develop concepts for identification of individuals with AD before the clinical stages of MCI or prodromal AD are reached.\nMemory services are often approached by individuals who subjectively experience decline in cognitive functioning but perform within the age, sex, and educationadjusted normal limits on standard cognitive tests. Increasing data suggest that, as a group, these individuals show slightly lower performance on challenging cognitive tasks than individuals without cognitive complaints [4, 5] and are at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia [6] . This accounts particularly for those who have biomarker evidence for AD [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In recent consensus publications, this condition has been termed subjective cognitive decline (SCD), research criteria have been proposed, and recommendations for research studies on SCD have been provided [12, 13] . Conceptually, SCD in the presence of AD pathology may indicate the stage of first subtle decline in cognitive brain function and correspond to stage 3 of preclinical AD [14] . At this stage, SCD reflects the individual's experience of this subtle cognitive dysfunction, which is still largely compensated [15] .\nSCD is highly attractive for future early interventions, because in these subjects brain function is largely preserved with intact compensatory processes, while at the same time individuals with SCD have complaints and seek medical help. In order to employ SCD in trials and prospectively in AD prevention, it is necessary to enhance knowledge about this condition with regard to crosssectional features and longitudinal outcomes [13, 16] . This is the primary aim of the multicenter DZNELongitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE), whose design and first baseline data are reported in this paper. The DZNE (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) is a national research institution dedicated to molecular, clinical, epidemiological, healthcare, and nursing research on neurodegenerative diseases. It has nine operational sites in Germany, of which seven collaborate with respective local university memory centers. In total, this provides a network of 10 memory clinics. The clinical research branch of the DZNE created methodological cores for clinical assessment/neuropsychology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and biomaterial. These cores develop and provide standard operation procedures (SOPs) and quality control for harmonized data and material acquisition and storage across all sites.\nDELCODE is a longitudinal observational study, focusing on SCD in the context of AD. The study also includes individuals with MCI and mild AD as well as control subjects without subjective or objective cognitive impairment. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with AD dementia are enrolled as an exploratory at-risk group.\nThe main aims of DELCODE are: the development of a refined understanding of SCD in the context of AD; establishment of prediction models and estimates of cognitive decline in SCD; investigation of the effects of risk and protective factors on cognitive decline; and development of new disease markers. Here, we present the protocol of DELCODE and the baseline characteristics of the first 400 individuals enrolled."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Overall study design DELCODE is an observational longitudinal memory clinicbased multicenter study in Germany. The participants to be enrolled are 400 subjects with SCD, 200 MCI patients, 100 AD dementia patients, 200 control subjects without subjective or objective cognitive decline, and 100 firstdegree relatives of patients with a documented diagnosis of AD dementia. All patient groups (SCD, MCI, AD) are referrals, including self-referrals, to the participating memory centers. The control group and the relatives of AD dementia patients are recruited by standardized public advertisement. Ten university-based memory centers are participating, all being collaborators of local DZNE sites.\nThe assessments within DELCODE include extended clinical and neuropsychological testing, MRI, and sampling of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Three sites perform additional MRI on a second day. A longitudinal amyloid-PET and FDG-PET has been added with a delayed onset, for administrative reasons. Figure 1 provides an overview of the study design.\nThe sequence of clinical and neuropsychological examinations is harmonized across all sites. MRI and PET are scheduled according to the local conditions. The followup scheme of DELCODE is annual, with an individual follow-up time of 5 years and potential extension beyond.\nAll data and all biomaterial are stored centrally. All staff members at all sites underwent training in the respective methods to achieve high-quality data and material acquisition according to the SOP. The database and the sites are monitored centrally, including a query process. All local institutional review boards (IRB) and ethical committees approved the study protocol.

The assessments include medical history, psychiatric and neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, blood laboratory work-up, and routine MRI, all according to the local standards. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological test battery was applied at all memory centers to measure cognitive function.\nGerman age, sex, and education-adjusted norms of the CERAD neuropsychological battery are available online (www.memoryclinic.ch). SCD was defined by the presence of subjectively reported decline in cognitive functioning with concerns as expressed to the physician of the memory center and a test performance of better than -1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the age, sex, and education-adjusted normal performance on all subtests of the CERAD neuropsychological battery. Regarding the MCI group, only individuals with amnestic MCI were included, defined by an age, sex, and education-adjusted performance below -1.5 SD on the delayed recall trial of the CERAD word-list episodic memory tests. Both patient groups (SCD, amnestic MCI) fulfill the current research criteria for SCD [12, 13] or MCI [17] , respectively. In addition, patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia [18] and \u2265 18 points on the MiniMental -State Examination (MMSE) qualified for DEL-CODE. Note that the described procedures were all part of the clinical routine at each site and not part of DELCODE itself, but they provided the entry diagnosis of the patients for DELCODE.\nThe control group and the group of first-degree relatives of AD patients were recruited by identical local newspaper advertisements. In the advertisement text, individuals were explicitly sought who felt healthy and without relevant cognitive problems. All individuals who responded to the advertisement were screened by telephone with regard to SCD. The report of very subtle cognitive decline, which did not cause any concerns and was considered normal for age by the individual, was not an exclusion criterion for the control group. Further screening questions addressed other inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria (see later).\nFor the first-degree relatives of AD, the advertisement did not exclude those with concerns of cognitive decline. Fig. 1 Flow chart of DELCODE. AD Alzheimer's disease, MCI mild cognitive impairment, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, PET positron emission tomography, SCD subjective cognitive decline AD in the relative (parent or sibling) had to be documented by medical records.\nBoth the control group and the group of first-degree relatives had to achieve unimpaired cognitive performance according to the same definition as the SCD group.\nAll participants entered DELCODE based on either their clinical diagnosis (SCD, MCI, AD) derived from the clinical work-up or their identification as a control subject or a first-degree relative according to the procedures outlined.\nAdditional inclusion criteria for all groups were age \u2265 60 years, fluent German language skills, capacity to provide informed consent, and presence of a study partner. The main exclusion criteria for all groups were conditions clearly interfering with participation in the study or the study procedures, including significant sensory impairment. The following medical conditions were considered exclusion criteria: current major depressive episode, major psychiatric disorders either at baseline or in the past (e.g., psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, substance abuse), neurodegenerative disorder other than AD, vascular dementia, history of stroke with residual clinical symptoms, history of malignant disease, severe or unstable medical condition, and clinically significant abnormalities in vitamin B12. Prohibited drugs included chronic use of psychoactive compounds with sedative or anticholinergic effects, use of anti-dementia agents in SCD, amnestic MCI, and control subjects and in healthy siblings, and investigational drugs for treatment of dementia or cognitive impairment 1 month prior to entry and for the duration of the study.\nAll participants gave written informed consent before inclusion in the study."}, {"section_title": "Clinical and risk factor assessments", "text": "Within DELCODE, the clinical assessments at baseline were performed by trained study physicians.

All sites operate Siemens scanners, including three TIM Trio systems, four Verio systems, one Skyra system, and one Prisma system.\nThe standard DELCODE MR protocol included a structural T1-weighted image, a resting state fMRI (including IR-EPI and a field map), a T2-weighted structural scan optimized for volumetric assessment of the medial temporal lobe acquired in oblique coronal orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, a task fMRI (scene novelty and encoding task), and a quantitative susceptibility weighted image. This protocol was used in eight out of the nine scanning sites. One of the sites did not have the provision to conduct the task fMRI and instead conducted a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol. At three sites participants also underwent an optional second day of scanning with DTI, a task fMRI to assess object and scene processing and mnemonic discrimination, and a T1-weighted FLASH sequence optimized to image the locus coeruleus.\nFor task fMRI, all sites were equipped with a highresolution (1280 Px \u00d7 800 Px) 30-inch MR-compatible LCD screen (\"Medres Optostim\"). All monitors were calibrated and configured to maintain the distance, luminance, color, and contrast constant across sites. Responses during task fMRI were recorded at all sites with MR-compatible response buttons (CurrentDesign). All participants underwent vision correction with MRcompatible goggles (Medigoogle; Cambridge Research Systems) according to the same SOP for all MRI sites. Task fMRI scenario files were controlled with Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems).\nFor quality assurance (QA) and assessment, the following steps were taken. The DZNE imaging network, headed by the Magdeburg DZNE site (iNET), qualified each MRI site with a traveling head measurement prior to the start of the study. DZNE iNET then provided every site with detailed SOPs for the implementation of each protocol. All radiographers who operate MRIs in the study underwent centralized training to implement the SOPs (i.e., subjects' positioning in the MRI scanner, sequence preparation steps, image angulation, task-fMRI visual acuity checks and correction, participant instruction, and testing).\nA small MRI-phantom built and designed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) is used to monitor the performance of the MR systems on a weekly basis.\nThe phantom images are analyzed according to a published protocol [24] . A custom-built holder was designed to maximize reproducibility in phantom positioning across all nine MRI sites.\nFor QA, every scan underwent a quality check for SOP conformity and scan quality by the DZNE iNET team (Magdeburg). To establish inclusion/exclusion criteria based on data-driven quantitative metrics, a Bayesian-based strategy is being developed which will use the current manual/semi-automatic QA information for training after processing the images using the pcp-qa package (www.preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/ quality-assessment-protocol/)).

The main focus of the study is on SCD as a pre-MCI at-risk state of AD dementia. In comparison to the control group, the SCD group showed slightly worse performance on the ADAScog. However, the mean score of 7.0 points on the ADAScog in the SCD group still reflects performance in the unimpaired range. The mean ADAScog score of the MCI group was 15.3. The global CDR score and the CDR-SOB were also slightly higher in the SCD group (mean 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Finally, the FAQ, which indicates the performance on activities of daily living, was slightly higher in the SCD group in comparison to the controls. The mean score of 0.8 in the SCD group, however, is clearly below a score of 6 points indicating IADL impairment at the level of dementia [27] . Overall these data indicate subtle lower cognitive and functional performance in the SCD group in comparison to the control group. Importantly, neither the cognitive nor the functional scores would be considered outside the normal range in the SCD group and are clearly distinct from the performance of the amnestic MCI group. These findings support the concept of SCD (at least in memory clinics) corresponding to the subtle decline in performance, which may correspond to the late stage of preclinical AD [12, 14] .\nWe observed a frequency of APOE4 allele carriers of 32.5% in the SCD group in comparison to a significantly lower proportion of E4 carriers in the control group (17.6%), indicating APOE4 enrichment. The frequency of the APOE4 allele in the general population in Germany has been reported to be 14.5% [28] .\nThe CSF biomarkers indicated a lower A\u03b242 concentration in the SCD group in comparison with the control group. The effect was of medium magnitude (d = 0.44) and reached a statistical trend level toward significance after controlling for age. We did not observe increased Tau or pTau in the SCD group in comparison to the control group. This is an intriguing finding, suggesting that first subtle symptoms may already occur at the stage of A\u03b242 deposition only, without significant neurodegeneration. This sequence has recently been proposed in a conceptual model of SCD in the context of AD [16] .\nHowever, there was also a higher rate of SCD individuals with suggestive AD pathology according to the Hulstaert score, which integrates A\u03b242 and Tau into a ratio and has been reported as a powerful predictor for conversion from MCI [e.g., 23] and also SCD [11] to AD dementia. The OR of SCD with regard to evidence of AD pathology according to this score was 2.62 with adjustment for age, which also showed a trend toward significance. In addition, the number of SCD patients with abnormal Hulstaert scores in the present sample (35.6%) is remarkably similar to the rate of 34.1% observed in a fully independent sample of memory clinic patients with SCD from the German Dementia Competence Network [11] .\nThe present report has limitations. It comprises only the first 394 baseline datasets of DELCODE, while the project aims at including 1000 individuals. This limits statistical power, particularly in the biomarker subgroups. At the present state, data are only exploratory and not generalizable. PET data are not yet available at a sufficient number for statistical analyses. Longitudinal data are also not available for the present analysis.

There was also evidence for an enrichment of APOE4 genotype and for A\u03b2-positive individuals in the SCD group, while there was no evidence for increased Tau pathology. These preliminary results support the concept that SCD may serve as an enrichment strategy for AD and may correspond to late-stage preclinical AD, indicating its first symptomatic manifestation."}]
