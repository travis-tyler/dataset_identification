To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated the crosssectional and longitudinal associations of BMI categories with CSF biomarkers, brain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) load, brain structure, and cognition and have assessed the effect of late-life BMI on AD risk in a large sample (n = 1,212) of nondemented elderly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. At baseline, higher latelife BMI categories were associated with higher levels of CSF A\u03b242 (p=0.037), lower levels of CSF total-tau (t-tau, p=0.026) and CSF t-tau/A\u03b242 (p=0.008), lower load of A\u03b2 in the right hippocampus (p=0.030), as well as larger volumes of hippocampus (p<0.0001), entorhinal cortex (p=0.009) and middle temporal lobe (p=0.040) . But no association was found with CSF phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) or CSF p-tau/A\u03b242. Longitudinal studies showed that higher BMI individuals experienced a slower decline in cognitive function. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that higher late-life BMI had a reduced risk of progression to AD over time (p = 0.009). Higher BMI in late-life decreased the risk of AD, and this process may be driven by AD-related biomarkers. www.aging-us.com 2006 AGING"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting approximately 35.6 million people worldwide in 2010 and an estimated 115 million people by the year 2050 [1] . There are no current preventive or disease-modifying therapeutic measures. Therefore, the identification of modifiable risk factors is of major interest [2] .\nAs an influential factor of AD, obesity plays different roles in AD during different life stages. Mid-life obesity is an established risk factor for AD dementia [3] [4] [5] . To be more precise, a high body mass index (BMI) in midlife is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, vascular pathology, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that are all independent risk factors for cognitive impairment and AD dementia in later life [6, 7] . An influential meta-analysis concluded that being underweight, overweight or obese in midlife predicted higher risk of dementia, with much of the evidence resting on a single sample aged 40-45 at BMI assessment [8] . But the association between late-life BMI and AD is inconclusive. Multiple epidemiological studies have even illustrated late-life obesity as a protective factor for AD (the so-called obesity paradox) [9] [10] [11] . Higher late-life BMI is associated with decreased risk of dementia [12, 13] , better cognition [14] , slower progression of AD [15] , and decreased mortality [16] . However, the evidence is not consistent, with some studies reporting an inverse association between obesity and AD risk [17] and others reporting no association [18, 19] . Inconsistencies might arise because previous studies have been quite small with short durations of follow-up.\nMore studies are warranted to elucidate and validate the relationship between late-life BMI and AD. The objectives of the current study were to examine the cross-sectional as well as the longitudinal association between late-life BMI and AD CSF biomarkers, imaging biomarkers and cognitive performance in 1,212 non-demented elderly individuals, using the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) cohort.

However, further adjustment for confounding variables made little difference to this inverse association between BMI and AD risk (p=0.160). Figure 4 shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the baseline BMI groups."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we examined the influence of BMI on AD CSF and imaging biomarkers, brain A\u03b2 load, as well as cognitive performance in a large multicenter cohort (ADNI) of non-demented older individuals. Our findings clearly indicated that higher baseline BMI was associated with higher levels of CSF A\u03b242, lower t-tau and t-tau/A\u03b242, lower load of A\u03b2, as well as larger brain volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. Further, the longitudinal data suggested that individuals with higher late-life BMI had less cognitive decline. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that higher late-life BMI had a lower incidence of conversion to AD. These analyses support the obesity paradox that has been observed across different studies where higher BMI in late life decreases AD risk [20] .\nConsistent with previous studies, our study has demonstrated that in non-demented subjects there were associations between late-life BMI and core feasible CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242 and t-tau) which have superior accuracy for the detection of AD and could indirectly assess the extent of AD pathology in the brain [19, 21, 22] . But our study found not all the associations were statistically significant in different diagnostic subgroups using the ADNI database. Our results showed that baseline BMI categories were associated with CSF t-tau but not with CSF A\u03b242 in the brains of MCI individuals, suggesting that individuals with MCI who AGING are normal weight were more likely to have tau-induced cognitive impairment compared to those who are overweight or obese. However, in NC group, there was no association between BMI and the level of CSF tau. The above findings were consistent with those of Mathys et al.'s study showing that BMI was significantly associated with the level of tau in the MCI group, but not in the NC group [21] . We also observed that higher BMI categories were associated with a higher level of CSF A\u03b242 in the total participants, but not in the MCI group or the NC group, which contradicted prior smaller studies showing an association in the MCI group [21, 22] . The potential explanations for this inconsistency may be the different numbers of MCI individuals for association analysis and whether BMI was assessed as a categorical variable or a continuous variable.\nIt has been suggested that many years prior to the appearance of clinical signs of AD, the deposition of A\u03b2 occurs within the neocortex and hippocampus [23] . Interestingly, the results of our cross-sectional tests indicate that through serial assessment of A\u03b2 using florbetapir PET imaging, subtle but significant lower A\u03b2 load are present in brain region of right hippocampus among subjects with higher BMI, and that the protective effect of late-life obesity against AD dementia may be mediated by reducing A\u03b2 accumulation in the hippocampus. However, BMI categories were not associated with the longitudinal rates of A\u03b2 accumulation in the follow-up study of 2 years. This result may have been influenced by the short follow-up time, which may be too abbreviated to verify the longitudinal association between late-life BMI and A\u03b2 accumulation.\nAs for MRI measures, our study demonstrated that higher late-life BMI categories were associated with larger volumes of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and middle temporal lobe at baseline. This association may, at least partly, underlie the link between high BMI at late-life and a decreased risk of AD, compared to overweight/normal weight individuals. In our study, BMI-related atrophy was observed in the medial temporal lobes, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal subfields, which have been extensively studied as two brain regions first affected by AD. Both brain regions are involved in modulating appetite, olfaction and taste, as well as weight regulation [11, [24] [25] [26] . Recent research suggested the hippocampus has direct connections to hypothalamic nuclei and other brain networks, which underlies its role in regulation of food intake and body weight [27] . Although we did not directly assess the mechanisms underlying the link between BMI and neurodegenerative processes which could lead to brain atrophy, this relationship could be mediated partly by A\u03b242 and tau. This was consistent with the previous findings about the involvement of BMI in the pathogenesis of AD [28] [29] [30] .\nLongitudinal studies have the advantage of following cohorts of individuals over prolonged periods of time, making themselves an ideal approach to observing disease development and identifying patterns, correlates and possible causes of changes that occur with age [31] . The analysis using longitudinal follow-up data available from our study participants showed that although cognitive function decreased over the follow-up period, obese individuals experienced a slower decline in cognitive function, compared with normal weight and overweight individuals. This finding is in line with recent studies showing that obesity was associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline in an elderly population, suggesting the protective association of high BMI with cognitive performance [32, 33] . The possible mechanism accounting for the protective association between obesity and cognition was explained by the hormone leptin which is mainly secreted by the adipose tissue [34] . An increased level of leptin regulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, hence decreasing AD. Other mechanisms, including involving neurodegenerative and cognitive reserve, need more exploration. In the present study, however, no significant association was found between higher BMI categories and longitudinal cognitive changes in the subgroup with NC. A possible explanation for this finding could be that protective effect of high BMI on cognitive performance became increasingly obvious with disease progression.\nFinally, we found that a higher late-life BMI at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of progression to AD. After adjustment for age, sex, education, cognitive diagnosis, ApoE \u03b54 status and comorbidities, this effect became nonsignificant among an elderly population. However, in a population of more than three hundred thousand olderly individuals, Qizilbash and colleagues found a lower risk of dementia in people who are overweight and obese, after adjustment for nine potential confounders: age, sex, smoking, alcohol, history of myocardial infraction, stroke and diabetes, use of recent anti-hypertensive drugs, and statins [35] .\nIn other studies adjusted for several important potential confounders, researchers also reported that obesity at baseline predicted a lower risk of AD in elderly people [20, 36, 37] . Additionally, the results from our study confirmed a higher late-life BMI was associated with lower AD-related biological biomarkers in prodromal AD, larger brain volumes of AD-vulnerable regions and better cognitive performance. This finding implies a potentially protective effect of obesity on AD in the elderly. Therefore, it may be an inaccurate interpretation AGING of the nonsignificant association of BMI and AD risk, and further studies with larger sample size are needed to assess the impact of BMI on AD risk.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, with the increase in adiposity, the precision of BMI measurement in older adults can be affected by age-related loss of lean body mass [38, 39] . Hence, future studies should examine other body composition metrics, such as waste circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Second, there was a small number of participants with underweight, which limited the conclusions we could make about clinical progression among these individuals. Third, although longitudinal studies can potentially characterize the associations of BMI with change rates of CSF AD biomarkers and cognitive decline, they can be confounded by participant dropout rates. There was some loss to follow-up in our study and we didn't correct for attrition bias. Fourth, we could not exclude the possibility of reverse causality in the association between BMI and AD. Fifth, except the three brain regions, others, such as parahippocampus, amygdala, precuneus cortex, and posterior cingulate, are also found to be associated with AD [40] . Despite the limitations, this study has several strengths, including a relatively large sample, longitudinal design, standardized clinical diagnosis of dementia, and several important adjusted confounders.\nOverall, higher baseline late-life BMI was associated with lower levels of AD biomarkers, lower A\u03b2 load, higher brain volumes, slower cognitive decline. These associations suggest that the obese elderly are at a decreased risk of AD. Future studies are warranted to better elucidate the mechanism underlying these associations."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used in the preparation for this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc. edu).
