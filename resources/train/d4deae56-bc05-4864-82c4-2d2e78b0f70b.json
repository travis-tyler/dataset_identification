[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We present an improved image analysis pipeline to detect the percent brain volume change (PBVC) using SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy) in populations with Alzheimer's dementia. Our proposed approach uses the improved brain extraction mask from BEaST (Brain Extraction based on nonlocal Segmentation Technique) instead of the conventional BET (Brain Extraction Tool) for SIENA. We compared four varying options of BET as well as BEaST and applied these five methods to analyze scan-rescan MRIs in ADNI from 332 subjects, longitudinal ADNI MRIs from the same 332 subjects, their repeat scans over time, and OASIS longitudinal MRIs from 123 subjects. The results showed that BEaST brain masks were consistent in scan-rescan reproducibility. The crosssectional scan-rescan error in the absolute percent brain volume difference measured by SIENA was smallest (p 0.0187) with the proposed BEaST-SIENA. We evaluated the statistical power in terms of effect size, and the best performance was achieved with BEaST-SIENA (1.2789 for ADNI and 1.095 for OASIS). The absolute difference in PBVC between scan-dataset (volume change from baseline to year-1) and rescan-dataset (volume change from baseline repeat scan to year-1 repeat scan) was also the smallest with BEaST-SIENA compared to the BET-based SIENA and had the highest correlation when compared to the BET-based SIENA variants. In conclusion, our study shows that BEaST was robust in terms of reproducibility and consistency and that SIENA's reproducibility and statistical power are improved in multiple datasets when used in combination with BEaST."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Chronic brain atrophy is one of the pathologic hallmarks in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

All the pre-processing was performed using minc-toolkit (ITK4v2 branch, https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit). The pre-processing was similar to previous studies [9] [10] [11] and consisted of the following: 1) N3 correction [12] , 2) de-noising using non-local means [13] , 3) linear affine standard space registration [14] to nonlinear ICBM atlas (ICBM 2009c [15] ), 4) intensity normalization based on histogram-matching, 5) brain extraction using BEaST (version 1.15, http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/BEaST) [6] , and 6) refinement of linear affine registration, N3 correction, and intensity normalization using the BEaST brain extraction mask. Importantly, the input to BEaST was N3-corrected, de-noised, and intensitynormalized image, resampled in standard space using 12-parameter affine registration. The BEaST library consisted of 10 samples from ICBM library [16] , 10 samples from NIH study of normal brain development [17] , and 60 samples from ADNI as described in the original study [6] . We left-right flipped the template images along the x-axis to artificially increase the sample for a total of 160 samples in the BEaST library. Of the 160 library images, BEaST preselects the 20 best matching samples for processing each image independently. The highest processing resolution of BEaST was 2mm with median filter set as a post-processing step. The mask was then brought back from standard space to the subject's native space and resampled to the original resolution. Of 323 ADNI subjects, 39 cases were overlapping with images included in the library. For these 39 cases, we excluded the case from the library to avoid the potential advantage for BEaST."}, {"section_title": "SIENA", "text": "We used SIENA (FSL version 5.0, https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) on CentOS 6.3 on the supercomputer Guillimin from McGill University (http://www.hpc.mcgill.ca). We measured the percent brain volume change (PBVC) in three ways: (1) between the baseline scan and followup (year-1) (original PBVC), (2) between baseline scan and baseline repeat scan for cross-sectional scan-rescan comparison, and (3) between repeat-scan at baseline and repeat-scan at year 1 (repeat PBVC) for longitudinal scan-rescan comparison. We compared five variations of SIENA as described next and summarized in Table 1 and Fig 1. We ran the analysis completely automatically. 1. Vanilla-SIENA. As a comparator, we applied the SIENA with \"-m\" option, which performs standard-space masking as well as BET, as a previous study has shown the benefit of standard space masking [18] . While typical research centers do not perform Vanilla-SIENA, this version serves as a traditional reference, and less advanced centers still use this option.\n2. Popescu-SIENA. To compare an improved brain extraction method within the FSL framework, we applied the options suggested by Popescu et al. [19] . In their study, different BET options were compared with respect to the manual segmentation using multi-center MRIs from multiple sclerosis patients. As described, we performed the neck-cropping using the field-of-view region-of-interest (ROI) created in MNI space. We also used the BET [5] options \"-B\" and \"-f 0.1,\" where \"-B\" corrects the bias field and cleans up the neck and \"-f\" is a fractional intensity threshold that would lead to a larger brain outline at the bottom with smaller f-value.\n3. Cover-SIENA. We also applied the options suggested by Cover et al. [20] . In that study, \"-B -f 0.2\" appears to be the optimal parameter for analysis of 1.5-Tesla MRIs in ADNI. We used the same neck-cropping as in Popescu-SIENA and changed the BET option. The only difference between Popescu-SIENA was the f-option. "}, {"section_title": "CBET-SIENA.", "text": "We used an option \"-c\" to define the center of gravity, which was calculated from a predefined coordinate in the standard ICBM space (0,-12,4) between left and right thalami and the affine standard-space registration matrix used to map the MRI into standard space. There was no neck-cropping. There were no additional options for BET. This version serves as a reference to BEaST-SIENA.\n5. BEaST-SIENA. In the proposed pipeline, we replaced the BET brain mask with the BEaST brain mask. BEaST was previously validated in terms of accuracy to be superior to BET and the VBM8 toolbox of SPM8 [6] . In this pipeline, we ran BET only to produce the skull mask since SIENA requires the skull mask for registration. We again used the \"-c\" option to set the center of gravity, using the same coordinate as in CBET-SIENA. There was no neckcropping."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of methods", "text": "Mask comparison. To detect gross brain masking errors, we generated average masks in standard space using the following procedure: we 1) nonlinearly registered all baseline MR images to the ICBM 2009c template using ANTS (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs) [21] , 2) transformed and resampled the brain masks from the native space to standard space using the transformation from ANTS, 3) computed the voxel-by-voxel mean and standard deviation of the masks from each subject for each time-point, and 4) repeated the process for each of the five SIENA variations (Vanilla, Popescu, Cover, CBET, and BEaST). ANTS was applied to the full image without brain extraction. We did not use the brain mask to avoid introducing the mask's influence on the performance of nonlinear registration. Note that BEaST was applied independently for baseline and follow-up image. In other words, there was no affine registration between baseline and follow-up scans in generating BEaST masks so that the comparison of masks is fair across the pipelines. We visually inspected the general accuracy of nonlinear registration. This test was only intended to show gross errors in brain extraction since there is no gold standard for each subject, and since the definition of true brain extraction may be different for BET and BEaST. We also counted the number of failures, defined by \"incomplete analysis\" whereby SIENA did not produce a valid value, which happened due to poor brain extraction and/or poor registration.\nCross-sectional scan-rescan error. First, the reproducibility of brain extracted masks was compared among BEaST and the four BET variations using the cross-sectional ADNI scanrescan data acquired on the same day. We calculated absolute volume difference, sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard similarity index, and mean surface distance between the scan and rescan brain extraction masks. All measurements were made in native space with linear rigid-body registration without the use of brain extraction masks. Thus, we used the same linear registration matrix for all 5 versions. We also created absolute difference maps between the scan and rescan brain masks for each subject and averaged them in the nonlinearly resampled standard space for each SIENA method.\nTo evaluate the impact on reproducibility of SIENA, we measured the percent brain volume difference and its absolute value for each of the 5 variations of SIENA.\nEffect size and sample size. To evaluate the quantitative improvement on statistical power, we calculated the effect size to detect a 25% change in PBVC over a 12-month period for each method, for each dataset. For ADNI, PBVC was measured between baseline scan and year-1 scan (original PBVC). The OASIS PBVC values were annualized since the MRI intervals were not consistent across subjects. The effect size was calculated using the standard equation where the denominator is a pooled standard deviation, \u03c3 is the group PBVC standard deviation, and \u03bc is the group PBVC mean obtained from longitudinal data. This equation includes the effect of normal aging thus the hypothesized treatment effect acts on the difference between AD and healthy controls; that is, a 100% treatment effect leads to patients having the same atrophy rate as healthy controls. We then calculated the required sample size per arm from the effect size according to the Eq 2:\nwhere SD p is the pooled standard deviation, u = 0.842 for 80% power, v = 1.96 to test at 0.05 significance level, Ceil is the round-up operator, and TxE is the predefined treatment effect (25%), which is assumed to take immediate and constant effect. All available PBVC values were included in the analysis. Longitudinal scan-rescan error. Using the ADNI rescan data acquired over time, we measured PBVC between the baseline repeat and year-1 repeat (repeat PBVC). We compared the repeat PBVC with the original PBVC between baseline scan and year-1 scan and calculated the mean difference and mean absolute difference in PBVC as well as their correlation and regression (slope and intercept)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fig 2 shows the qualitative evaluations of methods. BEaST appears to have the smallest variability in average mask obtained from 910 masks in 332 ADNI and 123 OASIS cases (top).", "text": "BEaST also had consistent segmentation within subjects from the scan-rescan pairs from 332 ADNI cases acquired on the same day (bottom). Table 2 (A) shows the comparison of scan-rescan brain extraction masks. BEaST performed better in all the comparisons. Note for all measures (sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard index, and mean surface distance), the worst quartile from BEaST outperformed the best quartile of other methods. Note also that the volume difference in Fig 3A and the absolute volume difference in Fig 3B contain no outliers for BEaST, which is not the case for the other methods. There are few very low specificity cases in Vanilla-SIENA (n = 3) and CBET-SIENA (n = 1), and thus the means are similar to the 25-percentile value. Table 2B , 2C and 2D shows scan-rescan percent brain volume difference and absolute values from SIENA. BEaST-SIENA had the smallest standard deviation in scan-rescan percent brain volume difference among the 5 methods. The smallest mean and median absolute values were obtained by BEaST-SIENA, followed by CBET-SIENA, and Cover-SIENA. The absolute scanrescan percent difference for BEaST-SIENA was significantly different from all other versions of SIENA (p < 0.0187, paired tests). Table 3 shows the effect size for all methods estimated from the ADNI and OASIS datasets. The actual mean (SD) interval between the baseline and follow-up of 1.08 (0.07) for ADNI and 1.82 (0.40) for OASIS. BEaST-SIENA had the largest effect size: 41% and 27% larger, respectively for ADNI and OASIS, compared to Vanilla-SIENA.\nLongitudinal scan-rescan experiment showed that BEaST-SIENA had the smallest mean absolute difference (0.11%) compared to other methods, best correlated with original PBVC values with the regression line closest to slope of 1 and intercept of 0 (Table 4 ). The effect size determined from the repeat dataset was overall lower than those calculated from the original PBVC but the trend that BEaST-SIENA performed optimally with CBET-SIENA closely next was similar to the scan-dataset."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusion", "text": "Our study not only compared our results with those obtained using the default options of SIENA, but also with previously published \"optimized\" parameters [19, 20] . We have shown the improved reproducibility of BEaST brain extraction mask over the BET-derived brain masks in the scan-rescan dataset ( Table 2 , Fig 2 bottom and Fig 3) , and better longitudinal consistency in the ADNI and OASIS datasets (Fig 2 top) . The study also demonstrates the robust impact of BEaST brain masks on the measurement of whole brain atrophy using SIENA in ADNI and OASIS datasets (Tables 3 and 4) .\nThe cross-sectional scan-rescan brain extraction comparisons in Fig 3 and Table 2 show that BEaST's reproducibility is higher than the variants of BET studied here. Both BEaST and Popescu-BET masks were the least biased with a percent volume difference of <0.1%, However at 0.3%, the standard deviation of BEaST percent volume difference was almost 5 times smaller than Popescu-BET (1.4%), indicating more reproducible and robust brain masks for BEaST. Cover-BET performed worse, with a bias of -3.1% and a standard deviation of 5.8% for percent volume difference in the scan-rescan tests. For sensitivity and Jaccard index, the lowest 25 percentile of BEaST values was greater than the each of the BET variant 75 percentile values. Improving the SIENA performance using BEaST brain extraction Better brain masks are likely to translate to improved scan-rescan SIENA measurements. Table 2C shows that all methods yield similar numbers with Popescu-SIENA giving the smallest bias for scan-rescan SIENA measurements. The absolute PBVC is also very similar between techniques, with CBET-SIENA and BEaST-SIENA yielding the smallest standard deviations.\nA larger effect size means that smaller sample sizes are required to show a statistically significant difference between groups. The methods that consistently increased the effect size compared to Vanilla-SIENA were Cover-SIENA, CBET-SIENA and BEaST-SIENA, with the largest effect sizes achieved by BEaST-SIENA in both ADNI and OASIS datasets. BEaST-SIENA had 41% larger effect size than Vanilla-SIENA in ADNI data. BEaST-SIENA and Cover-Siena were robust without any processing failures, while the three other BET-derived SIENA pipelines failed to compute PBVC for some datasets in the ADNI cohort. There were no failures in the OASIS cohort. Cover-SIENA, CBET-SIENA and BEaST-SIENA result in the smallest required sample sizes with CBET-SIENA and BEaST-SIENA yielding almost the same sample size in the ADNI cohort, and Cover-SIENA and BEaST-SIENA yielding almost the same sample size in the OASIS cohort.\nOur study did not evaluate the accuracy of PBVC measurements. The accuracy of BEaST has been studied in the original development and validation manuscript [6] . Creation of a gold standard for PBVC measurements is extremely difficult [22] as it requires manual segmentation of the brain parenchyma by multiple experts in high-resolution baseline and follow-up MRIs. Given the potential inter-and intra-rater variability in manual segmentation, it is not clear that such a gold standard would be good enough to quantify the differences between PBVC measures since the manual variability could be of the same magnitude as the errors and inaccuracies of the SIENA procedures using either BEaST-or BET-derived masks. Improving the SIENA performance using BEaST brain extraction\nWe did not investigate the effect of parameters directly used in SIENA. Since brain extraction is one the first processing steps in the SIENA pipeline, we expected the choice of brain mask would have the largest influence on the outcome of PBVC. We also did not investigate the sensitivity of templates in the BEaST library, as this was previously studied, and the use of n = 20 preselected templates appear to be sufficiently accurate [6] . We also did not assess the brain masks individually, reject results, or re-analyze data, which may take place in real analyses and in clinical trials. However, the robustness demonstrated by the scan-rescan measures (sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard, and means surface distance), average mask, the average difference mask, and greater statistical power suggests that such individual assessment may not be necessary with the BEaST-SIENA method.\nOur results also highlight the variable performance of SIENA when BET is used for brain extraction. The published optimized method (Cover-SIENA) performed well and had similar effect sizes compared to the BEaST-SIENA pipeline in both ADNI and OASIS datasets. This high quality performance may be attributed to the fact that SIENA combines two masks (with an OR-operation) before brain tissue segmentation, thus reducing the risk of failure in case one brain mask is partially missing brain tissue. We have found BEaST to be very robust on over 3,000 datasets in other combined studies [9, [23] [24] [25] [26] .\nThe improved sample size estimation using BEaST-SIENA compared to the second best method (Cover-SIENA) was not large for ADNI dataset (7% , Table 3 ). However, our results show that SIENA results are very sensitive to BET options as changing the option \"-f\" from 0.1 to 0.2 changed the mean PBVC in the OASIS dataset by 25%, i.e., from -0.330 to -0.413 in Improving the SIENA performance using BEaST brain extraction non-demented group. Previous studies have attempted to optimize the parameters for BET in multiple sclerosis and AD studies [18] [19] [20] and resulted in varying parameters. Therefore, it may be difficult in prospective multi-center studies to predict optimal parameters for BET for both accuracy and effect size. The ranking of algorithms differed in BET-based SIENA pipelines between the ADNI and OASIS datasets, which may reflect the sensitivity of SIENA to brain extraction and emphasize its importance. The ADNI standard analysis list contains 195 normal subjects and 133 AD patients for Complete 1 Year Visits [27] . Our cohort does not exactly match this list; one normal subject was removed due to poor quality, one normal subject is no longer available as of March 16, 2015 , and 6 AD patients were added because Month-6 scans were missing while Screening and Year-1 were available.\nIn conclusion, BEaST was robust in two large studies (ADNI and OASIS), consistent across and within subjects, and led to more reproducible and sensitive brain volume change measurements than conventional BET when applied in SIENA.
