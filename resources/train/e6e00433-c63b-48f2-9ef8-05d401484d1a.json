A total of 48 items were candidates for replacement, and two trial items were written for each. Of these 96 items, 37 were selected for the NEO-PI-3. When administered to a sample of adolescents aged 14 to 20, the NEO-PI-3 showed modest improvements in psychometric properties over the NEO-PI-R as well as greater readability. The median item/total correlation for the 37 items that were changed increased from .28 in the NEO-PI-R to .37 in the NEO-PI-3, and the median FleschKinkaid reading grade level decreased from 8.3 to 4.4. McCrae et al. suggested that the NEO-PI-3 might also be useful in adults, especially those with limited education.\nThe scarcity of personality data on individuals in their 20s has other causes. Much research has, of course, been conducted on college students, including a few longitudinal studies (e.g., Robins, Fraley, Roberts, & Trzesniewski, 2001) . Similarly, adult developmentalists have studied middle-aged (Costa, Herbst, McCrae, & Siegler, 2000) and older (Mroczek & Spiro, 2003) adults but, until recently (Neyer & Asendorpf, 2001) , have shown less interest in development in early adulthood. This is unfortunate, because a review of lifespan development by Costa and McCrae (2002) suggested that the largest changes (about 0.5 standard deviations) were to be found between age 18 and age 30. During that period, Neuroticism (N) and Extraversion (E) Decline and Agreeableness (A) and Conscientiousness (C) increase at a more rapid rate than in the remainder of life (where a cumulative change of less than 0.5 standard deviations is typically seen). Openness to experience (O) appears to increase after age 12 but to have declined by age 30. It is not clear when O peaks or whether the relatively rapid changes in the other factors are confined to the first part of early adulthood or continue throughout the decade of the 20s. Costa and McCrae (2002) predicted that there would be no noticeable changes in A or C after age 30, but subsequent data support the view that there is gradual but persistent change in these factors as well (Roberts et al., in press) .\nAlthough longitudinal data from early adolescence on would be desirable, the present study estimates age changes by examining cross-sectional age differences in adolescence and adulthood. NEO-PI-R and NEO-PI-3 data from McCrae et al. (2005) are combined with new data from adults aged 21 to 91; as a necessary step toward that cross-sectional comparison, we first evaluate the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-3 in the adult sample.\nAside from its importance in understanding trait development, research on personality traits in different age groups is a practical necessity for preparing appropriate age norms. Researchers and clinicians are routinely taught that test scores should be interpreted by comparison to normative data, but there is some confusion about which norms are appropriate for different uses. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 banned the use of race and gender norms in job hiring or promotion (Cohen & Swerdlik, 2002) , but many clinicians still prefer to interpret scores using within-gender norms. In this article, we describe normative data for the NEO-PI-3 for various age and gender groups to accommodate different needs for normative information. We also discuss the use and interpretation of age norms and suggest that for many purposes in research and individual assessment, combined-age norms are most meaningful."}, {"section_title": "STUDY 1: SCALE VALIDATION Method", "text": "Participants and procedure. Participants were 652 individuals ranging in age from 21 to 91 who constituted the second phase of a larger study spanning the adolescent and adult lifespan. Age and sex were stratified, with overrepresentation of the early-adult groups, because evidence suggests that age changes are most marked then . Participants responded to two questionnaires, one (Form S) to describe themselves and one (Form R) to describe a target individual with whom they were well acquainted. Protocols were screened for validity using the criteria specified in the NEO manual for validity checks (which ask respondents if they have answered honestly and in the right spaces), random responding (assessed by repetitive strings of identical responses; e.g., more than six consecutive strongly disagrees), and missing items, 1 and all further analyses were conducted on the 635 respondents (356 women, 279 men) who had valid protocols for both Form S and Form R of the NEO-PI-R. Participants resided in 29 states, although most (63.0%) were from Pennsylvania. The sample was predominantly White (92.6%) with 1.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.1% Black, 1.3% Hispanic, and the remainder other or missing ethnicity. High academic achievers were overrepresented in this sample, where 75.6% had more than a high school education and 26.8% more than a baccalaureate degree. Participants were also relatively affluent with only 8.8% reporting annual household incomes less than $20,000 and 19.3% reporting annual household incomes greater than $100,000. English was the first language of all but 4 participants.\nPotential participants were contacted by 1 of 56 undergraduate research assistants from two liberal arts colleges located in the Eastern and Southern United States. Most participants were acquaintances of the research assistants.\nResearch assistants described the study to potential participants, and if an individual expressed interest in participating, the research assistant submitted a referral with the identity, age, and contact information for the participant. Questionnaires were then mailed to participants.\nTo implement the cross-observer design, an attempt was made to recruit participants in pairs in which both individuals were aged 21 and older and both agreed to rate and be rated by the other. Complete data were obtained from 266 pairs. Individuals not paired chose a target they knew well to rate and were asked to specify their relationship to the target. The targets (341 women, 293 men) were siblings (6.8%), friends (18.3%), spouses (63.7%), domestic partners (8.5%), or parents/children (2.7%). Targets ranged in age from 18 to 90.\nResearch assistants were instructed to periodically contact individuals they had recruited and to whom questionnaires had been mailed. They asked these prospective participants whether they had questions about the task, reminded them that they were free to break their work on the questionnaires into sessions of a convenient number and length, and encouraged them to complete the questionnaires. To aid this process, research assistants received, on a weekly basis, a list of the names and phone numbers of persons they had referred in the previous 10 weeks who had not yet returned their questionnaires. When completed questionnaires were received, the participant and the research assistant were each paid $20. These procedures produced response rates of 71.0% for women and 63.1% for men. Although older cohorts generally yielded higher response rates than younger cohorts, the trend was not statistically significant.\nInstruments. The NEO-PI-R is a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 specific traits (or facets), six for each of the five basic personality dimensions: N, E, O, A, and C. Items are answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Scales are roughly balanced to control for the effects of acquiescence. Data on the reliability and validity of the instrument are summarized in the NEO manual . Parallel Form S (for self-report) and Form R (for observer rating) versions have been validated. The instructions and items are the same, except that the items are phrased in the first person in Form S and in the third person in Form R. In the present study, participants were administered a 336-item questionnaire that included the NEO-PI-R items and the 37 replacement items selected for the NEO-PI-3 along with the 59 trial items not selected by McCrae et al. (2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Preliminary analyses. NEO-PI-R items with words unfamiliar to adolescents were replaced in developing the NEO-PI-3. In the present adult sample, respondents were asked to circle any word or phrase they did not understand. Far fewer items were circled in this sample than in the adolescent sample. For example, fastidious was circled by 3.1% of the adult sample but by 11.4% of the adolescent sample. Nevertheless, the same words were problematic for both samples: fastidious (times circled in Form S by adults = 20), panhandlers (9), lackadaisical (9), methodical (9), permissiveness (8), and aesthetic (6). Items with all these words were replaced in the NEO-PI-3.\nRespondents are instructed to leave items blank if they do not understand them. In analyses of Form S data in the present sample, 237 of the NEO-PI-R items and all 240 of the NEO-PI-3 items were answered by more than 98% of the sample, and all but two of the NEO-PI-3 items were answered by more than 99% of the sample.\nTo gauge the representativeness of the sample of 635 valid protocols, we scored the NEO-PI-R and compared mean values with the published adult norms . Both men and women had means within the average range (T = 45-55) for all domains and facets. The most noticeable difference was that men in the present sample scored lower in O (T = 45) than the published values, perhaps because the original norms included especially well-educated men from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (Costa & McCrae, 1986) .\nTo assess the item selection decisions made in developing the NEO-PI-3, we calculated corrected item/facet correlations for the 37 items discarded from the NEO-PI-R and the 37 new items in the NEO-PI-3. For Form S, the correlation for the new item was as high or higher than for the old item in 30 of 37 comparisons, and the median item/ facet correlation for these 37 items increased from .36 to .45.\n2 (For the 240 NEO-PI-3 items, item/facet correlations ranged from .16-.70, median = .47.) For Form R, the correlation for the new item was as high or higher than for the old item in 27 of 37 comparisons, and the median correlation increased from .38 to .48. The new items appear to be appropriate for adult respondents.\nScale analyses. Table 1 reports analyses of scales for both the NEO-PI-R and the NEO-PI-3; they show that both work well in this adult sample, with adequate internal consistency and cross-observer validities that compare favorably to most studies using adults (cf. McCrae, . The NEO-PI-3 scales appear to offer a slight improvement in median internal consistency. Columns 2 and 3 report coefficient alphas for the two versions of Form S. At the domain level, the two versions have equivalent reliability (median \u03b1 = .90); at the facet level, revisions led to alphas that are the same or higher in 17 of the 19 cases. However, an alpha of .54 for O4 (actions) is marginal even in the revision. Columns 5 and 6 report the same statistics for Form R with similar results. Across all 30 facet scales, the median coefficient alpha increases from .75 to .76 for Form S and from .78 to .80 for Form R.\nFor Form S and Form R, respectively, columns 4 and 7 of Table 1 show equivalence correlations between the old and new versions of the scales that were revised. The domain scores are virtually unchanged, with all correlations at .98 or higher. In self-reports, the facet scale correlations range from .86 for A6: Tender-Mindedness (where half the items were changed) to .98. Comparable results are seen for observer ratings. All these correlations support the view that the new scales measure equivalent constructs. However, paired t tests showed significant differences between the old and new versions of 14 of the 19 changed facet scales ranging in magnitude from 0.17 to 1.19 raw score points. Although these differences are rather small, and NEO-PI-R norms might continue to be used with the NEO-PI-3, the present study presents an opportunity to prepare contemporary normative data with different age groups.\nColumns 8 and 9 of Table 1 report cross-observer correlations. Revisions made little difference at the domain level. At the facet level, notable improvements were found for N4: Self-Consciousness), O4: Actions, A6: TenderMindedness, and C2: Order. However, cross-observer validity declined in this sample for C1: Competence.\nFactor structure. Principal component analysis was conducted on Form S and Form R facets for both the NEO-PI-R and the NEO-PI-3. In each case, parallel analysis (Cota, Longman, Stewart, Holden, & Fekken, 1993) clearly indicated the presence of five factors. McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, and Paunonen (1996) recommended that factor replication be evaluated after rotation toward the normative adult Form S structure ; results for Form S are reported in Table 2 . The structures of the original and revision are very similar, and both closely approximate the adult NEO-PI-R structure, with factor congruence coefficients ranging from .97 to .99. Results for Form R are similar, with factor congruence coefficients ranging from .94 to .98 after targeted rotation.\nGender differences. The present sample shows familiar gender differences, with women scoring higher than men on N, E, O, and A factors. We computed d scores contrasting men and women on the facet scales; rank-order correlations across the 30 facets showed that almost identical patterns of gender differences were found for the old and new versions of Form S scales (r = .96, p < .001) and Form R scales (r = .98, p < .001) and that all four sets of scales showed patterns similar to that seen in Costa, Terracciano, and McCrae (2001) for American data (rs = .74 to .85, ps < .001).\nTwo-way ANOVAs were first conducted on Form S and Form R data, using gender and the age group as classifying factors. The expected gender differences were found, with women scoring higher than men in N, E, O, and A, but not C. All 35 domains and facets showed significant age main effects in either self-reports or observer ratings, and 29 of them showed significant, replicated effects in both. However, there were only six significant Gender \u00d7 Age Group interactions for Form S, and only four for Form R, and none of these remained significant after Bonferroni correction.\n3 All subsequent analyses were therefore conducted on combined gender groups.\nAge effects for the five domains, all significant at p < .001, are depicted in Figures 1 to 5 . Age trends are entirely consistent with previous findings: N and E decline crosssectionally with age, whereas A and C increase; O shows a curvilinear trend peaking at age 19. Visual inspection suggests that, except in the case of O, there is no change during adolescence (age 14 to 20), and Scheff\u00e9 post hoc tests show that these five groups do not differ significantly on any of the domains, including O. It is thus sensible to combine them to define adolescent norms. 4 Similarly, groups older than age 30 show very similar mean levels. By Scheff\u00e9 tests, only self-reported A shows evidence of an age difference (adults aged 31 to 40 score lower than adults older than 40). It would be meaningful to combine these four groups into an older adult category.\nIt is less clear how to handle adults in their 20s. With respect to E and O, they appear to resemble adolescents; for N and A, they seem closer to older adults; and in C, they are intermediate. Scheff\u00e9 tests show that individuals from the first and latter half of this decade do not differ from each other, so it is possible to make separate norms applicable to men and women in their 20s. For practical purposes, however, having multiple sets of norms is cumbersome. Individuals older than age 21 are legally adults, and the difference between adults in their 20s and older adults is small in magnitude, so it may be reasonable to continue the practice of the NEO-PI-R and offer a single set of adult norms for everyone 21 and older.\nThe data in the figures are plotted against one last standard-namely, norms for the total group. Given that the structure of personality is essentially unchanged across the lifespan after age 14 and that the same set of questions validly assesses the constructs in different age groups, it is meaningful to compare scores to norms from all age groups combined.\nThe hypothesis of Costa and McCrae (2002) that the rate of change would be higher in early than in later adulthood was partially supported. Curvilinear regression on the continuous data showed significant quadratic effects for N and C in both Form S and Form R data and for A in Form R data. As Figure 6 depicts, N declined and C and A increased cross-sectionally more rapidly for younger respondents. However, only linear effects were significant for E and O, and for A in self-reports. Details of the regressions are reported in Table 3 , which shows that the linear effects (first line for each entry, first data column) ranged from -1.16 T-score points per decade for observer-rated O to 2.17 T-score points per decade for self-reported A. These rates of change are consistent with previous results in several cultures (McCrae, Costa, Hr# eb\u00edc# kov\u00e1, et al., 2004) .\nFigures 7 through 11 present developmental curves for the 30 facet scales for Form R data. (Form S data showed very similar curves.) Where significant quadratic effects were found, the quadratic regression is plotted; otherwise, the linear regression is plotted.\n5 In general, facets followed the trend of the domain to which they are assigned, but considerable variation was found in trajectories in the O and especially E domains. O1: Fantasy shows a steep curvilinear decline, whereas O5: Ideas does not decline with age. Among E facets, E1: Warmth increases (perhaps because it has a secondary loading on A), E3: Assertiveness has a curvilinear shape peaking in middle age (cf. Helson & Kwan, 2000) , and E5: Excitement-Seeking declines dramatically (cf. Zuckerman, 1979) . Similar effects have been reported for E facets in longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling analyses (Costa, McCrae, & Terracciano, 2004) . In general, age trends for the facets resemble those found in other cultures (McCrae & Costa, in press ). Thus, the NEO-PI-3 facet scales appear to show the same pancultural developmental trends as the NEO-PI-R facet scales."}, {"section_title": "STUDY 2: AGE DIFFERENCES IN NEO-PI-3 SCALES", "text": "Analyses in Study 1 suggest that the NEO-PI-3 works at least as well as the NEO-PI-R when administered to NOTE: N = 635 except for cross-observer correlations (n = 532, 266 couples).

They were predominantly White (84.6%), and high academic achievers were overrepresented in the sample. They completed the 336-item questionnaire described in Study 1 from which the NEO-PI-3 was scored.

However, there is a good deal of evidence that O4 validly assesses its intended construct. In the present study, it shows cross-observer agreement (r = .42) and loads strongly (.54) on the O factor. Other studies have shown that the NEO-PI-R O facet is longitudinally stable (Costa et al., 2000) and heritable (Jang, McCrae, Angleitner, Riemann, & Livesley, 1998) at levels comparable to other NEO-PI-R facets, and O4: Actions has also demonstrated discriminant validity (Costa & McCrae, 1995; . In this instance, relatively poor internal consistency does not appear to diminish the validity or utility of the scale. In Study 2, the NEO-PI-3 was used to refine our understanding of developmental trends. Individuals aged 18, 19, and 20 were oversampled with the expectation that change would be most pronounced in these years (cf. Robins et al., 2001 ). However, Figures 1 to 5 show that in the present study, little change occurs in these years; the period of transition appears instead to be in the decade of the 20s. Given that the rate of change of most personality traits is less than 2 T-score points per decade, much larger sample sizes are probably needed to estimate precisely when change occurs."}, {"section_title": "The Interpretation and Use of Age Norms", "text": "We have proposed NEO-PI-3 norms for different age and gender groups. The effect of using gender-specific norms is to eliminate gender differences, which might be appropriate, for example, if a researcher wished to understand the influence of personality net of gender effects. However, gender-specific norms cannot be used in hiring or promotion decisions, so combined gender norms are also needed.\nAlthough the rate of change in personality trait mean levels is slow, the cumulative effect during a lifetime approaches one full standard deviation, so the issue of age norms must also be considered. We have suggested one to three age groupings, although it seems likely that published versions of the NEO-PI-3 will report norms only for adolescents and adults 21 and older. That choice would make NEO-PI-3 data more comparable to NEO-PI-R data; The consequence of using a single set of adult norms is that respondents aged 21 to 30 will score a few T-score points higher on N, E, and O and a few points lower on A and C than they would if early adult norms were used (and the reverse for adults older than age 30). It may seem that this introduces a small distortion into the scores of all adults, but an argument can be made that it does not.\nNorming test scores serves two fundamentally different purposes. The first is to make different tests comparable. Raw scores on the NEO-PI-3 N scale could not be compared to raw scores from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975 ) N scale, but if both were converted to T-scores using comparable normative samples, meaningful comparisons could be made. Similarly, if the NEO-PI-3 functioned differently in young adults and in older adults-if raw scales failed to show scalar equivalence (Van de Vijver & Leung, 1997) across age groups-then age norming would be required.\nBut there is no evidence that the NEO-PI-3 functions differently in these two age groups. Adults in their 20s score higher on N than older adults because they are, in fact, higher in N, as is seen in the higher incidence of N-related psychopathology such as borderline personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) . Adults in their 20s score lower on A and C because they, in fact, are less agreeable and conscientious, as is seen in the higher rates of criminal behavior in this age group (e.g., murder rates; see Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2003) . From this perspective, a single set of adult age norms provides a more accurate depiction of personality than the use of more differentiated age norms would. By extension, the same could be said for using a single set of norms for both adolescents and adults. That practice would preserve the age differences shown in Figures 1 to 5 and would be a reminder to clinicians and others dealing with adolescents that they tend to be high in N, E, and O and low in A and C.\nThere is, however, a second legitimate use for norms, which is to describe an individual relative to a known group. For example, counselors who work exclusively with adolescents may already have a good sense of what adolescent personality is like, and it may be more useful to them to see scores that reflect a client's standing relative to that reference group: Is the client even less conscientious than the average teenager? Such a view of the data may suggest the need for an intervention that might be ignored if low C were regarded simply as a normal attribute of adolescents. Particularly for those accustomed to their use, age norms may be helpful in understanding personality scores. Thomas A. Martin, Ph.D., is a professor of psychology at Susquehanna University.
