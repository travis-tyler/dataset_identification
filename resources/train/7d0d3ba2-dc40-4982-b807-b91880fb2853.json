Using nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002, the report analyzes a recent cohort of high school graduates (the class of 2004) as of 2012, eight years after they had completed high school. This group of students entered college and the labor force at a time of significant economic challenges-challenges that CTE has often been called upon to help address. By understanding the characteristics of these high school CTE participants and examining their employment status and earnings relative to nonparticipants, the report provides a portrait of the extent to which CTE may help high school students succeed in the workforce beyond the first few years of secondary school. This report also takes a rare opportunity to compare the labor market outcomes of high school CTE students in two different decades by examining data from ELS:2002 and its predecessor study, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). This places the circumstances of the high school class of 2004 in a broader context in which the progress of CTE students can be measured against a prior cohort as well as against non-CTE students from their own graduating class. This report provides national statistics about labor market outcomes of CTE participants at different levels, including those who concentrate on a particular field of study in high school, as well as detailed results for concentrators by their specific field. Results are presented overall and are often broken down by postsecondary education attainment and background factors, such as gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Key findings are summarized below. It is important to note that the findings in this report cannot be used to draw conclusions about the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the law that currently authorizes federal funding for career and technical education, because the students described in this report graduated from high school two years prior to its enactment. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 was the law in effect at the time the class of 2004 attended high school and participated in secondary career and technical education courses.

For the purposes of this report, high school CTE students are divided into four groups based on the number of occupational credits they earn during high school (Dalton et al. 2013). Occupational credits refer to credits in courses designed for specific labor market preparation in a field or area of study. Examples include business, computer and information sciences, manufacturing, and repair and transportation. The current report focuses on the following four groups: 1 Nonparticipants: Earned less than one occupational CTE credit Samplers: Earned one to two occupational CTE credits in one or more fields Explorers: Earned three or more occupational CTE credits, but no three credits in any single occupational CTE field Concentrators: Earned three or more occupational CTE credits in at least one occupational CTE field The report focuses on comparing CTE concentrators to nonparticipants, although results are presented for all groups. 2 \u2022 Eighteen percent of students from the high school class of 2004 concentrated in one or more CTE fields of study (table 1). Forty-two percent earned at least three CTE credits but did not concentrate in a single area. \u2022 Among the largest group of CTE concentrators are those focusing on business studies, composing 16 percent of all concentrators, more than all areas except agriculture and natural resources, and communications and design (table 2). Among the smallest group of concentrators (1 percent) are those focusing on public services (e.g., protective services, legal studies, or teaching). \u2022 The following groups were more likely to be CTE concentrators: males (57 percent versus 43 percent of females); students from the lowest socioeconomic \u2022 The most heavily female field of study is consumer and culinary services, with 89 percent of all concentrators being female; the most heavily male fields of study are repair and transportation, and manufacturing (both 95 percent male) (table 2). \u2022 A lower percentage of CTE concentrators earned a bachelor's degree or higher within eight years of completing high school than nonparticipants (27 percent vs. 49 percent, respectively (table 3). CTE concentrators were more likely to have completed only a high school education than nonparticipants (17 percent vs. 6 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Employment and Earnings Outcomes of High School CTE Students From the Class of 2004 in 2012", "text": "Employment and earnings were reported for those not currently enrolled in college. \u2022 There were no statistically significant differences in employment status among students with different levels of high school CTE participation. Between 75 and 77 percent of high school completers from 2004, depending on CTE participation level, were working full time in 2012; another 8 to 11 percent either were working part time or unemployed (table 5). \u2022 Labor force participation rates (the total of working full-time, part-time, or unemployed) were also high and consistent across CTE fields of study. However, some groups were more likely than others to have a particular employment status. For example, CTE concentrators in engineering technologies were more likely (92 percent) than peers in consumer and culinary services (54 percent) to be working full time (table 7). \u2022 There was little variation in the percent of the high school class of 2004 that was ever unemployed, or in the average number of months unemployed since 2009, by CTE participation level or concentrator field of study (tables 10 and 11). \u2022 Although results show that high school CTE concentrators have a nominally higher median income ($29,000) than nonparticipants ($26,000), the differences EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 xiv are not statistically significant (table 13). Hourly wages were also no different across CTE participation levels (table 14). \u2022 However, CTE concentrators who had earned an associate degree had a higher median annual income ($34,000) than nonparticipants with an associate degree ($22,000) (table 13)."}, {"section_title": "The Class of 2004 Versus the Class of 1992", "text": "The high school class of 2004, surveyed in 2012, was compared to the high school class of 1992, surveyed in 2000. These cohorts experienced postsecondary life in the eight years after high school under very different circumstances. \u2022 When comparing the class of 2004 to the class of 1992, there are no statistically significant differences in labor force participation rates by CTE participation level or concentrator field of study (table 19). \u2022 There are some differences in the percent working full time and the percent unemployed, however. In 2012, 77 percent of CTE concentrators were working full time, compared to 85 percent in 2000. Computer and information science concentrators were also less likely to work full time in 2012 versus 2000 (75 percent vs. 99 percent). Computer and information science concentrators were the only concentrators for whom a significant difference was observed (table  19). \u2022 Students at all CTE participation levels were more likely to be unemployed in 2012 than in 2000. Eight to 10 percent of the class of 2004 were unemployed in 2012, but only 2 to 4 percent of the class of 1992 were unemployed in 2000 (table 19). \u2022 As with employment status, there were no differences in median annual income or median hourly wage by CTE participation level within the class of 1992 in 2000 or within the class of 2004 in 2012 (table 23).

EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 xv"}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Overall, the report finds that, despite differences in background and postsecondary education and training, high school CTE participants are remarkably similar to nonparticipants in their employment and earnings outcomes. There are no significant differences in employment status, experiences of unemployment, or annual earnings by level of CTE participation. These results are encouraging but also provide sober reminders that recent high school and postsecondary graduates face challenging economic conditions. In both cohorts studied, results clearly indicate that, despite less advantaged backgrounds, CTE students fare just as well as their nonparticipating counterparts. At the same time, the findings show that recent CTE students and nonparticipants face an unfriendly economic climate that is markedly worse than that experienced by their peers a dozen years before. Further, while it is encouraging that CTE participants from 2004 were not more adversely affected than nonparticipants by the Great Recession, as their skills age, they may be at risk of falling behind due to economic restructuring that favors high-skill, nonautomated work. To the extent that higher education can help protect high school CTE participants' achievements and improve their long-term outcomes-as seen in the wage premium observed for CTE concentrators with an associate degree-policy can be geared toward ensuring access to college and building on the futures that CTE students established for themselves in high school.

One critical part of this pathway is the role that high school serves in providing an academic and practical foundation to meet the challenges of postsecondary life. The transition from high school to college or to the world of work can be a financially challenging and intellectually and emotionally demanding process. Recent cohorts of high school and college graduates face a particularly daunting set of obstacles in a slowly recovering job market amid a transition in the labor force away from manual labor and lowskill manufacturing and toward medium-skill jobs and information-intense occupations (Goldin and Katz 2008). Students who build a foundation in career and technical education (CTE) in high school may be well prepared to weather these challenges and emerge with stable jobs and long-term prospects for a productive life (Bishop and Mane 2005;CCSSO 2014;Stone, Alfeld, and Pearson 2008). This study uses nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002 to provide a portrait of the successes and failures of a recent cohort of high school graduates (the class of 2004) who entered college and the labor force at a time of rapidly increasing costs for postsecondary education and a massive disruption in economic opportunities due to the Great Recession. These data represent one of the few sources of national-level information on the medium-term outcomes of high school CTE students. In combination with ELS:2002's predecessor study, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), this report also takes a rare opportunity to compare the labor market outcomes of high school CTE students in two different decades. This places the circumstances of the high school class of 2004 in a broader context in which the progress of CTE students can be measured against a prior cohort as well as against non-CTE students from their own graduating class. It is important to note that the findings in this report cannot be used to draw conclusions about the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the law that currently authorizes federal funding for career and technical education, because the students described in this report graduated from high school two years prior to its enactment. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 was the law in effect at the time the class EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 2 of 2004 attended high school and participated in secondary career and technical education courses. The report builds on similar reports written for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (Bersudskaya and Chen 2011;Ingels et al. 2002;Laird, Chen, and Levesque 2006;Staklis and Ho 2012). Like the prior analyses, this report documents variations in the education and workforce preparation of high school CTE students, their employment status and work intensity, unemployment experiences, earnings, and other outcomes related to the match between high school CTE focus and job field, perceptions of work, and educational and overall debt. Findings are generally reported both by overall CTE participation statusthat is, the extent to which a student focused on a particular CTE field in high school-and, for those that concentrated in a CTE area, by high school CTE field. Results are further presented by highest education attainment level reached. In addition, for selected measures, the report compares the outcomes of 2004 graduates with CTE participants from the class of 1992, for whom similar data are available. Where sample sizes allow, the report also examines work outcomes by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The remainder of this report includes the following three sections: \u2022 Data and Methods"}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Results", "text": "\u2022 The same students, along with additional students included to provide a representative sample of high school seniors, were surveyed again in 2004, and their high school transcripts were collected and systematically coded and standardized. A second follow up was conducted in 2006, when most were two years beyond high school graduation. The basis for the current proposed study is the third follow-up, conducted in 2012, when most study respondents were eight years beyond high school completion. The third follow-up is a survey of study participants. Respondents provided information on their employment, training, occupation, and earnings, as well as information about postsecondary degrees, majors, minors, and enrollment histories. A subsequent data collection will obtain and code study participants' postsecondary transcripts. 3 The report also uses data from NELS:88, which began with a survey of spring-term eighthgraders in 1988. These students, along with additional sample members added to ensure national representation of subsequent grades, were surveyed again in 1990 (when most were 10th-graders) and again in 1992 (when most were 12th-graders). As with ELS:2002, high school transcripts were then collected, coded, and standardized (both studies standardized to the same course classification system). Subsequent surveys were undertaken in 1994 and 2000. The 2000 survey, which was the fourth and final follow-up of NELS:88 participants, is the basis of NELS:88 analyses conducted for this report and likewise corresponds to a time eight years after students had completed high school. Key Definitions. For both ELS:2002 and NELS:88, high school CTE students are defined in two ways. First, students are defined by their levels of participation in occupational CTE courses. CTE courses are divided into three broad areas: family and consumer sciences (such as home economics); general labor market courses (such as keyboarding); and specific labor market preparation (SLMP) courses, also referred to as occupational courses. Occupational courses include classes in fields as diverse as agriculture, business, computer and information sciences, and manufacturing. Because occupational courses represent the most specific form of CTE, relating to preparation and training in specific career, technical, and vocational fields, the definition of a CTE student used in this report focuses on their involvement in these courses. High school students are classified in one of four categories based on their earned credit in occupational courses (Dalton et al. 2013)  Analysis sample. ELS:2002 enables projections to the nationally representative population of 10th-graders in 2002 or 12th-graders in 2004. Because the focus of this report is on the occupational outcomes of high school CTE participants, and because CTE participation status is simplest to define at the end of high school, this report focuses on 12th-graders who graduated by the end of summer 2004. Thus, the report does not address issues related to the role of CTE in encouraging high school persistence and completion. In addition, to align with public policy interests, the analysis only includes students who attended a public school. Analysis sample members were in the 12th grade in 2004 (or 1992 for NELS:88 sample members); graduated from high school (with a regular diploma or alternative credential) by the end of August 2004 (or 1992); responded to both the end-of-high school survey and the eight-year follow-up survey; had complete high school transcript records; and met minimum credit requirements of at least 16 credits overall and a nonzero amount of English credits. The total number of cases analyzed for this report was 6,988 for ELS:2002 and 7,046 for NELS:88. 5"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "All results project to the national 12th-grade population in 2004 (for ELS:2002) or the national 12th-grade population of 1992 (for NELS:88). The analyses take into account the complex survey designs of both studies to generate estimates of the variability of a particular result. These estimates of variability, called standard errors, were then used when comparing two results (e.g., two percentages or two means) to determine whether the difference between them was due to chance or likely represented a real difference in the populationthat is, whether it was statistically significant. Comparisons of percentages and means used Student's t values to test for statistical significance. The statistical significance of each comparison was determined by calculating the t value for the difference between each pair of means or proportions and comparing the t value with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 6 where 1 \u0305 and 2 \u0305 are the estimates to be compared, and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. When making a part-to-whole comparison, for example, comparing the percentage of CTE concentrators who were employed full time to all students who were employed full time, the following formula was used. This formula takes the covariance of the two estimates into account when computing the t value: Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of discovering a false positive (i.e., that a difference is identified as significant when it is actually not significant). Statistical testing uses a value denoted by \u03b1 (alpha) to define the level of confidence that a finding is statistically significant by chance. In a single, two-tailed test of statistical significance, an alpha level of 0.05 is commonly chosen, representing a confidence level of 95 percent. However, because multiple comparisons are made in this report simultaneously, which increases the likelihood of false positives, a lower alpha of 0.001 was chosen, representing a confidence level of 99.9 percent. This alpha level was chosen based on a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, where the typical alpha (0.05) is divided by the number of comparisons made, n. In this case, n was set at 30, which is representative of the number of comparisons in the average figure in this report. Values in the tables that do not meet minimum sample size criteria are suppressed in the tables and designated with a special symbol ( \u2021). Values whose estimates are unstable are flagged with exclamation marks. For percentages, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error is 5 or more (meaning that the true value lies in a range of about +/-20 percentage points, based on an alpha level of 0.05). For means, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error of the mean is one-third or more as large as the estimate. For more detailed information on statistical procedures, see Appendix A.\nAll results from ELS:2002 are weighted by the first follow-up to third follow-up transcript weight (F3F1TSCWT) and project to the 12th-grade population of 2004 (G12COHRT=1 or 2). Balanced repeated replication (BRR) weights (F3F1T001 through F3F1T200) are used to adjust standard errors for the complex survey design of ELS:2002. Similarly, all results from NELS:88 are weighted by the fourth follow-up transcript weight (F4TRSCWT); however, given that BRR weights were not created for NELS:88, Taylor series linearization using the primary sampling unit (PSU) and sampling strata (STRATUM) were used to calculate standard errors. Some key analytical variables were imputed by NCES. These include eight-year follow-up employment status, occupation, total earnings, and highest level of education attained; in no case did the percent of cases imputed exceed 10 percent. More information about imputation, as well as about weights, can be found in Ingels et al. (2014) for ELS:2002 andCurtin et al. (2002) for NELS:88. This analysis compares means and proportions using a student's t test. Differences between estimates were tested against the probability of a Type I error 9 or significance level. The statistical significance of each comparison was determined by calculating the t value for the difference between each pair of means or proportions and comparing the t value with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: 9 A Type I error occurs when one concludes that a difference observed in a sample reflects a true difference in the population from which the sample was drawn, when no such difference is present. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 A-10 where 1 \u0305 and 2 \u0305 are the estimates to be compared, and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. When making part-to-whole comparisons, for example, comparing the percentage of CTE concentrators who were employed full time to all students who were employed full time, the following formula was used. This formula takes the covariance of the two estimates into account when computing the t value: There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related to the observed differences in the estimates and the number of respondents in the categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large (and thus possibly statistically significant) t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a false positive or type I error. Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of this type of error using a value denoted by \u03b1 (alpha), which defines the level of confidence that a finding is statistically significant by chance. In a single, two-tailed test of statistical significance, an alpha level of 0.05 is commonly chosen, representing a confidence level of 95 percent. However, because multiple comparisons are made in this report simultaneously, which increases the likelihood of type I errors, a lower alpha of 0.001 was chosen, representing a confidence level of 99.9 percent. This alpha level was chosen based on a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, where the typical alpha (0.05) is divided by the number of comparisons made, n. In this case, n was set at 30, which is representative of the number of comparisons in the average figure in this report. Choosing a single n simplifies interpretation and promotes consistency in significance testing. When analysts test hypotheses that show alpha values at the 0.001 level or smaller, they reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. Failing to reject a null hypothesis (i.e., detect a difference), however, does not imply the values are the same or equivalent. Values in the tables that do not meet minimum sample size criteria are suppressed in the tables and designated with a special symbol ( \u2021). Values whose estimates are unstable are flagged with EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 A-11 exclamation marks. For percentages, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error is 5 or more (meaning that the true value lies in a range of about +/-20 percentage points, based on an alpha level of 0.05); for means, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error of the mean is one-third or more as large as the estimate."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "This report presents results by high school CTE participation level and high school field of study for CTE concentrators. CTE concentration, defined as having earned three or more credits in one or more occupational CTE areas, does not necessarily correspond to defined curricula or programs as experienced by students or designed by schools. For example, EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 7 students may have completed programs that involved taking courses across two or more occupational areas. The current study mitigates against this possibility by presenting results for CTE explorers, who earn at least three occupational CTE credits but do not do so in one particular area; these students may have completed a course of study as defined by the school or perceived by employers. Results presented by field of study (for CTE concentrators) are limited by small sample sizes. When outcomes for students who concentrated in a field of study are broken down further (e.g., by highest education attainment level), results often must be suppressed due to small sample sizes or flagged as unstable, as defined earlier. For this reason, the focus of this report is on differences between CTE concentrators and nonparticipants. Readers are advised that observational studies such as ELS:2002 and NELS:88 cannot support rigorous causal inferences. Students who participate in CTE in high school may differ on a variety of preexisting characteristics; differences in outcomes between participants and nonparticipants (or among concentrators in different CTE fields) may reflect the types of students who chose to pursue or not pursue CTE rather than the influence of CTE itself. Although care is taken in this report to show how high school CTE students differ from nonparticipants, no statistical adjustments have been made to estimate the extent to which outcomes derive from preexisting student characteristics. Even using such statistical adjustments, there may remain unmeasured heterogeneity in the population of high school CTE students for which observational surveys and data collections cannot account. Instead of establishing causality, the results presented here are intended to spark further investigation and conversation about the contribution of high school CTE to student outcomes in later life.

A minority of students (18 percent) concentrated in a field of study; another 21 percent took at least three credits in occupational CTE courses but did not concentrate (explorer). Twenty percent of students took less than one credit in CTE (nonparticipant).

Similarly, students from the lowest SES quartile (bottom 25 percent) were more likely than students from the highest SES quartile (top 25 percent) to concentrate in an occupational area as well (26 percent vs. 17 percent), although students from the second and third SES quartiles were also more likely to be concentrators than the highest SES quartile. Repeating this pattern, students who scored in the bottom quartile of ELS:2002's 2004 math assessment were more likely to concentrate in a CTE field than students from the top quartile (30 percent vs. 18 percent).  Table 1 provides more detail about the differences in background participation by student characteristics, including additional differences by race/ethnicity, disability status, academic concentration, and academic course grade point average (GPA). The results are consistent with those presented in figure 3: High school CTE concentrators are more likely to come from disadvantaged student backgrounds and to be less academically prepared than students who are nonparticipants.

"}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Concentrators in Different Fields", "text": "Additional differences in CTE students are apparent when considering the fields of study in which CTE students concentrate. Figure 4 shows one such example: the percentage of males versus females in each field of study. The most heavily female field of study is consumer and culinary services, with 89 percent of all concentrators being female, followed by health sciences (79 percent) and business (63 percent). The most heavily male fields of study are repair and transportation and manufacturing (both 95 percent male), followed by construction and architecture (87 percent), engineering technologies (83 percent), computer and information science (82 percent), and agriculture and natural resources (72 percent). Fields in which there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of females versus males were communications and design (60 percent female), marketing (52 percent female), and public services (57 percent female).  Table 2 shows additional results for students in the lowest SES quartile and lowest math assessment quartile, as well as differences in average academic course GPA, by field of study. There were few significant differences across fields for the percent in the lowest SES quartile, but consumer and culinary services students were more likely to be in the lowest math assessment quartile-indeed, 51 percent of them were-than students in agriculture  and natural resources, business, computer and information science, engineering technologies, and marketing. This is despite the fact that students in consumer and culinary services were overwhelmingly females, who typically perform better academically than males. Students in communications and design had among the highest average academic GPAs, at 2.80 (compared to, for example, 2.17 for concentrators in repair and transportation). These results reinforce the important point that CTE students, both overall and in any given field, differ from non-CTE students in significant ways. Any interpretation of the outcomes of high school students must consider the ways in which CTE concentrators (or those with other levels of CTE participation) hail from less advantaged backgrounds and how concentrators in specific fields differ from those in other fields. Although this report does not attempt to account for these differences statistically, the remainder of the discussion will point to this key finding as valuable context in understanding the outcomes of high school students who engage in CTE. Before considering the labor force outcomes of CTE students-the main focus of this report-it is critical to also consider the postsecondary educational and training experiences of high school CTE students. High school CTE students may pursue different paths through postsecondary school and into the workforce, which can strongly influence their subsequent occupational outcomes and earnings."}, {"section_title": "Education Attainment", "text": "On average, 38 percent of all graduates from the high school class of 2004 earned a bachelor's degree or advanced degree by 2012, eight years after they had completed their secondary education (table 3).

The percentage of nonparticipants who earned a bachelor's or higher degree or certificate was higher (49 percent) than the percentage of CTE concentrators (27 percent [total from unrounded values]), with CTE samplers and explorers falling in between. At the lower end of postsecondary education attainment, 6 percent of nonparticipants completed only a high school education compared to 17 percent of CTE concentrators. Overall, figure 5 clearly shows that higher levels of CTE participation in high school are associated with lower levels of education attainment within eight years of completing high school. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 16  Table 3 presents an additional breakdown of education attainment by high school CTE field of study. Computer and information science concentrators were more likely to earn a bachelor's degree (33 percent) than concentrators in construction and architecture (8 percent), consumer and culinary services (11 percent), and repair and transportation (3 percent). Repair and transportation concentrators were more likely to earn only a high school credential (35 percent) than concentrators in a number of other areas, including business (12 percent), health sciences (10 percent), and marketing (6 percent).

Among those with a current job in 2012, 70 percent reported that their job required a certification or license.

Results are presented for CTE students overall and broken down by highest level of education attained by 2012. It is important to remember that these outcomes are not adjusted for preexisting differences between CTE students and nonstudents. It is also important to consider the general economic environment of the high school class of 2004 in the years between their high school completion and 2012. This was a period marked by strong growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) from 2004-08, followed by the largest economic disruption in U.S. history since the Great Depression. Although economic growth resumed in 2010, the after-effects of the Great Recession continued to linger. These effects were especially long and pronounced for specific industries, such as housing, related to the fields of study of many high school CTE students. The year 2012 represents the culmination of years of disruption followed by slow growth; for four-year college graduates who typically completed a bachelor's degree in 2008 or later, the timing of these events could exert an especially profound negative effect on employment and earnings opportunities.

The figure only presents results for those that were not currently enrolled in a postsecondary education institution. Perhaps surprisingly, there was very little variation in employment status among students with different levels of high school CTE participation. Between 75 and 77 percent of high school completers from 2004 were working full time in 2012; another 8 to 11 percent each were working part time or unemployed. This results in a labor force participation rate of 95 to 96 percent. None of the small differences evident in this figure are statistically significant. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 20  Table 5, which presents the same outcomes broken down by field of study, is consistent with these results, showing high rates of labor force participation and few detectable differences across CTE fields of study. Figure 7 illustrates part of table 5, showing the percentage of the non-college-enrolled class of 2004 that was working full time, by high school CTE field of study. Again, few statistically significant differences are detectable across high school fields of study. The high school CTE concentrators most likely to be working full time were those in engineering technologies at 92 percent and public services at 90 percent. They were more likely than their peers in consumer and culinary services (54 percent) to be working full time.   From the perspective of CTE, these results are encouraging when the aforementioned differences in the backgrounds of high school CTE students are considered. Recall that CTE concentrators, for example, were less likely to earn higher levels of postsecondary education, left high school with lower levels of academic preparation, and hailed from less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds than their peers with less or no CTE involvement. The extent to which high school CTE may have improved CTE participants' prospects, or led to postsecondary education programs that did the same, cannot be determined from these findings, but the results are consistent with such an interpretation and suggest a potentially powerful role for CTE in early career outcomes. Tables 6 through 9 present detailed results for percentages of the class of 2004 in 2012 in the labor force (i.e., full time, part time, or unemployed combined), working full time, working part time, and unemployed, by high school CTE participation level and concentrator field of study.

Figure 8 shows the percentage of the (non-college enrolled) class of 2004 that had ever been unemployed. Between 36 and 38 percent of students with different CTE levels of participation reported having ever been unemployed (differences not statistically significant). Results further broken down by highest level of education attainment also show no statistically significant differences (table 10). There were very few differences by concentrator field of study, as well.  Tables 11 and 12 provide similar results for the average number of months members of the class of 2004 in 2012 were unemployed since 2009 (between eight and 10 months, depending on CTE participation level, with no statistically significant differences) and the average number of months of the longest unemployment spell experienced (seven to eight months, also no statistically significant differences).

Table 13 shows additional detail by highest educational level attained, where there were also few detectable differences. One difference is that concentrators who had earned an associate degree had higher median annual income ($34,000) than nonparticipants with an associate degree ($22,000).

Some differences across concentrator fields of study were evident: The median high school CTE concentrator in engineering technologies earned more per hour ($19.00) than those in business ($14.00), consumer and culinary services ($11.36), or health sciences ($13.85).

The one large and noticeable finding is that construction and architecture concentrators were significantly more likely than all other concentrators to be working in their field. Indeed, 95 percent of all high school construction and architecture concentrators who were working in 2012 were in that field. This is important evidence for the efficacy of high school CTE in either attracting students whose long-term interests are in construction or architecture, or shaping their interests and pathways to the degree that they go into that line of work as adults.   Business, consumer and culinary services, health sciences, and repair and transportation concentrators were among the other groups with higher levels of matching between high school field of study and occupation eight years after high school completion.

High school CTE concentrators were more likely to have changed their occupational expectations than nonparticipants: 56 percent of nonparticipants did not experience a change in occupational expectations, while 38 percent of CTE concentrators saw no change. Not only were their expectations more likely to change, but CTE concentrators were more likely to see their occupational expectations increase after high school than nonparticipants (24 percent vs. 14 percent, respectively     "}, {"section_title": "Debt and Debt-to-Earnings Ratio", "text": "The debt that students accrue in pursuing postsecondary education, as well as debt incurred elsewhere, can be large burdens, especially for individuals working in less remunerative fields.

The results, presented in table 18, showed no statistically significant differences by CTE participation level and scattered association with CTE fields of study.  Changes in Employment and Earnings Between the High School Classes of 2004 and1992 The contrast between the economic environment faced by the high school class of 2004 and the one faced by the class of 1992 in the eight years after their respective high school completions is stark. Between 1992 and 2000, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent, with no year of near-zero or negative growth. Between 2004 and 2012, however, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent, with no growth in 2008 and -3 percent growth in 2009 (World Bank 2015). In other words, the U.S. economy was expanding at about half the rate in the latter period as in the former. This contrasting environment may have resulted in very different outcomes for high school CTE students, both for those who pursued postsecondary education and those who did not. This section compares the employment status, earnings, and work experiences of the class of 2004 (using results from ELS:2002) to the class of 1992 (using results from NELS:88). All earnings data have been adjusted to 2012 dollars."}, {"section_title": "Employment Status", "text": "The results in the prior section indicate that, despite differences in background and academic preparedness, high school CTE students from the class of 2004 experienced employment and earnings outcomes that were not noticeably different from those of CTE nonparticipants. Table 19 compares these outcomes to those of the class of 1992 and shows that the same was true in 2000: high labor force participation rates, no statistically significant differences across levels of CTE participation, and few differences across CTE fields of study. When comparing the class of 2004 to the class of 1992, there are no statistically significant differences in labor force participation by CTE participation level or concentrator field of study.  There are some differences in the percentage working full time and the percentage unemployed however. In 2012, 77 percent of CTE concentrators and 76 percent of CTE explorers (who had earned at least three occupational credits but did not concentrate in a CTE area) were working full time, compared with 85 and 86 percent (respectively) in 2000. Computer and information science concentrators were also less likely to work full time in 2012 versus 2000 (75 percent vs. 99 percent)-the only concentrators for whom a significant difference was observed. The more consistent result is that students of all CTE participation levels were more likely to be unemployed in 2012 than in 2000. Eight to 10 percent of the class of 2004 were unemployed in 2012, but only 2 to 4 percent of the class of 1992 were unemployed in 2000. This is direct evidence for the striking difference in economic opportunities facing the two cohorts. However, in no case were high school CTE participants more or less likely than their peers to have a given employment status when compared to nonparticipants from their own cohort. That is, CTE participation in high school may have had, at worst, no impact on employment status and, at best, a positive impact in helping students overcome their disadvantaged backgrounds. Further breakdowns by gender, race/ethnicity, and SES are provided in tables 20, 21, and 22 (respectively). Male CTE concentrators and explorers were less likely in 2012 to work full time than their peers in 2000 (85 percent vs. 95 percent for concentrators; 84 percent vs. 93 percent for explorers); and male CTE concentrators, explorers, and samplers were all more likely to be unemployed (e.g., 8 percent vs. 2 percent for concentrators). There were no differences detected related to full-time work for female CTE concentrators when compared to their peers in 2000. Asian CTE concentrators were less likely to be working full time in 2012 than in 2000 (64 percent vs. 96 percent). White CTE participants at all levels (sampler, explorer, and concentrator) were more likely to be unemployed in 2012 than in 2000. Finally, the only differences for CTE concentrators by SES quartile were among those in the second quartile: in 2012, they were less likely to be working full time and more likely to be unemployed than in 2000. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 43     All of these results are consistent with the economic shocks visited on students and workers of all backgrounds during the later period. During both time periods, however, there were few to no statistically significant differences in employment status by CTE participation level.

There were changes across cohorts in income and wages, however (2000 wages adjusted to 2012 dollars 6 ). All CTE groups-nonparticipants and participants-saw a decline in their median annual income, and CTE samplers also saw their median hourly wage decline. Figure 12 also illustrates cross-cohort differences by concentrator field of study. However, only the drop in median income for high school students concentrating in manufacturing (from $41,230 to $25,000) was statistically significant. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 49 There were also no within-cohort differences across CTE participation levels in the average hours worked per week or the percent having received employer training for either cohort (table 23). There were changes across cohorts, but not for CTE concentrators. The percentage reporting having received employer training declined for all but CTE concentrators (e.g., from 62 to 48 percent for CTE explorers [the change for CTE concentrators was not statistically significant]), and the average hours worked per week declined two to three hours for CTE samplers and CTE explorers. Additional detail about median annual income in both cohorts is provided in table 24, which shows results by gender, race/ethnicity, and SES. Male CTE concentrators had higher median income than female CTE concentrators in both cohorts, and there was no statistically significant change in male CTE concentrators' earnings across cohorts. The only cross-cohort difference for CTE concentrators was for blacks, who earned substantially less in 2012 than in 2000 ($20,000 vs. $37,240). There was only one cross-cohort difference for CTE concentrators by SES as well (in 2012, CTE concentrators from the second SES quartile earned $30,000, compared to $37,240 in 2000). EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 51 Overall, the results of comparing the two cohorts suggest much stability in the contribution of CTE to employment and earnings, at least relative to their own times. The economic opportunities for all students were worse in the latter period, as fewer reported working full time and more reported being unemployed. CTE students were not immune to these difficulties.  "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Conclusion", "text": "This report examined the labor market outcomes of a set of former high school career and technical education (CTE) students who encountered significant economic headwinds in their postsecondary lives. The results provide three clear lessons: \u2022 CTE participants differ substantially from nonparticipants. Those that invest most in high school CTE-concentrators, who earn at least three credits in one or more occupational fields-come from more disadvantaged backgrounds and are less academically prepared than those that invest a smaller amount in CTE. This is evident in their postsecondary education attainment: CTE concentrators, for example, earn only a high school credential more than twice as often as CTE nonparticipants (figure 5). \u2022 Despite differences in background and postsecondary education and training, high school CTE participants are remarkably similar to nonparticipants in their employment and earnings outcomes. There are no significant differences in employment status, experiences of unemployment, or annual earnings by level of CTE participation (figures 6, 8, and 9). There were some differences favoring CTE concentrators when postsecondary education levels were taken into account (table 13). \u2022 The similarity in labor force outcomes for CTE participants and nonparticipants is consistent with the experiences of a prior cohort of high school students who entered college and the workforce during a much more propitious time. Despite increased rates of unemployment and decreased earnings for the high school class of 2004 compared to the class of 1992, CTE participants were not affected more by the Great Recession than their contemporary peers (tables 19 and 23). These results are both encouraging and sobering. They clearly indicate that, despite less advantaged backgrounds, CTE students from the class of 2004 fare just as well as their nonparticipating counterparts, and that this was the case for the class of 1988 as well. The results also provide a portrait of how CTE students and nonparticipants have recently faced an unfriendly economic climate that is markedly worse than that encountered by a relatively advantaged earlier cohort. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 55 Implications for Policy and Practice The findings reported here can inform policy discussions relating to how CTE can help students smoothly transition to postsecondary education and find meaningful and rewarding work. As noted in the U.S. Department of Education's Investing in America's Future: A Blueprint for Transforming Career and Technical Education, alignment between CTE programs and labor market needs can help students prepare for in-demand occupations (U.S. Department of Education 2012). For example, the report found that the median annual income of students who had concentrated in manufacturing in high school had declined substantially compared to a prior cohort. The results presented here can point to fields of study in need of innovative approaches to ensuring the long-term salience of skills learned in high school. This report also speaks to the concern about a \"lost generation\" of students who completed college, or who experienced part of their early working life during a period of economic retrenchment and restructuring. Although their high school education is complete, and for most of them their postsecondary education is finished, programs and policies that can reconnect high school CTE students with in-demand skills and training could be a boon for them. While it is encouraging that CTE participants from 2004 were not more adversely affected than nonparticipants by the Great Recession, as their skills age, they may be at risk of falling behind. At the same time, the findings provide support for the argument that CTE can have beneficial effects on the labor market outcomes of students who are most invested in it. These findings come in the context of a long-term decline in the percentage of students who invest significant proportions of their time in CTE fields. Finding ways to document and report the employment and earnings outcomes of CTE students using methods besides large-scale, periodic cohort studies can help bolster the research base that demonstrates CTE successes and investigates and corrects policy failures. Improving both the frequency and quality of such research efforts can help to overcome some of the limitations of large-scale studies, which cannot gather the detail on specific CTE programs necessary for precise policy articulation and intervention. Since the resources required to implement high-quality CTE can be more intensive and specialized than academic instruction, regular and repeated surveys and evaluations of the outcomes of CTE students may serve to sustain CTE programs and reveal their value.  -up survey, and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) high school transcript study and fourth follow-up survey, gathered information about study participants' postsecondary educational experiences and labor market participation and preparation. It also gathered information about participant outcomes related to family formation, civic participation, and attitudes toward life and work. This study focuses primarily on individuals' labor market outcomes using students' demographic characteristics, high school experiences and course taking, and self-reported postsecondary education experiences drawn from survey data. Analyses also provide important context about the outcomes of career and technical education (CTE) participants by examining how CTE participants and nonparticipants compare on key student background characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, academic course taking, and math achievement).

This group of variables includes gender, socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, academic concentration, and score on the ELS:2002 12th-grade math assessment. Gender is simply defined as male or female (F2SEX, F4SEX). SES is a scaled index constructed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) based on parents' education, parents' occupation, and family income (F1SES2R, F2SES1). To understand variations by SES and simplify reporting, a version that divides the scale into quarters (F1SES2QR, F2SES1Q) is used. Respondents are divided into one of five racial or ethnic categories: Asian (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, white (non-Hispanic), or other (American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and those reporting more than one race) (F1RACE_R, F4RACEM). Hispanic ethnicity may be of any race; all race categories are non-Hispanic. NELS:88 explicitly allowed for \"other\" responses, and ELS:2002 allowed for respondents to choose more than one race; both of these categories are reported as \"other\" in the tables. Because of small percentages that result in unstable estimates, results for American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander are also included in \"other.\" Disability status (only reported for ELS:2002 respondents) is identified by the conjunction of two measures: whether the student had an individualized education plan (IEP) in 10th grade, as identified by the school (BYIEPFLG), and whether the student had been provided special test or EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 A-4 questionnaire accommodations as part of either the 10th-grade assessment or survey (BYACCTYP) or the first follow-up assessment or survey (F1ACCTYP). A student that meets either of these requirements would be classified as having a learning or other disability. Academic concentration (only reported for ELS:2002 respondents) describes the extent to which graduates completed a college-oriented academic curriculum in high school, as defined by NCES (F1RACAD). A graduate is deemed to be an academic concentrator if he or she earned at least four credits in English; four credits in math at the level of algebra I or higher; three credits in science with at least one higher than biology (i.e., chemistry or physics); three credits in social studies, with at least one of those credits in U.S. or world history; and two credits in a single non-English (foreign) language. Students who participated in the ELS:2002 first follow-up took a mathematics assessment specially designed for the study. For purposes of demonstrating how the high school academic achievement of CTE participants may differ from nonparticipants, a percentile distribution (0-100) of the standardized math score (F1TXMSTD) will be constructed, weighted by the panel transcript weight described earlier.

EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 A-7 Experiences with unemployment (for ELS:2002 respondents only) are examined through the following measures: whether the respondent was ever unemployed since January 2009 (F3C07), the total number of months unemployed since January 2009 (F3C08), the number of times the respondent was unemployed since January 2009 (F3C09), the longest length of time in months spent unemployed since January 2009 (F3C10), and whether the respondent was eligible for or received unemployment compensation (F3C11)."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary hours worked", "text": "In addition to employment status, the report examines the number of hours worked in respondents' current or most recent jobs (F3B21, F4BLHPW)."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary earnings", "text": "Earnings are examined in two ways. First, for respondents' current or most recent job, earnings are reported as a standardized hourly wage rate (F3HOURWAGE for ELS:2002, F4BRATE and F4BRATP for NELS:88) based on information respondents provided about their pay periods and pay amounts. This calculated wage rate was bottom coded at $2.13 per hour and top coded at $100 per hour to prevent disclosure of respondent identities.

Respondents coded their job titles and duties to O*NET codes using tools provided with the ELS:2002 web survey, or with the assistance of interviewers.

As in ELS:2002, the senior-year follow-up of NELS:88 augmented its sample to ensure a nationally representative sample of seniors for 1992. The analytical sample for NELS:88 is set to be the same as in ELS:2002: public high school 12th-graders from 1992 who were high school graduates (regular diploma recipients or alternative completers), had complete secondary transcripts in the database, and met minimum credit criteria of at least 16 credits and a nonzero amount of English credits. Substantial survey content was carried across the two longitudinal studies, ensuring data comparability. However, it should be noted that differences across the surveys remain. Principally, data collection for the ELS:2002 third follow-up began in the summer (of 2012), while data collection for the NELS:88 eight-year follow-up began in the spring (of 2000). 8 Additional secondary longitudinal studies in the same series were available for analysis. However, these could not be used for trend reporting. The High School & Beyond Study of 1980 Sophomores (HS&B:So) began with high school sophomores and did not resurvey students at the same intervals as NELS:88 and ELS:2002 (HS&B:So surveyed respondents 10 years after their typical high school graduation, instead of eight). NCES also conducted a survey of seniors as part of HS&B in 1980, but the senior cohort was only resurveyed six years after their senior year. EIGHT-YEAR POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2004 A-9 Race/ethnicity definitions have changed over time, as has the calculation of SES across the two studies (ELS:2002 did not include household possessions as part of the scale). Further, NELS:88 did not attempt to include as many students with disabilities or impairments in their survey. In addition, because it was developed after NELS:88 data were collected, codes for specific occupations in NELS:88 do not use the O*NET classification scheme; instead, they use a studyspecific code frame. Variables using this study-specific coding scheme were also used in the initial rounds (base year and first follow-up) of ELS:2002 and can be cross-walked to O*NET for later ELS:2002 rounds. However, given the effort involved in constructing the matched occupation variable and potential questions about the matching (16 NELS:88 codes match to 23 general [two-digit] O*NET codes, without any additional specificity), NELS:88-ELS:2002 comparisons in this report do not include occupation."}]
