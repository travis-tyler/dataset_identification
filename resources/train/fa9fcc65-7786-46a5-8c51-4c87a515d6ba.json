[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The teaching and learning of Geometry should be meaningful and not merely reacting to the teacher's stimuli. Hence, students should be given opportunities to experiment when learning mathematics through exploration and investigation of geometric shapes by themselves. For that reason, a Learning Strategy for 3-dimensional Geometry using the SketchUp Make dynamic software, called LSPE-SUM was designed through a step-by-step instruction to help students to improve their visual spatial skills and geometric thinking. Visual spatial skills were carefully integrated onto each van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking through specific arrangement of specially crafted learning activities. Such arrangement was vital to ensure that students could achieve better cognitive enhancement in visual spatial skills by communicating and interacting physically and socially according to the hierarchical van Hiele model of Geometry thinking. LSPE-SUM capitalized the dynamic features of SketchUp Make to facilitate the elevation of visual spatial skills and Geometry thinking during the learning processes. The whole process of designing and developing the LSPE-SUM adopted the five cyclic stages of ADDIE instructional design model. The purpose of this article was to report the details of the final two stages, more specifically, implementation and evaluation of LSPE-SUM. This learning strategy was tried out twice upon twelve different students in a classroom setting over a period of 3 weeks each. Besides that, LSPE-SUM was also given to experts to obtain their views and evaluation on its functionality. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data as well as to analyze the experts and students' views on the suitability of LSPE-SUM. Analysis of students' views suggested that LSPE-SUM has assisted most of them in \nO ensino e a aprendizagem da geometria devem ser significativos para os alunos, n\u00e3o consistindo, apenas, numa rea\u00e7\u00e3o a est\u00edmulos do professor. Por conseguinte, os alunos devem ter oportunidades de experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o na aprendizagem da matem\u00e1tica, atrav\u00e9s da explora\u00e7\u00e3o e da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de formas geom\u00e9tricas. Nesse sentido, uma estrat\u00e9gia de aprendizagem de geometria tridimensional, usando o software din\u00e2mico SketchUp, o LSPE-SUM, foi projetada atrav\u00e9s de instru\u00e7\u00f5es passo a passo para ajudar os alunos a melhorar suas compet\u00eancias visoespaciais e de pensamento geom\u00e9trico. As compet\u00eancias visoespaciais foram cuidadosamente integradas a cada n\u00edvel proposto pelo Modelo de van Hiele, relativo ao desenvolvimento do pensamento geom\u00e9trico, atrav\u00e9s de atividades especificas de aprendizagem. Esse arranjo foi vital para garantir que os alunos pudessem alcan\u00e7ar maior aperfei\u00e7oamento cognitivo das compet\u00eancias visoespaciais ao comunicar e interagir, demonstrativa e socialmente, de acordo com o modelo hier\u00e1rquico de pensamento geom\u00e9trico de van Hiele. O LSPE-SUM capitalizou recursos din\u00e2micos de SketchUp para facilitar a melhoria das compet\u00eancias e do pensamento geom\u00e9trico visoespacial durante os processos de aprendizagem. O processo de concep\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvolvimento do LSPE-SUM adotou as cinco fases do modelo de aprendizagem ADDIE. O objetivo deste artigo \u00e9 informar os detalhes das duas etapas finais da implementa\u00e7\u00e3o e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do LSPE-SUM. Essa estrat\u00e9gia de aprendizagem foi testada em sala de aula duas vezes, em doze alunos diferentes, ao longo de um per\u00edodo de 3 semanas. Al\u00e9m disso, o LSPE-SUM tamb\u00e9m foi entregue a peritos para obter os seus pontos de vista e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a sua funcionalidade. Foram usadas abordagens quantitativas e qualitativas na recolha de dados e an\u00e1lise das opini\u00f5es de peritos e alunos sobre a adequa\u00e7\u00e3o do LSPE-SUM.

It was reported by Mullis et al. (2012) that only 33% of Malaysian students could answer Geometry questions successfully. The achievement rate in the cognitive Geometry domain was 53% at knowledge and 28% at reasoning. Besides that, the reports also indicated that students have a low level of visualization. It is likely that these findings reflected certain flaws in the Geometry learning approach as well students' difficulties to achieve higher levels of thinking. Consequently, the current Geometry learning approach needed to be enhanced to address this problem. Malaysian Education Blueprint (MEB, 2012) highlighted that Ministry of Education was supportive and encouraged educators to explore pedagogical approaches to improve the quality of teaching and learning processes. This was especially crucial for those who use computer technologies as the seventh ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 aspect in the eleven shifts of the MEB transformation focused on leveraging computer technologies to improve the quality of learning in Malaysia.\nAs pointed by Mullis et al. (2012) , the current approaches and teaching methods in the classrooms were still confined to the traditional teacher-centered approach. Similar findings were also reported by Noraini (2006) and Abdul Halim and Effandi (2013) who found that teachers' Geometry learning activities were uncreative and boring due to merely using blackboard to explain definitions, concepts, and specific theorems. They also reported that there were teachers who showed the methods and algorithms for the solution of the problems raised and relied on numerous exercises to make their students familiar with the questions.\nAdverse impact occurred when students failed to understand the basic concepts of Geometry (Abdul Halim & Effandi, 2013; Zaid, 2014; Clements & Battista, 1992b; Noraini, 2007) . In addition, earlier researchers found that students who learned the concepts of Geometry by memorizing, often failed to recognize the components of Geometry series, features, and the relationship between the features. In fact, one of the learning principles to enhance students' understanding in Geometry is that students were required to successfully relate Geometry series and features.\nThe development of good levels of Geometry thinking plays a critical role at secondary schools. Chiang (2012) held the view that failure to raise the level of geometric thinking will disappoint students and, thus, drive them to achieve unfavorable decisions.\nNoraini (2006) has also expressed concern over poor Geometry performance at primary schools. It is possible that low Geometry thinking achievement at secondary schools will result in a lack of students who successfully pursue their Geometry studies related fields at higher levels. Similarly, Chiang (2012) believed that the failure to grasp the knowledge at schools would cause difficulties for students in learning more complex Geometry concepts such as trigonometry, transformation, and plan and elevation. Similarly, Usiskin (1982) also found that many students failed to understand the Geometry concepts because of their inability to master basic terminologies.\nTherefore, a more systematic approach of Geometry teaching and learning was needed to help students to develop the acquired level of Geometry thinking. Apart from that, learning 3D Geometry primarily required visual capabilities, especially representation of 3D objects in 2D view (Halimah, 2006) . A visual cross-section of the object was difficult to master among students who do not have strong basic knowledge about the object (Ben-Chaim et al., 1989) .\nBesides that, there were some concepts in Geometry which required students to construct a picture of an object and identify the distinguishing characteristics of the existing experiences ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 involving the same object. The Geometry concept also required visual translation since the Geometry problems were presented in 2D on question papers. Therefore, if any student failed to elaborate 3D Geometry figures in which the drawing was an isometric view on paper, they would also have difficulty in interpreting questions involving solid Geometry (Norani, 2006) .\nThere have been on-going efforts to develop teaching materials for Geometry (Battista, 2002; Clements, 2000; Ortiz, 1994) . Presmeg (2006) strongly believed that exposure of computer technology was very helpful in learning Geometry. Limited experiences in Geometry did not provide opportunities for students to develop their visual spatial skills, thus, preventing the development of thinking when learning Geometry. Ben-Cham et al. (2006) asserted that students faced problems in visual spatial cross-section of an object due to the lack of experience with solid objects. Teaching materials for the Geometry learning has evolved from the traditional of just drawing on black boards, to Geometry building blocks and, until recently, jigsaw puzzles with the help of computers. Over the past decade, computers have become a more popular tool in Geometry teaching and learning. In their studies, Battista (2002) Darr, Blasko, and Dwyer (2000) and Saud and Foong (2007) have also proven that the dynamic software was capable to elevate visual spatial skills successfully.\nPlan and elevation is a subject in Geometry which involves the mind and translation of descriptions into drawings. Geometry drawing is a picture in one's mind which is translated using drawing as a medium of communication (Ferguson, 1992) . Similarly, Jonassen (2003) and Tillotson (1984) also pointed that Geometry learning was based on actual situations and often involves mental, visual, and spatial representations, especially in building (Kytt\u00e4l\u00e4 & Lehto, 2008) . Therefore, students need to equip themselves with the basic concepts of Geometry drawing as it would facilitate them in learning more complex mathematics, especially those that involved Geometry. However, mastery of the basic concepts of Geometry drawing required students to master visual spatial skills (Alias, Black & Gray, 2002) and high level of Geometry thinking (Abdul Halim & Effandi, 2011) .\nThus, a Learning Strategy for 3-Dimensional Plan and Elevation using SketchUp Make called LSPE-SUM was designed and developed to overcome this difficulty. LSPE-SUM was conceived with the help of two experienced teachers, lecturers who were involved in the field of visual spatial and Geometry, and by lecturers who were enthusiastically engaged with SketchUp Make. LSPE-SUM's notion was to facilitate computer-aided learning ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 for students to elevate their visual spatial skills and develop students' Geometry thinking skills. Sidek and Jamaluddin (2005) explained that a noble learning module should be comprehensive and contain all the materials as well as teaching and learning resources including notes prepared by the teachers. In addition, Russell (1974 ), Sharifah Alwiah (1981 and Creager and Murray (1985) defined modules as a package of learning, containing components of learning in which students can follow step-by-step to grasp a unit of learning where it can be executed individually or in groups."}, {"section_title": "Development of LSPE-SUM", "text": "The development of LSPE-SUM referred to the application of visual spatial skills integrated into the van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking through a 3-dimensional dynamic software called SketchUp Make. Accordingly, the focused visual spatial skills consisted of four components, specifically the ability to mentally rotate, view, transform, and cut. Van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking are hierarchical, while the domains of visual spatial skills are not related to each other but have their own criteria representing certain abilities. To ensure that all the domains of visual spatial skills could be applied to the level of Geometry thinking, LSPE-SUM pursued the guidelines as shown in Figure 1 . LSPE-SUM contained three learning objectives and each learning objective involved four learning activities as shown in Figure 2 . The activities were arranged systematically into van Hiele's teaching phase. This study was conducted for three weeks in line with the weekly lesson plan set by the Curriculum Development Centre. The whole process of designing and developing LSPE-SUM adopted the five cyclic stages of the ADDIE instructional design model. The ADDIE model was chosen because the phases ensure more systematic development of LSPE-SUM. Jamaludin and Zaidatun (2001) believed that this design has its own advantages. However, this paper only focused on the two final stages namely; implementation and evaluation. ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 SketchUp Make's toolbars that were used to help assimilate the visual spatial skills onto each level of Geometry thinking are enlisted in Table 1 .

This is because according to Crowley (1987) , level five (Accuracy) is comprised of high-level thinking, which were complicated and complex. Furthermore, students in secondary schools have not achieved the level of thought. Examples of activities for every level of Geometry Thinking are explained below:\nAt this level students learn geometric shapes according to visual features and performance based on global perceptions about solid or certain elements (faces, edges, vertices) without paying particular attention to angular size, long edge, parallelism, and other traits. When any of the characteristics of mathematics appear in a student's answer, it's merely in the role of visual objects. Therefore, at this stage, students were not expected to understand and define the nature and characteristics of the Geometry shown.\nTo facilitate these activities, students were encouraged to use the Orbit toolbar to conduct activities for rotating the solid line and the image projected on the display plane.\nFor example as shown in Figure Students determine the properties through observation, measurement, experiments, drawing, and creating models. However, they cannot fully explain the relationship between nature, between Geometry and some, its definition.\nTo facilitate these activities, students were encouraged to use the Orbit toolbar to perform activities on all sides of the model and set the camera on the Camera Position and\nParallel Projection modes to see solid edges more clearly. To facilitate these activities, students were encouraged to set the camera on the of Position Camera mode and then on the Parallel Projection mode to see solid edges more clearly and followed by using the Standard View Camera mode to manipulate events from the viewpoint of certain solids to another. For example:\nStudents were to determine the orthogonal projection of a solid as displayed on Figure 5 .\nFollowing that, the students were to make a formal conclusion by deduction not on the side of the solid angle and on the side of the orthogonal angle projection. At this stage, students can reason formally based on solid mathematical structures or their elements, including properties that cannot be seen but can be inferred from the definition or other attributes. The students can then compile data, and not just receive evidence but organize theorems in the axiom system. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop more evidence along the way. Differences between statements and conversion can be made and students are aware of the need to prove through a series of deductive reasoning. For example, students have begun to understand the definitions, postulates and theorems on a <A'B'C '= <AB = 90, <GCB \u2260 <G'C'B' ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 plane, but may not understand why the postulate is true and why it can be used as a postulate in the ways of proving that two triangles are congruent.\nTo facilitate these activities, students were encouraged to set the camera mode and then use the Parallel Projection Standard View mode to manipulate events from the viewpoint of certain solids to solids and use the Display Section Cuts to see pieces of solid sides more clearly. For example:\nStudents were to perform deductive reasoning on solid geometric properties of a solid long side, which involve long sides and angles that were not visible. Based on the activity carried out as illustrated on Figure 6 , the students are able to do deduction reasoning, namely:\nI. If the solid surface is parallel to the plane of projection, the length of the solid is equal to the length of the orthogonal projection onto a plane surface.\nII. If the solid surface is not parallel to the plane of projection, the length of the solid is not the same as the length of the orthogonal projection onto a plane surface.\nReffering to orthogonal projection viewed from the X and Y directions, students are required to measure the length of the edge of the EA on a solid and projections using the Dimension "}, {"section_title": "Statement of the problem", "text": "This study attempted to determine the validity of LSPE-SUM, which has been designed and developed before its effectiveness was tested in mathematics classrooms. Mohd\nMajid (1998) defined that the validity of a module referred to the extent of which it can measure its objective. To gauge the validity, Russell (1947), Meyer (1988) and Mohd Najib (1998) suggested to request the evaluation of experts. Therefore, 5 lecturers and 2 master teachers of mathematics were engaged to validate LSPE-SUM. Sidek Mohd Noah and Jamaludin Ahmad (2005) believed that the content validity of a module depended on its objective and appropriateness. Thus, the information obtained could meet the desired overall achievement. In order to determine the validity of LSPE-SUM, the researchers designed a questionnaire with guidance from supervisors as suggested by Meyer (1988 ), Russell (1974 and Jamaludin Ahmad (2002) . In addition, a draft of LSPE-SUM, which went through improvements in terms of content validity, was also evaluated by students. Russell (1974) and Meyer (1988) pointed out that it was necessary to analyse how extensively students managed to follow the steps of each activity, as this process would show if the students had conquered the module objectives. Therefore, each student was given a set of questionnaire, which was developed based on the steps of LSPE-SUM's activities to be completed at the end of the pilot study. This procedure was conducted as Russell (1974) and Meyer (1988) believed that apart from validity by experts, pre and post tests should also be conducted to ensure that a developed module can achieve its required objectives."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the study", "text": "The aim of this study was to test the validity of the LSPE-SUM draft. It was performed by experts and students. The validity used in this study encompassed three main domains of content validity: (1) content about the Plan and Elevation topic, (2) van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking, and (3) visual spatial skills. Pre-test and post-test on visual spatial skills and van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking were also conducted to ensure that the main objective of the construction of LSPE-SUM could be achieved. "}, {"section_title": "Research methodology", "text": "The data of this study were collected through quantitative and qualitative approaches.\nThe quantitative data collection was divided into three stages, specifically Stage I (expert validity), Stage II (students' evaluation) and Stage III (Pre-test and post-test). while Stage II referred to the evaluation by students based on LSPE-SUM activities. For the success of this research, pilot study was conducted twice, whereby, Pilot Study I focused on how extensive the levels of activities in each van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking and visual spatial skills were and to perceive the students' abilities to grasp the step-by-step instructions given. Refinements were made based on these outcomes, which were then followed by referring the draft of LSPE-SUM to a specialist for content validity. The comments and suggestions obtained were taken into consideration to ensure that the module could elicit the targeted outcomes. Pilot Study 2 was then conducted to see students' perceptions of the draft of LSPE-SUM. Subsequently, pre and post-tests were conducted to ensure that the draft of LSPE-SUM could achieve its main objective, which was to elevate the visual spatial skills and van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking.\nThe set of questionnaires used to measure the content validity and student's evaluation was designed by the researchers and assisted by supervisors. It was then reviewed by language experts to ascertain the accuracy of language, sentence structure, as well as to ensure that the items were accurate and appropriate for the targeted respondents. Referring to Meyer (1988) and Russell (1974) in Sidek and Jamaludin (2005) , the questionnaires content validity depended on the experts' evaluation. Hence, a module with high validity should be able to meet the population's target, the teaching situation or the method of the module execution.\nBesides that, considerations should also be taken into on the allocation of time and whether the learning objectives were aligned and managed to promote students towards excellence.\nFor that reason, each expert was given a draft of LSPE-SUM to be reviewed. Abu Bakar (1995) in Sidek and Jamaludin (2005) pointed that a rate of 70% denotes one to have mastered or attained a high level of achievement. Concurrently, students evaluated the steps of each activity in LSPE-SUM by completing the set of questionnaires. Evaluation on the content validity of each item in the questionnaire was based on a semantic scale of one for the lowest scale and five for the highest. Russell (1974) , asserted that despite having a high validity, a module should be executed for implementation to monitor its handling abilities and skills, it should be repeated if the students could not achieve the module objectives. About this, Meyer (1984) suggested a simple analysis to be conducted to perceive the quality of LSPE-SUM. Hence, the pre and post-tests on visual spatial skills and van Hiele levels of Geometry thinking were carried out to evaluate if LSPE-SUM could achieve the desired objectives. The instruments used to evaluate the four domains of visual spatial ability already existed and were widely used by researchers on visual cognition such as Onyancha and Kinsey (2007) and Prieto and Velasco (2002) . The instruments were based on a standard criteria for spatial ability, as suggested by Sorby (2006) and a manipulation test (namely T3D2DT) developed by Safarin (2009). Hence, the Purdue Spatial Visualization for Rotation Test (PSVT: R) was employed to measure a student's ability to rotate mentally, the Purdue Spatial Visualization for View Test (PSVT: V) was used to measure a student's ability to describe an object from a mental assigned ISSN 1980 -4415 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590 /1980 viewpoint, the Mental Transformation test for 3D to 2D (T3D2D) was used to measure the ability to manipulate mentally, and the Mental Cutting Test (MCT) was employed to measure mental cutting abilities. In addition, the van Hiele Geometric Thinking (vHGT) Test was applied to measure the level of the students' geometric thinking, which has been used widely by researchers such as Usiskin (1982) , Abdul Halim (2013) and Vojkuvkova and Haviger (2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Research instrument", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Respondents", "text": "Two groups of subjects were involved in this study, namely experts and students.

Closer inspection of the mean value showed that the arrangement and combination of visual spatial skills, which were integrated in the level of the thinking and learning phase of van Hiele Geometry was appropriate. The data also identified that LSPE-SUM was appropriate with the level of students in developing visual spatial skills.\nExperts have also suggested that this technique should be introduced in textbooks or school syllabus to provide exposure for students to understand this concept.

They could complete the activity, give a better evaluation and it was easy for them to understand the concept of plan and elevation. In addition, they found the activities to be attractive. These thoughts were translated since it could be observed that the students were discussing and demonstrating positive attitude when doing the tasks. A possible explanation for this might be that SketchUp Make was user-friendly and a dynamic software, therefore the students were fascinated by it. In fact, interviews conducted on many students indicated that they loved and enjoyed using this software. Apart from that, overall visual spatial skills of students increased as shown in Table 7 .\nIn addition, observations done during the post test showed that the students appeared confident and the time taken to complete the test was shorter. It could be seen that the students expressed hand gestures to imagine handling the object while working on the activities. The interview responses also indicated that they felt more confident and it was easy to visualize and imagine the processes of mentally rotating, viewing, transforming, and cutting. Based on the graph, all students could improve the ability to rotate mentally. The findings show that three students managed to get full marks and nine marks of students increased by more than 30 points.\nBased on the graph, there was a positive effect on the ability of the students, in which three students went towards excellence, five students achieved a good level and four students reached a moderate level Ability to transform mentally Ability to cut mentally Based on the graph, all students increased their ability in mental transformation.
