[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The summer upwelling that occurs in coastal waters of South Central Vietnam is one of the major hydrographic features in the East Sea. A weakening of the upwelling after major El Ni\u00f1o events was observed in the literature for previous El Ni\u00f1o events and was verified here from the analysis of new satellite image data sets of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface wind. The analysis of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) from of monthly SST as well as of temporal and spatial variations of SST and wind force allow us to identify abnormal characteristics in ocean surface water that happened after El Ni\u00f1o episode, in agreement with previous studies. Those abnormal characteristics in Vietnam upwelling waters appeared mainly during the summers of 1998, 2003, 2010 and 2016 years for the El Ni\u00f1o decline phase. The upwelling weakening during El Ni\u00f1o decline episodes is associated with the following signals: (1) Wind force and Ekman pump are very weak; (2) the cold and high chlorophyll-a tongue is shifted northward but not extended eastward; (3) for years when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, SST strongly increases and reaches a peak in May or early June of next year, during the declining phase of El Ni\u00f1o episode; (4) upwelling phenomenon typically occurs during August and not July. Using a reanalysis dataset derived from the HYCOM/NCODA system coupled with a local Finite Element Model (FEM) allow us to complete our knowledge about the abnormal oceanographic characteristics of deeper water layers after El Ni\u00f1o episodes. The analysis of spatial variations of oceanography fields derived from HYCOM/NCODA/FEM system along zonal and meridional sections and vertical profiles as well as the results obtained from water mass analysis allow us to identify in details the abnormal oceanic characteristics of deeper water layers during the declining El Ni\u00f1o phase. Those are; (5) Sea water in both surface and deeper water layers were transported dominantly northward but not eastward; (6) The thermo-halocline layer in South Vietnam upwelling center was deeper (about 90 -100m), compared with previous El Ni\u00f1o and normal years (50-60 m and 35-40 m, respectively); (7) Extreme global warming in recent years (2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) pressed the thermo-halocline layer in upwelling center deeper (90-100 m) during summer. Under the influence of the ocean global warming, this process should progress continuously, the depth of thermo-halocline layer should become therefore deeper and deeper in next years."}, {"section_title": "Introduction 1", "text": "The upwelling is defined as an upward * Corresponding author, tongphuochoangson@gmail.com movement of seawater towards the surface. As upwelled water carries a large amount of nutrients from the lower layer to the upper and surface layers, upwelling regions are therefore considered to be important fishing areas (Hale et al., 2005) . Vietnam coastal upwelling water is one of the major hydrographic features of the East Sea (ES) and was studied by many authors (Wirtky, 1961; Le Phuoc Trinh and others, 1981; Vo Van Lanh et al., 1995; Tong Phuoc Hoang Son et al., 2005; Barthel et al., 2009; Dippner and Loick-Wilde, 2011 , and so on). The water circulation in Vietnam coastal upwelling is strongly influenced by the monsoon regime (Ose et al., 1997) . The center upwelling of cold waters moves southward from 15\u00b0N in May to 11\u00b0N in August with a changing of its scale. It finally evolves into a cold jet stretching offshore in mid-August (Kuo et al., 2000; Xia et al., 2003) . In this period, the coastal water circulation is dominated by the presence of a cold water tongue extending offshore and evolving as a cold jet stretching eastward along 11\u00b0N, under the influence of the South-East monsoon (Pohlmann, 1987; Shaw and Chao, 1994; Kuo et al., 2000) . This circulation is strongly related to the summer upwelling that results in a cooling of surface water off South Vietnam associated with a sea surface temperature (SST) decrease of more than 1\u00b0C (Wyrtki 1961; Huang et al., 1994; Kuo et al., 2000; Tang et al, 2004) . SST in this cold jet is below 26\u00b0C (Xie et al., 2003; Kuo et al., 2000) . Based on the analysis of sea surface height (SSH) derived from satellite altimetry data, Xie et al. (2007) concluded that the SSH field shows a dipole structure, positive in the northern and negative in the southern basin with a nodal line around 11\u00b0N. This SSH features in the Vietnam upwelling water represent a marked weakening of the climatologically anticyclonic circulation there, acting to favor the cold jet eastward-stretching for normal years when El Ni\u00f1o event does not occur (Xie et al., 2003) . A northward shift of the anti-cyclonic eddy was observed in summer 1998 (Xie et al., 2007) , as well as 2010 (Tran Van Chung, Bui Hong Long, 2016) when the ES was anomalously warm, making them the warmest summers on record in this region (Wang et al., 2002 , NOAA, 2011 . In another aspect, sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) is recognized as an index for the Asian monsoon and El Ni\u00f1o -South Oscillation (ENSO) system (Ose et al., 1997) . SST in the ES increases during the El Ni\u00f1o developing phase and peaks in the following summer during El Ni\u00f1o declining phase (Qu et al., 2004) . The appearance of SST anomalies happened during El Ni\u00f1o declining periods (i.e summer of 1998, 2003) with an extreme increasing of SST in upwelling waters as well as a northward moving of the cold upwelling center (Xie et al., 2007) . On the contrary, during the mature El Ni\u00f1o periods (i.e summer 1997, 2002) and normal summers, cold water jet extended eastward. A Recent result of Siswanto and his colleagues (Siswanto et al., 2017 ) also emphasized and divided the impact of El-Ni\u00f1o in ES into 3 different periods: developing, mature, and weakening phases. The oceanic anomalies in ES were mainly observed during the ElNi\u00f1o weakening phase. Most of the studies on these oceanic anomalies mainly focused on the analysis of spatiotemporal variations of surface oceanographic variables. However, very few works studied into details the anomalies associated with El Ni\u00f1o of oceanography structures in ES for deep water layers. The present study aims to understand, consolidate and clarify our knowledge of the main El Ni\u00f1o induced oceanographic anomalies in both surface water as well as deeper layers in Vietnam coastal upwelling waters."}, {"section_title": "Study area and used data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of study area", "text": "The studied area is the Vietnam coastal upwelling water region, between longitude 107\u00b030' to 112\u00b000'E and latitude 10\u00b030'to 14\u00b000'N.

Ekman transport describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer and is induced by the Wind Stress Curl (WSC) (Colling, 2001; Knauss, 2005) . In North Hemisphere, when WSC >0, Ekman pumping is strong and upwelling phenomena occurs, contrarily when WSC <=0, Ekman pumping is weak and/or Ekman suction with downwelling phenomena appears (Sverdrup et al., 1942) .

The HYCOM system represents the world's first eddy-resolving global ocean prediction system with both high horizontal (1/12.5\u00b0) and high vertical (32 deep layers) resolution. It is therefore eddy-resolving. Due to its resolution, the HYCOM/NCODA system can however not represent submesoscale oceanic processes (such as the effects of tidal current, land-atmospheric-ocean interactions, the effects of complex shorelines, relief of shallow water, and so on). The local hydrodynamical Finite Element Model (FEM) for upwelling region of South Vietnam described in Bui Hong Long and Tran Van Chung (2009) was therefore applied and combined with HYCOM/NCODA to provide a high resolution modeled dataset over the studied area. The HYCOM-NCODA-FEM outputs including sea water temperature, salinity, and meridional/zonal current in twenty-two layers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, and 200m) were extracted and used for the analysis. Flow chart of coupled HYCOM-NCODA-FEM for forecasting the oceanic structures in upwelling waters of Central Vietnam Sea is shown in Figure 2 . Results show that the first spatial EOF 1 characterizes the intrusion of a cold water mass from North (i.e from Luzon strait (Qu et al., 2004) during North-East monsoon, whereas the spatial EOF 2 is typical of the South Vietnam upwelling phenomena with a center of lowest temperature appearing in latitude 11\u00b0N during South-West monsoon (Le Phuoc Trinh and others, 1981; Vo Van Lanh et al., 1995; Pohlmann, 1987; Shaw and Chao, 1994; Kuo et al., 2000) . These results are in agreement with previous studies of Son and Lanh, who also examined the major features of temperature patterns in the whole East Sea from an EOF analysis based on U.S. N vy's Modular Ocean Data Assimilation System (MODAS) data (Tong Phuoc Hoang Son and Vo Van Lanh, 2005) . The temporal EOF 1 evolution shows that January is the typical period of the intrusion of cold water mass, while the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of EOF 2 show that the strongest upwelling activity usually occurs in August with a strong contrast between the upwelling area and the hot SST background over the studied region in this season. Our conclusions presenting August as the typical month for upwelling phenomena in the Central Vietnam region differ from previous discussions of Le Phuoc Trinh (Le Phuoc Trinh et al., 1981) , and Vo Van Lanh (Vo Van Lanh et al., 1995) , who suggested that July was the characteristic month for upwelling activity in this region.\nFinally, the spatial distribution of EOF 3 shows the appearance of SST anomalies associated with the extreme increasing of background SST in the studied region as well as the northward displacement of the cold upwelling-generated centroid (Figure 4) . We obtain a strong correlation (r2=0.65) between the temporal evolution of EOF 3 and Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index (ONI) with a phase lag of about 3 months (Figure 4) . These results agree with previous discussions on anomalies of oceanographic fields over the western edge of East Sea in summer of 1998, 2003, 2010 (years following El-Ni\u00f1o events) under ENSO influence (Qu et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2007, Chung and Long, 2016) : during the years when El Ni\u00f1o occur, SST in the ES is strongly increasing and reaches a peak in May of the next year declining El Ni\u00f1o episode. This peak occurs three months earlier as the upwelling which usually occurs in August. Finally, our results also allow us to add summer 2016 to the list of those SST anomalies related to ENSO event."}, {"section_title": "Anomalies of oceanographic structures in mid-summer of El Ni\u00f1o declining episode in East Vietnam Sea coastal waters", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Surface oceanographic anomalies during El Ni\u00f1o episodes", "text": "Monthly variability of SST in upwelling center (109\u00b015'E; 11\u00b015'N) obtained from AVHRR-MODIS image series (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) showed that, SST summers 1998 and 2010 were about 1\u00b0C higher than SST for other summers ( Figure 5 ). Recent analysis of surface water circulation system in Vietnamese region (Bui Hong Long, Tran Van Chung, 2015) also showed the northward moving trend of the current dipole for mid-summer of 1998 and its complete disappearance for mid-summer of 2010 (Figure 8) . On the contrary, during summers of normal years, surface water circulation in upwelling waters was characterized by the existence of a cold centroid in 11\u00b0N latitude and by the eastward moving of the cold water tongue (Bui Hong Long, Tran Van Chung, 2015) .

It allows us understanding more into details the disappearance or weakening of upwelling phenomena during El Ni\u00f1o decline phase shown above. The post El Ni\u00f1o accu-mulation of heat during a long time induces the thermal base in the land to be much higher than the sea water temperature, due to the large difference of specific heat between earth and sea areas). This is the main reason for the pressure difference between land and sea, that results in the formation of \"breeze wind\" toward the land. This breeze wind weakens the amplitude strength of southwest monsoon and/or induces a change in wind direction from southwestward to northward. 30'E, a longitude that crosses the cold-water tongue associated with upwelling waters. For 2014 and 2015, every summer from May to September, there are two to three cooling centers. Each one is associated with a strong basin wide wind pulse (>8 m/s) and a temperature drop of at least 1\u00b0C to 1.5\u00b0C. For summers following the major El Ni\u00f1o events of 1997-1998 and 2009-2010 (i.e . during El Ni\u00f1o decline phase) the entire studied region is abnormally warm, the wind is low and the cold water tongue does not develop eastward (1998) or disappears completely (2010). These results fit well the results of Xia et al.

The division of water masses of the mid summer of 1998, 2010, 2014, 2015 is shown into details in Table 1 .\nResults show that, temperature of surface water layers in post El Ni\u00f1o midsummer abruptly increases (about 1-2\u00b0) in comparison with temperature in normal periods. Temperature in surface layers in July 1998 and 2010 reaches 30.8\u00b0C, whereas in July of 2014 and 2015, it is only about 28.8\u00b0C. The thickness of TS scatterplots along the vertical axis ( Figure 11 ) is used to determine the homogeneous or non-homogeneous aspects of thermo-haline layer as well the ability of water masses to exchange across the different layers. Water salinity is relatively uniform for post El Ni\u00f1o periods (ie. mid summers of 1998 and 2010), with a fluctuation range for upper water layers varying between 31.5 and 34.5 psu. Whereas, during normal years (e.g. summers of 2014, 2015) , this range is larger, varying between 30.0 and 35.5 psu. This allows us to conclude that during abnormal years under the infuence of El Ni\u00f1o, water exchange along vertical direction (from bottom to surface) is very limited and deep, high salinity water masses are not transported upward to shallower as well as surface layers\".\nThe 3D volume plot obtained from cluster analysis of HYCOM/NCODA/FEM data (Figure 12 ), provides us a visual picture of the distribution and movement of water masses. Analysed results show that in post El Ni\u00f1o periods, thermo-haline stratification direction is alongshore and creates a dominant northward current system in whole water collumn from surface to 50 m depth. Upwelling phenomenon weakened or almost completely disappeared in mid summers of 1998 and 2010 during El Ni\u00f1o decline phase. On the contrary it appeared clearly in July 2014 and July 2015.

Weak influence of relatively cold water is the main reason responsible for the creation a shallow thermocline layer. The second profile (Figure 13 , middle) characterizes the 1 st anomaly profile with a thermo-halocline layer between 50 and 60 m depth. The discussion of Qu et al. (2004) showed that \"SST in the ES increases around the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1o and reaches a peak in the following summer\" suggesting that extremely warm sea water during El Ni\u00f1o episodes (i.e., 1998, 2003) pressing the thermo-halocline layer downward is the main factor responsible for the above phenomenon. Moreover, analyzed results also show that sea water temperature gradually increasing during the period 2008-2012 intensified above phenomena, participating in pushing the thermo-halocline layer deeper.\nThe third profile ( 2013 -2016 (right) Note that, in analyzing results in Figure 13 , we removed temperature and salinity profiles of years 2000 and 2001 which didn't suit with the general rule of a shallow thermocline depth for normal years.
