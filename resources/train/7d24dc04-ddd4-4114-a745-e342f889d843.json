In spite of the context type, determining how policies have been implemented addresses the questions of consistency between the expected results and the scripted policy document. Failing to match those desired outcomes and policies has been recognized to be a gap, and that is one of the most important hindrances of making the anticipated outcomes of any institution attainable (Abu-Ayyash 2016) . In educational institutions, it is not easy to determine with inevitability whether certain policies; for example language policy, are explicitly acknowledged and practiced in most domains. Language Education Policy (LEP) has 64 | P a g e been considered a powerful mechanism for creating de facto language policies in most countries (Tollefson 2002) .\nThose countries, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are no exception, have introduced LEPs that emphasize the need to learn a second language (L2) in addition to the mother tongue (MT) (Menken & Garc\u00eda 2010) . It is not a secret that English enjoys a considerate status and is hereby utilized as the major second language worldwide (Crystal 2003) , including the Arab world and mainly the UAE (Godwin 2006) . In UAE, considerable attention has been recently devoted to the policy of bilingual education, where reforming the emirate's education system and promoting a bilingual approach in learning and teaching are the main objectives of the strategic plan of supervising bodies of education such as Abu Dhabi Education Council's (ADEC) (ADEC 2017) . It is needless to say that acquiring and utilizing the knowledge of two languages for educational purposes with a considerable degree of fluency, known as bilingual education, is increasingly and advantageously valuable in the academically globalized world (Kirkg\u00f6z 2009 ). Its significance has been highlighted in the Policy 7110 Language of Instruction in the ADEC Public School (p.12) Policy Manual under section 7000: instructional Program (ADEC 2015) ADEC, as a visionary response to the educational reform in UAE. It has embarked on promoting a bilingual education approach that begins at kindergarten (KG) and extends to grade 12-Math, Science and English learning by enshrining the fact that teaching literacy skills and content in two languages would equip students with the twenty-first century skills (ADEC 2017) .\nIt is a fact that the educational system in the UAE is relatively new and that by supporting of the New School Model (NSM) as a part of the educational reform in the emirate of Abu Dhabi it is anticipated to obtain internationally notable results in educational standards. O'Sullivan (2015) reported that this reform has been extensively accepted since massive resources have been devoted to UAE education, yet student learning has remained generally inadequate. Quite understandably, the need for education reform that builds up language learning is becoming evidently significant. To achieve successful second language learning and teaching, emphasizing native and non-native speaker interactions in the emirate of Abu Dhabi is a necessity in order to improve students' language attainment and proficiency levels (Al-Khaili 2009). Nevertheless, enshrining the educational success and meeting the expectations of policy-makers encompasses the participation and consultation of all stakeholders involved in implementation; and teachers are the forefront. In reference to teacher's perspectives and the relevant document analysis, this study attempts to determine whether a gap exists between the reform-policy document that pursues promoting bilingual education and its implementation during the current reform climate."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the study", "text": "Cultivating bilingual language proficiency and encouraging learners to read in their mother tongue and another language have been a perquisite for successful development in an increasingly globalized world.

Throughout history, abundant definitions have been proposed in the literature (Baker 2011; Cummins 2000; Ellis, 2005; Garc\u00eda 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez 2008 ), yet the communicative competence in two languages, with the same relative degree of proficiency is a mutual element (Hamers & Blanc 2000; Lanvers 2001 ). Bialystok (2017) describes bilingualism realistically by pointing to the realistic standards of second language proficiency, which involves competence to a certain degree of functioning in the second language; and that is a correspondent view with that of Hamers and Blanc (2000) , who illustrated that the commonly held image of a bilingual speaker is that of a person who is not necessary evenly fluent in the two languages, but somewhat very proficient in the second one. On this point, Baker (2011) stated that bilinguals are not often equally good at both languages, but rather one language typically dominates.\nBased on Bialystok's (2017) description, a new ability called \"Bi-literacy\", has been revealed. In academic contexts, bi-literacy is described as a competence in the receptive and productive skills in two languages; namely having the ability to communicate thoughts, comprehend ideas and write, using grammatical structures and terms in two languages (Baker 2011) . And as one language is generally dominant for bilinguals, some receptive or productive skills would seem to be more developed than the others. This academically leads to differences in the bilingual's language competence (Cummins, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Journal of Education in Black Sea Region", "text": "Vol. 3, Issue 2, 2018 66 | P a g e\nVol. 3, Issue 2, 2018 70 | P a g e In line with Rosi and Rosli's framework, Bach, Matt and Wolff (2014) suggest that policy ambiguity that results in poor implementation is not only a result of establishing poor alliance and agreement in the policy development process, but also it is a consequence of communication problems addressed by policy developers.\nIn a comparative analysis of the challenges of policy implementation, Sultana (2008) stated that disregarding and overlooking any group or position of people in the education system during the reform process, such as teachers, education officers and inspectors, creates a gap which in turn leads to critical problems with implementation. She further suggested to involve deputy principals, inspectors and parents in benchmarking and promoting the implementation of practices and standards of the reform process.\nVol. 3, Issue 2, 2018 72 | P a g e on the contrary, that successful nations around the world acknowledge the importance of student's first language in scaffolding the nation's striving for excellence in education.\nHaving understood all the previously mentioned arguments and due to ADEC's lack of experiences in designing and implementing educational reform, ADEC has established a constructive bilingual education policy that adopts teaching English, Math, and Science using an English-language curriculum. The curriculum was designed by Australian consultants and applied in secondary schools in 2007. That process commenced with establishing public-private partnerships (PPPs) which were assigned to qualify and mentor Emirati teachers to implement the curriculum designed by numerous foreign companies.

In the past, numerous researchers were concerned about the delayed mental development and faulty language skills of early bilinguals (Byers-Heinlein & Lew-Williams 2013; MacNamara 1967; cited in Carroll 2007) . However, the advocates of early bilingualism have currently spotlighted their views on the many potential advantages early bilingualism has, mainly for students' oral language skills and pre-literacy abilities (Erdemir 2013) . Additionally, Cummins (2000) claimed that languages are interdependent and are controlled by a common processing system that permits knowledge and thoughts to be transferred. Thus, they advocated the hypothesis that proficiency in L2 acquisition is moderately reliant on children's first language skills."}, {"section_title": "Additive v Subtractive Bilingualism", "text": "The controversy and disagreements over bilingual education are grounded in the negative and positive results of undertaken studies and as a result two types of bilingualism -additive versus subtractive -were addressed (Cummins 2000) .\nSince proficiency in two languages is considered a linguistic and cultural advantage, a number of researchers advocates achieving additive bilingualism, which occurs when the bilingual person's first language and identity are not endangered to be depreciated or underestimated (Baker, 2001) . The opponents of subtractive bilingualism argued in favor of additive bilingualism, stating that devaluing a bilingual person's L1 and culture and gradually replacing it with L2 is disadvantageous and not \"a humanistic approach\" (Atkinson 1987, p.242; cited in Levine 2003) . Joining the discussions of bilingualism-related issues, it is important to shed light on the anticipated levels of language skills at which students will achieve competence in two languages. In response to research findings that tackle the impact of bilingualism on children's cognitive development and to lessen the subtractive effect of L2 instruction, Cummins (1976; cited in Cummins, 2001 ) developed the Threshold Theory, which assumes that learners are required to acquire and cultivate a threshold level of L1 proficiency, namely, receptive and productive skills, antecedent to second language acquisition."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives on Bilingual Education", "text": "Bilingual education remains a topic of worldwide debate that is manifested in the dichotomy revealed in the studies investigating the effects of bilingual education on cognitive development and communicative skills. In general, the positive effects of bilingual education on students' cognitive development were first recognized in Pearl and Lambert's study (1962) , which created a milestone in the field of bilingualism (Baker 2001; Hamers & Blanc 2000) .\nThe effects of bilingual education involve more than just academic benefits, they also embrace valuing culture and (2001) demonstrated that bilinguals have a higher level in using communicative strategies."}, {"section_title": "1.5. Policy document and implementation", "text": "Operationally, Ogbonnaya (2003) defined policy as purposeful procedures in approaching essential issues, a set of anticipated objectives of an institution in conjunction with guidelines for action. Another comprehensive definition suggested by Honig (2006) stated that policy is a set of analogous decisions by political agents communicated to subordinates that encompasses the selection of objectives and the means for accomplishing them within particular conditions. Jacobsen and Young (2013) in their study on educational policy perceive policy as rules and structures established by top management and subordinates to generate positive results for the progress of the institution.\nWhatever the definition of policy is and whatever field it encompasses, understanding the objectives of the policy establishes a better understanding of how its implementation takes place in that field, e.g., in education.\nPolicy implementation is basically turning the policy into practice with an emphasis on the association between the anticipated expressions of the institution's intention; either encouraging or discouraging the execution of something, and the obtained results (Rosli & Rossi, 2014) . Rosli and Rossi (2014) demonstrated that the attainment of educational policy objectives is crucially based on the process of policy implementation. Robichau and Lynn (2009) correspondingly highlighted the importance of aligning the policy document with its implementation in order to make the educational policy decision meaningful and pursuable. They also added that developing policies do not reflect the success of the institution unless the policies are implemented effectively and thus they shared the belief that the implementation of a policy influences its outcome (Pressman and Wildavsky 1984) . In order to make a policy and its succeeding implementation efficacious and to understand the nature of policy implementation over time, numerous theoretical policy-implementation models have been consequently offered; mainly the top-down approach, the bottom-up approach and the combined approach (Birkland, 2014) .\nUtilizing those approaches mainly depends on the essence of the policy and the contextual setting of the policy implementation. Generally, top-down implementation involves the forming and executing of the policy decisions, which are set by policy designers, and then communicating them to the implementers, whereas the policy implementation in the other approach is a reciprocal process that involves collaboration between the policy makers and the subordinates, who have the discretion to modify the policy objectives or change the way of their implementation.\nIn order to better understand different dimensions of education policy implementation, Sultana (2008) reviewed a number of studies that tackle the relationship between policy objectives and its implementation and oncluded that understanding the dimension of people, policymakers and implementers, the targets of the policy Numerous explanations that pinpoint how policy is implemented in reference to its design, the administrative arrangements that operate the policy and the aptitude of those involved in the implementation of the policy have been proposed by scholars. The scholars premised their explanations on the importance of having assistance of agents, such as teachers, to achieve the aspirations of the institution and thus to make the ends of the policy a reality (Spillane, Reiser and Reimer, 2002) . They further demonstrated that the gap is a result of the implementer's deficiency of the skills, knowledge, constructive understanding and assistance of the policy makers to establish consistent ways for better policy implementation. In order to provide an explanation on the gap between institutions' policy aspirations and its implementation, Rosi and Rosli (2014) provided a conceptual framework that consolidates different arguments on policy implementation (cf. Figure 2) . The main focus in their proposed framework was how both a policy's setting and its implementation develop in different directions to create a mismatch between them.\nAs shown in the table, the framework examines the contrast between the two sources of policies; the first one is the government that sets the policy aspirations, whereas the second is the agency that is required to implement the policy by means of assembling a suitable instrument. Over time, the policy process encompasses a complex array of aspects that interact with many levels of agencies. Therefore, it is expected that in conjunction with the different levels of pressure that may occur between the objectives and the implementation, a developing mismatch will arise particularly when the policy involves ambiguous and complex issues. According to Rosi and Rosli (2014) , if the issues are extremely convoluted, different perspectives will emerge in interpreting the issue. Thus, the understanding will become more ambiguous and the gap between policy makers and implementers will tend to increase."}, {"section_title": "The theoretical underpinning", "text": "Language development faculty is one of the most essential and thought-provoking sets of theories applied to second language acquisition (Krashen 2013 ). This study is based on Krashen's Input Hypothesis, which claims that, in order to obtain a systematic linguistic output, students learning second or third languages should have an extensive exposure to those target languages (Krashen 2013 ).\nAdditionally, educational policy is a dynamic negotiation between diversified performers, including teachers, superintendents, and policy developers. Thus apprehending the complication of its implementation can occur through considering the interactions and negotiations between the performers in particular policy contexts (cf. Figure 3) . That interaction is grounded in Lev Vygostky's Sociocultural theory, which emphasizes that giving individuals room for social and cultural interaction can help them to construct and reflect on their knowledge (Vygotsky, 1978) . This sociocultural framework consolidates examining the policies and the interplay between policy and the performers.

Quite understandably, laying the foundation for dramatic quality improvement in the education reform is considerably vital; however, some policies that emerge in the reform require a wide-ranging discussion to make their content comprehensible. Although ADEC strives to develop education, educational policies in the UAE, similarly to any other worldwide educational environment, are inevitably subject to global influences (Robichau & Lynn 2009) . O'Sullivan (2015) stated that the problem of the educational policies followed in the UAE is that they are not home-grown or reflective of the country's needs. She elaborated that although the supervising body of education in the emirate of Abu Dhabi has attempted to increase the quality of education for four decades, the education system seems to have been unsuccessful. To help achieve the objectives of ADEC's vision, numerous policies concerning bilingual education system have been created. Yet, those policies have not been indigenous and therefore it is expected that the inborn policies in the UAE may lead to gaps between the policy and implementation.\nCorrespondingly, in their whole-school reform model, Datnow and Castellano (2000) based their arguments on specified and comprehensive research-based models in respect of policy-implementations guidelines.\nAccording to them, in order to have a reflective educational system, its policies must be established indigenously.\nTo meet the needs of educational reforms, they further emphasized the importance of including all members involved in the learning and teaching process, in particular, students and teachers.\nAs a matter of fact, the worldwide supremacy and dominance of the English language over other languages on account of the economic, political, and technological reasons extends to the Arab world (Crystal, 2003) , including the UAE (Godwin, 2006) . That superiority made English the medium of instruction in higher education institutions in the UAE, and it turns out that secondary schools will be accountable for equipping students with a considerable level of proficiency in English. That was illustrated in a report in a local newspaper which documented a decision taken by the UAE's Minister of Higher Education at the Federal National Council (FNC) to disassemble English foundations programs at higher educational institutions by the year 2018 (Salem & Swan, 2014) . The authors further argued that the decision of the abolition of the foundation programs will require critical changes to the curriculum and thus considered secondary schools responsible for qualifying students for university education.\nHowever, favoring English over Arabic (the UAE's first language) and making it the medium of instruction in the context of Emirati higher education institutions has been a topic of controversy in the past few years (Issa 2013) . Issa (2013) in her report documented arguments of a number of educational experts in the field of linguistics and the FNC's members who urged to make Arabic the major language at state universities; and thus warned that abandoning using Arabic will result in a violation of the UAE's national identity and constitution.
