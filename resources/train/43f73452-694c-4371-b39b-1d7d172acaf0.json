[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviridae is an emerging family of coronaviruses and comprises two subfamilies, coronavirinae and torovirinae. 1 Coronavirinae is sub-categorized into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. 2 Until now, humans have been mostly affected by alpha (229E, NL63) and beta genera (OC43, SARS-CoV, HKU1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). 3 As a point of fact, the alpha and beta genera infect mammals while the delta and gamma genera mainly infect birds. 4 In 1930, the first bird coronavirus was discovered when domestic chickens were infected by an unknown pathogen named an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). 5 Later, in 1965, the first human coronavirus was reported 6 with common cold symptoms. In 1968, eight scientists proposed the name \"corona\" (which means \"crown\" or \"wreath\" in Latin) for the newly discovered viruses based on detailed findings of their structures. 7 This structural exploration showed that four types of proteins are present in all coronavirus structures: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). 8 A positive sense single-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) (+ssRNA), which is 26-32 kilobases in length, is packed inside an N-protein shell with S-, E-, and M-proteins surrounding it (Figure 1 ). 9 The S-protein is believed to be the principle and only receptor-attachable part of each viral body. 10 The S-protein of the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor while, for the MERS virus, the S-protein binds to host dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptors. 11 The recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence matches about 79% of previous versions of SARS-CoV and around 50% of MERS-CoV. 12 The newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 was first reported to affect humans in late 2019 with common pneumonia-like symptoms. 13 Based on the degree of infection, other symptoms were also observed including respiratory problems, fever, cough, diarrhea, shortness of breath, dyspnea, kidney failure, and even death. 14 Scientists termed this new virus SARS-CoV-2 15,16 because of its similarity to SARS-CoV and refer to it as a \"novel coronavirus\" because of its dissimilarity with previously reported coronaviruses. 17 This virus has already infected more than 39 million people of which nearly 1.1 million people have died as of October 18, 2020, a number which continues to increase daily. 18 The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that widespread testing is the best way to reduce these numbers.\nRepurposing antiviral drugs or drugs used for other types of therapy to provide therapeutic support to SARS-CoV-2 patients is a temporary solution. Targeted therapeutic treatments will take some time to develop and test. Vaccination against the virus is the only treatment that can boost our immune system and grow antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2. However, a development time of about 12-18 months is needed to prepare a completely new vaccine, although researchers are trying to speed up the development. 19, 20 Hence, in this situation, there is an urgent need for better and instant drug support for SARS-CoV-2 patients.\nNanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as one of the most important therapeutic materials used in the medical field. 21 Recently, metal, [22] [23] [24] metal oxide, 25, 26 metal sulfide, 27, 28 and inorganic NPs have been developed with proper surface modifications which show promise for important therapeutic applications in various fields. 29 Apart from inorganic NPs, there are also several kinds of organic NPs and among them, some of the most extensively studied are nanospheres, 30 dendrimers, 31 liposomes, 32 micelles, 33 and solid lipid nanoparticles, 34, 35 Presently, four organic nanoparticle-based vaccines are in clinical phase trials against COVID-19 and have shown promising results in terms of immunogenicity and safety. 36 Among inorganic materials, AgNMs have been extensively studied and shown to possess different biological activities, i.e., antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer. As a result, they are gaining importance in the medical field. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] AgNMs are also being investigated due to their catalytic properties, 42, 43 non-toxic nature, high quantum efficiency, 44 54 biochemical capacity as sensors, 55, 56 water purification properties, [57] [58] [59] [60] and straight forward synthesis. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] While AgNMs are still not a well-explored topic in the field of virology, some anti-viral actions against a few known viruses, i.e., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 66 H1N1 influenza A virus, 67 hepatitis B virus, 68 herpes simplex virus type1, 69 and monkeypox virus 70 have been reported. Although such nanoparticles are almost undefined and yet to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 therapy, previous results from virologic studies give some hope about their therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2. Researchers are currently trying to utilize different metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and other inorganic nanomaterials for possible therapeutic support against SARS-CoV-2. [71] [72] [73] Few AgNMs have been reported as therapeutic agents towards some animal coronaviruses and other metal-based nanomaterials are reported as analytical sensors, vaccine adjuvant, and nanocarriers. This review is primarily focused on the formulation of AgNMs to provide therapeutic support against coronaviruses."}, {"section_title": "Mechanism of Virus Entry into Host Cells", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mainly through active and passive pathways.

AgNMs interact with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein to inactivate the virus before host cell binding. 74, 76, 90, 91 AgNMs work as an adjuvant to improve the immune response of the vaccine. It has been reported that the addition of AgNMs with the influenza vaccine efficiently induced an immune response in infected mice. However, the AuNP performance was not as good compared to AgNMs. 92 Moreover, AgNPs and chitosan conjugates were also tested against H1N1 influenza A virus and it was observed that synergistically, the conjugates showed remarkable antiviral effect against the virus compared to AgNMs or chitosan alone. 75 "}, {"section_title": "AgNMs as Vaccines", "text": "Vaccines are biological particles which facilitate building of acquired immunity against infectious diseases.
