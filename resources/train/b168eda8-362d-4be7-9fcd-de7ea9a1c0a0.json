[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-Classifying and predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with memory disorders through clinical and psychometric assessment is challenging, especially in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging acquisition methods in combination with computer-aided diagnosis are currently being used for the assessment of AD. These acquisitions methods include voxel-based morphometry, volumetric measurements in specific regions of interest (ROIs), cortical thickness measurements, shape analysis, and texture analysis. This review evaluates the aforementioned methods in the classification of cases into one of the following three groups: normal controls, MCI, and AD subjects. Furthermore, the performance of the methods is assessed on the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. In parallel, it is also assessed which ROIs are preferred in both classification and prognosis through the different states of the disease. Structural changes in the early stages of the disease are more pronounced in the medial temporal lobe, especially in the entorhinal cortex, whereas with disease progression, both entorhinal cortex and hippocampus offer similar discriminative power. However, for the conversion from MCI subjects to AD, entorhinal cortex provides better predictive accuracies rather than other structures, such as the hippocampus.\nIndex Terms-Alzheimer's disease (AD), classification, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prediction, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "D", "text": "EMENTIA is a broad category of brain diseases that affect the brain by causing deterioration in memory, thinking, behavior, orientation, and, as a result, a decline in a person's daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60-80% of cases. Other common types include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) [1] . AD is most often diagnosed in people over 65 years of age, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA. The greatest risk factors for AD are old age, family history, and the presence of Apolipoprotein e4 (ApoE4) gene in a person's genome. Currently, there is no specific cure for the disease, and the condition of the patient worsens with the disease progression eventually leading to death. According to Braak and Braak [2] , the most evident change is the progressive deposition of abnormal proteins, both between and within the nerve cells. In the early stages, the most common symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events, while advanced AD patients often suffer from loss of the ability to take care of themselves, communicate with others, or even recognize their family members. Apart from challenging, the assessment and, most importantly, the early identification of the stage of AD are essential to provide a future treatment. Unfortunately, when the diagnosis is based exclusively on the clinical and psychometric assessment, a patient will be diagnosed with AD when the brain tissue has already undergone widespread and irreversible synaptic loss [3] .\nMini-mental state examination (MMSE) [4] and clinical dementia rating (CDR) [5] are two of the most commonly used tests in the assessment of AD. MMSE consists of a series of clinical and psychometric assessment through neuropsychological tests, which assess language and memory abilities and the ability of solving problems. The maximum MMSE score is 30 points. A score less than 12 indicates severe dementia, 13-20 recommends moderate dementia, 20-24 suggests mild dementia, and 24-30 represents normal controls (NC). In parallel, CDR is used to describe memory, orientation, judgment, and problem solving, home and hobbies, and personal care. A score of 0 represents NC, 0.5 represents very mild dementia, 1 represents mild dementia, 2 represents moderate dementia, and 3 represents severe dementia. The revised criteria for the diagnosis of AD were proposed in 2007 by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders working group [6] . According to [6] and due to the uncertainty of clinical diagnosis, the clinical assessment should include at least one supportive feature: 1) medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy as seen in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 2) temporoparietal hypometabolism as seen in positron emission tomography (PET); 3) positivity on amyloid imaging as seen in PET; 4) abnormal neuronal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers (tau and/or A\u03b2). As a consequence of the AD, structural changes initiate within the MTL of the brain [7] , a region that includes anatomically related structures that are essential for declarative memory [8] . Many postmortem studies [2] , [9] , [10] have implicated entorhinal cortex and the transentorhinal region as early sites of involvement in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in AD subjects. It was shown that the degenerative process initiates from the entorhinal cortex, followed by the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the parahippocampal gyrus [8] , [11] , [12] . With the disease progression, these regions lose neuronal tissue with consequent brain atrophy [13] .\nA definite diagnosis of AD relies on histological confirmation at postmortem biopsy [6] , and brain inaccessibility has driven a search for diagnostic imaging markers. Imaging plays an important role in improving our understanding of AD, as it can provide an image of the brain of living patients that are affected by AD. Furthermore, imaging biomarkers can be used for differential diagnosis due to the uncertainty of clinical tests in differentiating other subtypes of dementia such as FTLD [14] , [15] . The entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus (see Fig. 1 ) are the two most common regions of interest (ROIs) used in both in vivo and postmortem investigations on the pathophysiology in AD. However, a visual qualitative assessment of MRI is not enough to estimate the rate of the tissue loss in the areas affected by the disease, and quantitative measures are essential for the assessment of the disease. Furthermore, the human eye cannot perceive the minimum degree of atrophy, and without quantitative measurements, image evaluation is subjective. On the other hand, by using only MMSE tests, MCI, which represents a transitional period between normal ageing and clinical probable AD, cannot be easily identified through cognitive tests, mainly because these subjects do not have severe memory problems [6] . As the size of the MRI datasets increases and manual This review describes the overall results, including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of the image-processing methods that assess AD as observed in structural MRI. Additionally, it describes the effectiveness of these methods in the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. The rest of this review is organized as follows. Section II presents the CAD system pipeline and Sections III and IV present the use of CAD systems in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, respectively. Section V concludes which methods and structures are suggested for both diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Section IV addresses and suggests future directions for the assessment of AD."}, {"section_title": "II. CAD SYSTEM PIPELINE", "text": "The objective of CAD systems is to assist the radiologist in the interpretation of medical images as a supporting tool. Furthermore, CAD provides quantitative information for ROIs to produce accurate and complete pathology reports. In medical image analysis, the following steps, i.e., image acquisition and preprocessing, ROI segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and interpretation, are usually carried out to provide quantitative measurements of biomedical images. Medical image analysis steps and techniques used for the development of CAD systems for the assessment of dementia are analyzed in this section."}, {"section_title": "A. Datasets and Preprocessing", "text": "In AD research, many investigators obtain their data from online databases (see Table I ). These databases provide researchers with study data to define the progression of AD. One of the most comprehensive databases is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [16] , an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by a principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The ADNI image processing pipeline includes postacquisition correction of gradient warping (Gradwarp) [17] , B1 nonuniformity correction [18] depending on the scanner and coil type, and phantom-based scaling correction [19] . For up-to-date information, see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/. Apart from the ADNI, the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle flagship study of aging (http://aibl.csiro.au) has already enrolled 1100 participants and collected over 4.5 years' worth of longitudinal data. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) [20] provides data to be used in the determination of diagnostic markers for the assessment of AD and the data are divided in two sets: the cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented and demented older adults and the longitudinal MRI data in nondemented and demented older adults. AddNeuroMed [21] is a cross European public/private consortium developed for AD biomarker discovery. It combines modalities, and it uses animal models in biomarker research.\nFurthermore, two large dementia challenges where research groups could test and compare their algorithms in the AD assessment are the CADDEMENTIA [22] (http://caddementia.grandchallenge.org) and the Alzheimer's Disease Bid Data DREAM challenge (http://dreamchallenges.org)."}, {"section_title": "B. ROI Segmentation", "text": "The role of segmentation in medical imaging is to separate an image into regions to study anatomical structures, to identify ROIs, or to measure the volume of a tissue. For the automatic segmentation of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF from magnetic resonance (MR) images, three methodologies have been proposed: statistical-based segmentation methods, learning-based segmentation methods, and atlas-based segmentation methods. Atlas-based segmentation methods are the most frequently used in medical image segmentation. In atlasbased segmentation, an intensity template is registered nonrigidly to a target image, and the resulting transformation is used to propagate the tissue class or anatomical structure labels of the template into the space of the target image [23] . The study by Babalola et al. [24] compared atlas-based and modelbased segmentation techniques and was tested on 270 subjects. The two atlas-based methods, classifier fusion and labeling and expectation-maximization segmentation using a dynamic brain atlas, performed significantly better than the model-based methods, profile active appearance models, and Bayesian appearance models. Factors that affect accuracy in multiatlas segmentation are presented in [23] .\nBased on the aforementioned segmentation methods, several software \"pipelined\" image analysis packages for automated brain tissue segmentation have been developed (see Table II ). These packages usually contain skull stripping, intensity nonuniformity correction, and automated segmentation. FreeSurfer (Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Harvard-MIT, Boston, MA, USA) [25] is an open-source software suite [29] is a graphical workflow environment, which allows grid utilization and provides a significant library of computational tools. It was built to be used in complex neuroimaging analysis, which requires deep knowledge about the input/output requirements of algorithms. The LONI Pipeline could be used to design, execute, validate, and deliver complex heterogeneous computational protocols."}, {"section_title": "C. Feature Extraction", "text": "Thus, through feature extraction, it is possible to retrieve important data that can assist the characterization of a pathology. Feature extraction methodologies analyze objects or images to extract the most prominent features that are representative of the various classes of objects. Table III lists selected methods that are currently used in the assessment of AD as described in [30] , where these methods were compared. According to Cuingnet et al. [30] , these approaches can be divided into three categories, depending on the type of features extracted from the MRI: 1) voxel based, if the features are derived from GM, WM, or CSF; 2) vertex based, if the features are derived from the cortical surface such as thickness measurements; 3) ROI based, if the features are derived from ROIs. However, apart from the hippocampus, it should be noted that the entorhinal cortex is also a structure currently used Measures the cortical thickness in specific areas [31] Volume and Shape\nHippocampus and Entorhinal cortex -Discriminative power of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex only [16] , [39] , [40] , [49] - [53] , [41] , [54] - [56] GLOSSARY: STAND: structural abnormality index; ROI: region of interest; GM: gray matter; WM: white matter; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid.\nby many studies for the assessment of AD. In this review, structural MRI features derived from voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical thickness, volume, shape, and texture are described.\nIn the assessment of AD, VBM has the advantage examining the whole brain and not a particular structure. Specifically, it detects differences in the local composition between different brain tissue types such as GM and WM [50] . First, the brain images are segmented into their three main tissue components, GM, WM, and CSF and, then, are spatially normalized to the same stereotactic space. This allows different brains to be compared directly through a voxelwise statistical analysis over the entire brain. For technical and methodological information about VBM, the reader is referred to [51] . Nowadays, VBM is used to examine the whole volume of the brain and to detect differences or similarities in images for two populations [52] . Furthermore, it is also used to calculate cortical thickness changes on the entire cortex. A limitation of thickness measurements is that they cannot detect changes on subcortical structures such as WM or CSF; therefore, it is only used to detect the regional distribution of cortical atrophy. In general, some of the limitations of VBM include systematic registration errors during spatial normalization [53] and difficulties in detecting WM changes in T1 MRI sequences or pathologies that are not common in the majority of a population [54] .\nVolumetric techniques are used to measure the volume of a structure; however, a major weakness of volume analysis is that the thickness or shape of a structure might change before its volume. According to [55] , global hippocampal volumetry might not be always sensitive enough to follow changes within a single population, which may reflect conversion from a healthy state or disease progression. In differential diagnosis, VBM showed higher accuracy from volume measurements, in the ability to differentiate AD from FTLD [14] , [15] .\nShape analysis is used in digital geometric models of surfaces and/or volumes of objects of interest in order to detect similarities or differences between the objects [56] . It examines the shape of a structure that gives not only more sensitivity to follow the progression of the atrophy, but also allows its evaluation in different subfields. Among the many techniques [56] used to obtain shape features of the human brain, corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), deformation-based morphometry, and deformable models are the methods mainly used, mainly due to alignment factors.\nTexture is an indistinct concept often attributed to human perception of variation of the color/intensity of a surface, quantifying properties such as smoothness, coarseness, and regularity. It could be argued that texture refers to the spatial and statistical relationship of pixel values in an ROI. The early stage of AD is associated with small-scale changes in terms of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque deposition [57] . According to Castellano et al. [58] , these small-scale changes are able to form certain textural patterns in MRI images recognizable by extracting texture descriptors from the image. In AD, texture analysis is less used than the other methods. However, the information provided by texture analysis cannot be visible through volume and shape properties [36] ; thus, it may have the advantage of detecting earlier microscopic alterations [58] . Broadly, the approaches used to describe texture features in neuro MRI can be split into syntactic, statistical, and spectral [59] .\nStatistical-based approaches (see Table IV ) are mostly used, and they represent the texture indirectly by nondeterministic properties that prescribe the distributions and relationships between grey levels of an image [59] . According to Kovalev et al. [60] , 3-D texture features contain more spatial information, higher sensitivity, and specificity compared to 2-D techniques. Three-dimensional texture features include the use of Predict classification in a group based on continues variables [31] , [66] , [68] , [72] , [77] , [94] , [95] Logistic regression [96] It examines relationships between a categorical Y and a continuous X variable [81] , [97] Neural networks Fit nonlinear models using nodes and layers. Could be very good predictors [78] Support vector machines [89] , [98] Supervised, multivariate learning methods used for classification, as well as regression [32] , [36] - [38] , [40] , [41] , [75] , [99] law filters [61] , run-length matrices (RLMs) [62] , subband [63] , [64] , Gaussian-Markov random fields, and a combination of co-occurrence matrices and Gabor filters [63] . For a review on the 3-D texture, the reader is referred to [65] ."}, {"section_title": "D. Classification Methods", "text": "Classification is used for the identification of patterns features of interest into the classes they belong. Moreover, machinelearning techniques have the potential to classify MR features without requiring a priori hypotheses from where this information may be coded in the images [86] . When classifiers are used, image samples are divided into two sets: training and testing [87] . The most popular statistical techniques used in CAD include discriminant analysis (DA), logistic regression (LR), neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM). These techniques are presented in Table V .\nWhen the sample size is large, linear DA and LR have similar results, whereas in smaller samples, DA performs better. Furthermore, DA is faster compared to LR. Regardless of the data distribution, LR performs well, and it should be used as the first choice to classify data [88] . On the other hand, DA is preferred when the variables are categorized and as long the assumptions are met. Furthermore, DA is preferred when the number of categories is big enough to let the estimated mean and variance be close to the population values of the continuous explanatory variables [88] .\nSVMs were developed by Vapnik [89] , and they represent pattern recognition algorithms based on training, testing, and performance evaluation. Compared to DA that is a more generative method as it focuses on all data points, SVMs are more discriminative as they concentrate on the points that are difficult to classify. They can be used when the data have an unknown distribution [90] , and one of their strongest advantages is that they provide excellent results in pattern recognition and good generalization performance. Furthermore, they offer a possibility to train generalizable nonlinear classifiers in high-dimensional spaces using a small training set [91] .\nNeural networks can be used as an alternative to LR. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) benefit from the availability of multiple training algorithms; they require less statistical training and perform well in predicting medical outcomes. Limitations of ANNs include computational load, restricted potential to unmistakably detect possible causal relationships, and overfitting suffering [92] . Table VI tabulates CAD systems for the classification of MCI and AD. Quantitative MRI studies tabulated in the following are based on amyloid, volume, thickness, shape, and texture analysis that are described in the following subsections. For each study, the main author, ROI, data type, the number of subjects and classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are given."}, {"section_title": "III. COMPUTER-AIDED SYSTEMS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Quantitative MRI Studies Based on VBM", "text": "VBM describes global changes or atrophy of deep cerebral structures. Evans et al. [100] revealed a mean standard deviation whole-brain loss at 1.5% per year in AD patients compared to 0.5% per year in NC. On the other hand, MCI subjects had an intermediate rate of 1.1% loss per year. Interestingly, in this study, it was noticed that MCI patients who converted to AD had brain atrophy twice more than the MCI patients who did not progress to AD.\nBusatto et al. [101] used a fully automated VBM technique to evaluate GM abnormalities over the entire area of the temporal lobe in the classification of NC subjects from AD patients. Their results confirmed the findings of previous ROI-based studies [11] , [102] , [103] , where significant GM loss was detected bilaterally in the MTL region in AD patients. The entorhinal cortex was found to be the primary region where the neurodegenerative changes initiate in the earliest stages of AD. Karas et al. [34] used VBM, and apart from the earlier findings in the atrophy of the hippocampus, they demonstrated global reduced GM volume including the cerebellum, medial thalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus as well of the cingulum in AD patients. Their findings collated with the histopathological staging of Braak et al. [9] , [104] . Another study by Karas et al. [105] analyzed the patterns of GM loss in order to examine what characterizes MCI and what determines the differences with AD by using VBM methods. Apart from quantifying the extent of GM loss between MCI subjects and AD patients, the authors wanted to investigate if the hippocampal volume still changes in patients who converted to AD. The results of the study showed that MCI patients had GM loss in the MTL area, where the parietal and cingulate cortices were areas more related to AD patients. Whitwell et al. [42] compared the pattern of GM loss in MCI patients who progressed to AD within a fixed time of period (18 months from baseline scan) with the subjects who remained stable. Compared to NC, the subjects that progressed to AD had bilateral GM loss in specific regions of the brain. Interestingly, the nonprogressed MCI patients had no areas of GM loss when compared to the NC. Thus, the VBM method might not be the most sensitive technique for the classification of normal and MCI patients. However, when the two groups (stable and progressed MCI) were directly compared, the progressed group showed more GM atrophy.\nKl\u00f6ppel et al. [37] used a voxel-based SVM approach to analyze the GM of NC and AD patients through modeling two different anatomical areas: in the first model, they used data from the whole brain, and on the second, they used data from a hippocampus-centered ROI. Their method reached an accuracy of 90% when evaluated on 20 NC and 20 AD subjects."}, {"section_title": "B. Quantitative MRI Studies Based on Volume Analysis", "text": "Several studies used hippocampal volumetric measurements and confirmed that hippocampal atrophy can constitute a useful diagnostic biomarker. The studies that used AD patients and NC from the ADNI database reported that the hippocampal volumes were varying between 1600 mm 3 [106] and 3000 mm 3 [107] . According to the study by Schuff et al. [106] , the hippocampal loss was accelerated by 26.5 \u00b1 4.5 mm 3 /year 2 in AD and 12.1 \u00b1 3.2 mm 3 /year 2 in MCI, equivalent to \u22121.6 \u00b1 0.2%/year 2 and 0.6 \u00b1 0.2%/year 2 , respectively, relative to baseline volume. One of the first studies where MRI was used to investigate if volumetric measurements in MTL could provide information for the classification of NC and AD patients took place in 1997, by Jack et al. [108] . Their study included 126 NC subjects and 94 probable AD patients, where they estimated volume measurements of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the amygdala. Their results showed a parallel structure decline with increasing age in control subjects for both women and men, and in each case, MTL volume in AD patients was significantly smaller compared to NC subjects (p < 0.001). The MTL structure, which performed better for this classification, was the hippocampus. In 2001, Galton et al. [67] confirmed that hippocampal atrophy is a useful diagnostic biomarker, and they showed that there was a 50% hippocampal atrophy in AD patients.\nIn [39] , Colliot et al. used hippocampal volume to distinguish NC from MCI and AD patients. The technique used was previously used by Chupin et al. [109] , and it was fully automated where both the hippocampus and amygdala were segmented at the same time. The results of their study revealed significant hippocampal volume reductions in all groups of patients. Specifically, there was a 32% volume reduction between AD and NC, a 19% reduction between MCI and NC, and, finally, a 15% reduction between AD and MCI.\nApart from hippocampus, other structures such as entorhinal cortex are used for the assessment of AD. However, because it is controversial whether entorhinal cortex or hippocampus is more affected with the disease progression, the study by Juottonen et al. [68] used volumetric MRI on AD patients and NC subjects to investigate which of the two structures was more affected. Both structures had the ability to differentiate AD patients from NC subjects, and no essential difference was found between the discriminative power of entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volumes. Specifically, the volume of entorhinal cortex in AD patients was 38% less on the right and 40% less on the left side, compared to NC subjects. A similar pattern of atrophy was noticed on the hippocampal volume, where it was 33% less on the right and 35% less on the left side compared to NC subjects. Obviously, in the late states of the disease, both structures have a similar atrophy rate.\nAccording to Pennanen et al. [72] , the appropriate ROI selection should depend on the classification group. Thus, they investigated which structures of the brain can be used to best classify the three different study groups. Their results showed that entorhinal cortex atrophy was more severe, in comparison with hippocampus volume, in MCI subjects, whereas, in AD patients, the hippocampal atrophy was more pronounced. Specifically, the best overall classification (66%) between MCI and NC subjects was achieved with entorhinal cortex, whereas the best overall classification (82%) between MCI and AD patients and between NC and AD patients (91%) was achieved with hippocampal volume. Similar to [68] , the left hippocampal atrophy appears to be more severe for all the subjects."}, {"section_title": "C. Quantitative MRI Studies Based on Thickness Analysis", "text": "Desikan et al. [31] carried out automated structural measurements of entorhinal cortex and supramarginal gyrus thickness in order to differentiate MCI subjects and AD patients from normal patients. They used baseline volumetric scans from two independent cohorts, where images were obtained from the OASIS [20] and the ADNI database [16] . Hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus thickness indicated an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.91 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.95 in the validation cohort. It should be mentioned that their results were comparable or even more accurate from nuclear medicine techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET [110] , [111] or amyloid-binding PET studies [112] , [113] . Furthermore, discrimination accuracy of MCI subjects in this study was comparable to one prior PET study utilizing a radioactive amyloid and tau protein tracer [113] and two MRI studies [95] , [114] .\nLerch et al. [94] used an automated method to measure the cortical thickness across the entire brain and detect differences between AD patients and NC. Cortical thickness was declined in many areas of the brain; however, the parahippocampal gyrus and the MTLs were the areas most affected. Similarly to other studies [68] , [72] , it was found that the left side of the brain was more severely affected. Therefore, according to this study, cortical atrophy in the early stages of AD is not related only to MTL but to the limbic system, the lateral temporal lobes, and cortex as well."}, {"section_title": "D. Quantitative MRI Studies Based on Shape Analysis", "text": "Gerardin et al. [41] used hippocampal shape features instead of volume analysis, and specifically, SPHARM coefficients were used to model the hippocampal shape. Their results revealed that shape analysis can detect local atrophy on the hippocampus, before it starts losing volume. Therefore, this technique may be more sensitive and in particular at the MCI stage. Shape analysis can be used to reveal atrophy on local and nonglobal areas of the hippocampus, and according to the authors, the classification accuracy between AD patients and NC subjects was superior to studies that used volume analysis where classification accuracy was ranging from 80% to 90%. Furthermore, when MCI patients were involved in volume studies, the discriminative power was even lower, ranging from 60% to 74%. However, these results were reported in volume studies where manual and not automated segmentation was used.\nCh\u00e9telat et al. [43] conducted a longitudinal study where MCI subjects were followed for 18 months. Their purpose was to project possible atrophy maps onto a 3-D surface view of the hippocampus between MCI patients who converted or not to AD, compared to the profile of GM loss across normal aging. Their results showed that atrophy was more significant in converters than in nonconverters, and this effect was more marked at follow-up. Interestingly, for both converters and nonconverters, the hippocampal atrophy was more evident on the superiorlateral part of the hippocampus, called CA1. Histopathological studies [115] also agreed that there was a relatively higher degree of atrophy in that specific hippocampal subfield. Similar results were observed by Apostolova et al. [74] . On the other hand, GM loss with increasing age was more severe on the inferior part of the hippocampus corresponding to the subiculum, something that was reported by Frisoni et al. [116] as well. Ferrarini et al. [75] used hippocampal shape-based markers in the CA1 region, and by using SVMs on either one or both hippocampi, they discriminated AD patients from NC subjects with an overall accuracy of 90%, and stable MCI subjects from MCI converters with an accuracy of 80%."}, {"section_title": "E. Quantitative MRI Studies Based on Texture Analysis", "text": "Freeborough and Fox [77] used texture analysis for the classification of AD patients from NC. They extracted features by using gray-level co-occurrence matrices for offset angles of 0 o , 45 o , 90 o , and 135 o . From each matrix, they derived 13 features, and the mean and range of each feature over the four offset angles were completed. They indicated that texture analysis can reveal significant different values between NC and AD patients. Zhang et al. [78] used 3-D texture features to identify NC from AD patients. Over 100 texture features were extracted from spherical ROIs placed within the area of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, using image histograms, gradients, co-occurrence matrices, and RLMs. To investigate the impact on the ROI selection, they placed 3-D ROIs in three ways. The ROI that performed better included the regions of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and part of CSF. The selection of a larger ROI, which in this case included a part of the CSF, generated a higher classification accuracy. They achieved the highest accuracy mentioned in the literature, maybe due to the fact that they used severely affected AD subjects.\nde Oliveira et al. [79] applied texture analysis on MCI subjects. In their analysis, they choose to use the thalamus and calossal due to their anatomic heterogeneity, which is more suitable for texture analysis. The analysis was carried out separately for the two ROIs using manual segmentation and the MaZda tool [117] to extract the features. According to the authors, this method was more reliable than other techniques [77] , [118] , [119] , where the whole-brain texture was analyzed. The objective of their study was to classify NC from amnestic MCI subjects and mild AD patients, and through their analysis, they revealed differences between the thalamus and corpus callosum, which differentiated the two groups of subjects.\nSimoes et al. [36] used a whole-brain approach by applying local statistical texture maps for the classification of MCI subjects from NC. Through SVM, they achieved a mean accuracy of 87%. However, their sample was small (N = 30). In the study by S\u00f8rensen et al. [81] , the classification capabilities of hippocampal texture were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves with the corresponding AUC as performance measure. Texture analysis had an AUC of 0.912 in discriminating NC versus AD and 0.764 between NC versus MCI. For the same groups, the AUC curves for volume analysis were 0.909 and 0.784, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study that evaluated if there is a correlation between texture and the volume of the hippocampus in MCI subjects. Regarding prognosis, it was shown that the hippocampal texture is superior rather than volume measurements with an AUC of 0.74 versus 0.67, respectively, and their results were correlated with FDG-PET."}, {"section_title": "IV. PREDICTION OF CONVERSION FROM MCI TO AD", "text": "Recently, the task of predicting conversion from MCI to AD has received a lot of attention, mainly because, nowadays, large multicenter studies, such as the ADNI, provide longitudinal data to the research community. The MCI term was first introduced in the literature by Reisberg et al. [120] in 1988, and two decades later, Farias et al. [121] showed that a 10-15% rate of MCI subjects will progress to dementia. The biggest challenge in AD assessment is to predict if a patient will develop the disease. The identification of these patients is of great importance as they will be provided earlier with possible preventive pharmaceutical (or nonpharmaceutical) interventions. Currently, many studies investigate the prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD using feature sets similar to the ones used for the classification of subjects. A selection of these studies can be found in Table VII ."}, {"section_title": "A. Prediction Based on VBM", "text": "Davatzikos et al.

Similar to [52] and [109] , the CA1 area appeared to be more affected, and it showed more diagnostic accuracy from the total hippocampal volume. In contrast to [68] , [69] , and [72] , where lateralized hippocampal atrophy was mainly observed, the study by Davatzikos et al. [114] indicated bilateral hippocampal atrophy. When the results were cross-validated, the analysis showed a 90% predictive power. In a more recent study by Davatzikos et al. [44] , where VBM was used, a lower classification accuracy (56%) was achieved maybe due to the fact that the SVM was trained on NC and AD patients. In [99] , Misra et al. used VBM analysis to evaluate the volume of WM and GM in 103 MCI subjects, which they were followed up for 15 months in order to predict, which individuals will convert to AD. They evaluated their results via cross-validation and achieved a classification accuracy of 82%. However, the number of progressive MCI patients was low (N = 27); thus, the results of this study are not directly comparable to other studies that used the ADNI image set. Plant et al. [45] used three different classifiers including SVM, Bayes, and voting feature intervals. When the anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex were included in the measurements, the best predictive accuracy obtained was 75%. Duchesne et al. [122] used only MTL in their VBM analysis, and their results were better compared to other studies (see Table VII ) that used the whole brain.\nKoikkalainen et al. [123] used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to classify stable from progressive MCI subjects. They selected ROIs using statistical maps of differences on their test set, and they achieved an overall accuracy of 72%. However, their results may be biased as the training and testing were not completely independent. Ch\u00e9telat et al. [46] longitudinally assessed (for 18 months) the possible structural changes in MCI patients and then compared these changes between the nonconverter and converter subjects. A fully automated VBM analysis was carried out, and results were similar to the changes observed by other VBM studies such as [105] . Interestingly, (perhaps due to methodological issues) in contrast with most of the ROI volume studies, they did not detect any hippocampal volume differences between AD and MCI patients, suggesting that a plateau has been reached."}, {"section_title": "B. Prediction Based on Volume Analysis", "text": "Chupin et al. [40] used an automated segmentation technique of the hippocampus and amygdala, and hippocampal volume was calculated to predict the conversion from MCI to AD. An overall classification accuracy of 64% was achieved, indicating that global hippocampal volume evaluation may not be an accurate measure for prognosis, mainly due to the fact that hippocampal volume is variable in young and older adults, which, in turn, may have implications on the final results [124] .\nThe study by Tapiola et al. [125] used MCI patients who were followed-up for 34 months to investigate the predictive value of different methods on conversion from MCI to AD. They used MRI-derived volumes of MTL structures, WM lesions, MMSE scores, and APOE genotype. Interestingly, their results revealed that only MTL volume was able to predict the patients at high risk for developing the disease. Similar results were observed in the study by deToledo-Morrell et al. [97] , where hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes were compared to determine which of the two regions could differentiate stable from progressive subjects. Twenty-seven MCI patients were followed after baseline diagnosis for 36 months, and ten of them converted to AD. The results showed that both hippocampus and entorhinal cortex could make the prediction; however, the entorhinal cortex was the best predictor with a rate of 93.5%.\nKilliany et al. [12] investigated the most frequent ROIs used in volume analysis for the assessment of AD, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex. Patients with mild AD at baseline were included as well. The measures between the two ROIs were different for each of the pairwise comparisons between the groups. The entorhinal cortex volume was able to differentiate the subjects that will probably develop the disease with an accuracy of 84%, whereas the hippocampal volume could not. The study suggested that more neuronal changes occur within the entorhinal cortex during the preclinical phase of AD, and as the disease spreads, atrophic changes develop within the hippocampus as well. Similarly to the study by Pennanen et al. [72] , the hippocampal volume loss in MCI subjects was 8%, whereas, in entorhinal cortex, volume loss was almost double.\nDevanand et al. [126] measured hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. In this large longitudinal study, 163 MCI patients and 63 NC subjects were followed for five years. Their results confirmed most of the findings of other studies that used smaller samples [12] , [127] , where hippocampal and entorhinal cortex had more atrophy in MCI converters to AD compared to NC and MCI nonconverters. Specifically, entorhinal cortex volume in converters was 17% lower than in nonconverters and 29% lower than in NC. For hippocampal volume, the percentages were 11% and 14%, respectively. Interestingly, it was observed that when both regions were used together with cognitive scores, the prediction accuracy was improved to 87.7%. Both hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes contributed to the prediction; however, the entorhinal cortex remained highly significant even after controlling for age and cognitive measures. On the other hand, hippocampal volume correlated with cognitive measures and, thus, less significant for prediction.\nKilliany et al. [95] found that entorhinal cortex and superior temporal sulcus including the anterior cingulate gyrus (which is not yet known at which stage of the disease starts to involve) were the most useful regions for prediction of conversion to AD. These areas were used to determine if quantitative MRI measures at baseline could be used to determine whether subjects in the prodromal phase of the disease could be accurately identified before they develop AD. A discrimination accuracy of 93% between NC and the subjects with memory difficulty who eventually developed the disease was achieved. The discrimination accuracy of the subjects with memory difficulty who did not developed the disease between the NC and the converters was 85% and 75%, respectively. Entorhinal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus ROIs were the best discriminators when NC were included."}, {"section_title": "C. Prediction Based on Thickness Analysis", "text": "Querbes et al. [66] used baseline normalized thickness index on a large sample of patients for the prediction of conversion from stable MCI to AD and compared it to the predictive values of the main cognitive scores at baseline. Their results showed that subtle structural changes could be detected and used to predict the outcome even two years before the clinical symptoms appear with a predictive value of 73%. This study had the advantage of using a cross-validation procedure. However, according to Eskildsen et al. [128] , the results of the study most likely show an overestimated accuracy, as some subjects are used both for training and testing. Bakkour et al. [35] investigated the abnormalities of the cortex on patients with questionable AD and tried to detect which neocortical measures were better for early diagnosis and predictive power. A total of 49 questionable AD patients were longitudinally followed-up for 2.5 years, and according to their results, 20 patients converted to mild AD, while 29 remained stable. The MTL cortical thickness achieved the best performance.\nIn a very similar study [128] , patterns of cortical thickness measurements were used for the prediction of AD. It was observed that atrophy patterns differed with the disease progression; thus, by learning these differences, the prediction accuracies could be improved. MCI subjects who had scans at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months prior to the diagnosis of AD were selected from the ADNI database, and they were grouped into time-homogenous groups of progressive MCI. Then, these patients where compared with MCI subjects who remained stable during their longitudinal study period. Interestingly, it was noted that even at 36 months prior to the AD diagnosis, the hippocampus could not be used for prediction of the disease. On the other hand, the entorhinal cortex was the area affected first, followed by hippocampus. In other studies, such as [40] , [44] , [66] , [99] , and [129] , the baseline data for analysis were not homogeneous with respect to the \"time to conversion,\" since the progressive MCI patients would convert anytime over the course of six months to four years follow-up. According to the authors, such heterogeneity may conceal the neurodegenerative processes that could be attributed to the different substages of AD. For example, the pattern of atrophy could differ one year before diagnosis compared to the pattern two years earlier.\nThe study by Desikan et al. [130] identified MCI patients who converted to AD within two years after baseline with an overall accuracy of 91%. They used automated MRI-based software tools to compute measurements of MTL cortex thickness and volume on 64 ROIs among the two hemispheres of 324 MCI subjects. Furthermore, they compared their results with CSF samples and PET measures, and remarkably, they showed that structural MRI could better predict the disease progression. In a comparable study by Vemuri et al. [131] , where structural MRI and CSF biomarkers on 399 subjects were used, the results were similar. It was found that the Structural Abnormality Index (STAND) score [38] could predict with higher accuracy the time to conversion compared to CSF."}, {"section_title": "D.

This was similar to the accuracy achieved using other predictive models based on nonautomated techniques. Similarly to [73] and [131] , where morphometric pattern analysis was used, the results were significantly better from studies that suggested that 3-D shape analysis is better for the disease prognosis.

Texture appeared to have higher but not significantly different AUC compared to hippocampal volume for the prediction of MCI to AD within 12 months. However, hippocampal texture was significantly better compared to volume, for the prediction of MCI to AD within 24 months, showing an AUC of p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively.

CONCLUDING REMARKS", "text": "Cerebral atrophy, as captured in structural MRI, is a promising biomarker in the assessment of early AD. Many studies [11] , [72] , [95] , [136] proved that MTL is an area that showed atrophy even in the preclinical stage of the disease. Although hippocampal formation might be the most frequently used structure for the assessment of AD, the earlier involvement of the entorhinal cortex was proved by many studies [12] , [67] , [68] , [97] , [101] , [125] , [137] .\nThe necessity of quantitative MRI image processing and visualization derives from the fact that the human eye cannot perceive the subtle anatomical changes affecting the structures of the brain; thus, it detects atrophy after the brain has already undergone irreversible synaptic loss. All the aforementioned studies agree that medical image analysis is essential in the assessment of AD and can be used either for classification between subjects or for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "A.

According to G\u00f3mez-Isla et al. [138] , some entorhinal cortex layers can undergo 40% to 60% neuronal depopulation even in the earlier phase of AD. Indeed, the study by Pennanen et al. [72] revealed that the entorhinal cortex degenerated twice more rather than the hippocampus between NC and MCI. Thus, when AD patients are not included in the classification group, entorhinal cortex is the suggested structure to be used. All methods appear to have lower classification accuracy in this group of patients because, in MCI subjects, the changes are difficult to be identified. Shape analysis appears to be a better technique compared to volume analysis with similar results to voxel-based methods.

Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, entorhinal cortex can provide better results in the classification of NC from MCI subjects, as the atrophy is more severe compared to the hippocampus in the early stages of the disease. For the discrimination accuracy of AD patients from NC and AD patients from MCI subjects, volumetric measurements of the hippocampus seem to be preferred mainly because entorhinal cortex is a very small region that is difficult to delineate when it is atrophied. Furthermore, image artifacts and/or anatomic ambiguities can obscure the boundaries of the entorhinal cortex. However, the hippocampus segmentation is more specific, and it provides more robust and accurate results for these two groups. On the other hand, entorhinal cortex is a better predictor of conversion from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "text": "Nowadays, apart from classification, many researchers are concentrating in the prediction of the disease as well. It is very important to identify specific MRI diagnostic biomarkers to predict whether MCI subjects will eventually convert to AD patients. Perhaps, the initiation of serial MRI scans at annual or longer intervals to investigate the disease progression will provide insight in predicting the MCI subject that will develop the disease.\nInterestingly, for the disease progression, with the use of medical image analysis, morphometric measures derived from structural MRI, can provide similar results with cellular or metabolic markers such as CSF, amyloid A\u03b2, and FDG-PET. A systematic and quantitative metaanalysis by Schroeter et al. [139] involved 1351 patients and 1097 NC from 40 studies. The aim of the study was to reveal the prototypical neural correlates of AD and its prodromal stage. The analysis included data from studies that used structural MRI and studies that measured reduction in glucose utilization or in perfusion with PET. It was suggested that atrophy in the (trans-) entorhinal area/hippocampus and hypometabolism/hypoperfusion in the inferior parietal lobules could predict most reliably the progression from amnestic MCI to AD, although, in a metaanalysis [140] , PET was a better disease predictor than MRI. However, there should be enough clinical information to justify irradiation of a subject, and this a major drawback for PET imaging. After the first symptoms appear, it was found that the evaluation and predictive accuracy was better using structural based biomarkers [131] , [132] , [141] . However, other studies [12] , [72] , [114] revealed that structural MRI can also be used before clinical symptoms appear, and in some cases, it could be more accurate rather than metabolic markers [130] - [132] . Marcus et al. [142] support that amyloid PET imaging should be perform in subjects with suspected AD because it was shown that A\u03b2 plaques could also appear on nondemented elderly subjects. The presence of A\u03b2 plaques in elderly nondemented subjects was also noticed in the study of Pike et al. [143] . Overall, the effectiveness of structural MRI compared to PET in predicting MCI conversion to AD is controversial.\nNowadays, medical image analysis has become a computationally rich process due to the additional new challenges, e.g., to predict if an MCI subject will convert to an AD patient. These processes include many intricate steps run on increasingly larger datasets with the use of many different tools. Graphical workflow environments such as LONI's Pipeline [29] facilitate numerous resources developed at other institutions such as FSL/Oxford [28] or Freesurfer/Harvard [25] . Combination of these tools can be used to analyze images efficiently and effectively. The advantages and possibilities of such workflow environments have not yet been investigated extensively.\nIn classification, the most challenging task appears to be the classification between NC and MCI subjects, as the classification accuracy of most of the studies is lower compared to other group of subjects (see Table VI ). In the study by Davatzikos et al. [114] , evaluation of WM areas of the brain both in the temporal lobe and in the superior and middle frontal gyri appeared to be necessary for the accurate classification of MCI subjects. However, apart from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, limited studies have investigated the aforementioned areas.\nImaging biomarkers are meaningless if they are not correlated with clinical assessment. The combination of two provides a better predictive accuracy [144] - [146] . It is also noted that are very few studies [30] , [129] that combine volume, thickness, shape, intensity, and texture in multivariate assessment of the disease, which, in turn, may result to better classification and prediction accuracies. Martinez-Torteya et al. [80] used images from the ADNI database with their corresponding segmentation masks, provided by Heckemann et al. [147] , to establish ROIs for every image. For each ROI, they used nine texturerelated features together with 13 morphometrical features and 28 signal distribution related features. They revealed an MCI to AD progression biomarker, which yielded an AUC of 0.79. The same is true for the combination of imaging biomarkers derived from structural and functional imaging modalities [111] , [148] , as well as for the combination of MRI with genomic analysis toward personalized medicine and targeted drug development.\nThe use of texture analysis, especially of the 3-D texture, is also very restricted, when compared to the other methods, regarding the assessment of AD. However, some of the best classification accuracies were achieved with textures features [36] , [78] , [81] , and it should be investigated more in the assessment of AD.\nResearch on the assessment of AD mainly involves volumetric 3-D T1-weighted sequences. However, there are several other MRI strategies such as diffusion weighted imaging, MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging [149] that have yet to be investigated in large cohort studies.\nFinally, deep learning is the new trend in medical image analysis that is becoming the methodology of choice in many studies. Deep learning algorithms are based on neural networks of several layers of neurons, through which a signal is propagated and can also be used for segmentation, registration, classification, and other tasks in the assessment of AD [150] .\nQuantitative MRI can have a great impact in the assessment, evaluation, and treatment of AD especially if approaches described in this review move from the experimental stage to the clinical soon. Similarly, quantitative MRI biomarkers could also contribute in dementia differential diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": ""}]
