We used questionnaires to assess stroke (n\u00bc57), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; myocardial infarction, angina and congestive heart failure; n\u00bc44) and death (n\u00bc53) as primary end points. At baseline, we evaluated the carotid-femoral PWV (9.1 \u00b1 1.8 m s \u00c01 ), the glomerular filtration rate and urinary protein excretions. We divided these subjects into those in the highest quartile of PWV and other subjects and into CKD (n\u00bc149) and non-CKD (n\u00bc458). We evaluated the prognostic influences of PWV and CKD with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox's proportional hazard model. PWV in CKD (9.6 \u00b1 1.9 m s \u00c01 ) was higher than in non-CKD (8.8 \u00b1 1.6 m s \u00c01 ; Po0.0001), and creatinine was slightly decreased in the highest PWV group (1.09 \u00b1 0.35 mg dl \u00c01 , Po0.0001). On the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, the highest PWV group (PWV410.1 m s \u00c01 ; P\u00bc0.0003) and the CKD group (P\u00bc0.0005) showed significantly higher proportions of stroke and CVD events. In addition, the highest PWV group showed the highest percentage of stroke (P\u00bc0.0007), and the CKD group showed the highest proportion of CVD (Po00001).High PWV and CKD were independent predictors for stroke and CVD (P\u00bc0.0332) by Cox's proportional hazard model.

Both arterial stiffness and CKD are important risk factors for stroke and CVD; however, the ability of the relationship among these risk factors to predict stroke and cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients has not been reported. Therefore, we analyzed the predictive value of the combination of PWV and CKD for stroke and CVD in hypertensive patients as a part of the Non-invasive Atherosclerotic Evaluation in Hypertension study."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population and study design", "text": "investigated 531 hypertensive outpatients, as shown in Table 1 .

Moreover, we demonstrated that having a high PWV value may be a risk factor for stroke and that the presence of CKD may be a risk factor for CVD in hypertensive patients.\nThere have been several reports that have revealed an association between CKD and arterial stiffness in cross-sectional studies. [12] [13] These reports have suggested that arterial stiffness measured by PWV is associated with the presence of CKD or estimated GFR, which is similar to the results observed as baseline characteristics in this study. Although there have been many reports on the prognostic impacts of CKD, sub-analysis of the Hisayama study suggested that the presence of CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD and coronary heart disease, but not stroke, in a general Japanese population. 3 In this study, presence of CKD was also a risk for CVD, but not stroke, in outpatients with essential hypertension. The Framingham Heart Study revealed 14 that having aortic PWV values in the highest quartile is a risk factor for CVD or stroke by KaplanMeier analysis. The Rotterdam Study 15 also revealed that having aortic PWV values in the highest tertile is a risk factor for CVD and stroke using a Cox's proportional hazards model. In this study, having PWV values in the highest quartile was a risk factor for CVD and stroke in outpatients with essential hypertension. A longitudinal study by Laurent et al. 16 suggested that increased aortic stiffness as measured by higher PWV is a risk factor for coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients. Why are PWV values in the highest quartile a risk for stroke whereas the presence of CKD is a risk for CVD? The results from the subanalysis of the Hisayama study are similar to our results in a general Japanese population. 3 Stroke is influenced to a greater extent by the duration and severity of pressure overload, that is, the history and severity of hypertension, whereas CVD, especially acute coronary syndrome, is based on coronary atherosclerosis. Recently, inflammatory responses 17 and oxidative stress 18 have been considered to be major mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Renal dysfunction is also influenced by inflammatory responses and increased reactive oxygen species. [19] [20] The age-related increase in arterial stiffness is augmented in phases according to the severity of hypertension, 21 and PWV is an independent predictor of the longitudinal increase in SBP and of hypertensive incidents in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 22 Together with these findings, the presence of CKD may be considered a risk factor for CVD via increased inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, and higher PWV may be thought of as a risk factor for stroke based on the history and severity of hypertension.\nWe propose a more sensitive evaluation, combining presence of CKD with being in the highest quartile of PWV to predict the incidence of stroke and CVD in hypertensive patients. More than 40% of hypertensive patients with CKD and high PWV (410.1 m s \u00c01 ) had strokes or CVD events during a 6-year period as assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In our Cox's proportional hazards model, the presence of CKD and high PWV was an independent risk (RR\u00bc2.15) after adjustment of baseline characteristics. Although a further largescale clinical survey will be required, the presence of CKD and increased arterial stiffness may have good predictive value in the management of patients with essential hypertension."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations", "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, this cohort study was hospital-based and not a multicenter study; to avoid study bias and confirm the present results, larger cohort and multicenter trials are needed. Second, patients who enrolled in this study were receiving many types of antihypertensive treatment, and some patients were also receiving statin therapy. Recent reports indicate that treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 11 angiotensin II receptor blocker, 23 or statins 24 improve arterial stiffness. As a result, taking these medications may contribute to better effects on survival. Because these medications would affect the prognosis of hypertensive patients, further studies based on the type of medications are needed. Third, patients with PWV values in the highest quartile and CKD were older and had higher systolic blood pressure in the present study. These determinants may accelerate the progression of aortic stiffness during the follow-up period, resulting in a worse outcome. However, this limitation does not influence the present conclusions, as PWV values in the highest quartile and CKD were accepted as independent risk factors by the Cox proportional hazards model."}]
