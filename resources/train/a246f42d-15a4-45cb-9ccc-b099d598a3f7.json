[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Accurate estimation of cognitive scores for patients can help track the progress of neurological diseases. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised multimodal relevance vector regression (SM-RVR) method for predicting clinical scores of neurological diseases from multimodal imaging and biological biomarker, to help evaluate pathological stage and predict progression of diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Unlike most existing methods, we predict clinical scores from multimodal (imaging and biological) biomarkers, including MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF. Considering that the clinical scores of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are often less stable compared to those of AD and normal control (NC) subjects due to the heterogeneity of MCI, we use only the multimodal data of MCI subjects, but no corresponding clinical scores, to train a semi-supervised model for enhancing the estimation of clinical scores for AD and NC subjects. We also develop a new strategy for selecting the most informative MCI subjects. We evaluate the performance of our approach on 202 subjects with all three modalities of data (MRI, FDG-PET and CSF) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our SM-RVR method achieves a root-meansquare error (RMSE) of 1.91 and a correlation coefficient (CORR) of 0.80 for estimating the MMSE scores, and also a RMSE of 4.45 and a CORR of 0.78 for estimating the ADASCog scores, demonstrating very promising performances in AD studies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Many pattern classification methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, most existing pattern classification methods aim only for the binary classification, i.e., identifying whether a subject is diseased or healthy from the imaging data. Recently, many researchers have started investigating the application of pattern regression methods to estimating the continuous clinical scores from brain images Stonnington et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010 ). Compared to pattern classification, pattern regression methods can help assess pathological stage and predict future progression of neurological diseases. It is well known that many diseases result in a continuous spectrum of structural and functional changes. For example, AD pathology is known to progress gradually over many years, sometimes starting decades before a final clinical stage (Wang et al. 2010) . Many studies on the combination of neuropsychological and neuroimaging data show that the preclinical AD is associated with both cognitive and imaging changes (Caselli et al. 2009 (Caselli et al. , 2007 Reiman et al. 1996 Reiman et al. , 2009 Twamley et al. 2006) . Therefore, pattern regression methods can potentially be used to estimate the continuous clinical scores from neuropsychological and neuroimaging data for helping assess the stage of AD disease or predict clinical outcome.\nMost existing methods for estimating cognitive test scores use only a single modality of data, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Stonnington et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010 ). However, biomarkers from different modalities can provide complementary information for AD diagnosis, which is demonstrated in the recent works on multimodal AD diagnosis (Bouwman et al. 2007b; Chetelat et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2008b; Fellgiebel et al. 2007; Geroldi et al. 2006; Hinrichs et al. 2009a, b; Vemuri et al. 2009; Visser et al. 2002; Walhovd et al. 2010a, b; . For example, MRI can measure spatial patterns of atrophy, and thus can be used to define surrogate markers of the underlying neurodegenerative AD pathology (Fan et al. 2008a) . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may detect early neocortical dysfunction before atrophy appears (De Santi et al. 2001 ). Specifically, some recent studies have reported the reduction of glucose metabolism in parietal, posterior cingulate, and temporal brain regions with FDG-PET in AD patients (Diehl et al. 2004; Drzezga et al. 2003) . Also, before the appearance of atrophy and the reduction of glucose metabolism, the biological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers (such as concentrations of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b242)) can appear at brain regions of AD patients (Bouwman et al. 2007b; de Leon et al. 2007; Fjell et al. 2010) . Therefore, these multimodal data can be potentially used jointly for estimation of clinical cognitive test scores.\nOn the other hand, supervised relevance vector machine regression (RVR) method (Tipping 2001) has been adopted to estimate the continuous clinical scores from brain images Stonnington et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010) . Moreover, Duchesne et al. (2009) demonstrated the relationship between the baseline MRI features and the decline in the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) after 1 year using linear regression modeling for subjects with MCI (Duchesne et al. 2009 ). In addition, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subtest (ADAS-Cog) is the gold standard in AD drug trials for cognitive assessment (Rosen et al. 1984) . In all aforementioned studies, the supervised regression models are employed, which often require many labeled data for training in order to achieve good performance. However, the amount of labeled brain image data is usually limited in clinical practice. Also, due to the heterogeneity of MCI, the clinical scores obtained in cognitive tests, including MMSE and ADAS-Cog (Inoue et al. 2011) , are less stable than those for AD and NC subjects. To partially alleviate this issue, instead of using the clinical scores of MCI subjects in this study, we propose to use only their multimodal data to help train a semi-supervised regression model.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the use of MCI subjects as unlabeled data for constructing a semi-supervised regression model to estimate the cognitive performance from multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. We do however, notice that some investigators have used MCI subjects (also as unlabeled data) for constructing semi-supervised classification models and then using them for classifying AD patients from normal controls (NC) (Filipovych et al. 2011; . However, these semi-supervised classification models can only deal with discrete category (usually binary, i.e., diseased or normal), but cannot estimate continuous clinical scores for disease progression as discussed in this paper. We propose a semi-supervised multimodal relevance vector regression (SM-RVR) method to estimate clinical scores from both imaging and biological biomarkers (i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF) for new subjects. Moreover, we develop a new strategy to select the most informative MCI subjects for training our semi-supervised regression model (SM-RVR).\nIn our proposed SM-RVR method, we first employ a knearest neighbor (k-NN) regression model to estimate the clinical scores for the MCI training subjects. Then, we use a supervised multimodal RVR (M-RVR) to select the most informative MCI subjects by iteratively testing the capability of each MCI training subject in enhancing the estimation of clinical scores for the new testing subjects. Finally, we train an M-RVR model using all AD and NC training subjects and also those selected informative MCI subjects. We have evaluated the performance of our method on 202 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and achieved very promising results as compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nADNI is the result of efforts by many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations.

Next, for all structural MR images, we used both brain surface extractor (BSE) (Shattuck et al. 2001 ) and brain extraction tool (BET) (Smith 2002) to perform skull-stripping. Then, we further removed cerebellum material. After skullstripping and cerebellum removal, for each structural MR image, we used the FSL package (Zhang et al. 2001 ) to segment it into three different tissues: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After tissue segmentation, we use atlas warping to partition each subject into 93 ROIs via a template shown in Fig. 1 . Then, for each of 93 ROIs, we computed the volume of GM tissue in that ROI as a feature. For the PET image, we used a rigid transformation to align it onto its respective MR image of the same subject, and then computed the average intensity of each ROI in the PET image as a feature. By performing this series of image pre-processing steps, for each subject we acquire 93 features from the MRI image, and another 93 features from the PET image.

The main idea of RVR is summarized as follows. Specifically, RVR is a sparse kernel method formulated in a Bayesian framework (Tipping 2001) . Given a training set with its corresponding target values, such as\n, RVR aims to find out the relationship between the input feature vector x and its corresponding target value t:\nWhere \u03b5 i is the measurement noise (assumed independent and following a zero-mean Gaussian distribution), and f(x, w) is a linear combination of basis kernel functions k(x, x i ) with the following form:\nWhere w \u00bc w 0 ; w 1 ; . . . ; w N \u00f0 \u00de T is a weight vector.\nAccording to (Tipping 2001) , we can obtain a sparse kernel regression model based on the weight vector w.\nMultimodal RVR (M-RVR) Now we can extend RVR to multimodal RVR (M-RVR) for multimodal regression by defining a new integrated kernel function for comparison of two multimodal data x and x i as below:\nWhere x (m) and x i (m) denote the m-th modality of multimodal data x and x i , respectively, k (m) denotes the kernel function over the m-th modality, and c m denotes the weight on the m-th modality. This new integrated multiple-kernel can be embedded into the conventional single-kernel RVR, and thus solved by the programs developed for the conventional single-kernel RVR (Tipping 2001) . To find the optimal values for the weights c m , in this paper, we constrained them so that P m c m \u00bc 1 and then adopt a coarse-grid search through cross-validation on the training samples, which has been shown effective in our previous work for multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) Zhang et al. 2012 . Compared with most existing multi-kernel learning methods (Rakotomamonjy et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2010) , the main advantage of our method is that it can be conveniently embedded into the conventional RVR and thus solved using the conventional RVR solvers, e.g., Sparse Bayesian toolbox (Tipping 2001) . In this paper, we used M-RVR to fuse data from three different modalities, i.e., MRI, PET and CSF. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of M-RVR for multimodal regression using MRI, PET and CSF data."}, {"section_title": "Semi-Supervised M-RVR (SM-RVR)", "text": "As discussed before, due to the heterogeneity of MCI, the clinical scores of MCI subjects are usually less stable than those of the AD and NC subjects. Therefore, the direct use of MCI subjects (i.e., including their corresponding clinical scores as targets) together with the AD and NC subjects for training the regression model could lead to low performance. To address this issue, we propose to first employ the k-NN regression method for estimating clinical scores of MCI subjects by using clinical scores of the AD and NC subjects, which are more stable than those of MCI subjects. Then, we suggest using M-RVR to select the most informative MCI subjects for subsequent data regression by iteratively testing the capability of each MCI training subject in enhancing the estimation of clinical scores for the new testing subjects. These two steps are described below one by one.\nEstimating Clinical Scores of MCI Subjects Figure 3 plots the distributions of AD, NC, and MCI subjects with CSF features. As we can see from Fig. 3 , there exists a large overlap between MCI subjects and AD/NC subjects. This overlap implies that in the CSF feature space the MCI subjects are similar to some AD or NC subjects. Similar phenomena can also be observed in MRI and PET feature spaces, which to some extent explains why AD and NC subjects can be used for estimating the clinical scores of MCI subjects. The flowchart of estimating clinical scores of MCI subjects is shown in Fig. 4 . Specifically, for each modality of MRI, PET, and CSF, we used a respective k-NN (i.e., find the k-nearest neighbors among AD and NC training subjects) to estimate clinical scores of each MCI subject, and then computed the average of estimated scores from all three modalities as the final clinical score for that MCI subject.\nM-RVR Based Recursive Sample Selection, to Select the Most Informative MCI Subjects After getting the estimated clinical score for each MCI subject, one can simply merge those 'relabeled' MCI subjects with AD and NC training subjects to train a regression model. However, to further improve the performance, we propose to first select the most informative MCI subjects and then use them together with the AD and NC training subjects to train the regression model. The flowchart of selecting the most informative MCI subjects is shown in Fig. 5 . Specifically, we denote L as the labeled set which initially contains only AD and NC training subjects, and denote U \u00bc \u00bd u 1 ; . . . ; u i ; . . . ; u r as the unlabeled set which initially contains all MCI subjects with their estimated clinical scores (from AD and NC training subjects using k-NN) as targeted values. Then, we individually combine each sample in U with all samples in L to train an M-RVR regression model (using L as corresponding testing set) and record the corresponding root-mean-square error (RMSE). Finally, the sample u i 0 with the minimum RMSE value (i.e., most informative) in U is selected and added into L, and further deleted fromU. The above procedure was repeated for T iterations to select the most informative subset of MCI subjects. Finally, we trained the M-RVR model using the AD and NC training subjects and also those above-selected most informative MCI subjects (with their estimated clinical scores as targets) to estimate the clinical scores for the new test subjects. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we adopted the popular root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (CORR) as performance measures. In our experiments, we used a 10-fold cross-validation strategy to divide the labeled sample set (i.e., AD and NC subjects) into a training set and a testing set. Specifically, the whole labeled sample set was equally partitioned into 10 subsets. Each time, the subject samples within one subset were successively selected as the testing samples and all remaining subject samples in the other 9 subsets were used for training. This process was repeated for 10 times independently to avoid any bias introduced by randomly partitioning the dataset in the crossvalidation. The RVM regression learner was implemented using Sparse Bayesian toolbox, 1 with the Gaussian kernel. The iteration number T (1\u2264T\u226499), the Gaussian kernel width\u03c3 \u220a{2, 4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512} , and the number of the nearest neighbors k (1\u2264k\u226420) were learned based on the training samples by another cross validation. Similarly, the weights in the M-RVR were also learned based on the training samples, through a grid search using the range from 0 to 1 at a step size of 0.1. Also, for each modality feature in the labeled samples and the unlabeled samples, the same feature normalization scheme as used in ) was adopted here."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison on Different Combinations of MRI, PET and CSF Modalities", "text": "We first evaluated the performance of SM-RVR on different combinations of MRI, PET and CSF modalities (with totally 7 different combinations).

Figures 6 and 7 give the corresponding scatter plots of the actual clinical scores vs. the estimated clinical scores for the estimation of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores, respectively. As we can see from Table 2 and Figs. 6 and 7, the combination of MRI, PET, and CSF can consistently achieve better results than both single-modality and two-modalities cases. Specifically, SM-RVR using all three modalities can achieve a RMSE of 1.92 and a CORR of 0.80 for MMSE scores, and a RMSE of 4.45 and a CORR of 0.78 for ADAS-Cog scores as shown in Table 2 . Table 2 also indicates that the use of two modalities can also improve the regression performance compared with the single-modality cases, although they are inferior to the use of all three modalities. These results validate the advantage of multimodal regression over the conventional single-modal regression in estimation of clinical scores. show that most of CORR values within squares of the upper triangle are larger than those on the three vertices and edges. These results further validate that combining three modalities can achieve better regression results than combining only two modalities or using only one modality."}, {"section_title": "Comparsion with Supervised M-RVR and Other Variants", "text": "To investigate the efficacy of using the unlabeled MCI samples for helping regression, we first compare SM-RVR with 1 http://www.miketipping.com/index.php?page=rvm the supervised M-RVR (M-RVR for short). In our experiment, we implemented two versions of M-RVR, i.e., 1) M-RVR (AD+NC) which trains a supervised model using only the AD and NC subjects, and 2) M-RVR (AD+NC+MCI) which trains a supervised model using not only the AD and NC subjects, but also the extra MCI subjects (with their corresponding clinical scores). Here, for fair comparison, all methods (including both versions of M-RVR and SM-RVR) are validated on the same testing data involving only the AD and NC subjects, since the corresponding clinical scores of the MCI subjects are less stable due to the heterogeneity of MCI. Notice that although both M-RVR and SM-RVR involve MCI subjects in training models, the former uses both data and the corresponding clinical scores of MCI subjects (together with AD and NC subjects) for training a supervised model, while the latter uses only the data of MCI subjects as unlabeled data (together with the labeled AD and NC subjects) for training a semi-supervised model. The corresponding results are shown in Table 3 . As shown in Table 3 , SM-RVR consistently outperforms the two different versions of M-RVR on each performance measure. These findings validate the efficacy of our SM-RVR method in using MCI subjects as unlabeled samples in a semi-supervised framework for improving regression predictive utility. Furthermore, in Fig. 10 , we plotted the curves of regression performance measures (i.e., RMSE and CORR) with respect to the use of different number of unlabeled MCI samples for SM-RVR. It shows that the regression performance of SM-RVR steadily improves at first as the number of unlabeled MCI samples increases, (and is significantly better than that of M-RVR in most cases), but it decreases after reaching a certain value. This indicates the importance of using only the selected informative MCI To further validate the efficacy of selecting the most informative MCI subjects for clinical score estimation, we also implemented a variant of SM-RVR, i.e., SM-RVR without selecting the most informative MCI subjects (denoted here as UNSM-RVR). Specifically, in the UNSM-RVR method, MCI subjects (with their corresponding estimated clinical scores) are directly combined with AD and NC training subjects to train the M-RVR regression model. In Fig. 10 , we also plotted the curves of regression performance measures (i.e., RMSE and CORR) with respect to the use of different number of unlabeled MCI samples when using SM-RVR and UNSM-RVR methods. Here, for UNSM-RVR, we randomly choose a part of MCI samples and directly merged them with the current training set (i.e., training AD and NC subjects) to train the regression model. From Fig. 10 , we can observe that both curves show a rising trend in performance with the increase of MCI subjects in most cases, but SM-RVR is significantly and consistently better than UNSM-RVR in estimating both MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores. This implies that the use of selected MCI subjects as unlabeled samples is superior to using the selected MCI subjects as labeled samples, and also better than the use of all available MCI subjects in clinical score estimation.

The existing semi-supervised learning methods deal with this issue in the following ways: (1) using a manifold hypothesis and the graph Laplacian for delivering the relatedness between labeled and unlabeled samples Belkin et al. 2006) ; (2) learning a propagable graph for semi-supervised classification and regression (Ni et al. 2012) ; (3) transductive learning and varifold Laplacian framework based on the hypothesis of weaker varifold structure (Bruzzone et al. 2006; Ding and Zhao 2010) , etc. Recently, some researchers have used semi-supervised classification methods to diagnose AD or MCI with brain images (Filipovych et al. 2011; .

On the dataset mentioned, our SM-RVR method achieves a classification accuracy of 69.4 % (with 72.4 % sensitivity and 67.8 % specificity), which is comparable to some recently reported results for MCI conversion prediction in the literature. In contrast, M-RVR only achieves a classification accuracy of 66.4 % (with 69.3 % sensitivity and 63.7 % specificity). Also, the M-RVR with only using the AD and NC as training set for MCI conversion prediction achieves a classification accuracy of only 58.4 % (with 64.1 % sensitivity and 54.1 % specificity). This again validates the advantage of our SM-RVR method over the conventional methods in predicting the future conversion of MCI to AD.

Although CSF amyloid and tau biomarker tests are commercially available, they are seldom used due primarily to the lack of an effective disease-modifying therapy. The ADNI consortium dataset provides a robust sample for investigating and validating clinically relevant biomarkers along the spectrum from MCI to AD. The wealth of data available from volumetric MRI brain scans, fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging, and CSF amyloid and tau markers, together with a standard clinical assessment test battery are designed to facilitate the development of more useful clinic diagnostic tests and objective therapeutic outcome measures. The superior results achieved with SM-RVR using all three modalities are not surprising, as each of the three modalities reflects complementary and clinically relevant information. CSF amyloid and tau markers may be more useful in pre-clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of specific anti-amyloid and/or anti-tau therapeutic agents. Quantitative MRI measures of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampal regions, are more likely to reflect episodic memory deficits that are the sine qua non of AD and the amnestic form of MCI. However, variability across MCI subjects that do not conform to the \"amnestic\"subtype is likely to be accounted for better by the use of the SM-RVR multiple regression technique. Brain fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging provides a measure of synaptic functioning and may be most useful as a predictor of clinical progression, as exemplified by predicting conversion of MCI to AD. Depending on the specific application pertaining to diagnostic accuracy or therapeutic monitoring, SM-RVR methodology may be adapted to help streamline clinical therapeutic trials."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our proposed method is limited in the following aspects. First, our proposed regression method separately estimates different clinical variables, without considering their inherent correlations and further exploiting the class labels to aid the accurate estimation of regression variables. Second, our proposed method is based on the multimodal data, i.e., MRI, PET, and CSF, and thus requires each subject to have the corresponding modality data, which limits the size of sample set that can be used for study. Besides MRI, PET, and CSF, there also exist other modalities of data, i.e., APOE, in ADNI database. However, due to the fact that not every subject has all available multimodal data, we are not able to investigate the contribution of those modality data in the current study, although in principle the inclusion of data from more modalities could further improve the regression performance."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised multimodal regression method, namely SM-RVR, to estimate the clinical scores of subjects from both imaging and biological biomarkers, i.e., MRI, PET and CSF. Our method assumes that the clinical scores obtained from MCI subjects may be less stable than those of AD and NC subjects due to the heterogeneity of MCI, and thus MCI subjects should be used as unlabeled data in a semi-supervised regression framework, rather than as labeled data in the conventional supervised regression framework. Furthermore, a scheme for selecting the most informative MCI subjects for helping train regression model is also developed. Experimental results on 202 baseline subjects from ADNI database show that our proposed method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in estimating clinical scores based on pattern regression."}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing Statement", "text": "The dataset used in this paper were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which are available at http://www.adni-info.org.
