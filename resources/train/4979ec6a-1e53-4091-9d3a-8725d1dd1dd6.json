[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Total serum magnesium is a common clinical measurement for assessing magnesium status; however, magnesium in blood represents less than 1% of the body's total magnesium content. We measured intramuscular ionized magnesium by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) and tested the hypothesis that this measure better correlates with skeletal muscle function and captures more closely the effect of aging than the traditional measure of total serum magnesium. Data were collected from 441 participants (age 24-98 years) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a study of normative aging that encompasses a broad age range. Results showed that intramuscular ionized magnesium was negatively associated with age (\u03b2 = \u22120.29, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.08) and positively associated with knee-extension strength (\u03b2 = 0.31, p < 0.001, and R 2 = 0.1 in women; and \u03b2 = 0.2, p = 0.003, and R 2 = 0.04 in men), while total serum magnesium showed no association with age or strength (p = 0.27 and 0.1, respectively). Intramuscular ionized magnesium was significantly lower in women that in men (p < 0.001), perhaps due to chronic latent Mg deficiency in women that is not otherwise detected by serum magnesium levels. Based on these findings, we suggest that intramuscular ionized magnesium from 31 P-MRS is a better clinical measure of magnesium status than total serum magnesium, and could be measured when muscle weakness of unidentified etiology is detected. It may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of oral magnesium interventions, including supplementation."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Although readily accessible as a clinical measurement, serum magnesium (Mg) represents only 0.3% of total body Mg, the majority of which is located in tissue and is active in a variety of enzymatic processes. The intramuscular Mg pool, illustrated in Figure 1 , contains around 27% of the body's Mg, second only to bone, which contains approximately 60% (Vormann, 2003) . Mg in skeletal muscle and bone contributes to homeostasis (Lim et al., 1969) , and defects in serum Mg may not become apparent until these stores are depleted (De Baaij et al., 2015) . Indeed, some individuals show serum Mg levels within the reference range, but have a deficit in total body Mg, while others demonstrate low serum Mg levels but have a physiologic Mg content in tissue (Elin, 2010) . Both hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia have traditionally been diagnosed by serum assays (Durlach, 1988) ; however, serum measures alone may not capture chronic latent Mg deficiency and depauperated Mg reserves (Elin, 2001 (Elin, , 2011 , and both conditions may have important consequences for health (DiNicolantonio et al., 2018) . Indeed, recent reports indicate that many Americans, especially older persons, do not consume the recommended daily amount of Mg: 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women (Institute of Medicine Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, 1997; Vaquero, 2002; Ford and Mokdad, 2003; King et al., 2005) . It has been suggested that inadequate Mg intake contributes to the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength observed in most aging individuals and often associated with disability and higher mortality (Morley et al., 2001; Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2018) . Indeed, recent work by Welch et al. has shown associations between dietary Mg and indices of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and leg explosive power in men and women of all ages (Welch et al., 2016 (Welch et al., , 2017 Hayhoe et al., 2018) . For this reason, measures of intramuscular Mg may serve as better markers than serum Mg for understanding the relationship between Mg levels and skeletal muscle function.\nClinical assays for serum Mg give a \"total\" Mg concentration comprised of protein-bound, complexed, and ionized moieties, which leads to low sensitivity to the biologically active form of Mg, the ion Mg 2+ . Serum ionized Mg can be determined using ion-selective electrodes, but this technique cannot be used to measure intracellular Mg in tissue non-invasively. Furthermore, while 24-h urine Mg is useful (Witkowski et al., 2011) , it is difficult to apply either in an individual subject or at the population level, and it may not reflect tissue Mg in non-steady-state conditions, such as acute kidney injury. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) represents a promising alternative to these methods, providing a non-invasive in vivo measure of intracellular ionized Mg that can be applied directly in skeletal muscle (Williams et al., 1993; Iotti et al., 2000) . The frequency shift of the \u03b2-adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) peak, as determined by 31 P-MRS, depends on Mg complexation with ATP (Gupta et al., 1978) , and gives an indirect estimate of free intracellular [Mg 2+ ] when combined with a simultaneous measurement of pH from the 31 P spectrum. Furthermore, 31 P-MRS also offers insights into cell membrane metabolism and mitochondrial function and may shed light on how these processes change in dysmagnesemia.\nThe primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that intramuscular ionized Mg assessed by 31 P-MRS is a better measure than total serum Mg for assessing Mg status, as well as to understand how Mg status changes with age and how it affects muscle function, namely knee-extension strength. To this end, we investigate the relationships between these measures, age, sex, and muscle function in a cohort of normatively aging men and women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), ranging from 24 to 98 years old. A secondary aim is to investigate other 31 P-MRS metabolites, such as phosphodiesters (PDEs), as possible non-invasive markers of cell damage in skeletal muscle in the context of dysmagnesemia."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The BLSA is a study of human aging that was founded in 1958 and is currently conducted by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging (Shock et al., 1984) .

Data were acquired as part of a previously described exercise MRS protocol for assessing mitochondrial function (Choi et al., 2016; Zane et al., 2017) ; an illustration of the participant setup is shown in Figure 2 . Briefly, subjects were positioned feet-first and supine with the loop coil placed over their vastus lateralis, midway between the greater trochanter and lateral femoral epicondyle. Participants were then shifted laterally to place the left thigh close to the magnet's isocenter, and hook-and-loop straps and pads were applied to their hips, knees, and shins to limit gross displacements during the scan. After localizers and image-based shimming (Sch\u00e4r et al., 2004) , and prior to the exercise MRS FIGURE 1 | An illustration of the aspects of intramuscular magnesium physiology that can be observed using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS). MRS is sensitive to the influence of magnesium complexation on the adenosine triphosphate molecule; this information can be used to estimate the bound magnesium fraction, and thus the proportion of free ionized magnesium, Mg 2+ . In brief, magnesium is involved in transport across the sarcolemma, energetic metabolism, and muscle contraction and relaxation. A third of the total magnesium content of a muscle cell can be found inside mitochondria. Magnesium also mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell through several mechanisms.

Participants were asked to shift to their right on the table to place the sensitive volume of the coil close to the magnet's isocenter, which is indicated by the intersection of the dashed lines. A lower-leg positioning pad and a blanket were then placed over the shins as part of an exercise procedure performed subsequent to the rest MRS protocol detailed in this study. Wedges were placed at the left knee and shin to keep the left leg straight, and hook-and-loop straps and were affixed to the table over the hips, knees, and shins to limit gross displacements during the scan.\nprotocol, a static 31 P spectrum was obtained from the entire sensitive volume of the loop coil with the following sequence parameters: repetition time = 25 s, spectral bandwidth = 2250 Hz, 2048 sampled points, 4 signal averages, 1 startup acquisition, and an adiabatic excitation pulse with a flip angle of 90 \u2022 . A long repetition time was chosen to obviate the need for relaxation correction of metabolite ratios.

This software performed 8 Hz Lorentzian apodization, twotimes zero-filling, zero-and first-order phase correction, and shifting of the phosphocreatine peak to 0 ppm. Spectra were then automatically piped into the AMARES time-domain-fitting algorithm from jMRUI (version 3.0 2 ; Vanhamme et al., 1997; Naressi et al., 2001; Stefan et al., 2009) , which multiplied the first six points of each signal by a quarter-sine wave and corrected any residual phase errors before fitting all metabolite signals and calculating their amplitudes and chemical shifts. The chemical shifts of the two inorganic phosphate resonances, Pi a and Pi b , were then used to calculate a weighted pH. First, the pH was calculated for each Pi resonance using the modified HendersonHasselbalch equation:\n1 www.python.org 2 www.jmrui.eu where \u03c3 1 is the chemical shift difference of the Pi peak relative to phosphocreatine. Second, the weighted pH was calculated as described by Reyngoudt et al.

We show that our 31 P-MRS-based measure of intramuscular ionized Mg captures the effects of age and sex on magnesium status and is an independent correlate of skeletal muscle function, and knee-extension strength, while a conventional clinical assay of total serum Mg was not correlated with these parameters. Our method represents a non-invasive alternative to muscle biopsies for assessing ionized Mg content in muscle. It may be of particular interest for: (1) examining cases of muscle dysfunction where poor Mg status is suspected and the search for other causes is negative; and (2) tracking the effectiveness of Mg supplementation or other interventions aimed at improving Mg status where the homeostatic regulation of Mg may not track with functional reserves.\nSerum Mg is the most common measure of Mg status; however, it does not consistently correlate with tissue Mg concentrations (Fiser et al., 1998; Emelyanov et al., 1999) , and this is true of the data shown here. More than 400 enzymatic processes depend on Mg, so maintaining stable serum levels is crucial. Total serum Mg concentrations range from around 0.7-1.05 mM in healthy people (Lowenstein and Stanton, 1986) , and our data from the BLSA cover a similar range; however, in our cohort, seemingly hypomagnesemic participants with serum levels lower than 0.66 mM did not show a concomitant reduction in muscle function. It is now well-established that some Data are provided for the whole cohort and subdivided by sex, age, and race.\nFIGURE 4 | Intramuscular ionized magnesium is associated with total serum magnesium in men, but not in women. Sex-stratified scatter plots of the estimated ionized magnesium concentration in muscle, from 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, versus the total serum magnesium concentration in 441 participants. To convert mM concentrations of serum magnesium to mg/dL, divide by 0.411. Linear regression was used to assess the association between the two magnesium measures, and the regression line, 95% confidence intervals, and summary statistics are shown. There was a statistically significant negative association between intramuscular ionized magnesium and total serum magnesium in men, but not in women. A total of 459 participants had complete data for 31 P-MRS muscle magnesium and serum magnesium.\npersons who present with a normal serum Mg concentration may in fact be severely Mg deficient, or even in excess of Mg (Elin, 2010; De Baaij et al., 2015) . Such individuals may have a chronically low dietary intake of Mg, which would lead to low Mg concentrations in muscle and bone as these pools are accessed to maintain normal serum levels. This tight homeostasis may explain the weak or non-existent association between total serum Mg and intramuscular ionized Mg demonstrated in previous work (Rosenstein et al., 1995; Carlier et al., 1996; Ryschon et al., 1996) , as well as the weak association shown in this study. We show slightly lower concentrations of ionized intramuscular Mg than Wary et al. (1999) ; however, participants in that work were all young males under the age of 35, while more than 75% of our cohort are over the age of 65, with many female participants. Indeed, our results show significantly lower ionized intramuscular Mg in women than in men, but there was no difference in total serum Mg between these two groups. Several studies have shown sex differences in total serum Mg concentrations (Lowenstein and Stanton, 1986; Ryschon et al., 1996; Hayhoe et al., 2018) , though others have not (Dominguez et al., 2006) . Work by Ryschon et al. (1996) showed statistically significant sex differences in both total serum Mg and 31 P-MRS-measured intramuscular ionized Mg, where the former was lower in women and the latter was lower FIGURE 5 | Intramuscular ionized magnesium is negatively associated with age, while total serum magnesium has no association with age.

In contrast, we found that that intramuscular ionized Mg was lower in women than in men; however, our cohort is much larger than the group studied by Ryschon et al., and the participants are substantially older. The significantly lower muscle Mg that we show in women may indicate a trend of chronic latent Mg deficiency in this study cohort that is not otherwise detected by total serum magnesium levels (Elin, 2001 (Elin, , 2011 . This may also explain other observations from our data: (1) that there was no apparent association between total serum Mg and intramuscular [Mg 2+ ] in women, while there was in men; and (2) that serum calcium levels were significantly higher in women than in men.\nFIGURE 6 | Intramuscular ionized magnesium is significantly lower in women than in men, but there are no sex differences in total serum magnesium.

There were statistically significant negative associations between knee-extension torque and age in both male and female subgroups.\nIn this work, we sought to validate intramuscular ionized Mg as an alternative to total serum Mg using a measure of knee extension strength and, indeed, we found a statistically significant association between intramuscular [Mg 2+ ] and kneeextension strength in our study cohort. However, after adjusting for age, race, and BMI, this association only remained significant FIGURE 8 | Intramuscular ionized magnesium is associated with knee-extension torque, but total serum magnesium is not.

In support of the association we demonstrate between intramuscular [Mg 2+ ] and muscle strength, work by Niermann et al. (2002) has shown reduced intramuscular [Mg 2+ ] and [MgATP] in adult and juvenile dermatomyositis, conditions associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. Dominguez et al. (2006) demonstrated strong associations between total serum Mg These models test the association between intramuscular ionized magnesium and knee-extension strength for female (top section) and male (bottom section) participants, accounting for different sets of confounders. Model 1 tests the unadjusted association between intramuscular ionized magnesium and knee-extension strength; model 2 was adjusted for age, race, and body mass index (BMI); model 3 was adjusted for age, race, BMI, serum calcium, serum albumin, and serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D. All regression coefficients, \u03b2, are standardized. * Statistically significant.\nand muscle performance in the InCHIANTI study, where muscle performance included measures of grip strength, lower-leg muscle power, and knee-and ankle-extension strength. However, in the present work, total serum Mg was not associated with knee-extension strength, despite a strong association between our intramuscular [Mg 2+ ] measure from 31 P-MRS and muscle strength. This disparity may stem from differences between the two cohorts: BLSA participants tend to be very healthy relative to the general population, while InCHIANTI participants are more representative of the broader public, being selected at random from census records (Ferrucci et al., 2000) . Many older adults in the United States do not consume the recommended daily amount of Mg (Vaquero, 2002) , likely due the progressive decrease in the Mg content of foods resulting from food processing and changes in eating habits (Marier, 1986) . Our results show a decline in muscle function with age that may be a consequence of this inadequate Mg intake. Studies looking at the relationship between dietary Mg and muscle strength have shown mixed results: some reported associations between the two measures (Veronese et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2016 Welch et al., , 2017 , while others did not (Scott et al., 2010; Moslehi et al., 2013) . A recent intervention study also found a significant effect of Mg supplementation on functional measures, and this effect was more pronounced in women with a low dietary intake of Mg (Veronese et al., 2014) . Total serum Mg can be used as an integrated measure of dietary intake and other factors (Ayuk and Gittoes, 2014) ; however, it does not accurately reflect dietary intake. Our 31 P-MRS measures of intramuscular ionized Mg may represent a much superior alternative to total serum Mg for assessing intake and monitoring supplementation, as well as offering valuable clinical insight into the etiology of muscle dysfunction. It will be of particular interest in studying sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with age.\nRegarding future work, Dominguez et al. highlighted three possible mechanisms for their observed association between total serum Mg and muscle strength: the role of Mg in cell energetics; increased oxidative stress in hypomagnesemia; and the pro-inflammatory effect of Mg deficiency. Magnesium's role in muscle energy metabolism may be elucidated through the expansive BLSA dataset, which also includes 31 P-MRS-derived measures of mitochondrial function (Choi et al., 2016; Fabbri et al., 2017; Zane et al., 2017) . Reactive oxygen species and inflammation, and their relationship with intramuscular Mg, might be explored using other 31 P-MRS measures, such as the PDE:ATP ratio, which is thought to reflect cell membrane breakdown. We showed that PDE:ATP was positively associated with age, suggesting greater membrane phospholipid breakdown in older age that may be related to oxidative stress. When ionized intramuscular Mg was included as a covariate, it was seen to be positively associated with PDE:ATP. This appears to contradict previous studies that show an association between Mg concentration and oxidative stress; however, a positive association between PDE:ATP and ionized intramuscular Mg may in fact reflect healthy membrane turnover that is facilitated by greater concentrations of intracellular Mg. For comparison, recent work by Reyngoudt et al. (2019) has shown a negative association between [Mg 2+ ] and PDE:ATP that was hypothesized to relate to disruption of the cellular membrane by Ca 2+ . They also showed a negative correlation between [Mg 2+ ] and the phosphomonoester-ATP ratio, which is thought to be a marker of membrane synthesis. The phosphomonoester resonance was not resolvable in our dataset; however, additional data could be acquired to explore the relationship between intramuscular Mg and membrane metabolism in greater detail.\nWe found that intramuscular ionized magnesium was associated with age and muscle function while total serum magnesium was not. As such, our 31 P-MRS measure of muscle magnesium represents a superior assay of magnesium status to total serum magnesium. Thus, it shows potential for identifying chronic latent magnesium deficiency; for investigating muscle dysfunction, particularly in the context of sarcopenia and frailty; and for testing of dietary, exercise, and pharmaceutical interventions."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "text": "The raw data supporting the conclusion of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher, provided they submit a research proposal on the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging website: https: //www.blsa.nih.gov/how-apply."}, {"section_title": "ETHICS STATEMENT", "text": "The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
