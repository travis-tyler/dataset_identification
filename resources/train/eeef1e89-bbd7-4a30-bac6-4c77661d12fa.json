In 2004, thirty-eight percent of seniors expected a graduate/professional degree and 37 percent of seniors expected to earn a bachelor's degree as their highest level of education, compared to 20 percent expecting to attend some college and 5 percent expecting to finish high school or less as their highest educational level. x However, no difference was observed between 1972 and 2004 between the percentage of seniors expecting a bachelor's degree as their highest level of education. Instead, growth was greatest in expectations for a graduate or professional degree: 13 percent of seniors expected to attain this level of education as their highest in 1972, compared to 38 percent of seniors in 2004. x In 1972, males expected to earn a graduate degree as their highest educational level in greater proportions than did females (16 percent versus 9 percent); however, in 2004, females expected to earn a graduate degree more often than males (45 percent versus 32 percent). x Asian seniors' expectations for a graduate degree, which were lower than Whites' in 1972 (17 percent versus 22 percent), topped the expectations of all other groups by 2004 (at 51 percent) and represented the largest percentage point gain in any group (35 points). x Seniors increasingly expected to work in professional occupations (growing from 45 percent of seniors in 1972 to 63 percent of seniors in 2004 expecting to work in a professional field). x More males than females expected to work as craftsmen across all years (10 percent of males versus less than 1 percent of females in 2004); more females expected to work as professionals in all years (71 percent of females versus 54 percent of males in 2004) and as service workers in all years but 1992 (11 percent of females versus 2 percent of males in 2004). xiii Table  Page   1."}, {"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": "Percentage of high school seniors, by sex and race /ethnicity: 1972, 1980, 1992, and 2004 ...............................................................................................................2 2.

Over the past three decades, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has sponsored a series of studies designed to provide both cross-sectional data and longitudinal cohort data that can be used to examine the experiences, attitudes, and achievement of high school students and their transition to young adulthood, postsecondary education, and work. This report updates an NCES report published in 1995, Trends Among High School Seniors, 1972-1992(Green, Dugoni, and Ingels 1995, by including data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002.

All four of these studies were principally longitudinal in design; however, the overall scope and design of each one also provides nationally representative cross-sectional profiles of the nation's high school seniors at the appropriate time in each study. As part of a historical series, the studies have repeatedly collected core questionnaire and academic records items each decade. These areas include cohort demographics; academic coursetaking in the senior year; rates of 12th-grade participation in extracurricular activities; and goals, values, and expectations. For the analyses in this report, students who were seniors during the spring term of their respective study year were included; dropouts, early graduates, or those entering non-graded programs were not included. In this and subsequent chapters, all reported differences have been found to be statistically significant using student's t tests at a level of p < 0.05. Comparisons were tested across years for all seniors and by subgroup, within years across subgroups, and across subgroup gaps across years (e.g., Black-White gap in 1972 versus the same gap in 2004). Given the large number of comparisons made, and because even very small differences can be statistically significant with the large sample sizes involved in these analyses, not all statistically significant differences are discussed in the text.

Academic Coursetaking in the Senior Year of High School", "text": "The recommendations from the oft-quoted A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform (National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983) called for increased core academic subject graduation requirements, implementation of testing standards, increased teacher professionalization, and increased emphasis on student preparation for college in high schools. More recently, the National Goals for Education (1995) and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) have emphasized similar strategies and recommendations for reform. By 1992, most states (42 of 50) had raised course requirements for graduation. 5 Between 1987 and 2004, the number of states requiring at least 2.5 credits in mathematics grew from 12 to 26, and the number of states requiring at least 2.5 credits in science grew from 6 to 23 (Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSSO] 2005). Given such changes in course requirements and demonstrated growth in academic credits among high school graduates (e.g., Planty et al. 2007), more recent senior classes may enroll in academic 6 courses during their senior year in greater proportions than earlier cohorts. This chapter presents new results regarding senior-year coursetaking in three academic subjects-mathematics, science, and foreign language-for the period of 1982 to 2004. 7 While all levels of courses are considered, the focus is on non-enrollment in subject-area courses and enrollment in advanced courses. These provide a snapshot of the extent to which seniors are or are not using their senior year to continue their academic development in these subjects. This snapshot of senior-year coursetaking does not specifically address total credits earned or highest courses taken at any point during high school, but rather provides insight into the coursetaking patterns of seniors only (cumulative credits earned and highest courses taken during high school are the subject of other NCES reports, including Perkins et al. 2004, Dalton et al. 2007, and Planty et al. 2007. Other subjects such as English and social studies are not included in this chapter because of the difficulty of providing any comprehensive ordering of courses from \"low-level\" to \"advanced.\" Due to data limitations of early studies (HS&B in particular), trend analysis of Advanced Placement (AP) courses-the most obvious candidate for distinguishing between high-and low-level English and social science courses-is not feasible (AP courses were not identified in HS&B, and some existing AP courses in NELS:88 were also not identified). A alternative approach would be to examine whether or not students took a full credit in English or social science that year, but this does not provide much information about senior-year coursetaking differences, as the majority of students would have done so. Tables 3 and 4 present the patterns of coursetaking in mathematics for the senior cohorts  of 1982, 1992, and 2004 shows the percentage of high school seniors enrolled in specific mathematics courses during their senior year. x In 2004, thirty-four percent of seniors took no mathematics classes during their senior year, a decline from 57 percent of seniors in 1982 (table 3). Most of this decline occurred between 1982 and 1992."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Coursetaking", "text": "x In 1982, seven percent of seniors were taking trigonometry and 7 percent were taking advanced geometry, more than any other specific mathematics courses (such as basic mathematics, pre-algebra, and statistics and/or probability). x By 1992, algebra II, trigonometry, advanced geometry, and calculus were each being taken by ten percent of seniors, more than were taking any class at or below geometry. x In 1982, five percent of seniors were taking precalculus and 6 percent were taking calculus. These percentages grew to 13 percent of seniors taking precalculus and 13 percent taking calculus in 2004, higher percentages than were taking any other single mathematics course. While table 3 shows that the percentage of seniors not enrolling in any mathematics course declined between 1982 and 2004 and that advanced mathematics (i.e., precalculus and calculus) coursetaking during the senior year increased over this period, table 4 indicates that the percentage of seniors enrolled in basic mathematics courses did not statistically significantly differ between 1982 and 2004 (standing at 16 percent in the latest cohort). Intermediate mathematics coursetaking rose from 17 percent to 25 percent between 1982 and 1992, but showed no difference between 1992 and 2004. Among seniors with different background characteristics, the following was observed: x Sex. In 1982, a higher percentage of females than males (63 versus 52 percent, respectively) did not enroll in a mathematics course their senior year, and higher percentages of males than females enrolled in basic, intermediate, and advanced mathematics courses; by 2004, however, there were no differences in enrollment between male and female seniors (table 4). x Race/ethnicity. In 1982 and 2004, lower percentages of Asian and Black seniors than their Hispanic or White peers did not enroll in mathematics courses during their senior year. In 2004, twenty-one percent of Asian seniors and 27 percent of Black seniors did not enroll in mathematics, compared to 38 percent of Hispanic and 35 percent of White seniors.

The pipeline measures indicate the highest course level taken at any point in the high school career; a student may take their highest mathematics or science course, for example, not in their senior year, but in their junior year, and this course would be reflected in the pipeline measure. In contrast, the courses discussed here are courses taken only during senior year. course at higher rates than their Black or Hispanic peers. In 2004, forty-two percent of Asian seniors enrolled in advanced mathematics, versus 15 percent of Blacks, 15 percent of Hispanics, and 28 percent of Whites. x Socioeconomic status (SES). In all years, seniors from the highest SES quartile took advanced mathematics courses at higher rates than seniors from lower SES groups (in 2004, forty percent of highest SES quartile seniors, versus 14 and 21 percent of lowest and middle two SES quartile seniors, respectively, enrolled in advanced mathematics courses).

Also: x In all years, the science courses most often taken by seniors were advanced biology and general physics: 9 percent of seniors took each in 1982, growing to 18 percent of seniors taking advanced biology and 13 percent taking general physics in 2004 (table  5).  Table 6 shows the percentage of seniors taking no science and taking basic, intermediate, and advanced science courses during their senior year. Basic science courses refer to general science; regular and advanced earth science; general physical science; basic biology, chemistry, and physics; and astronomy/meteorology. The intermediate category represents general biology, chemistry I, and physics I. Advanced science courses refer to chemistry II, physics II, and advanced biology, and include all Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) science courses.

As with mathematics, however, the percentage of seniors taking basic science courses showed no overall differences between 1982 and 2004. By student subgroups: x Sex. In 1982, 69 percent of females were not enrolled in any science courses, compared to 63 percent of males; however, there was no difference between the percentages of males and females enrolled in advanced science courses. In 2004, the science pattern changed: there was no statistically significant difference in nonenrollment, but females enrolled in advanced science courses at higher rates than males: 27 percent of females and 23 percent of males enrolled in advanced science courses in 2004. x Race/ethnicity. Asian seniors had the highest levels of enrollment in advanced science courses and the lowest levels of non-enrollment in science in all years. In 2004, for example, 37 percent of Asian seniors enrolled in an advanced science course, compared to 21 percent of Blacks, 18 percent of Hispanics, 27 percent of Whites, and 23 percent of multiracial students. x Black and Hispanic seniors had lower rates of advanced science coursetaking than Asian and White seniors in all years, though all groups' participation increased from 1982 to 2004 (growing from 8 to 21 percent for Blacks, 6 to 18 percent for Hispanics, 22 to 37 percent for Asians, and 14 to 27 percent for Whites). x SES. In all years, non-enrollment in science courses was lower among the highest SES quartile seniors than among the lowest and middle two SES quartile seniors. In 2004, thirty-eight percent of the highest SES quartile seniors did not enroll in science courses, versus 52 percent of the lowest SES quartile seniors.

Courses are divided between non-enrollment in senior-year foreign language courses, first-and second-year foreign language enrollment, and third-year-and-above enrollment, including Advanced Placement courses. A breakdown of course-specific enrollment rates is not provided because foreign language courses are more difficult to categorize than mathematics or science subjects: some schools provide less-offered languages, and high school seniors may opt to start a new foreign language after completing multiple years of a previous one."}, {"section_title": "Foreign Language Coursetaking", "text": "x In all cohorts, the majority of seniors were not enrolled in foreign language courses, though the percentage declined from 87 percent in 1982 to 75 percent in 1992 and 76 percent in 2004. x Similarly, the percentage of seniors enrolled in a third year or above foreign language course rose from 7 percent in 1982 to 15 percent in 2004.

Their occupational aspirations and educational expectations are associated with their academic achievement and educational attainment (Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey 1998; Reynolds and Pemberton 2001), and some research has shown that minority students possess an advantage in these areas, once differences in socioeconomic status are accounted for (Cheng and Starks 2002;Kao and Tienda 1998;Qian and Blair 1999).

This chapter describes the highest education level students expect to eventually attain, the occupational sector within which they expect to work at age 30, and their perspectives on eight life values such as family life, work life, and impact on society."}, {"section_title": "Educational Expectations", "text": "In each cohort, seniors were asked to indicate the highest level of education that they expected to obtain. The four response categories used in this report are a) high school or less; b) some college (but less than a bachelor's degree); c) bachelor's degree; and d) graduate or professional degree. Table 12 provides the percentages of seniors whose expectations fell into each of these four categories. In 1992 and 2004, a greater proportion of seniors expected their highest level of educational attainment to be a bachelor's degree or a graduate/professional degree than expected to reach some college education or a high school degree or less as their highest level of education. While more seniors expected to end their postsecondary education with a bachelor's degree than a graduate or professional degree in 1972, 1980, and 1992, in 2004, a greater proportion of seniors expected to earn a graduate or professional degree (38 percent) than expected to end their postsecondary education with a bachelor's degree (37 percent). Expectations of attaining a graduate degree increased from 13 percent of seniors in 1972 to 38 percent of seniors in 2004, while expectations for finishing with a bachelor's degree showed no difference when comparing 1972 to 2004. Expectations of attaining some college education short of a bachelor's degree were lower in 2004 (20 percent) than in 1972 (31 percent), as were expectations that a high school diploma or less would be the highest level of education attained (5 percent in 2004, compared to 19 percent in 1972).

In 2004 itself, the main difference among seniors' expectations was that professional occupations were chosen more often than any other occupation (63 percent for professional versus 7 to less than 1 percent for others). Table 14 shows occupational expectations at age 30 by sex, racial/ethnic group, and SES quartile. Statistically significant differences within occupational categories exist by sex, such as: x More males than females expected to work as craftsmen (such as mechanics or painters) across all years (10 percent of males versus less than 1 percent of females in 2004); more females expected to work as professionals in all years (71 percent of females versus 54 percent of males in 2004) and as service workers in all years (11 percent of females versus 2 percent of males in 2004). x In addition, in all years, females expected to be clerical workers at higher rates than males, but the gap declined from 24 percent in 1972 to less than 1 percent in 2004. Across racial/ethnic groups, there were few differences that occurred in all years: x More Asian seniors expected to be working as professionals at age 30 than did Blacks or Hispanics in all years, and Whites in all but 1992. In 2004, for example, 70 percent of Asian high school seniors expected to be professionals, compared to 62 percent of Blacks, 59 percent of Hispanics, 63 percent of Whites, and 64 percent of multiracial seniors. x Whites more often expected a professional occupation than their Black peers in 1972; by 1980 and in later cohorts, however, there were no statistically differences between Whites and Blacks in this occupational category. x Beyond expectations of being a professional, Black and Hispanic seniors in 1972 expected to be clerical workers more often than White seniors (27 percent of Blacks and 23 percent of Hispanics versus 13 percent of Whites). However, in 2004, there were no statistically significant differences between these groups in their expectations of clerical occupational status, and all groups had 1 percent or fewer students expecting clerical work in 2004.

Conclusion", "text": "This report examined the following characteristics: demographic characteristics, coursetaking patterns, extracurricular participation, and plans and values of high school seniors across four decades . Focusing on experiences during the 12th-grade year itself, the analysis found shifts in the national composition of high school seniors, changes in senior-year coursetaking, and a variety of differences between student subgroups and over time in extracurricular activities and plans for the future. Some of these changes reflect the continuation of trends observed in the prior version of this report (Green, Dugoni, and Ingels 1995), while others represent breaks or reverses. Changes in the racial/ethnic makeup of high school seniors tracked overall trends in the population, with increasing proportions of Hispanic seniors and a decreasing share of White seniors (chapter 1). Black and Asian seniors also increased their representation in the highest socioeconomic status (SES) groups over time. Students' senior-year coursetaking also mirrored previously observed trends in overall high school coursetaking (Dalton et al. 2007): in their last year of high school, students increasingly enrolled in advanced mathematics, science, and foreign language courses, and smaller proportions skipped enrolling in these subjects at all (chapter 2). The lowest quartile SES groups, in particular, shifted from nonenrollment and into intermediate and advanced courses in these subjects, making SES differences in coursetaking in the latest year of observation (2004) less frequent than in 1982. Seniors' extracurricular participation showed stability or decline in certain activities when comparing 1972 to 2004 (chapter 3). Seniors had higher rates of participation in honor societies in 2004 versus 1972, but lower rates of participation in academic clubs, vocational clubs, newspaper/yearbook, and student government; no differences were observed in sports/athletics. Among student subgroups, other differences were observed: for example, the gap between male and female participation rates in athletics (favoring males) was lower in 2004 than in 1972, but the gap between male and female participation in honor societies was higher in 2004 than in 1972 (favoring females). Senior-year plans also changed over time, but in some instances there was little change in recent years. For example, seniors planned to enter postsecondary school after leaving high school in greater proportions in 2004 than in 1972, but this change occurred entirely between 1980 and 1992-between 1992 and 2004, no significant differences in plans for attending school were observed (chapter 4). Seniors' plans to attend 4-year postsecondary institutions continued to rise, however, with the proportion planning attendance at a 4-year school growing from 54 percent in 1992 to 61 percent in 2004. The gap between highest and lowest SES quartile seniors in highest educational expectations for an eventual bachelor's degree was lower in 2004 compared to 1972 as well, though the high-low SES quartile gap in graduate/professional degree expectations was higher in 2004 than in 1972 (chapter 5). Compared to seniors in 1972, greater percentages of seniors in 2004 expected to work in a professional occupation by age 30, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "A.2 NCES High School Longitudinal Studies Program", "text": "In response to its mandate to \"collect and disseminate statistics and other data related to education in the United States\" and the need for policy-relevant, nationally representative longitudinal samples of elementary and secondary students, NCES instituted the High School Longitudinal Studies program. The aim of this continuing program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various stages in their educational careers and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development. The high school longitudinal studies program consists of three completed studies: NLS:72, HS&B, and NELS:88. In addition, base-year, first and second follow-up data for ELS:2002, the fourth longitudinal study in the series, are now available. (A fifth study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 [HSLS:09], has just been initiated). Taken together, these studies describe the educational experiences of students from four decades-the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s-and also provide bases for further understanding of the correlates of educational success in the United States. Figure A-1 includes a temporal presentation of these four longitudinal education studies, including completed waves of the ELS:2002, and highlights their component and comparison points.

The statistical comparisons in this report were based largely on the t statistic. Whether the difference between two groups is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values (cv). The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups), and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. "}, {"section_title": "Appendix A. Technical Notes and Glossary", "text": "A-13 In all four studies, the composite is based on five equally weighted, standardized components summed together; however, these components differ somewhat. In NLS:72 and HS&B the household items are directly used; in NELS:88, they are used only as a proxy for missing income data; in ELS:2002, they are not used at all. In NLS:72 and HS&B only father's occupation was utilized for the composite measure; mother's occupation was available from the dataset but was not used in calculating SES (even when father's occupation was missing as in mother-only families-in these and similar cases, the remaining non-missing items form the basis of the SES composite). In NELS:88 and ELS:2002, both mother's and father's occupation are elements of SES. In NLS:72 and HS&B, student data were used to construct this composite. In NELS:88 and ELS:2002, parent data were normally used to construct the SES composite. In both NELS:88 and ELS:2002, student data were substituted where parent education or occupation data were missing. However, when both parent and student occupation or education reports were missing, ELS:2002 values were statistically imputed using a weighted sequential hot deck procedure. In NELS:88 and ELS:2002, family income was asked only of parents, and not of students, but was asked of students in NLS:72 and HS&B. While in NELS:88 a student-provided household item index (see below for more information about the household item scale), which served as an income proxy, was substituted when income data were missing, a different procedure was followed in ELS:2002. When parent data on income were missing (parent respondents were asked to place their family's income in an income range), income was statistically imputed (again, with the weighted sequential hot deck methodology). The impact of imputation on the intercohort comparability of the SES composite was investigated by comparing two versions of the 2002 SES composite, one based on the ELS:2002 specifications, the other on NELS:88 specifications. The basic finding was of no impact or extremely small impact on estimates. Details are given in , appendix C. Some SES differences across the studies are grounded in differences in design. The studies had different starting points. NLS:72 began with seniors. HS&B base-year respondents were sophomores or seniors. NELS:88 base-year respondents were eighth-graders. ELS:2002 base-year respondents were sophomores. A parent interview was sought for all NELS:88 and ELS:2002 base-year student respondents. HS&B had a parent survey, but it only encompassed a modest subsample of student respondents. Because the quality of reporting on parental occupation and education may increase with student age or grade, it may be of concern whether reports were gathered at grade 8, 10, or 12. However, since parent reports are markedly superior to student reports in these matters, it may be of concern that only in NELS:88 and ELS:2002 are the occupation and education data primarily parent-reported. Likewise, students are more problematic reporters of family income, but the income question was asked of students in HS&B and of parents alone in NELS:88 and ELS:2002. More specific information about each of the SES components is provided below. SES: Household items scale. Differences in household item questions reflect changing social circumstances over time. The household items list has been revised for each survey. By 2002, HS&B items such as ownership of a typewriter had ceased to function as good proxies for family income, while other items, such as access to the Internet or having a digital video disc (DVD) player, did. 5 Although items differ across the index over time, in each case the items are those that are needed to provide a measure that has a reasonable correlation with income. The NLS:72 household items were as follows: regularly delivered newspaper, dictionary, encyclopedia, magazines, record player, tape recorder, color TV, typewriter, electric dishwasher, two cars. The HS&B household items were as follows: regularly delivered newspaper, more than 50 books, encyclopedia, place to study, room of own, calculator, typewriter, electric dishwasher, two cars. In NELS:88, information was collected about the following household items: regularly delivered newspaper, dictionary, encyclopedia, magazines, place to study, room of own, calculator, typewriter, electric dishwasher, more than 50 books, atlas, clothes dryer, washing machine, microwave oven, computer, and VCR. Though not used in constructing SES, the following household item questions appeared in ELS:2002: regularly delivered newspaper, magazines, room of own, internet access, electric dishwasher, fax machine, clothes dryer, computer, DVD player."}, {"section_title": "SES: Occupation.", "text": "The following occupation categories were used for eliciting parental occupation from parent, and student respondents and used in building the SES composite for the 1972, 1980, 1982, 1992, and 2004 senior cohorts.

Occupational expectations. Seniors were asked what occupation they expected to have in the future. For HS&B, NELS:88 and ELS:2002, this question was asked for occupation at age 30, while with NLS:72 there was no qualifier to fix a specific point in future time. In the student questionnaire, NLS:72 seniors were asked to \"circle the one number that goes with the best description of the kind of work you would like to do.\" The same occupation scheme (based on 1970 Census Bureau codes) that was employed for father's and mother's current occupation (and used in the SES composite-see the occupation categories and examples in section A.6.2) was employed for asking about future occupational expectations. As noted earlier, the NLS:72 scheme combined three professional categories that were later (1980 and thereafter) broken out separately (school teacher, professional A, and professional B). In HS&B, the question read \"What kind of work will you be doing when you are 30 years old?\" In NELS:88 the question read \"Which of the categories below comes closest to describing the job or occupation that you expect or plan to have\u2026when you are 30 years old?\" In both HS&B and NELS:88, the 1970 Census occupation categories were again used in the occupational expectation question, with the tripartite breakout of professional occupations. In ELS:2002, the question read \"Write in the name of the job or occupation that you expect or plan to have at age 30.\" ELS:2002 used the same 1970 Census occupation categories as HS&B and NELS:88 to code the ELS:2002 verbatim responses (in the earlier studies, respondents self-coded their expectations with the provided occupation categories list). In addition, a \"don't know\" option was offered in ELS:2002. Plans to attend college/vocational school next year. For each of the four studies, students were asked to indicate their plans immediately following high school. For NLS:72 and HS&B, single variables were used (VAR0385 and BB071, respectively), with the codes indicating plans for nonacademic pursuits immediately after high school ( For NELS:88, these same categories were constructed using two separate variables (F2S49, indicating that the respondent planned to continue in school immediately following high school [code 1], and F2S61, indicating the specific type of college or vocational program they the respondent intended to attend). For ELS:2002, the respondent was coded as planning to attend postsecondary school after high school if, first, they responded 1 (yes) to F1S45 (whether they planned on attending postsecondary school immediately after high school), with, second, the same postsecondary education categories as in other studies coded from F1S49. Plans to work next year. Plans to work next year were coded on the basis of one to three separate variables, depending on the study. In NLS:72, students were asked if they planned to work full-time right after high school; respondents are routed to a section \"For those planning to work full-time during the year after they leave high school\u2026\" and asked: \"When do you plan to go to work full-time?\" A-21 In HS&B, students were asked to indicate their \"main activity\" immediately following high school (BB071); response options are detailed under \"Plans to attend college/vocational school next year,\" above. In NELS:88, three variables were used: F2S51, indicating whether the respondent planned to work next year (1=yes, 2=no; 9=skip, indicating the student had answered F2S48A); F2S48A, indicating whether the student planned (code 2) or had already joined (code 3) the armed forces; and F2S49, indicating whether the student planned to attend school immediately following high school (1=yes). In ELS:2002, two variables were used: F1S53, indicating the respondent's work plans immediately after high school (1=full-time, 2=part-time, 3=no plans to work); and F1S46H, indicating whether respondent would or had joined the military (0=no; 1=yes). Respondents were classified into one of two categories based on the following logic (those planning on military service were classified as \"full-time work\"): 1. Those who planned to work full time, with the following codes (each indicating, in various ways, in combination or separately, plans for full-time work): NLS:72 -VAR0385 codes 1, 2, or 3; HS&B -BB071 codes 1, 2, or 3; NELS:88 -F2S51 code 1 or F2S51 code 9 in combination with F2S48A code 2 or 3; ELS:2002 -F1S53 code 1 in combination with F1S46H code 1; and 2. Those who did not plan to work full time the next year, who were classified as having other plans, with the following remaining codes: NLS:72 -NVAR0385 codes 4 through 10; HS&B -BB071 codes 4 through 10; NELS:88 -F2S51 code 2 or F2S51 code 9 in combination with F2S49 code 1; ELS:2002 -F1S53 code 2 or 3 in combination with F1S46H code 0. Transcript variables: coursetaking in academic subjects. High school transcripts from HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 were the source of coursetaking information for high school seniors. As no transcript study was conducted with the HS&B 1980 senior cohort but was conducted in 1982 for the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort, the latter sample is used in this report. The 1982 follow-up transcript study of HS&B 1980 sophomores did not identify seniors directly. Variable FY1 (when the respondent expects to graduate) was used to identify the sample of seniors, removing dropouts, early graduates, and those that planned to graduate during the next academic year. In addition, the HS&B files used for the analyses in this report are the archived first follow-up files, which may have produced different estimates than the fourth follow-up Electronic Codebook files of HS&B 1980 sophomores. The Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) codes were used to define the courses in Chapter 2. This classification changed slightly over the years, so some caution may be used in interpreting changes. The CSSC classification for ELS:2002, for example, separated out many Advanced Placement courses, but earlier CSSC definitions used with HS&B and NELS:88 often did not. All courses used in this report come from high school transcripts and only present themselves as course titles; information about the quality or content of these courses is not available. All courses in Chapter 2 were defined with reference to senior-year coursetaking; this contrasts with other definitions of advanced or low-level courses used in NCES reports based on a \"pipeline\" of coursetaking (e.g., Dalton et al. 2007). The pipeline measures were designed to capture coursetaking levels over the course of the entire high school career, and as such do not fit senior-year patterns adequately; for example, the highest level of course in a particular subject may be taken by students in their junior year, not their senior year. The lists of specific mathematics and science courses provided in tables 3 and 5, respectively, follow the sequence of coursetaking as previously identified and discussed in the construction of the pipeline measures of coursetaking (see Burkam and Lee 2003). For the classification of mathematics courses in table 4, four categories were constructed: (1) Not enrolled; (2) Basic mathematics courses (basic mathematics, general mathematics, applied mathematics [e.g. consumer mathematics, actuarial mathematics, and nurse's mathematics], pre-algebra, algebra I, and geometry); (3) Intermediate mathematics courses (algebra II, algebra III, trigonometry, advanced geometry, statistics, probability, and other intermediate courses such as linear algebra); and (4) Advanced mathematics courses (precalculus and calculus, including Advanced Placement [AP] or International Baccalaureate [IB] precalculus or calculus). For science in table 6, the categories were: (1) No enrollment; (2) Basic science courses (general science, regular and advanced earth science, general physical science, basic/introductory biology, basic/introductory chemistry, basic/introductory physics, astronomy, and meteorology); (3) Intermediate science courses (general biology, chemistry I, physics I); and (4) Advanced science courses (chemistry II, physics II, and advanced biology; these include all AP and IB science courses). Foreign language courses in table 7 were coded as (1) no enrollment; (2) First or second-year course enrollment; and (3) Third-year and above course enrollment. Foreign language coursetaking was in any language. For all students in these three tables, only the highest level full-credit course counted for inclusion in a category."}, {"section_title": "A.7 Comparability of Data Across Cohorts", "text": "A major question for cross-cohort comparisons such as are reported in this report is the comparability of the data sets to be used. Although the four studies have been designed to produce comparable results, there are also differences between them that may affect the comparability and precision of estimates."}, {"section_title": "A.7.1 Eligibility", "text": "Similar definitions were used in deciding issues of school eligibility across the studies. Differences in student sampling eligibility, however, are more problematic. Although the target population is highly similar 8 across the studies (all seniors who can validly be assessed or at minimum meaningfully respond to the questionnaire), exclusion rules and their implementation have varied somewhat, and exclusion rates are known to differ where they are known at all. Not all students are able to meaningfully respond to research instruments such as the assessments and questionnaires administered in the four studies. Some English language learners are too limited in their English proficiency to do so, whereas others may be precluded from participation by a severe physical or mental disability. HS&B excluded as ineligible students"}, {"section_title": "A-23", "text": "with such barriers to participation, although an overall exclusion rate has not been documented. Nor are ineligibility rates available for NLS:72, with the result that computation of intercohort bias is not possible. In NELS:88, 5.3 percent of the base-year eighth-grade sample was excluded for such reasons (this figure is similar to the exclusion rate for eighth grade in the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP] in similar subjects in the same period). However, a sample of the NELS:88 ineligible students was followed over time, and students whose status changed were incorporated into the first and second follow-ups, from which the NELS:88 sophomore and senior cohorts are drawn. In ELS:2002, no students were classified as ineligible as such, although some were exempted from completing the questionnaire (and others also a test); still others were tested under circumstances in which they were provided with special accommodations. The overall rate of instrument-exempted sophomores in ELS:2002 is quite low, below 1 percent in the ELS:2002 base year. Base-year students incapable of completing a questionnaire were reevaluated in the first follow-up. Although not all were seniors, and the eligibility status of many remained unchanged, others became capable of questionnaire completion, particularly students who had been excluded for language reasons. (Note that the questionnaire-incapable students are considered to be part of the study but do not appear on the ELS:2002 public-use file.) In ELS:2002 (but not the earlier studies), transcripts were collected for all sample members, including both test-and questionnaire-incapable. The fact that a larger proportion of the student population was included in ELS:2002 (99 percent of the potential cohort in ELS:2002 as contrasted to 95 percent in NELS:88 base year) may affect cross-cohort estimates of change. This is the case because though the numbers are small (about 2.5 percent of the NELS:88 senior cohort), the excluded students in NELS:88 tended to be quite different from the included students. 9"}, {"section_title": "A.7.2 Sample Design Differences", "text": "Differences in sampling rates, sample sizes, and design effects across the studies also affect precision of estimation and comparability of findings across studies. Asian students, for example, were oversampled in NELS:88 and ELS:2002, but not in NLS:72 or HS&B, where their numbers were quite small. Also, although Catholic schools were oversampled in three of the four studies, HS&B had few (only 38) private non-Catholic schools, and NLS:72 had few nonpublic schools. While sampling weights adjust for the effects of oversampling on estimation, rare populations that had no oversampling will tend to have higher standard errors. The baseyear (1980) participating sample in HS&B numbered 30,030 sophomores. In contrast, 15,362 sophomores participated in the base year of ELS:2002. Cluster sizes within schools were much larger for HS&B (on average, 30 sophomores per school) than for ELS:2002 (just over 20 sophomores per school; larger cluster sizes are better for school effects research but carry a penalty in greater sample inefficiency). Mean design effect (a measure of sample efficiency) 10 9 For example (Ingels 1996), though just 5 percent of the population, inclusion of the ineligible students changes the cohort dropout rate between 1988 and 1990 from 6 percent to 7 percent. Only 62 percent of the base-year ineligibles were still in high school 4 years later, compared to 83 percent of the total sample. Of this 62 percent, 58 percent were in modal-grade sequence, and 42 percent were not (80 percent of the overall in-school sample was in modalgrade sequence (i.e., seniors 4 years later). 10 Effective sample size can be quite different from the nominal sample size; effective sample size is more meaningful than raw sample size in terms of statistical analysis-for example, the sampling variance of a mean standard score is equal to the reciprocal of the effective sample size, not the reciprocal of the raw sample size. Effective sample size may be defined as the raw sample size divided by the design effect."}, {"section_title": "A-27", "text": "ELS:2002 senior cohort includes both sophomores surveyed in the previous study wave as well as additional seniors in 2004.
