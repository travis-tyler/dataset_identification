Even though atherosclerosis is usually a chronic, progressive process, abrupt rupture of an atherosclerotic -so-called vulnerable -plaque can become acutely life threatening by releasing embolic material that leads to myocardial infarction or stroke. So far, no biomarker or imaging technique is able to assess and predict the individual risk of plaque rupture and a subsequent acute cardiovascular event beforehand. Whether and how a plaque ruptures is determined by its macroscopic structure and its microscopic composition [4] . Arterial wall inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerotic plaque rupture [2] . Obviously, specific detection of markers of arterial inflammation within a vulnerable plaque through imaging represents a highly attractive approach to identifying patients at risk of rupture of such an atherosclerotic plaque [5] .\nAmyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition is considered one of the initial events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, A\u03b2 1-42 peptides are involved in the inflammatory pathology of this neurodegenerative disorder [6, 7] . However, there is cumulative evidence that atherosclerotic disease as well as AD share some key pathophysiological elements and pathways that promote disease [6, 8, 9] . Irrespective of whether A\u03b2 peptides are deposited in vessels of the central nervous system or atherosclerotic plaques in the periphery, they are likely to promote and perhaps synergize chronic inflammatory processes, which culminate in the degeneration, malfunction and vulnerability of arterial walls or plaques, respectively [6] . Activated platelets and/or vascular wall cells have been found to be the most likely source of the A\u03b2 pool in aortic atherosclerosis lesions [6] . A\u03b2 activates a cascade of proinflammatory events in endothelial cells and macrophages involving cytokine secretion and oxidative stress that leads to vascular disease [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, it has recently been shown in blood samples from 1,464 haemodynamically stable patients that A\u03b2 levels are significantly and independently associated with progression of arterial stiffness as well as with the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Furthermore, A\u03b2 blood levels can be used to substantially improve risk stratification for cardiovascular death in patients with stable CAD. [8] .\nFlorbetaben is an 18 F-labelled stilbene derivative that was developed as a PET tracer for routine clinical use to visualize A\u03b2 plaques in the brain of AD patients [13] . A recently published multicentre phase 3 study revealed that 18 F-florbetaben PET has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of histopathologically confirmed neuritic A\u03b2 plaques [14] .\nUsing a fully integrated hybrid PET/MRI system, we evaluated whether specific 18 F-florbetaben uptake in the carotid arteries can be identified and, subsequently, whether the carotid artery PET signal correlates with risk factors for clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "This was a cross-sectional study of patients with suspected AD admitted to the Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Leipzig, Germany, for further diagnostic evaluation with clinically indicated 18 F-florbetaben PET/MRI.

An experienced reader (J.B.) analysed all scans. The methodology for analysis and reproducibility of the vascular PET measurements has previously been reported [16] . Briefly, arterial 18 F-florbetaben uptake was quantified by manually drawing an individual region of interest (ROI) around the left and right common carotid arteries on every slice of the T1-weighted MPRAGE scan. The ROIs were then used to acquire functional data from natively coregistered PET datasets. Next, the mean and maximum arterial standardized uptake values (SUV mean and SUV max ; mean and highest pixel activity within the ROI) from PET were determined. Averaging the mean and maximum SUV values of all arterial slices of both carotid arteries led to mean SUV mean and mean SUV max values. The mean and maximal carotid artery target-to-background ratios (TBR mean and TBR max ) were calculated by normalizing the carotid artery SUV mean and SUV max to the mean SUV mean of the blood pool measured in both jugular veins (JV). Thus, the carotid artery TBR is a reflection of the specific carotid artery wall 18 F-florbetaben uptake. For measuring the JV SUVs, ROIs of 3-4 mm diameter were placed on consecutive slices bilaterally, and the results were averaged.

All explanatory variables in the backward elimination model found to be significantly associated with the 18 F-florbetaben uptake value were retained and entered into the regression model as a block in a single step.

On average, 7 \u00b1 4 slices of the left common carotid artery and 6 \u00b1 4 slices of the right common carotid artery were analysed to derive the 18 F-florbetaben uptake. In seven patients, the anatomy of only one common carotid artery (six left, one right) could be appropriately assessed. However, in all of these patients, analysis of the respective carotid artery provided sufficient data for inclusion in the analysis. 18 F-florbetaben uptake in the carotid arteries as well as in the JV could be easily identified by visual inspection of the PET/MRI overlay images in all patients (Fig. 2) .

The ENTER regression showed that male gender was an independent positive predictor of 18 Fflorbetaben uptake (\u03b2 = 0.407, p = 0.009; Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "F-Florbetaben and CVD risk factors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "BClassical^imaging modalities such as invasive angiography, CT angiography and MRI do not provide sufficient information on specific characteristics (e.g. vulnerability) of arterial plaques. Identifying individual patients with vulnerable arterial plaques carrying a high risk of rupture is therefore a central challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Over the past decade there has been an increasing interest in noninvasive functional imaging of vascular inflammation and different parts of the underlying complex pathological processes of atherosclerosis by means of PET [22] . To our knowledge, amyloid tracers have not so far been utilized in this context. We identified PET imaging with the A\u03b2 tracer 18 F-florbetaben as a suitable approach to specifically identifying patients with increased carotid 18 F-florbetaben uptake. The significantly higher arterial 18 F-florbetaben uptake compared with the venous blood pool activity of the tracer clearly indicates specific arterial tracer uptake, which consequently led to mean TBR mean and mean TBR max ratios of >1. A nonspecific arterial tracer uptake would be expected to show a ratio of \u22641 [23] . Therefore, it is likely that 18 F-florbetaben PET is able to specifically image A\u03b2 peptides in the arterial wall and/or the atherosclerotic After confirming normality of the data distribution, univariate analysis was performed using the t test for independent samples F-florbetaben is able to image peripheral A\u03b2 deposition in addition to the originally considered detection of intracerebral deposits in the clinic. In an approach comparable to ours, a similar PET tracer to 18 F-florbetaben which is also used for noninvasive imaging of cerebral A\u03b2 in AD, namely 11 C-labelled Pittsburgh B compound ( 11 C-PiB), was recently successfully used for noncerebral A\u03b2 imaging in cardiac amyloidosis [24] .\nIt is now considered that atherosclerosis and AD cerebrovascular amyloidosis share pathophysiological pathways, despite their different end-stage manifestations [6] . Lee et al. found that serum A\u03b2 levels are elevated in stroke patients and that both the infarct size and the initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score are significantly positively correlated with serum A\u03b2 levels [25] . More recently, the clinical relevance of A\u03b2 with regard to CVD was further shown in a study by Stamatelopoulos et al. who found that A\u03b2 blood levels in humans are independently associated with the progression of arterial stiffness, incident subclinical atherosclerosis, and incident coronary heart disease [9] . From a pathophysiological point of view, Kokjohn et al. found that atherosclerotic lesions contain a heterogeneous mixture of A\u03b2 peptides [6] . These A\u03b2 peptides most likely originate in the cells of the vascular walls that express A\u03b2 precursor proteins/ protease nexin-2/A\u03b2 and in platelets that take part in the atherosclerotic inflammatory and disturbed coagulation cascades [6, 21, 26] . Both processes are inherent to arterial wall degeneration as part of the atherosclerotic disease process. The presence of A\u03b2 peptides in atherosclerotic plaques may synergistically increase the chronic inflammatory processes that sustain this degeneration and the destruction of the arterial walls. This is because they mediate the process of increased and persistent synthesis of proinflammatory molecules by activated macrophages and activated platelets. As a consequence, focal vascular inflammatory response in the vulnerable region of atheroma plaques may contribute to plaque instability and rupture [27] .\nAlthough it appears that the general contributions of A\u03b2 to the inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis and AD are essentially the same [6, 13, 14] , we did not observe higher carotid 18 F-florbetaben uptake in patients with a positive cerebral A\u03b2 scan than in those with a negative cerebral A\u03b2 scan. Our results indicate that, despite the most likely shared pathophysiological basis of atherosclerosis and AD with regard to A\u03b2 mediated inflammation, one cannot assume a completely common character of this inflammatory reaction in the brain and the non-cerebral arteries. This is in accordance with the results of the previously published Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), which showed that individuals with coronary or aortic atherosclerosis per se are not at increased risk of AD [28] . In contrast, intracranial atherosclerosis was confirmed as a strong risk factor for dementia [29] . However, our findings need to be confirmed in well-powered prospective trials.\nSupporting the clinical relevance of our results, we found that male gender, one of the well-known CVD risk factors, was independently associated with 1 8 Fflorbetaben uptake in the carotid arteries after adjustment for other CVD risk factors. This is interesting as previous studies with 18 F-FDG PET have also indicated a significant association between arterial 18 F-FDG uptake, as a marker of arterial wall and/or plaque inflammation, and male gender [29] [30] [31] [32] . Moreover, as revealed by our immunohistochemistry study, A\u03b2 immunoreactivity was mostly present in atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. The fact that besides male gender none of the other evaluated CVD risk factors was found to be significantly related to carotid 18 F-florbetaben uptake might be related to the rather small population in this study, the missing values for some of the collected cardiovascular risk factors and the fact that our patient population was not a dedicated cardiovascular risk population. Thus, wellpowered, prospective studies need to be performed next to provide more conclusive results with regard to the association between arterial 18 F-florbetaben uptake and clinical CVD risk factors.\nDue to the study design involving the inclusion of patients with suspicion of AD, we were not able to confirm our imaging results by histology in these patients. Therefore, future studies need to histologically confirm the correlation between vascular 18 F-florbetaben uptake and the presence of arterial A\u03b2 deposition, in for example imaging of carotid artery stenosis. However, immunohistochemistry in a separate cohort representing different stages of atherosclerosis supported preferential uptake in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, while arteries with intimal thickening were mostly negative. Furthermore, in the absence of a dedicated vascular MR sequence in the retrospective setting of the study, we were not able to correlate the PET signal to a particular carotid plaque which might have been seen on the MRI scan. Another limitation was the rather small study population that potentially impaired the correlation between carotid 18 F-florbetaben uptake and clinical CVD risk factors or distinct cardiovascular biomarkers as well as the correlation with the cerebral A\u03b2 deposition. These issues will have to be addressed in future trials with dedicated CVD profiling."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "PET can visualize specific 18 F-florbetaben uptake in human carotid arteries for which male gender was identified as an independent clinical risk factor.
