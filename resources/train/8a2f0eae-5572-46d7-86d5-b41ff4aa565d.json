[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Hearing loss is a common and disabling sensory disorder, yet prospective data on potentially modifiable risk factors are limited. Previous studies suggest that alcohol consumption may influence the development of hearing loss, yet results have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the relation between alcohol use and hearing loss in men.\nWe examined prospectively the independent association between alcohol intake and self-reported professionally diagnosed hearing loss in 26,809 men aged 40 to 74 yrs at baseline in 1986. Study participants completed detailed questionnaires at baseline and every 2 yrs thereafter. Incident cases of hearing loss were defined as those professionally diagnosed after 1986. Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.\nResults: During 386,081 person-years of follow-up, 3447 incident cases of hearing loss were reported. Overall, there was no association between level of alcohol intake and risk of hearing loss. Compared with those who did not consume alcohol, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.00 (0.89 to 1.12) for those who consumed 5.0 to 9.9 g/day, 1.08 (0.96 to 1.21) for 10.0 to 14.9 g/day, and 0.98 (0.85 to 1.13) for 30.0 to 49.9 g/day. The results did not differ by age group or folate intake. Among those with lower intake of vitamin B12, however, higher consumption of alcohol, specifically liquor, was associated with an increased risk of hearing loss.\nOur data suggest that low or moderate alcohol consumption does not influence the risk of hearing loss in older men. A possible relation between vitamin B12 intake, alcohol consumption, and hearing loss merits further investigation."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Hearing loss is a common and disabling sensory disorder that afflicts more than 36 million people in the United States (Pleis & Lethbridge-Cejku 2007) . In adults aged 48 yrs and older, the 5-yr incidence of developing hearing loss is 21% . Hearing loss can compromise communication (Gordon-Salant 2005) and safety (Girard et al. 2009 ) and can lead to social isolation, depression, and poorer quality of life (Uhlmann et al. 1989; Gates et al. 1996; Dalton et al. 2003; Gates & Mills 2005) .\nAlcohol consumption may influence the development of hearing loss; however, results from previous studies have been inconsistent (Brant et al. 1996; Popelka et al. 2000; Itoh et al. 2001; Helzner et al. 2005; Fransen et al. 2008) . It has been proposed that the cardioprotective effects of moderate alcohol intake, such as those mediated by higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and antithrombotic activity (Mukamal & Rimm 2008) , extend to a decreased risk of hearing loss, potentially by protecting against disturbances in cochlear blood flow (Seidman et al. 1999) . Although chronic alcohol abuse has been reported to increase the risk of hearing loss (Rosenhall et al. 1993) , the relation between consumption of low or moderate levels of alcohol and hearing loss remains unclear. A protective association of low to moderate levels of alcohol intake was observed in some studies (Popelka et al. 2000; Itoh et al. 2001; Fransen et al. 2008) , but not in others (Brant et al. 1996) , or observed only in certain subgroups (Helzner et al. 2005 ). Many of the previous studies were cross-sectional in design and have only evaluated alcohol consumption during the preceding year.\nTo further clarify this relation, we conducted a prospective study in 26,809 male participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) to examine the association between updated alcohol use and the development of professionally diagnosed hearing loss. In addition, as higher levels of folate intake have been demonstrated to protect against hearing loss in a randomized controlled trial (Durga et al. 2007 ) and the modification of the impact of alcohol consumption by level of folate intake has been demonstrated to occur in other disease processes (Zhang et al. 1999; Rohan et al. 2000; Sellers et al. 2001; Baglietto et al. 2005) , we evaluated whether the relation between alcohol intake and hearing loss is modified by the level of folate intake. As a previous study in this cohort suggested an association between vitamin B12 and hearing loss that was modified by the level of alcohol consumption , we evaluated whether the association between alcohol intake and hearing loss was modified by the level of vitamin B12 intake."}, {"section_title": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The HPFS originally enrolled 51,529 male dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, pharmacists, podiatrists, and veterinarians who were 40 to 75 yrs of age at baseline in 1986. Study participants filled out detailed questionnaires about diet, medical history, and medication use. Questionnaires have been administered every other year, and the 20-yr follow-up exceeds 90%. The 2004 long-form questionnaire included a question regarding whether the participant had been professionally diagnosed with hearing loss, and if so, the date of diagnosis. Of the 31,496 men who returned the long-form questionnaire, 8291 (26.3%) reported a diagnosis of hearing loss. We excluded men who reported hearing loss diagnosed before 1986 (N \u03ed 2950) or cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (because of possible exposure to ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents) from the analysis. In addition, because age is such a strong risk factor and the prevalence of hearing loss is so high among the elderly (Agrawal et al. 2008) , we also excluded men as they reached age 75 yrs during follow-up. The number of men included in the analysis was 26,809. "}, {"section_title": "Ascertainment of Alcohol Intake", "text": "At baseline, men reported their alcohol consumption on a 131-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that included separate items for beer, white wine, red wine, and liquor. Participants were asked how often, on average over the past year, they consumed each beverage. We calculated total alcohol intake by multiplying the average consumption of each beverage by the alcohol content of the specified portion size (12.8 g for beer, 11.0 g for wine, and 14.0 g for liquor) and summing across beverages. Subsequently, the FFQ was administered every 4 yrs, with an item for light beer added in 1994.\nThe validity of alcohol consumption estimated from the FFQ has been demonstrated (Giovannucci et al. 1991) . The Spearman correlation coefficient between alcohol intake estimated from the FFQ and corresponding intake from diet records was 0.86 (Feskanich et al. 1993) . Alcohol use assessed in this manner has been shown to be associated with a number of important outcomes in this cohort, such as myocardial infarction (Mukamal et al. 2006) , colon cancer (Giovannucci et al. 1995) , and gout (Choi et al. 2004 )."}, {"section_title": "Ascertainment of Outcome", "text": "Information on the primary outcome, self-reported professionally diagnosed hearing loss, was obtained on the 2004 long-form questionnaire along with the year of first diagnosis.\nWe defined incident cases as those diagnosed after 1986. Although standard pure-tone audiometry is generally considered the gold standard for hearing loss evaluation, several survey instruments have been developed to evaluate large populations because of the cost and logistic limitations of audiometric screening. Studies that have compared the reliability of self-report with the gold standard of audiometry (Gates et al. 1990; Nondahl et al. 1998; Sindhusake et al. 2001; Valete-Rosalino & Rozenfeld 2005) demonstrated that self-reported hearing loss is a reasonably reliable measure of hearing loss. For example, based on NHANES data using the definition of hearing loss to be a pure-tone average (at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) \u054625 dB in both ears, the sensitivity was 65% and the specificity was 83% for self-report compared with audiometry (Agrawal et al. 2008) . Notably, in contrast to previous studies that used a general question such as \"Do you feel you have a hearing loss,\" our questionnaires queried participants specifically about professionally diagnosed hearing loss."}, {"section_title": "Ascertainment of Covariates", "text": "We selected covariates purported to be risk factors for hearing loss. Covariates considered in the multivariate analyses included age (Agrawal et al. 2008) , race (Agrawal et al. 2008) , body mass index (Seidman 2000) , folate intake (Durga et al. 2007 ), vitamin B12 (Houston et al. 1999; Holt 2007) , vitamin C intake (Takumida & Anniko 2005) , \u2424-carotene (Seidman 2000) , physical activity (Li et al. 2006) , smoking (Itoh et al. 2001) , hypertension, diabetes (Bainbridge et al. 2008 ), cardiovascular disease (Gates et al. 1993) , elevated cholesterol (Gates et al. 1993 ), use of furosemide (Rybak et al. 1991) , and regular use of aspirin, acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) .\nAge and race were obtained from biennial questionnaires. Height and weight were obtained from the baseline questionnaire with self-reported weight updated every 2 yrs. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Information on smoking status and physical activity was updated every 2 yrs. Intake of folate and B12 was calculated from semiquantitative FFQs and updated every 4 yrs. Information on other covariates was available from the biennial questionnaires.\nQuestionnaire-derived information on daily intake of nutrients and for many of the covariates has been validated by comparison with directly measured values or detailed diaries, with correlations of 0.71 for folate (Rimm et al. 1992) , 0.50 for vitamin B12 (Rimm et al. 1992) , 0.97 for weight (Rimm et al. 1990 ), and 0.79 for physical activity (Chasan-Taber et al. 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "All analyses were prospective using information on alcohol consumption that was collected before the diagnosis of hearing loss. Alcohol use was categorized according to level of average daily ethanol intake in grams: none, 0.1 to 4.9, 5.0 to 9.9, 10.0 to 14.9, 15.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 49.9, and 50.0 g or more (Choi et al. 2004 ). We also categorized frequency of intake of individual alcoholic beverages (beer, red wine, white wine, and liquor) into five frequency categories (servings/time): \u03fd1/mo, 1/mo to 1/wk, 2 to 4/wk, 5/wk to 1/day, and \u03fe1/day (Choi et al. 2004 ). For each participant, person-time was allocated based on the response to the alcohol consumption questions at the beginning of each follow-up period. Alcohol intake as well as dietary and other exposure information was updated every 4 yrs. Participants were censored at the date of diagnosis of hearing loss, report of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, age 75 yrs, the date of death, or the end of follow-up, whichever came first. Age-and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Multivariable models were adjusted for potential confounders listed above.\nBecause advancing age is a strong risk factor for hearing loss, the relative contribution of additional risk factors may be more pronounced in younger individuals. For example, the relation between diabetes mellitus and hearing loss is modified by age (Bainbridge et al. 2008) , as is the relation between regular analgesic use and hearing loss in men that was demonstrated in this cohort previously . To examine whether the relation between intake of alcohol and hearing loss varied by age, we performed analyses stratified by age less than 50 yrs, 50 to 59 yrs, and 60 yrs and older. In addition, to examine whether the relation between intake of alcohol and hearing loss varied by folate intake (Sellers et al. 2001; Baglietto et al. 2005) , we performed analyses stratified by the median of folate intake. To examine whether the relation between intake of alcohol and hearing loss varied by vitamin B12 intake, we performed analyses stratified by the median of vitamin B12 intake.\nFor all HRs, we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All p values are two tailed. Statistical tests were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Characteristics of participants according to the level of alcohol use at baseline are shown in Table 1 . Those who consumed \u054630 g/day of alcohol were more likely to report hypertension, gout, current smoking, regular use of aspirin, and regular use of NSAIDs, compared with those who consumed no or lower amounts of alcohol.\nDuring 386,081 person-years of follow-up, 3447 cases of incident hearing loss were reported. Overall, there was no association between level of alcohol intake and the risk for developing hearing loss (Table 2 ). In multivariable models, compared with those who did not consume alcohol, the HRs for risk of hearing loss were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.12) for those who consumed 5.0 to 9.9 g/day; 1.08 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.21) for 10.0 to 14.9 g/day; 1.09 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.22) for 15.0 to 29.9 g/day; 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.13) for 30.0 to 49.9 g/day; and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.30) for 50.0 g/day or more. Additional analyses that evaluated the intake of specific alcoholic beverages (beer, red wine, white wine, or liquor) did not reveal any consistent significant associations between the intakes of specific beverages and the risk of hearing loss (Table 3) .\nThe lack of association between the level of alcohol intake and the risk of hearing loss did not vary by age (p for interaction \u03ed 0.58) or folate intake (p for interaction \u03ed 0.22).\nHowever, the relation between alcohol intake and hearing loss varied by vitamin B12 intake. Among those with vitamin B12 intake below the median (9.0 g/day at baseline), the risk of hearing loss increased with higher levels of alcohol intake (p for interaction \u03ed 0.005) (Table 4 ). Specifically, among those with vitamin B12 intake below the median, the HRs for risk of hearing loss were 1.19 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.41) for those who consumed 15 to 29.9 g of alcohol per day and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.54) for those who consumed 30 to 49.9 g of alcohol per day, compared with those who did not consume alcohol. There were only 46 cases in the category of men who consumed \u054650 g or more of alcohol per day; thus, the results in this group are difficult to interpret because of the small number of cases. Further analyses of each specific type of alcoholic beverage (beer, red wine, white wine, or liquor) showed that among those with vitamin B12 intake below the median, the risk of hearing loss increased only with higher levels of liquor intake (p for interaction \u03ed 0.003) ( Table 5 ). The HRs for risk of hearing loss was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.47) for those who consumed five to seven servings per week of liquor and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.70) for those who consumed more than one serving per day, compared with those who consumed liquor less than once per month."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this prospective study of 26,809 male health professionals, we found no overall association between alcohol intake and the risk of hearing loss. However, among those with lower levels of vitamin B12 intake, consumption of higher levels of alcohol, specifically liquor (spirits), was associated with an increased risk of hearing loss.\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that alcohol may influence the preservation of hearing function. Disturbances in cochlear blood flow, particularly hypoperfusion and possible ischemia, have been associated with adult hearing loss (Seidman et al. 1999) . Moderate alcohol consumption may aid in the maintenance of optimal cochlear blood flow, possibly mediated by increased HDL cholesterol or reduced coagulation. In prospective cohort studies, moderate intake of alcohol has been associated with a lower risk for myocardial infarction compared with abstention (Maclure 1993) , an association thought to be due to higher levels of HDL cholesterol in moderate drinkers (Linn et al. 1993 ) that have been demonstrated in short-term randomized trials of alcohol administration (Rimm et al. 1999) . Similarly, Gates et al. (1993) observed an inverse relation between HDL levels and hearing thresholds, suggesting a protective effect of HDL on hearing.\nAlthough chronic alcohol abuse has been associated with hearing impairment (Rosenhall et al. 1993) , results from studies of the relation between low or moderate levels of alcohol intake and hearing loss have been inconsistent. Several cross-sectional studies have suggested that consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol may have a protective effect (Popelka et al. 2000; Helzner et al. 2005; Fransen et al. 2008) . For example, a cross-sectional study based on audiometric evaluations in participants of the epidemiology of hearing loss study (N \u03ed 3571) found an inverse association (odds ratio \u03ed 0.71) between moderate alcohol use (\u03fe140 g/wk) during the previous year and hearing loss (defined by pure-tone average as measured by audiometry: PTA [0.5, 1, 2, 4] \u03fe25 dB HL)]. This association was even stronger (odds ratio \u03ed 0.49) when hearing loss was defined according to more stringent criteria (i.e., PTA [0.5, 1, 2, 4] \u03fe40 dB HL) (Popelka et al. 2000) . A case-control study in Japan reported a U-shaped relation between alcohol consumption and hearing loss, with a 45% decreased risk of hearing loss for occasional drinkers (not defined), a 27% decreased risk for light drinkers (\u03fd30 g/day of alcohol), but no association for heavy drinkers (\u054630 g/day of alcohol) (Itoh et al. 2001) . In contrast, our findings are consistent with those from a prospective study of 531 men based on data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which found no association between moderate alcohol use and hearing loss assessed by audiometry (Brant et al. 1996) .\nOur findings suggest that the relation between alcohol, specifically liquor, and hearing loss may vary by level of vitamin B12 intake. A previous study in this cohort examined the relation between vitamin B12 intake and risk of hearing loss . We found a lower risk of hearing loss among men with higher intake of vitamin B12 only among those with the highest alcohol consumption, suggesting an interaction between alcohol and vitamin B12 intake. This study examined the association between alcohol consumption and risk of hearing loss and further examined whether the relation varied by vitamin B12 intake. The observation of higher risk among those with both higher alcohol intake and lower intake of vitamin B12 supports the likelihood of an interaction. Because of its impact on cellular metabolism, vascular function, and myelin synthesis, vitamin B12 deficiency has previously been implicated as an important factor in cochlear pathology (Hall 1990; Gates et al. 1993; Shemesh et al. 1993; Brant et al. 1996) . In a small cross-sectional study, women with hearing loss had lower serum levels of vitamin B12 (Houston et al. 1999) . Possibly, as higher levels of alcohol consumption may lead to a depletion of hepatic vitamin B12 stores (Halsted et al. 2002) , greater vitamin B12 intake would be required to preserve cochlear functioning in those who consume higher levels of alcohol. Whether liquor in particular alters vitamin B12 metabolism differently than beer or wine has not been examined.\nThe lack of association between alcohol intake and the risk of hearing loss did not vary by folate intake. A previous investigation by Durga et al. demonstrated that folic acid supplementation slowed low-frequency hearing decline in older adults (Durga et al. 2007 ). However, this was limited to individuals with low levels of blood folate in a country without folate supplementation of the food supply. Thus, it is possible that the relation between alcohol intake and hearing loss may be modified by a level of folate intake lower than in our study population.\nOur study differs from previous work in several ways. A particular strength is the long-term prospective updated measurement of alcohol consumption over the course of up to 18 yrs, with updated measurements every 4 yrs. In addition, we examined the relation between more finely defined categories of alcohol consumption than used previously. Furthermore, participants in this study were younger than many of those examined in other studies. We also evaluated the intake of specific alcoholic beverages (beer, red wine, white wine, or liquor). Although we observed an increased risk of hearing loss among those who consumed white wine 2 to 4 times per week, this result is likely spurious as there was no dose response.\nThis study has limitations. Although the participants in this cohort may not be representative of the adult US population, follow-up rates are high, and information provided is reliable. Assessment of hearing loss was based on self-report of professionally diagnosed hearing loss. Standard pure-tone audiometry is considered the gold standard for evaluation of hearing index, physical activity, folate, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, profession, race, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease, gout, furosemide use, aspirin use, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use, acetaminophen use, and use of other individual beverages (beer, red wine, white wine). loss; however, self-reported hearing loss has been demonstrated to be a reliable assessment (Sindhusake et al. 2001) . Moreover, participants were specifically asked whether they had been \"professionally diagnosed\" with hearing loss, a more objective measure than the commonly used single question, \"Do you feel you have a hearing loss?\" Nonetheless, given the high prevalence of hearing loss in men of this age group (Agrawal et al. 2008) , there was likely misclassification of outcome. Furthermore, few participants in our cohort reported very high levels of alcohol consumption; thus, our ability to examine the potentially detrimental effects of heavy alcohol use was limited. Assessment of alcohol consumption was based on self-report; however, the measures of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption used in this study were previously validated (Giovannucci et al. 1991) , and any misclassification in our instruments is unlikely to affect the rank order of alcohol consumption. Finally, it has been suggested that the protective role of alcohol may be to diminish or delay the progression of hearing loss once it has occurred, a process this study cannot examine.\nWe did not have information on lifetime noise exposure in the whole cohort, a common cause of hearing loss. Although noise exposure may increase the vulnerability to hearing loss related to age (Erway et al. 1996; Gates et al. 2000; Kujawa & Liberman 2006) or other causes (Brown et al. 1981) , it is not known whether the impact of noise is modified by alcohol. Previous studies of alcohol use and hearing loss have not addressed leisure time and occupational noise exposure in detail.\nThese findings do not support an overall relation between low or moderate alcohol consumption and risk of hearing loss in older men. Additional studies are needed to examine the relation between alcohol intake and hearing loss in women, younger men, and other racial groups. The potential role of vitamin B12 in alcohol-related ototoxicity merits further investigation."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by NIH grant P01 CA055075, MEEI Foundation, and the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Development Funds.\nThe sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
