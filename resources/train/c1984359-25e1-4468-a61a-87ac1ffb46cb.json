[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Ageing is associated with increasing health care costs of which two related neurological disorders, dementia and stroke, account for much of the increase. Dementia is a progressive development of multiple cognitive deficits with several underlying aetiologies, the two commonest types being Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The total estimated worldwide cost of dementia was US$818 billion in 2015, representing 1.09% of global GDP. 1 In 2015, 46.8 million people worldwide were living with dementia, a figure which is expected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million by 2050. Meanwhile, stroke remains the second commonest cause of death and commonest cause of dependency in adults worldwide. 2 Age-related cognitive decline ranges from minor reductions in memory and executive function that do not interfere with daily life, to more severe degrees that fall short of dementia but may interfere with some activities of daily living, termed 'mild cognitive impairment'. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may progress to dementia or remain static, and cognitive decline is also a risk factor for stroke.\nAll three of MCI, dementia and stroke are associated with changes seen on brain imaging particularly brain volume loss (atrophy) and development of focal lesions in the white and grey matter such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, microbleeds, focal cortical or subcortical infarcts or small haemorrhages.\nThese features are also associated with ageing (though are less frequent in healthy ageing), may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and predict increased risk of stroke, dementia and death. 3 In the last decade, improvements in medical imaging, higher image quality, the exponential increase in computational power of affordable computing platforms, and the greater availability of brain imaging datasets such as from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), have increased opportunities to develop machine learning approaches aimed at the automated detection, classification and quantification of diseases. 4 Some of these techniques have been applied to classify brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, comparing patients with dementia and healthy controls and to distinguish different types or stages of dementia, cerebrovascular disease and accelerated features of aging. However, the recent rapid increase in publications using different machine learning techniques in different populations, types of images and disease criteria, make it difficult to obtain an objective view of the current accuracy of machine learning."}, {"section_title": "Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria", "text": "Two reviewers (EP, VGC) separately assessed all non-duplicate papers in a two-stage selection process.\nFirst, we evaluated titles and abstracts to exclude studies clearly not relevant to the scope of the review.\nSecond, we assessed full texts of the remaining papers to eliminate studies using the following exclusion criteria:\n1. Studies of animals or ex-vivo samples 2. Reviews, surveys, collections and comparison papers not presenting a new ML method or application.\n3. Studies with a validation set comprising a small number of subjects (<100 for disease classification or lesion identification tasks, and <25 for pixel or voxel level lesion segmentation tasks) or with a manual ground truth provided by only one trained observer.\n4. Studies presenting a method in which the main task (e.g., lesion segmentation) was not performed in a fully automated fashion. Studies involving semi-automated pre-processing steps (e.g., brain parcellation refinement) obtained by making use of previously validated software and trained observers were accepted.\n5. Studies not about structural MRI or CT imaging.\n6. Studies focused on image pre-processing techniques that did not include any machine learning for disease classification or lesion segmentation/identification (e.g., contrast enhancement, noise reduction techniques, etc.).\n7. Studies of parcellation of healthy brain regions not used for disease classification or detection.\n8. Studies that either did not provide, or presented their results in such a way that we were not able to calculate performance metrics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity).\n9. Multiple publications from the same research group, focusing on the same task and dataset. In such cases, only the most recent publication or with the largest sample size was included in the data analysis.\n10. Studies that did not describe their methods in sufficient detail to enable replication.\nDiscrepancies were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers with a third (MvH, LB, GM) arbitrating as necessary."}, {"section_title": "Data Extraction", "text": "From the included papers, we extracted data on the:\n(1) disease or lesion investigated, (2) dataset used and whether it was publicly available or not,\nnumber of subjects or images on which the proposed technique had been validated, (4) type of structural imaging modality and sequences used, (5) imaging features that were investigated, (6) use of any additional imaging data (e.g., functional imaging) or non-imaging features (e.g., cognitive test scores) in the analysis, (7) classifier(s) and the feature selection and representation techniques used, and (8) performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of the proposed method.\nWe extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity where not already calculated.\nIf multiple tasks were investigated in a single study, the respective data for each experiment were recorded.\nWe also extracted (when reported) details of: use of single vs multiple scanners, image resolution, population demographics, exclusion criteria for each dataset, image pre-processing steps, time cost, and use of third party software (details available on request).\nWe evaluated study quality according to the relevant Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22007046). We used the seven criteria that were most relevant to the material of the review, four addressing risk of bias and three addressing applicability. since some criteria were not strictly applicable to the field.\nAll acronyms used in the results table are reported in Supplemental Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "We extracted the different performance metrics directly from the papers, or calculated them from the data provided. In particular, we aimed to examine:\n1. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for binary classification tasks.\n2. Mean class accuracy for multi-class classification tasks.\n3. Dice coefficient (DC) for accuracy of lesion segmentation tasks.\n4. Precision and recall for lesion identification tasks (calculated using the formula in Supplementary methods).\nWhere the results of multiple experiments for the same classification task were reported in a single study, we only used the set of metrics associated with the higher value of accuracy in our analysis.\nWe constructed forest plots to summarise sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of various clinically relevant diagnoses including AD versus healthy ageing, MCI versus AD or healthy ageing, MCI conversion to AD versus not conversion. In order to summarise the mass of information effectively, we plotted forest plots of accuracy rather than sensitivity and specificity, defined as:\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to determine if source dataset, machine learning method, type of data used, or study size accounted for the variance between studies. We calculated 95% CI of accuracy using the Wilson score method. We plotted all graphs in R. We considered but rejected performing a formal metaanalysis, since the huge overlap in datasets in publications precluded determining the results of patients who contributed to more than one study (even with exclusion of obvious duplicate publications), preventing the modelling of between-study variance. Finally, to minimise confounding by inclusion of studies that only contributed to one comparison, we compared accuracy across multiple diagnostic boundaries using studies that provided data on more than one diagnostic comparison from the same dataset."}, {"section_title": "Role of the Funding Source", "text": "The funders had no role in the conduct of this systematic review. The corresponding author confirms that she had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Our search yielded 5775 non-duplicate studies, of which 4978 (86%) were excluded at title/abstract screening as clearly not relevant to the review. After full text screening, we found 111 papers relevant for data extraction (Figure 1 ). The two criteria accounting for the most exclusions were small sample (item 3) and no performance metrics provided or calculable (item 8; respectively 41% and 19% of exclusions at this stage; proportions meeting exclusion criteria see Supplementary Table 2 ). Note that studies that failed one exclusion criterion were excluded and not evaluated further; although some might have failed on multiple criteria, we only recorded the first reason for exclusion.\nMost of the 111 studies that met inclusion criteria achieved low risk of bias scores and low concerns on applicability (Supplement Figure 1) . Of the 111, we used 89 studies in further analyses of accuracy where data could be extracted as 2x2 tables and there were sufficient studies to compare."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Flowchart of search and exclusion stages of the review.\nMost studies tested the diagnosis of AD (68/89, 76%), most versus healthy controls (67/89, 75%), then MCI non-converters to AD versus converters to AD (37/89, 42%), MCI versus healthy controls (29/89, 33%), and MCI versus AD (8/89, 9%; Table 1 shows individual comparisons; full details in Supplementary Table S3) .\nThere were 21 studies that compared multiple diagnostic classes, of which many involved the same author groups.\nThe remaining studies focused on other factors: other types of dementia (five studies, Supplementary Table   S4) , and studies investigating different types of brain lesions related to dementia, stroke and pathological aging, either: lesion segmentation (seven studies, Supplementary Table 1 Number of comparisons in each systematic review analysis group using specified data source, machine learning method, types of imaging and non-imaging data and by study size. Individual studies contribute to more than one analysis and use more than one data source, machine learning method, combinations of imaging data and more than one dataset (hence more than one sample size in some studies). HC=healthy control; AD=Alzheimer's disease; MCI=mild cognitive impairment; nc=non converter to AD; c=converter to AD.\nThe 76 analyses focused on AD (Supplementary Table S3 ) amounted to 68 unique references, with huge overlap in authors and data sources between the studies. As well as using more than one data source, many studies performed more than one comparison of disease classifications with these multiple data sources, hence amounting to 144 different comparisons ( Amongst the 76 studies focused on AD, the accuracy was higher for differentiating AD from healthy controls (most study accuracies were in the 0.8-1.0 range), than for differentiating MCI from healthy controls (accuracies =0.6-0.9), or non-converting from converting MCI to AD (accuracies= 0.5-0.85), or MCI from AD (accuracies =0.6-0.9). "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We found acceptable accuracy for all machine learning methods in differentiating healthy controls from AD, but fewer data and lower accuracies for differentiating healthy controls from MCI, or MCI from AD, or (of more concern) for risk prediction of MCI non-converters from converters to AD. From a clinical perspective, the comparison of healthy controls to AD is the least important distinction: such Type I diagnostic studies do not aim to produce clinically relevant estimates of sensitivity and specificity, but to test the initial feasibility of a method. While the results for machine learning methods in differentiating healthy controls from AD are encouraging, the performance across the other cognitive diagnosis categories indicates that the field has some way to go before these methods should enter routine clinical use. 4 The over-reliance on one data source, one type of imaging, and one machine learning method, further limits the clinical relevance and generalisability of the results. This may reflect that, as yet, machine learning is still insufficiently intertwined with the clinical world, in part due to misalignment of targets and methods: while the machine learning community aims primarily for algorithm novelty, inspired largely by computer vision and machine learning, clinicians want reliable, validated, methods for early diagnosis, risk prediction, or monitoring interventions, that are better than conventional methods, and change clinical practice.\nWe aimed to include as many relevant papers as possible, so kept the search broad. We retained conference papers to reflect the tendency to publish conference papers that equate to full publications in the fast-moving medical image analysis, computer vision and machine learning fields. High-quality conference papers are at least as selective as many journals; e.g., MICCAI, a leading medical image analysis conference, applies a 3-stage selection protocol including rebuttal. About a quarter (29/111, 26%) of the included papers were conference papers. The number of un-refereed pre-prints becoming available online (e.g., arXiv, biorXiv) is also increasing rapidly, but we did not include these pre-print publications since they are not peer-reviewed. However, the use of these sites for dissemination is growing and may need considering in future reviews. The proportion of papers using deep learning has increased since late 2016 (including several published by the authors, many conference papers in MIUA 2018, and MICCAI 2017) , and therefore this review may under-represent the most recent developments in machine learning.\nHowever, many of these recent papers focused on methods to detect single brain lesion types, such as WMH or atrophy, that are associated with cognitive decline but not on degrees of cognitive decline itself, or on differentiating AD from healthy controls rather than more subtle diagnoses. Therefore it is unlikely that the conclusions of the present analysis, which is based on a substantial body of work, would change by the inclusion of these most recent papers.\nSome non-systematic reviews and surveys on machine learning have been published. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] We used established systematic review methods including QUADAS-2 criteria to grade study quality, since there are no agreed guidelines for reviews in data science and machine learning, but found the QUADAS criteria difficult to apply. We aimed to make reasonable exclusion criteria (publications from 2006 onward, data set larger than 100 for patient/image level classification, data set larger than 25 for pixel/voxel level segmentation), based on experience and consultation with a team of experts. We do not believe that the main conclusions would change significantly by including more small studies, and believe that the main messages embedded in the current literature are captured well by the review.\nWe excluded more than 200 papers (Supplementary Table S2 ) because the sample size or ground truth annotations were too small. This suggests the need for more public data repositories with annotated, reliable data. Various international initiatives provide public annotated data sets for competitions, e.g. the challenges organized by MICCAI or ISBI. Such challenges emphasize the competition aspect (achieving the best values for specific performance parameters), more than maximizing the amount of data made available, the generalisability of the results, or relevance to clinical practice. The latter two should receive more attention if the field is to advance.\nWe excluded many papers that did not provide accuracy data. This suggests a need to standardise reporting of performance criteria, an issue in the validation of algorithms and software for data and image analysis. 12-14 Some aspects of the perceived importance of standard criteria and data sets is highlighted by the clear majority of papers using the ADNI data set (www.adni-info.org). Although use of one dataset may promote cross-comparisons of results, it is likely to inflate estimates of accuracy and considerably reduces the generalisability of the results to clinical practice. Deep learning techniques are rapidly becoming the methods of choice in medical image analysis, and feature in increasing proportions in conferences and journals, e.g. many conference papers at MIUA 2017. However, the overall message remains the same, i.e. differentiation of AD from healthy controls, but fewer studies and poorer accuracy at differentiating MCI vs.\nhealthy control or AD, or MCI converters/non-converters to AD, with the same problems of sample size and repeated use of the same data and lack of clinical integration. This further increases the need for large datasets as convolutional neural networks have millions of parameters to train. The performance of systems classifying brain images as associated with AD or not seems to improve when taking into consideration multiple data types. 15, 16 Including non-imaging features, like CSF biomarkers and cognitive test scores, unsurprisingly also improve performance. Further work is needed to clarify the interplay between data from images and from other sources."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "Most studies started with pre-processed features ('ground truth') as input to the machine learning method.\nMany pre-processing techniques use population templates that derive from young populations; these are of limited relevance to the older brain and may bias the resulting machine learning outputs. 17 Very few papers on lesion segmentation techniques were included as most failed the inclusion criteria on annotations (ground truth). This reflects that generating sufficient ground truth for a reliable validation of such algorithms is very time consuming, and highlights a limitation of machine learning methods in relying on ground truth.\nUse of crowd-sourcing to annotate images may be one solution but would have to achieve high reliability to meet the definition of 'ground truth'; 18-20 their use remains sub judice and depends on the application. We also notice recent work on the automatic generation of annotations (auto-annotations) for non-medical classifiers with large numbers of classes, 21 and the growing interest of medical image analysts in techniques to minimise the number of annotations required without affecting performance."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "It proved particularly difficult to locate papers attempting stratification of different types of dementia, and few studies combined imaging with other data types. Possible reasons include that diagnosing dementia is not a clear-cut process, so that several covariates should be considered in addition to a binary label (dementia/no dementia), e.g. time of diagnosis, source data for diagnosis (MCI test, brain images, clinical records, prescriptions) . Different dementia components might be present at the same time. Finally, to our best knowledge, no public data sets exist which offer reliably stratified, sufficiently large cohorts with brain imaging.\nPractically all the included papers were written for a computer science or engineering audience. They focused on technical information (e.g. algorithm choice and description, parameter setting techniques, training protocol) omitting essential clinically-relevant information (e.g. patient and cohort demographics, clinical covariates, data acquisition protocols). Clearly, specialized journals and conferences require specialist language, but international efforts are needed to make technical papers more understandable to a clinical audience, and vice versa, to improve interdisciplinarity."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The results of our review indicate that machine learning methods to predict risk of dementia are not yet ready for routine use. There is a need to push inter-disciplinary collaborations, including the development of internationally agreed (by clinicians and computer science/engineers) validation protocols and clinical trials.\nThe further development of any machine learning methods in neuroimaging requires much greater interdisciplinary working, use of varied and clinically-relevant public data sets with annotations, or ground truth, including a variety of imaging types not just T1, to maximise the use of relevant predictive variables and ensure that the resulting machine learning methods are robust and reliable prior to further testing in clinical trials in patients."}, {"section_title": "DECLARATION OF INTEREST STATEMENT", "text": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Study conception and design: EP, GM, ET, JW.\nAcquisition of data: EP, VGC, MVH, LB, DA, SD, SMM, DJ, CP.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: all coauthors.\nDrafting of manuscript: EP, LB, TM, ET, JW.\nCritical revision: EP, GM, FC, TM, ET, JW.
