The Bering Sea in particular is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, accounting for more than 10% of the world's and 59% of the U.S. seafood harvest (NMFS 2014).

Figure 2a). These studies have attributed the enhanced productivity of the GB to tidal mixing and transverse circulation processes. Together, these two processes contribute to nutrient enhancement in the euphotic zone, and because of their sustained nature, they aid in prolonging the spring bloom and enhancing rates of annual high production in this region. Tidal mixing in the Bering Slope and the coastal area is stronger than in the middle shelf and in the deep basin. However, there is no evidence of transverse circulation (at least in summer). If transverse circulation was present the observed summer \"cold pool\" in the shelf area would not form (Hu and Wang 2010). In this study, we have used a coupled 3-D Physical-Biological Model to simulate the horizontal distributions of surface Chl-a ( Figure 2b). Physical, chemical, and biological factors are inferred from the model simulations (section 3.1) and then invoked to provide an explanation for the observed surface Chl-a distribution (Figure 2a). During summer the Bering Sea is characterized by a prominent subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM) (Stabeno et al. 2012;Lomas et al. 2012). During a cruise survey in 2008 ( Figure 3, section 59.9 \u00b0N, see Figure 1 for location), a prominent SCM was also observed in the Bering Sea (Goes et al. 2014). Chlorophyll a concentrations in the top layer (< 20 m) and the bottom layer (> 50 m) were less than 0.4 \u03bcg/L. However, right beneath the thermocline in the middle shelf, Chl-a concentrations reached levels of 15 \u03bcg/L. To the best of our knowledge, the SCM is seldom reported in 3-D physicalbiological model simulations for the Bering Sea because of its complex environment caused by sea ice. Because the SCM contains a large part of the biomass on the Bering Shelf in summer, mechanisms leading to the formation of SCM are of interest and are discussed in section 3.2. There have been some previous numerical studies of the Bering Sea ecosystem.

Consistent with satellite measurements, the model results showed a general downward trend in summer sea ice extent. In Zhang et al. (2010) it was inferred that in addition to increasing the availability of photosynthetic active radiation, the decline in sea ice tends to increase the nutrient availability in the euphotic zone by enhancing air sea momentum transfer and causing enhanced upwelling and mixing of nutrients in the water column. In an earlier study (Wang et al. 2013), we reported preliminary model results of our 3-D coupled model for the Bering-Chukchi Sea in 2007-2008 In the present study we have used model outputs to describe the mechanisms and factors responsible for the formation and sustenance of the \"Bering Sea Green Belt\", the formation of the SCM and the general distribution of phytoplankton in the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea.\n\nconsisting of wind, air temperature, shortwave radiation, precipitation, humidity, and sea level pressure were used to drive the model. The sea ice velocity, concentration, and thickness were set to zero as initial conditions. The model was run for years 2007-2012 with 6-hourly atmospheric forcing. The initial conditions for nutrients were derived from the World Ocean Database 2009, which archives the digitized annually mean nitrate (NO 3 ), phosphate (PO 4 ), and silicate (SiO 3 ) in a grid format of 2\u00d72 degrees at standard depths. Seasonal surface Chl-a concentrations were used, and there were no usable zooplankton data. These annually averaged data were interpolated into the model grids in both horizontal and vertical directions. Along the lateral open boundaries, the same annual mean data were used to prescribe the boundary forcing to the model with no interannual variability. Satellite measurements of Chl-a concentration (Figure 2a) from the Sea-viewing \nOverall, if we compare increased quantity in Figure 5f with the observed and simulated horizontal distributions in Figure 2, it is clear that the distributions are not determined by any single bio-geochemical/physical factor, but by the integrated effects.\nphytoplankton start growing to form blooms. The south to north differences in the timing of the onset of the bloom on the Bering Sea shelf is a reflection of the influence of sea-ice on phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth. Figure 7d shows the interannual variations of phytoplankton blooms on the Bering Sea shelf. The blooms of 2008 appeared in May, those of 2009 in April, and the blooms of 2010 in May. It is clear that in all three years, these interannual differences in the timing of the blooms were tightly connected to sea ice melting. Observations verified that spring bloom timing is related to ice retreat timing, if ice was presented on the Bering Shelf after mid-March (Sigler et al. 2014). Temperature plays an important role in the Chukchi Sea phytoplankton bloom (Figure 7a). The nutrient factor remains at a locally high level from November until the following July; the light factor picks up in May; and sea ice cover retreats in June. However, the bloom does not appear to be connected with sea ice melt, as observed on the Bering shelf. Rather, the bloom starts in early August because light in the Chukchi Sea is as low as 4 W/m 2 , which is lower than the 6 W/m 2 in the Bering Shelf, and it has to wait for the temperature to pick up to promote rapid growth. In summary, although the growth requirements (i.e. nutrients, light, and temperature) for phytoplankton of the entire Bering Sea shelf and the Chukchi Sea are not dissimilar, the manner in which they interact with each other in different regions has a large influence on the onset and timing of the blooms. Nutrients are never the triggering factor for the spring-summer bloom, but light and temperature are, and it would appear to make sense to ascribe sea ice melt as the most important driver of the variances in the timing of the blooms. In the case of the fall bloom, its timing is far less related to temperature and light conditions. Nutrients appear to play a far greater role at this time of the year. The surface water temperature drops because of surface cooling, making the water column vertically unstable, which helps bring bottom nutrient-rich water to the top layer, and in turn supports a fall bloom. The fall bloom only occurs in the Bering Shelf. In the case of the deep basin, the rate at which these nutrients arrive in the upper layer is very slow and is therefore unfavorable to bloom formation. On the other hand, in the Chukchi Sea, nutrients rise fast, but the light drops even faster, and at the same time, sea ice forms to a rigid lid and prevents light penetration.\nfast from April to May (the melting season) and are eventually released into water when sea ice melts in May and June. Due to excess consumption by ice algae, the surface nutrients tended to stay lower (the lowest is 30%) when compared to the no-ice-algae case. With the release of ice algae, the phytoplankton biomass in the surface water increased faster, by almost 35%, as compared to the no sea ice algae case. Also worthy of mention is that after the bloom peak, the surface phytoplankton decreased faster than the no-ice-algae case because of the reduced availability of nutrients in the water column. An examination of the integrated phytoplankton biomass on the Bering Shelf from June 1 to July 15 (Figure 9c), revealed an average 14.3% difference between the two cases; within the Chukchi Shelf, the average difference from July 15 to September 15 rose to 36.9%. This suggests that sea ice algae was largely responsible for the increase in total phytoplankton biomass in the water column during the ice melting season. Ignoring the contribution of sea ice algae, it lowered the total annual phytoplankton biomass by 3% in the Bering Shelf, and at least a 12% in the Chukchi Sea."}, {"section_title": "The Model", "text": "The physical model is described in detail in Wang et al. (2009Wang et al. ( , 2013, Hu and Wang (2010), and Hu et al. 2011. Complete details of the biological model are available in Hu et al. (2004) and Wang et al. (2013). Different from our previous studies, sea ice algae are included in this model. It is generally accepted that the community composition of sea ice algae present in the Bering and Chukchi Seas are not the same species as those found in the water columns, the former being characterized by many pennate-type diatoms instead of the centric forms often reported from the water column (McRoy and Goering 1974;Goes et al. 2014). In this study, the sea ice algae were simulated as a thin layer at the bottom of the ice. Sea ice algae are not specified to species. Furthermore, the equations and parameters used for sea ice algae are the same as used for algae in the water, except that the vertical movement and horizontal diffusivity are neglected due to the fact that sea ice algae move only with sea ice. Additionally, zooplankton predation is omitted due to little or no zooplankton grazing (McRoy and Goering 1974 Most phytoplankton cells are denser than water. The density of seawater varies from about 1.021 to 1.028 g/cm 3 , but the density of cytoplasm within phytoplankton can range from 1.03 to 1.10 g/cm 3 . Phytoplankton sinking has been discussed via Chl-a measurement (Cooper et al. 2012). Evidence for phytoplankton sinking in this region is available from the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) project observations where a large amount of Chl-a can be seen at depth ( Figure 4). Zooplankton may swim down to avoid light or predation in the daytime and swim up at night to feed. In this study, however, we ignore the swimming and assume that they sink with phytoplankton at the same speed. Unlike in our previous study (Wang et al. 2013), we have included the downward movement (sinking) of phytoplankton and zooplankton; the equations for phytoplankton are as follow, This article is protected by copyright.

Here the mechanisms of the GB formation were numerically examined: how the nutrients, light, and temperature control phytoplankton growth. From May to Sept. (Figure 5a), the surface nutrients min , , were consumed to a low level in the southern Bering Sea, whereas in the northern Bering Sea, nutrients remain relatively high owing to the gradual melting of ice cover. Also, worthy of note is the relatively high nutrients around the coast, the Aleutian Islands, and the Bering Slope areas. It is worth mentioning that vertical mixing plays a significant role in the distribution of nutrients. Though the vertical mixing is relatively weak due to stratification in summer time (May-Sep), while in the coastal areas and Bering Slope, it is relatively strong because of the coastal current plus tidal mixing and the strong slope current, respectively. The light factor 1 1 2 unsurprisingly gradually abates from the south to the north (Figure 5b). In addition in the western Chukchi Sea is lower than the east because of sea ice cover. The minimum of light and nutrients min , is shown in Figure 5c. The light factor reduces the south-north difference caused by nutrients, and the integrated factor enhances the Bering Slope and Aleutian Islands areas, where both nutrients and light are relatively high. The temperature factor is shown in Figure 5d, which indicates the expected gradual reduction with latitude to north. In the case of the coastal area, especially in the Bering inner shelf, the temperature is relatively high due to the shallow water, and also high in the Bering Slope area, where the Slope Current carries warm water to the north along the slope. The total integrated growth factor \u22c5 is shown in Figure 5e. It appears that the coastal area, Aleutian Islands, and the Slope area are characterized with higher values compared to the adjacent areas. The increased quantity per hour is described with \u0394P \u22c5 \u22c5 P (Figure 5f). Surprisingly, the quantity in the northern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea is low when compared to its growing factor in Figure 5e. This is because the phytoplankton quantity (P) remains relatively low year-round in these areas."}, {"section_title": "The Subsurface Chlorophyll Maxima", "text": "During the 2008 cruise, a subsurface phytoplankton bloom was observed right beneath the thermocline from 30 m to 50 m in the middle Bering shelf (Figure 3a), but mechanisms leading to the formation of the SCM beneath the thermocline and the factors regulating its formation and maintenance have not been examined in previous coupled physical-biological modeling studies. Similar to the previous section, the controlling factors (nutrients, light, and temperature) unveil the mechanism behind the observations. A location was selected in the middle shelf (175 \u00b0W, 60 \u00b0N), where water depth was 105 m, and the summer thermocline was within 20-40 m. Nutrients play a notable role in phytoplankton growth (Figure 6a). In winter (from Dec to Mar), nutrients are rich and are not a limiting factor. In the bottom layer, nutrients remain rich year round. In comparison, the summer nutrients in the top layer (0-30 m) were at a very low level, which is very unfavorable to phytoplankton growth. Light attenuates from top to bottom in the water column ( Figure 6b). In winter, weak light penetrates to a very shallow layer or reduces to none when thick sea ice is present. In summer, strong light reaches the deep layer. In other seasons, appropriate intensity light is favorable to phytoplankton growth. When examining the minimum factors of light and nutrients, the top layer (0-30 m) is limited by nutrients, and the bottom layer is limited by light. As a result, f nL maxima appear in subsurface in summer (Figure 6c). The temperature factor is shown in Figure 6d. Temperature has an exponential relation to growth function; this means that growth rates are higher at higher temperatures and vice versa. It is worth mentioning that in the real ocean, however, individual species have their own preferred thermal conditions; some prefer high temperature, and some prefer low temperature. In this study, species are not specified, thus the species-specific preferences are ignored; we only describe a general trend. Temperature factor f T multiplies f nL is shown in Figure 6e. This is the actual growth factor to the phytoplankton.

In the Bering basin (Figure 7c), the phytoplankton bloom starts at the end of February, reaches a peak in March, and maintains a high value of 4 mg/m 3 until April. In February, the temperature is low, however, the nutrients are rich. Once the light intensity is sufficient, phytoplankton starts to bloom and continue into May. Meanwhile, nutrients drop sharply from 10 \u03bcmol/L to 4 \u03bcmol/L due to phytoplankton consumption. On the other hand, sea ice appears to play a key role in phytoplankton blooms over the Bering shelf. On the shelf (Figure 7b), sunlight is adequate in April and May, the temperature remains as low as ~-1.87 \u00b0C, and nutrients are rich throughout the spring. However, phytoplankton are not able to grow due to the low temperature and low light availability in the water caused by sea-ice cover.

Model outputs for an entire year with and without plankton sinking are shown in Figures 8a-b. In the non-sinking case, the vertical distribution of phytoplankton shows high values in spring, persisting at the surface until the start of June, and declining to form an SCM thereafter at around 20-30 m, which disappears by late Aug/early Sept. (Figure 8a). With sinking, the bloom at the surface starts declining by the end of May, to form an SCM around 30-40m by the end of June, persisting until the end of Sept.

Garrison et al., 1987) or not (McRoy and Goering 1974;Goes et al. 2014). Chl a concentration within sea ice can reach 120 mg/m 3 in the Arctic Ocean (Meguro et al. 1966), and ranged from 1.20 to 48.0 mg/m 3 in Amundsen Sea, Antarctica (computed from Arrigo et al. 2014, where 1.80 to 72.2 mg/m 2 in depth-integrated with an averaged sea ice thickness 1.5 m), these are as high or higher an order of magnitude as of blooms in open water. To verify the sea ice algal impact on the bloom, two comparable cases were conducted to examine the model behavior with/without sea ice algae. With sea ice algae (Figure 9a, 9b), the growth equations are similar to the algae in the water except they move with ice and do not have vertical movement. Their growth depends on light, temperature, and nutrients. At the bottom of ice, temperature stays stable at ~ -1.83 o C (depends on salinity). The nutrients are rich enough to support the growth (Figure 9b). The controlling factor is light, which is sensitive to ice thickness. Ice algae start to grow at the beginning of February and, with increasing sunlight, they grow"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The observed Bering Sea Green Belt was thoroughly studied using a coupled 3D physical-biological model. Model results indicate that the distributions are not driven by a single physical or biogeochemical factor, but instead, by a combination of factors. Observations show that the SCM of the Bering Sea shelf exists in the layer directly below the thermocline. Model results suggest that during the summer, vertical mixing is very weak on the middle shelf, and rich bottom nutrients (beneath the thermocline) do not penetrate the thermocline. In addition, strong light can penetrate the thermocline. These factors create conditions suitable for the development of the SCM. The spatial bloom timing depends on various factors. While light availability controls the phytoplankton bloom in the deep Bering basin, sea ice plays a key role in phytoplankton bloom in the Bering Sea shelf through its influence on seawater temperature and light. In the Chukchi Sea, temperature appears to play a far more important role in the formation of phytoplankton blooms. This article is protected by copyright.
