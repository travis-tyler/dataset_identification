The wind friction and pressure gradient generate long waves that can be modelled by the shallow water equations. Since 2004, the JRC has developed experience in tsunami early warning system (Annunziato, 2007) and inundation modelling using HyFlux2 code, which solves the shallow water equations by a finite volume method (Franchello, 2008;Franchello, 2010). Therefore the JRC has introduced the atmospheric forcing in the shallow water equations, solved by HyFlux2 code, to simulate the storm surge phenomena (Probst and Franchello, 2012), see next Section. The GDACS alert levels are based on the maximum storm surge height: \u2022 Green when the storm surge is below 1.5m; \u2022 Orange when the storm surge is between 1.5m and 3m; \u2022 Red when the storm surge is above 3m.

The Holland parametric model (Holland, 1980;Holland et al. 2010) is used to infer this forcing and uses it into the source terms of the shallow water equations. This model develops an idealized representation of the Tropical Cyclone (TC), based on a few key parameters (named hereafter Holland parameters): track, maximum wind speed (V max ) or minimum central pressure (P c ), and the radius of maximum wind (R max ). The method solves simplified equations and therefore is very efficient and widely used in storm surge modelling (see Harper et al., 2001). The Holland's parameters are not globally available; therefore the JRC has developed a Monte Carlo method to obtain the required parameters using the data available in the cyclones bulletins provided by the NOAA or by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) 5 , through the Pacific Disaster Centre (PDC). This method used as input the coordinates of TC centre (Latitude and Longitude), the maximum velocity V max and wind radii at each quadrant 6 . JRC storm surge calculations for ISAAC are presented in Section 4.3.2. Other than JRC storm surge model, several other storm surge models are used to predict the Tropical Cyclone impact (see Harper et al, 2001). In the Atlantic basins, the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model is used by NOAA (see Section 4.3.3). JRC uses a deterministic approach to obtain the storm surge impact, other Centres uses a probabilistic approach. NOAA NHC Storm Surge Product Decision Support Wedge uses three different approaches to utilize available storm surge data for decision support (see NOAA NHC slosh web site).

"}, {"section_title": "Comparisons between JRC calculations and NOAA S torm Surge Probabilities products", "text": "JRC uses a deterministic approach to obtain the storm surge impact while other Centres use a probabilistic approach. In this Section the NOAA NHC probabilistic Storm Surge (P-surge) 9 product is compared with the JRC HyFlux2 deterministic storm surge calculations. The P-surge product is developed by the M eteorological Development Laboratory (M DL) of the National Weather Service (NWS), in cooperation with the NHC. The Tropical Cyclone storm surge probabilities (2-25 feet) graphics show the overall chance that a storm surge greater than a specific height -between 2 and 25 feet -will occur at each individual location on the map during the forecast period indicated. These graphics are based upon an ensemble of Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model runs using the current official tropical cyclones advisories data. SLOSH M odel is a computer code developed by Federal Emergency M anagement Agency (FEMA), United States Army Corps of Engineers and by the National Weather Service to define flood-prone areas for evacuation planning. It is run by the NOAA National Hurricane Centre to estimate storm surge heights and winds resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. SLO SH model solves the depth-integrated shallow water equations using a finite difference solution and a polar or elliptical/hyperbolic grid type (depending on the specific coastal area called basin 10 ). SLOSH uses a simplified, parametric wind and pressure model, which required as input the radius Rmax and the pressure difference between the center of the storm and the ambient pressure (Deltap) over time, derived from NHC's advisory data. M ore information on SLO SH model can be found in Jelesnianski et al. (1992), Glahn et al. (2009), Dube et al. (2010), on the NOAA NHC SLOSH website 11 and FEM A website 12 . Since the errors in the input provided to SLOSH far exceed the error in the model, a probabilistic approach for the inputs seemed appropriate (see Harper et al, 2001). The probabilistic hurricane storm surge (P-surge) model 13 was developed to calculate the probability of storm surge from an ensemble of forecasts. The approach is, instead of using a single run of the model based on the current NHC hurricane forecast, to use an ensemble of hypothetical storms based on both the current NHC hurricane forecast and combinations of error distributions derived from historic NHC advisories, to estimate the probability of storm surge. The comparisons of the JRC deterministic calculations with the NOAA probabilistic P-surge products are shown below. For the three analysed Advisories, the maximum water height forecasted by the JRC model is quite stable in value (from 2.5 m to 3.5 m) and spatial distribution. The NOAA forecasted probabilities -for a maximum water height exceedance of 2.4 m -increase from about 20-30% (2 days before landfall) to 70-90% (few hours before landfall) while the spatial distribution of the forecasted probabilities is stable like for the JRC calculations. The different behaviour between the two methods should be investigated: it seems that the evaluated probabilities are too low or not consistent with the improvements in the accuracy of the recent tropical cyclones forecast tracks. a) Comparison with NOAA Storm Surge Probability of Advisory 25.

On Aug 27 at 09:00 UTC, the NOAA storm surge probabilities of a storm surge higher than 8 feet (2.4m) in the coastal area near New Orleans was in the order of 10-30% (see Figure 21). On Aug 20 at 09:00 UTC (about 1 day before the second landfall), the NOAA storm surge probabilities of a storm surge higher than 8 feet (2.4m) in the coastal E of New Orleans was in the order of 20% to 60% (see Figure 23); in this area JRC storm surge model estimated a max height of the order of 2.5-3.5m (see Figure 22). Few hours before the second landfall (Aug 29 03:00 UTC, Adv. 32) the JRC storm surge model estimated a max height of the order of 2.5-3.5m (see Figure 24). The NOAA storm surge probabilities (as of Adv. 32) of a storm surge higher than 8 feet (2.4m) in the coastal areas near New Orleans was 70-90% in the area SE of New Orleans with a max of 90-100% in a small area near New Orleans (see Figure 25). 16 Source: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/psurge/archive.php?S=Isaac2012adv32&Ty=gt8&Th=8&Z= "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "JRC has developed GDACS, an early warning system created to alert the humanitarian community about potential disasters which are under development. Tropical cyclones are some of the most damaging events, affecting the coastal population with three dangerous effects: strong wind, heavy rain and storm surge. GDACS classification, for TC ISAAC in the USA, was: Green for the wind impact, Orange for rain impact and Red for storm surge impact. On 27 August 2012, 2 days before landfall, JRC storm surge model indicated a possible storm surge in the order of 2.5-3.5m for Aug 29 morning (UTC) in the coastal area E-SE of New Orleans, Louisiana. Observations on the tidal gauges, 1 day before and after the landfall, confirmed the forecast values and allowed to publish the inundation height map with high confidence. This report analyses and discusses the GDACS automatic impact assessments (more detailed for storm surge effect) and compares the JRC HyFlux2 deterministic storm surge forecasts with the probabilistic forecasts provided by NOAA P-surge product. For the three analysed Advisories, the maximum water height forecast by the JRC model is quite stable in value and spatial distribution. The NOAA forecast probabilities increase with time while the spatial distribution of the forecasted probabilities is stable as in the JRC calculations. The different behaviour between the two methods should be investigated: it seems that the evaluated probabilities are too low or not consistent with the improvements in the accuracy of the recent tropical cyclones forecast tracks. Overall, the GDACS models performed well, providing alert levels for all hazard components, that should be validated with more field observations. The method adopted to evaluate the forecast of the storm surge impact -comparison of the calculated sea level with online tidal gauges measurement -should continue and validated case by case.
