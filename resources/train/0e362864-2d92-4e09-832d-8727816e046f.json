Within this context the European Union institutions recognise the need of establishing the framework conditions in order to attract and to retain well-trained and highly-motivated researchers. Creating a real European labour market for researchers is a key element of the ERA strategy. In this context, the lack of adequate statistics on researchers, and more generally on the human resources available for innovation, science and technology in Europe, is impeding the understanding of the nature and scale of the phenomena of brain circulation across countries, regions, sectors and professions and the implementation of appropriate measures for the implementation of the ERA strategy. In fact, an ideal database encompassing complete, harmonized and comparable data on researchers does not exist in Europe yet. Therefore, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is developing an information system on researchers' stocks, mobility and career. It appears that a set of indicators are required to support the design of policies for matching the supply and demand of researchers, their mobility and more generally the development of research careers, at European and Member State levels. The approach followed by IPTS consists in developing specific methods based on estimation and \"modelling\" techniques to construct such new indicators with the available, although scattered data. This paper presents the \"modelling\" approach and develops three examples illustrating the interests and benefits of this approach, but also the difficulties and problems that may exist. The remaining of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the aim and general methodology of the \"modelling\" approach. Section 3 presents the first example which provides results on nowcasting/forecasting techniques applied to the number of researchers in the EU, based on Eurostat-OECD-UNESCO data. Section 4 shows and discusses the results of a study on the international mobility of researchers and engineers in the EU25 (the second example), which is based on results of national Labour Force Surveys of a few countries. Sections 5 develops the last example related to the career and mobility of doctoral candidates and post-doctorates in life sciences in Europe, which combines statistics from Eurostat and from an ad-hoc survey commissioned by IPTS for Europe, and NSF data for the US. Finally, Section 6 presents our first provisional conclusions. 2 The \"modelling\" approach: aim and methods Three main problems have been identified in the statistics on researchers' mobility and career: \u2022 Lack of data at the EU level on many subjects. \u2022 Lack of comparable and harmonized data between EU countries. \u2022 Long delay in obtaining these data when they exist. To deal with these problems, a \"modelling\" approach has been adopted at IPTS that consists in developing specific estimation and modelling techniques to construct new and original indicators on researchers' career and mobility. More precisely, we try to fill the gaps in the EU and national data, to build proxies when robust data are not available, to carry out new adhoc surveys when essential and to estimate and extrapolate the results at the EU level when necessary and feasible. Three main steps can be distinguished. The first step has consisted in identifying existing data sources. It has been based on an inventory and analysis of about 100 data sources in nine European countries. These sources can be classified in five main categories: \u2022 Labour Force Surveys (LFS). \u2022 Registers \u2022 Graduate surveys. \u2022 Other national surveys, studies or research (e.g., on a university, a research centre, a sector, a specific pool of graduates). \u2022 Other national and international data sources and surveys (e.g., R&D surveys, CHEERS survey, Eurostat-OECD CDH survey, US NSF SESTAT system). The second step consists in collecting new data when data on critical aspects of researchers' career and mobility are not available or to address new specific questions not covered by \"official\" statistics on HRST. Pilot ad-hoc surveys have been (and will be) carried out. The primary aim is to test the feasibility of new collection methods. However, the provision of new critical results on specific aspects of careers and mobility, on specific populations (e.g., junior/senior researchers, fields) and on a limited scope (e.g., geographical coverage, snapshot) is not negligible. The \"modelling\" approach itself constitutes the third step. It is based on the following main elements, even if not all these elements are necessarily valid in each case: \u2022 Harmonization of data. \u2022 Synthesis of information. \u2022 Approximation and estimation. \u2022 Extrapolation at the EU-25 level. \u2022 Now-casting and medium-term forecasting. \u2022 Assessment of the quality, reliability and pertinence of results. The indicators combine by definition several factors to build an overview, a simplification in one dimension of a complex multidimensional reality."}, {"section_title": "Example I: Nowcasting the number of researchers", "text": "The aim of this section is to present results on nowcasting/forecasting the number of researchers for the period 2005-2007, i.e. evaluating the current values and the evolutions of the number of researchers in the near future on the basis of available information, as official data are delayed for a few years. The method consists in estimating basic econometric models with GDP and/or a trend as explanatory variables. The variable GDP captures the impact of general economic conditions. GDP was chosen as it is forecasted on the next two years and thus can be used to nowcast the number of researchers. The trend variable is intended to capture the exogenous component in the number of researchers."}, {"section_title": "Data and estimation techniques", "text": "Three models have been estimated: where RES is the number of researchers (HC)T P F 3 FP T , GDP is the gross domestic product at constant prices (index 1995 = 100), t is the year, u is the error term, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4 are the parameters to estimate.
