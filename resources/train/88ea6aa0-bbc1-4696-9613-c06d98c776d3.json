Due to modern society's current interest in people's achievements, several questionnaires have been developed to assess people's attainment-oriented personal traits. The Grit scale, developed by A. Duckworth et.al (2007 Duckworth et.al ( , 2009 ) and her colleagues (Duckworth, et al., 2007; ) is one within a family of similar self-report measures, which focus on people's abilities to keep maintain long-term goals and overcome difficulties. Some of these questionnaires refer to entities not exactly covering exactly the concept of grit: Personal Views Survey III-R (Maddi et al., 2006) ; The tenacity scale by Baum and Locke (2004) ; A motivational persistence scale (Constantin, et al., 2012) ; The Passion Scale (Vallerand et al., 2003) , the KUT (Klein et al., Unidimensional, Target-free) measure of commitment (Klein, et al., 2014) . Other instruments have been developed for specific populations, such as a scale for measuring persistence in children (Lufi & Cohen, 1987) , or the Career Advancement Ambition Scale (DesRochers & Dahir, 2000) . Some scales are out of date, as in the questionnaire measure of persistence disposition (Mukherjee, 1974) , or a scale for measuring persistence (Wang, 1932) . Some of the modern grit-relevant scales, which are part of the multidimensional questionnaires, consist of only a few items (e.g. The Motivation and Engagement Scale by Liem and Martin (2012) ), which can enlarge the error of measurement significantly.\nThe Grit Scale, developed by Duckworth et. al (2007) , has an advantage over scales from this family by having, as the authors claim, face validity for varied populations, a low probability of ceiling effects in high-achieving groups, and a precise focus on the construct of grit (Duckworth, et al., 2007) . The authors assume that grit as a personality trait is composed of two underlying constructs: the ability to overcome difficulties and a stability of interest over time.\nThe latter provides a distinguishing of the long-term interest in goal achievement as a key component of grit from other possible motivations, e.g. fear of censure or avoidance of changes completely.\nAccording to the theory, the Grit Scale consists of two subscales: Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort -each consists of 6 items (in the full version) or 4 items (in the short 8-item version (Duckworth, et al., 2007; Those researchers who used the scale in their own studies reported the alpha 0.77 -0.80 for the full scale, 0.63 -0.80 for Consistency of Interests, and 0.60 -0.79 for Perseverance of Effort (Pozzebonet al., 2013; Maddi, et al., 2012 Eskreis-Winkler, et al., 2014 .\nHowever, it is interesting that despite quite a low percentage of the total variance (\u224820%) shared between the Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort factors reported by Duckworth et al (2007) , authors tend to treat their instrument as single, using the overall score for the scale in all future calculations. Unfortunately, we have not found any other data on the correlation between the factors, but we believe that the low correlation between subscales may suggest that the scale measures two overlapping but distinct constructs, rather than one common trait at least for the studied samples. Anyway, based on the available data a question of the dimensionality requires additional verification.\nIn terms of validity, the Grit score has predicted educational attainment; the number of lifetime career changes; the completion of some training programs (Duckworth, et al., 2007) ; retention in the military, workplace, school and marriage (Eskreis-Winkler, et al., 2014) , students' metacognition (Arslan et al., 2013); teachers' efficiency (Robertson-Kraft, et al., 2014; ; the well-being of residents in general surgery (Salles, et al., 2014) , and job satisfaction in doctors (Reed, et al., 2012) .\nDespite the impressive psychometric and predicting characteristics obtained for the Grit scale we've not found any supporting data from the modern test theory -Item Response Theory IIRT). It's well known that the Classical test theory (\u0421TT) exploits several serious assumptions about test scores and the standard error of measurement. First, under CTT the sum of item scores is treated as a measure of trait, without any justification whether it is appropriate for this purpose or not. Second, assessment of item and scale properties heavily relies on the sample being used.\nIt means that any changes in sample characteristics would lead to changing in psychometric features of both item and the total scale characteristics. Third, the standard error of measurement is treated as equal across all trait levels, while the error (or, in other words, precision of measurement) as well other item and test statistics differ throughout the trait continuum.\nIRT methods and procedures overcome these limitations (Embretson & Reise, 2000) .\nMoreover, from practical point of view, a big advantage of IRT modeling is that it provides a way for constructing personality and cognitive ability instruments and examining their measurement characteristics, including investigation of the quality of response categories in Likert-type scales and dimensionality study (Linacre, 2002; Smith, 2002) . So we resorted to the IRT approach to overcome the restrictions of \u0421TT and strengthen a methodological foundation of the Grit scale.\nAside from developing a Russian version of the Grit scale, which would be valuable in itself, in this study we also aimed to examine the reliability and dimensionality of the scale through an IRT analyses (Study 1). Once the psychometric quality of the Grit scale was confirmed, we estimated all respondents using the IRT scaling. The students' estimates are on an interval scale, using a scale unit called logit. Using the students' IRT estimates, we confirmed the multidimensional structure through a confirmatory factor analysis. A further construct validation (Study 2) included the determination of whether two subscales show reasonable patterns of correlations with external measures."}, {"section_title": "Study I. Developing, IRT and confirmatory factorial analysis of the Russian version of the", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Grit scale", "text": "Developing instrument. The procedure of the Grit scale translation into Russian was in line with the guide of Van de Vijver and Hambleton (1996) and included a primary translation into Russian, a review of this translation by psychologists experienced in the field and a small pilot group of respondents, to reach of a reconciled version of translation, and back translation to English language and comparison of the original and the backtranslated version. At the stage of reviewing the primary Russian version the participants were asked in detail about a questionnaire, clarity of items, the convenience of the response scale, and their impression of the questions.\nAs a result of this process two items were reformulated to be more consistent with cultural features of perception of diligence as a personal trait. Although a diligent person is held in respect and diligence is an encouraged trait which is encouraged in Russian culture, calling yourself a diligent person or hard worker is perceived as bragging. Openly calling somebody a diligent worker is to be understood as antiphrasis, in an ironic or derisive sense. This was why two items with a direct reference to these traits (\"I am a hard worker\" and \"I am diligent\") were received with resistance by the participants. The items were reformulated to reduce their straightforwardness and categoricalness: \"I am a hard worker\" \u2192 \"Without irony I am a hard worker\", \"I am diligent\" \u2192 \"At work I am diligent\".\nWe also found that the item \"Setbacks don't discourage me\" confused some of our respondents because of its double negative wordings in conjunction with the negative answer options (\"Do not agree at all\" and \"Not fully agree\"). To avoid the confusion the item has been reformulated to be in positive wording. We also introduced \"as a rule\" to emphasize regularity of the situation. Eventually the item was worded: \"As a rule, setbacks do discourage me\".\nExcept these three items, in other respects the backtranslation and the original form were found to be remarkably similar (See the items of the original version of the Grit Scale in Appendix A)."}, {"section_title": "IRT modeling of the Grit scale", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A sample of Russian students (n=3383, 49.3% were girls and 50.7% were boys) from the 9 th grades of regular secondary schools took part in a longitudinal national survey of school and university graduates (Kuzmina et al., 2012) , where the Grit scale was implemented. The mean age of the students was 15.13 (SD = 0.47)."}, {"section_title": "Instrument", "text": "The developed Russian version of the Grit scale included 12 items that referred to 2 subscales: 6 items to Consistency of Interests and 6 items to Perseverance of Effort. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 7 (completely agree). Table   1 shows the 12 items of the Grit scale. "}, {"section_title": "IRT model", "text": "The Grit scale employs a 5-point rating scale with 1 point for Strongly Disagree category to 5 points for Strongly Agree category. To construct test and scales we use Rating Scale Model that is a Rasch-type model designed especially for Likert-type scales. The RSM is an extension of the Rasch dichotomous model for polytomous items. According to Linacre (2002) ,\nwhere P nik is the probability that person n on encountering item i would response in category k,\nis the probability that the response would be in category k-1, B n is the ability of person n, D i is the difficulty of item i and F k is the k th step calibration, i.e. a rating scale threshold defined as the location corresponding to the equal probability of observing adjacent categories k-1 and k.\nA detailed description of the model can be found in Wright and Masters (1982) . The reasons for choosing the RSM are both psychometrical and practical. Firstly, the RSM is the Rasch model and so has optimal metric properties, and secondly, from practical point of view, it is useful to empirically determine the quality of response categories in Likert-type scales (Bond & Fox, 2001) .\nWinsteps software that is a Rasch-model computer program was used for parameters estimation, analysis of the quality of response categories and scales construction (Linacre, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Results of IRT analysis", "text": "Dimensionality study. At the first stage of the research we examined the dimensionality of the Grit scale by conducting a principal component analysis (PCA) of the standardized residuals (Linacre, 1998; Ludlow, 1985; Smith, 2002) . Theoretically, if the unidimensionality assumption is hold, then correlations between item-level residuals should be near zero. If there is no second dimension remaining in the residual variation, then the principal component analysis should generate eigenvalues all near one and the percentage of variance across the components should be uniform. The analysis of the eigenvalues of the Grit scale residual correlation matrix for 12 components revealed that there is one component with eigenvalue of 3.3 while eigenvalues for other components ranged from 1.3 to 0.6 (the exception was the eigenvalue for the last component that was 0.012). In addition, the percentage of variance for the first component was 27% while for other components the variance was roughly evenly split across components.\nThus, the scale is two-dimensional and consists of two subscales. Table 2 shows standardized residuals loadings for all items. In accordance with previous research on the Grit scale (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, & Kelly, 2007; , it consists of two subscales; Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort. Our findings confirm the two-factor structure, but the item \"As a rule, setbacks do discourage me\" moved from the Perseverance of Effort to the Consistency of Interests subscale. Subsequently, the Perseverance of Effort subscale consisted of 5 items, while the other 7 items formed the Consistency of Interests subscale. The item \"I become interested in new pursuits every few months\" has a negative, but very small loading. It will be analyzed more carefully through a confirmatory factor analysis and reported in Study 2.\nTherefore, the analysis showed that the Grit scale is multidimensional and consists of two subscales. Further analysis should be conducted on each subscale separately."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Consistency of Interest subscale", "text": "The Consistency of Interest subscale consists of seven items with negative loadings, as shown in Table 2 . First, we conducted the dimensionality study for the subscale using the same approach as for whole Grit scale. The subscale is unidimensional and can be productive for measurement if it has good psychometric properties. We then conducted a series of analyses aimed at investigating the quality of the items and the subscale as a whole.\nWe began the analysis of the scale from a model fit analysis. The Rasch goodness-of-fit analyses rely principally upon standardized residuals -the difference between the observed response and the response expected under the model (Wright &Masters, 1982 In total, six hundred thirty six subjects (17% of the sample) were removed based on the 2.0 criteria for the MNSQ person statistics. When we analyzed the response profiles of these students, we confirmed that large values of fit statistics were caused by one or two unexpected responses, which could be explained by carelessness or by chance. After excluding these people, the mean and standard deviation for the fit statistics became 1.00 and 0.54 (both INFIT and OUTFIT), respectively. Further analysis of the subscale properties was therefore conducted with a sample of 3191 individuals.\nThe next step was to investigate the quality of the response categories. In the RSM context, a set of criteria had been posed for verifying the useful functioning and diagnosing malfunctioning of a rating scale: (a) sufficient frequency and regular distribution of responses (the optimal is a uniform distribution); (b) the average measures by which a category should increase monotonically with the rating scale categories; (c) categories should fit the model well ;\nand (d) the Rasch step calibrations (or threshold estimates) must advance monotonically with the categories (if this is not so, then some of the categories are inefficient). Table 3 provides a summary of the rating scale's category structure and indicates that the five categories' response system is adequate. The same information can also be seen in Figure 1 , which shows the category probability curves for the scale. We can observe that thresholds are ordered and each category has the probability of being selected by the respondents. This implies that, as one moves up the ability continuum, each category in turn becomes the most probable response. Figure 1 . Category probability curves for the rating scale\nIn summary, the evidence suggests effective functioning of the categories of the Consistency of Interest subscale.\nThe next section of analysis was devoted to the properties of the whole scale. The Rasch analysis provides a reliability index and alternative statistics, a separation index, that characterize the ability of the scale to reliably distinguish between individual participants (Wright & Masters, 1982; Stone, 2004) . The person reliability is 0.71, meaning that the proportion of observed student variance considered true is 71%. (This index is close in value and interpretation to the classical reliability: \u03b1 = 0.76 for the subscale).\nThe last IRT analysis was performed to investigate whether the items' functioning varies across male and female respondents, that is, whether a differential item functioning (DIF) exists across gender groups. Therefore all items were analyzed on DIF.\nThe DIF-analysis of the Consistency of Interest subscale items was conducted with two statistics available in Winsteps. These are the Student's t-test and Mantel-Haenzel statistics (Smith. R. M., 2004; Dorans N.J., 1989) . The results indicated that the items do not demonstrate significant DIF in regard to representatives of different gender (see Appendix B for details).\nIn conclusion, the 7-item Consistency of Interest subscale shows good psychometric properties and can be used for a person's measurement."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Perseverance of Effort subscale", "text": "The Perseverance of Effort subscale consists of 5 items with positive loadings in Table 1 .\nAll steps of this subscale analysis were similar to the analysis of the Consistency of Interest subscale. Only a condensed version of the full results is presented here (see Appendix C for details).\nSeven hundred sixty-one subjects (20% of the sample) were removed, based on the same criteria as for the first subscale. Therefore, an analysis of the subscale properties was conducted with a sample of 3066 persons. The subscale is unidimensional, all items fit the model, and all categories function effectively. The person reliability is 0.78, and classical reliability is \u03b1 = 0.84 for the subscale.\nThe 5-item Perseverance of Effort subscale also shows good psychometric properties and can be used to measure this person's characteristic."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Study 1", "text": "This study has showed that the Grit scale consists of two subscales; the Consistency of Interests and the Perseverance of Effort, as predicted based on Duckworth's report (Duckworth, et al., 2007) . The two subscales both have good psychometric quality, meaning that both subscales are uni-dimensional and have high reliability, and that all categories function effectively, since the items do not demonstrate DIF. The subscales can therefore be used to measure a respondents' correspondent traits.\nAn estimation of respondents' measures was conducted separately for each subscale, which resulted in two different estimates for each person; the measure of consistency of interest and the measure of perseverance of efforts. We revealed that the correlation between respondents' measures on two subscales was 0.24. This implies that a low value of correlation does not allow us to construct a common measure of one trait with this scale. The two subscale provide rather measures of different traits than one. The first distinction from Duckworth's results is therefore that a common measure of grit cannot be constructed.\nThe second distinction we found was the migration of the item \u00abAs a rule, setbacks do discourage me\u00bb from the Perseverance of Effort to the Consistency of Interests subscale. As previously mentioned, this item underwent two changes in comparison with its original form: the positive wording and the addition of the time adverb \"as a rule\", and both changes might result in the item's migration.\nFirst, after positive rewording, the item became reversed towards the Perseverance of Effort subscale and therefore was recoded. The recoding itself might cause the migration to the other subscale \"Consistency of interest\" where all items were reversed towards their subscale and therefore recoded. This tendency of pooling of reversed items in a separate factor has been extensively discussed for the last decades (Bagozzi, 1993; Marsh, 1996; Herche and Engelland 1996) .\nThe inclusion of the time adverb \"as a rule\" to the wording of the item emphasized the trait's regularity and consistency. As a result, the migration of the item could be related to the effect of the new wording (adverbs of regularity) rather than to the content of the items (perseverance -consistency). Indeed, the time adverbs (regularity) such as \"usually\", \"sometimes\", \"often\", \"from time to time\" can be seen in every item of the Consistency of Interest subscale, but they are absent from the Perseverance of Effort subscale. Accordingly, we consider the wording effect as the main reason for the migration of the item. Nonetheless, even with this structure, both subscales showed their effectiveness as measures of corresponding traits."}, {"section_title": "Study 2.

The instruments to assess the grit-related constructs came from these surveys and were used as a part of them.\nTo assess educational achievement, we used the TIMSS (8 grade) 5 and PISA 6 results\n(plausible values). Both TIMSS and PISA metrics for the overall mathematics, science or reading scales are based on a mean of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100 points (Mullis et al., 2009; OECD, 2014b We measured other school outcomes that are used in several studies, confirming validity measures for grit-related constructs (such as perseverance and tenacity). When students were completing questionnaires of the national survey they indicated whether they had repeated any grades, taken advanced courses in any school subjects, or participated in school subject competitions or subject Olympiads. They also indicated the period of time they spent doing outof-school educational activities (music, art and sport) (\"If you practice music, art or sport, how long have you been doing this?\").\nIn Russia, a nine-year education is compulsory and after the ninth grade, students have an opportunity to choose whether to stay in high school for two more years and then start university after graduating, or to apply to a vocational school (a technical college) and to receive a vocational education. Alternatively, students may finish their formal education and get a job.\nWe questioned the students in a telephone follow-up study conducted 7 months after the PISA survey, and asked whether they had stayed in high school, moved to vocational education or finished their schooling after the 9 th grade. Although we have no strong evidence that shifting to 5 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study measures mathematics and science achievement at the fourth and eighth grades.\n6 The Programme for International Student Assessment is OECD project assessing competency in three domains: reading, mathematics and science in 15-years-old students.\nvocational education itself indicates a lack of grit, there are a great number of studies which claim that mainly low-achieving students follow a vocational trajectory (Altinok, 2011; Kuzcera, 2008 ). As we demonstrated earlier, student achievements can be predicted by grit-relevant measures, and so it is reasonable to presume that the choice between general and vocational education after 9 th grade can be indirectly predicted by grit.\nThe PISA survey also provided an Index of \"Perseverance\" which we used to examine a convergent validity of the Grit scale. PISA measures students' perseverance through their responses to questions about the extent to which they feel they resemble someone who gives up easily when confronted with a problem; who puts off difficult problems; who remains interested in the tasks that he or she starts; who continues to work on a task until everything is perfect, and who does more than is expected of them when confronted with a problem. Student responses ranged on a 5-point Likert scale from \"this person is very much like me\" to \"not at all like me\".\nThe Index of Perseverance provided by PISA is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 across all OECD countries (OECD, 2014a). The observed internal reliability of the PISA perseverance scale (Cronbach' Alpha) was 0.49 for the Russian sample.\nThe Russian version of the Grit scale developed in Study 1 was used to assess the consistency of interests and perseverance of effort.

Second, we used ANOVA to compare the means for both the Consistency of\nInterests and Perseverance of Effort subscales in the groups which were contrasted by educational outcomes; grade repetition, general school retention vs. vocational school, attending advanced courses, participating in subject competition/Olympiads, duration of practicing music (or art) and sport.\nThird, we assessed the convergent validity as a part of construct validity via correlations between the Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort scores with the PISA Index of Perseverance."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We provided a summary for descriptive statistics in Appendix D."}, {"section_title": "Confirmatory Factor Analysis", "text": "The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that Model 2, obtained by an IRT analysis in Study 1, has better fit indices than Model 1 (Table 4) .

The CFA supported the two-factor scale structure. A validity study was also undertaken, where we treated the Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort subscales separately, relying on our results which had been obtained in the previous analyses. We found that the Perseverance of Effort subscale discriminated the groups well, and contrasted all the educational outcomes which were measured in a hypothesized direction.\nStudents that stayed on the general education track after the 9 th grade; who took advanced courses; participated in school subject competitions and Olympiads; did not repeat any grades, and practiced music and sports over a year, had significantly higher Perseverance of Effort scores than students who did not. The Consistency of Interests subscale failed to discriminate between those who repeated a grade, took an advanced course and those who practiced music, from those who did not. The remaining criteria were distinguishable by the Consistency of Interests subscale.\nOne possible explanation for the Consistency of Interests's failure to discriminate between these outcomes is that this kind of behavior does not require any particular consistency of interests. Indeed, the formal schooling, including music or art schooling 7 , occurs regardless of whether one is interested in it consistently and steadily or not. On the other hand, the personal efforts and perseverance should still be applied in order to move along an educational trajectory without grade retention or dropping out.\nThe Consistency of Interests subscale's poor discrimination between the advanced course takers should not be surprising either. Consistency of interests implies the continuance of interests over time. Questioning whether or not a student has ever taken an advanced course does not refer to its continuance. A person could take several advanced courses and interrupt their studies immediately, which would demonstrate an inconsistency of pursuits. Therefore, attending advanced courses is likely to be a criterion of perseverance of effort rather than their stability over time.\nA further question, which ought to be discussed in this section, is the low correlations between the TIMSS and PISA performance which we obtained for both the Consistency of Interests and Perseverance of Effort, despite prior work indicating moderate associations of the subscales and academic attainment operationalized by GPA and SAT (Duckworth, et al., 2007) .\nOne interpretation might suppose that PISA and TIMSS measures are more multi-determined, integrating a wider range of sources for variance, than SAT and GPA. To support this interpretation, we can first refer to a number of studies that argue PISA measures are substantially more complex outcomes of student experiences rather than only academic outcome (e.g., Fuchs, & W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2008; Feuer, 2013) . In addition to this, OECD found the week association between students' perseverance and mathematics performance observed in PISA when the perseverance are measured via PISA Index of Perseverance. They reported that about 5.7% of variation in student performance over OECD countries is explained by the perseverance, and even less so for Russia, i.e. 1.1% (OECD, 2014) . Thus, these correlations might be affected by the measurement features of the PISA and TIMSS assessments."}, {"section_title": "General Discussion", "text": "Based on IRT modeling, the present studies provides data which examining dimensionality, reliability and validity of the Grit Scale in a Russian sample. Taken as a whole, the results demonstrated first that the scale provide two separate measures for two different constructs; \"consistency of interests\" and \"perseverance of effort\" rather than the common trait \"grit\". Both subscales have good psychometric properties in terms of uni-dimensionality, reliability and functioning of answer categories. Second, both subscales displayed their validity, discriminating between groups of respondents with different educational outcomes. It is worth noting that subscales proved to be sensitive enough to predict only the relevant outcomes. The unique patterns of associations, with external measures formed by each subscale, supports the main finding that the subscales function effectively as separate measures of separate traits.
