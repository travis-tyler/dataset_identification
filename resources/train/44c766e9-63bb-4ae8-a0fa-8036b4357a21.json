[{"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019", "text": "48 . This disease has spread worldwide, and as of June 26, 2020, has 49 infected more than nine million humans 1 . The whole-genome sequence of SARS-50 CoV-2 is 96.2% similar to that of a bat SARS-related coronavirus (RaTG13) and is 79% 51 similar to human SARS-CoV 2 . Recent studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is 52 more easily transmitted from person to person than SARS-CoV 3,4 . SARS-CoV-2 has 53 also gradually accumulated new mutations that may make it more suitable to the 54 human host 5,6 . With the development of next-generation sequencing, it has become possible to 56 conduct large-scale studies to detect inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms 57 (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) for infectious 58 diseases, such as Ebola virus that can uncover essential information concerning their 59 transmission and evolution 7,8 . Thus, tracing inter-host SNPs and iSNVs, and revealing 60 the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is a priority. 61 To trace mutations in SARS-CoV-2, we first identified similarities and 62 differences in SNPs from assembled genome sequences and publicly available raw 63 reads. We collected 15,818 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the 64 publicly accessible GISAID, CNGBdb, GenBank, GWH 9 and NMDC databases on 65 May 27, 2020. All of these sequences were aligned against the reference genome 66 (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank NC_045512.2) 10 using MUSCLE 11 , revealing 7,700 inter-67 host SNP sites (4,672 nonsynonymous, 2,570 synonymous, 98 stop gain, 7 stop loss, 68 and 433 noncoding) (Extended Data Table 1 ). Publicly available raw reads were analyzed, the number of iSNV is much underestimated. We then investigated the distribution of inter-host SNPs and iSNVs in each open 81 reading frame (ORF) and found similar trends in the SNP numbers and SNP numbers 82 normalized by the length between inter-host SNPs and iSNVs ( Fig. 1, a-d) . We then 83 focused on the S-protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as it is being used for 84 monoclonal antibody isolation and vaccine design 13,14 . Several mutations were found 85 in this region, including 68 inter-host nonsynonymous and 65 intra-host 86 nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 1, a and c ). An excess of C-to-T, A-to-G and T-to-C 87 mutations were observed in both the inter-host SNPs and iSNVs, which may be the Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "104", "text": "When the sequences were tested for evidence of recombination using the "}, {"section_title": "134", "text": "The frequency of iSNVs can also be used to reveal selection signals 8, 19 .

Diversifying selection on these two regions might 147 also be driven by an intra-host escape from antibody recognition."}, {"section_title": "148", "text": "To study the mechanisms for the generation and transmission of fitness 149 advantage mutations, we first investigated the number of iSNVs over time and noticed 150 that the numbers of iSNVs was generally steady with few fluctuations (Fig. 3a) . Thus, 151 we concluded that there was no increase in diversity within intra-host genomes over "}, {"section_title": "175", "text": "Population genetics theory points out that an allele with a fitness advantage will 176 increase in frequency faster than alleles without a fitness advantage. Thus, if a 177 mutation has a selective advantage, then the frequency of this mutation will gradually 178 increase over time in a transmission chain (Fig. 4a) . To detect possible fitness with isolate sampling times for the above iSNVs for each lineage. We found two 186 shared iSNVs (mutation type) in the red cluster and two shared iSNVs in the black 187 cluster that had gradual frequency increases over time ( Fig. 4c and Extended Data are not yet highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients. We urged researchers to focus on 199 these types of mutations and upload raw data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to public 200 databases for the monitoring of iSNV frequencies."}, {"section_title": "201", "text": "In summary, we found that to May 27, at least 35.6% of the bases of the SARS-202 CoV-2 genome harbor one or more mutation and that evolution of mutations in the 203 spike protein gene might have been driven by diversifying selection to increase 204 diversity to escape immune system recognition. Furthermore, we found that recurring 205 mutations and human-to-human transmission are the reasons for the prevalence of the 206 fitness advantage mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Through an analysis of shared iSNVs in 207 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients from Shanghai, we found three alleles that 208 might be fitness advantage mutations for SARS-CoV-2. This study provides 209 theoretical support for vaccine development and optimizing treatment. We also 210 strongly recommend that researchers submit raw sequence data and epidemiological 211 10 information of SARS-CoV-2 isolates to public databases, which will improve the 212 detection of fitness advantage mutations of SARS-CoV-2. To prevent a mapping bias caused by polymorphisms, the iSNVs in the SARS-377 CoV-2 reference genome were replaced with 'N' for each sample. We used BWA 378 mem 0.7.17 with default parameters to re-map the reads 23 ."}, {"section_title": "379", "text": "Following the haplotype network and phylogenetic tree in the Shanghai samples, "}]
