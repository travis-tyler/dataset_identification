[{"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "In both technologically advanced and developing economies, understanding educational outcomes is central to effective educational planning and reform. Further, in today's global innovation economy, competence in mathematics and science remains an educational imperative. For more than 50 years, the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) has been conducting comparative studies of educational achievement in a number of curriculum areas, including mathematics and science. TIMSS 2011 represents the fifth cycle of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), developed by IEA. During the past two decades, TIMSS has reported on mathematics and science achievement trends at the fourth and eighth grades, providing educational policymakers, administrators, teachers, and researchers with powerful insights into how educational systems are functioning as well as critical intelligence about the possibilities for educational reform and improvement. The TIMSS 2011 International Results in Science presents extensive information on student performance in science, including trends over the five assessments since 1995. Also included are data on performance in the science content domains (earth science, biology, chemistry, etc.) and on competence in managing the problem solving challenges in these science contexts. In addition, the TIMSS 2011 report contains vital information on key curricular, instructional, and resource-related factors that can impact the teaching and learning process. These data on student achievement trends and the contexts for teaching and learning science will ensure that TIMSS continues to set the standard for studies of this type and be regarded as a fundamental source of information for educational policymakers, planners, and researchers alike. TIMSS requires and represents a significant commitment of resources and dedication to achieve a common vision. Clearly, projects of this magnitude rely on the cooperation and support of a large number of individuals, institutions, and organizations around the world. IEA is particularly indebted to the staff members of the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, who have been charged with the overall leadership of this project. Their contributions have been augmented by the staff of the IEA Data Processing and Research Center, the IEA Secretariat, Statistics Canada, and Educational Testing Service, for whose support I am also extremely grateful. While the work of the staff of this consortium makes projects like TIMSS possible, the continued leadership and direction of the TIMSS Executive Directors Ina Mullis and Michael Martin remain central to the success of this project. In addition, projects of this size are possible only with considerable financial support. I am particularly grateful for support from IEA's major funding partners, including the US National Center for Education Statistics, the World Bank, and the many self-funding countries without which this project would not have been possible. I also wish to thank Boston College for its continued support of the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center. Finally, as always, TIMSS would not have been possible without the National Research Coordinators and their colleagues, whose responsibility it was to manage the study at the local level, and the participation of the many teachers, students, and policymakers around the world who gave freely of their time in the interest of advancing our common understanding of reading achievement. On behalf of all who benefit from the use of the information provided by TIMSS, we are thankful for this commitment."}, {"section_title": "Hans Wagemaker Executive Director, IEA", "text": "TIMSS is an international assessment of mathematics and science at the fourth and eighth grades that has been conducted every four years since 1995. In 2011, nationally representative samples of students in 63 countries and 14 benchmarking entities (regional jurisdictions of countries, such as states) participated in TIMSS. Countries and benchmarking participants could elect to participate in the fourth grade assessment, the eighth grade assessment, or both: fifty-two countries and seven benchmarking entities participated in the fourth grade assessment, and 45 countries and 14 benchmarking entities participated in the eighth grade assessment. Several of the countries, where fourth and eighth grade students were expected to find the TIMSS assessments too difficult, administered the fourth and eighth grade assessments to their sixth and ninth grade students. In total, more than 600,000 students participated in TIMSS 2011. TIMSS 2011 continues the series of international assessments in mathematics and science conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). IEA pioneered international comparative assessments of educational achievement in the 1960s to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of policies and practices across countries' different systems of education. TIMSS is directed by IEA's TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College. The TIMSS science assessment is based on a comprehensive framework developed collaboratively with the participating countries that is organized around two dimensions: A content dimension specifying the domains or subject matter to be assessed within science; and A cognitive dimension specifying the domains or thinking processes expected of students as they engage with the science content. The content domains and topic areas within them are different for the fourth and eighth grades, but the cognitive domains are the same for both grades, encompassing a range of cognitive processes involved in solving problems throughout the primary and middle school years. Given the frameworks' broad coverage goals, the science assessment item pools were necessarily large-172 and 217 assessment items at the fourth and eighth grades, respectively-with about half being multiple choice and half being constructed response items where students write their answers. The achievement results are reported on the TIMSS achievement scales for the fourth and eighth grades, each with a range of 0 -1,000 (although student performance typically ranges between 300 and 700). TIMSS uses the centerpoint of the scale (500) as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment."}, {"section_title": "East Asian Countries Among the Top-performers in TIMSS 2011", "text": "Taipei, and Japan-had higher achievement than all other countries except Singapore.

Twenty percent of the students in Finland reached this level, followed by the Russian Federation (16%), Chinese Taipei (15%), the United States (15%), and Japan (14%). Although relatively few students reached the Advanced International Benchmark in most countries (median percentage across countries: 5%), the high median percentage reaching the Low International Benchmark (92%) indicates that many countries have been successful in educating almost all of their fourth grade students to a basic level of science achievement. At the eighth grade, four East Asian countries had the largest percentages of students reaching the Advanced International Benchmark: Singapore had the highest percentage (40%), followed by Chinese Taipei (24%), Korea (20%), and Japan (18%).

In comparison to the fourth grade, the percentage of eighth grade students reaching each of the International Benchmarks was lower. For example, the median percentage of students reaching the Low International Benchmark was 79 percent (compared to 92% at the fourth grade), indicating that more eighth grade students were being \"left behind\" their classmates. Generally, TIMSS 2011 participants with the highest achievement overall also had the highest achievement in the science content domains (e.g., biology and physics).

To provide information on this topic, TIMSS routinely asks school principals to report on their students' economic home backgrounds and home language. While there was variation across countries, higher average science achievement was associated with students attending schools where a greater percentage of students had the following characteristics: Were from relatively affluent socioeconomic backgrounds; and Spoke the language of the TIMSS assessment as their first language. For example, students were distributed relatively equally across three types of schools categorized by the affluence of their home backgrounds. At the fourth grade, 36 percent attended schools with relatively more students from affluent than from economically disadvantaged homes, and these students had the highest average achievement. At the other end of the range, 30 percent of students attended schools with relatively more students from economically disadvantaged homes, and these students had the lowest average achievement. Similarly, at the eighth grade, 32 percent attended schools with rel at ively more students f rom affluent than disadvantaged homes, and these students had the highest average achievement. Conversely, 36 percent of students attended schools with relatively more students from economically disadvantaged homes, and these students had the lowest average achievement. In contrast, schools with discipline and safety problems are not conducive to high achievement. The sense of security that comes from attending a school with few behavior problems and having little or no concern about student or teacher safety promotes a stable learning environment. To create the School Discipline and Safety scale, principals provided their perceptions about the degree to which a series of ten discipline, disorderly, and bullying behaviors were problems in their schools. At both the fourth and eighth grades, students who attended schools with disorderly environments and who reported more frequent bullying had much lower achievement than their counterparts in safe and orderly schools. Interestingly, across the fourth grade countries, 61 percent of students, on average, attended schools with Hardly Any Problems with discipline or safety, 29 percent were in schools with Minor Problems, and 11 percent attended schools with Moderate Problems. Across the eighth grade countries, however, discipline appeared to be more of an issue; principals reported that only 16 percent of students were in schools with Hardly Any Problems, 66 percent were in schools with Minor Problems, and 18 percent attended schools with Moderate Problems."}, {"section_title": "Principals' Problems with School Discipline and Safety-International Averages", "text": "There is growing evidence that bullying in schools is on the rise, especially with the emergence of cyber-bullying, and that bullying does have a negative impact on students' educational achievement. The Students Bullied at School scale was based on how often students experienced six bullying behaviors, such as \"Someone spread lies about me\" and \"I was made to do things I didn't want to do by other students. \" At both the fourth and eighth grades, an increase in the frequency of bullying was related to a decrease in average science achievement. Unsettlingly, across countries, although nearly half of the fourth grade students reported Almost Never being bullied (48%), the majority were bullied either About Monthly (32%) or About Weekly (20%). In contrast to principals' reports of more school discipline and safety problems at the eighth grade than fourth grade, the eighth grade students reported experiencing somewhat less bullying behavior than the fourth grade students. In view of the importance of a well-prepared teaching force to an effective education, TIMSS 2011 collected a variety of information about teacher education. Internationally, most students were taught by the following: Teachers with bachelor's or postgraduate university degrees (80% at the fourth grade, and 90% at the eighth grade); Teachers with at least 10 years of experience (70% at the fourth grade, and 62% at the eighth grade); Teachers who reported being Very Well prepared to teach the TIMSS science topics (62% at the fourth grade, and 72% at the eighth grade); and Teachers Very Confident in teaching science (59% at the fourth grade, 73% at the eighth grade). At both the fourth and eighth grades, students with more experienced and more confident teachers had higher science achievement. The TIMSS 2011 Teacher Career Satisfaction scale categorized students based on their teachers' degree of agreement with six statements, such as \"I do important work as a teacher\" and \"I plan to continue as a teacher for as long as I can.\" At both the fourth and eighth grades, teacher satisfaction was positively related to average science achievement, and very few students had teachers that expressed any dissatisfaction except in a small number of countries. Internationally, the fourth grade students with Satisfied science teachers (54%) had higher achievement than those with teachers that were only Somewhat Satisfied (41%) or Less Than Satisfied (5%). The eighth grade science teachers reported somewhat lower levels of career satisfaction, with the 47 percent of students taught by Satisfied science teachers having higher science achievement than those taught by only Somewhat Satisfied (45%) or Less Than Satisfied (8%) teachers."}, {"section_title": "Students with Positive Attitudes Toward Science Have Higher Achievement, but Attitudes Less Positive at the Eighth Grade", "text": "Each successive TIMSS assessment has shown a strong positive relationship within countries between student attitudes toward science and their science achievement. The relationship is bidirectional, with attitudes and achievement mutually influencing each other. The Students Like Learning Science scale was based on students' degree of agreement with six statements, such as \"I enjoy learning science\" and \"I learn many interesting things in science. \" Internationally, more than half of the fourth grade students Like Learning Science, and they had higher average achievement than those that Somewhat Like Learning Science (35%) or those that Do Not Like Learning Science (12%). At the eighth grade, 16 of the TIMSS countries teach science subjects separately (i.e., biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science) rather than as a general or integrated subject. TIMSS asked students in these countries about their liking of the individual subjects and the results were scaled separately for each subject. Compared to the fourth grade, substantially fewer eighth grade students reported positive attitudes toward learning science. Among countries teaching general or integrated science, only about one-third (35%) of students Like Learning Science, compared to 53 percent at the fourth grade. Accompanying this decrease is a widening achievement gap between students who like learning the subject (515, on average) and those who do not (450). Among separate science subject countries, the average percentage of students liking learning biology (36%) and earth science (33%) was similar to the percentage liking learning science in general or integrated science countries, but fewer students like learning chemistry (25%) or physics (26%).

The students lacking confidence (21%) had the lowest achievement. At the eighth grade, only 20 percent of the students in general or integrated science countries, on average internationally, felt Confident in their science ability, with most students either Somewhat Confident (49%) or Not Confident (31%). The achievement gap was 86 points between the Confident and Not Confident students. The eighth grade students in separate science countries were similar to students in general or integrated countries in their confidence in biology and earth science (21% and 19% Confident, respectively) but less confident in chemistry and physics (14% Confident for each). In all four science subjects, there was a strong positive relationship between student confidence and average science achievement. The Students Value Science scale asked the eighth grade students about six different aspects of valuing science, including \"I think learning science will help me in my daily life\" and \"I need to do well in science to get the job I want. \" Internationally, the eighth grade students in general or integrated science countries placed a high value on science, with 41 percent who Value science and another 33 percent who Somewhat Value the subject. However, about one-fourth (26%) Do Not Value science. Students who said they value science had higher average achievement than students who only valued it somewhat, and those students, in turn, had higher achievement than students who did not value science. Students in separate science subject countries do not seem to value the individual science subjects in the same way as students in general science countries. Across the four science subjects, only about one-fourth (25-29%) of the students reported that they value the subjects and about two-fifths (36 -42%) reported that they did not value them.\nFrom the students' perspective, the Engaged in Science Lessons scale asked how much students agreed with five statements, such as \"I know what my teacher expects me to do\" and \"I am interested in what my teacher says. \" Internationally, the fourth grade students Engaged in their science lessons (45%) had the highest achievement, followed by those Somewhat Engaged (47%) and the few students Not Engaged (8%). At the eighth grade, internationally, smaller percentages of students reported being Engaged. In countries teaching general or integrated science, only 29 percent of students, on average, reported being Engaged during their science lessons, although these students had the highest average achievement. Among the separate science subject countries, students reported somewhat more engagement in biology and earth science lessons (33% and 31% Engaged, respectively) than in chemistry and physics lessons (26% and 27% Engaged, respectively).

Typically, teachers are asked to report how frequently they use various instructional activities and strategies, and such information can be very useful. However, in light of the growing body of evidence about the complexities of teaching and learning, researchers are beginning to understand that these lists of activities cannot be used as proxies for the characteristics of good teaching. To help build a better bridge between curriculum and instruction, TIMSS 2011 collected information about the concept of student engagement in learning, which focuses on the cognitive interaction between the student and the instructional content. To measure aspects of student engagement, TIMSS 2011 developed both a teacher scale, called the Engaging Students in Learning scale, and a student scale, called the Engaged in Science Lessons scale. For the Engaging Students in Learning scale, students were categorized according to how often their teachers reported using six instructional practices (four at the eighth grade) intended to interest students and reinforce learning (e.g., summarizing the lesson's learning goals, questioning to elicit reasons and explanations, and bringing interesting things to class). Many fourth grade students internationally (71%) had science teachers that made efforts to use these practices to engage them during Most Lessons, and the rest had teachers that used such practices in About Half the Lessons (with a few exceptions).

The Emphasize Science Investigation scale was based on teacher reports of how often, in teaching science, they ask students to engage in six activities (seven at the eighth grade), such as \"Observe natural phenomena such as the weather or a plant growing and describe what they see\" and \"Design or plan experiments or investigations. \" On average across the fourth grade countries, 40 percent of students were taught by teachers emphasizing science investigation in About Half the Lessons or More, although teachers of science at the fourth grade vary widely across countries in their use of inquiry activities, with the percentage of students taught by teachers emphasizing science investigation ranging from 4 to 86 percent. There was greater use of investigation in science instruction at the eighth grade, with almost half of the students (48%) taught by teachers emphasizing investigation in About Half the Lessons or More.

Unfortunately, some children in many countries around the world suffer from hunger, and a growing body of research, mostly in developing countries, is providing evidence that malnutrition has a negative impact on educational achievement. Similarly, a number of studies in a variety of countries have shown sleep duration and quality to be related to academic functioning at school. On average, internationally, most fourth grade (71%) and eighth grade students (64%) were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited because students were lacking in basic nutrition. These students had higher average science achievement than their peers in classrooms where instruction was limited \"some or a lot\" because students suffered from lack of basic nutrition. The percentage lacking in basic nutrition was much higher in some countries, including some of those that participated at the sixth and ninth grades. Internationally, students suffering from some amount of sleep deprivation did have lower average science achievement. Teachers reported that only a scant majority of fourth grade students (54%) and not even half of the eighth grade students (42%), across countries, were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited by students suffering from not enough sleep. Further, while there was considerable variation across countries, in a number of TIMSS 2011 countries and benchmarking participants at least two-thirds of students reportedly were at least somewhat sleep deprived.

In particular, in 2011 the trend cycles of IEA's TIMSS and PIRLS international assessments came together producing a synergy that led to advancements in the quality of background data collected by both projects. Because PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) also assesses students at the fourth grade, the alignment of the two projects provided the opportunity for countries to assess the same fourth grade students in reading, mathematics, and science in conjunction with the extensive background data collected by IEA assessments-most notably, allowing TIMSS INTRODUCTION to benefit from the PIRLS Learning to Read Survey, completed by students' parents or caregivers. Having almost 40 countries participate in both assessments required a great deal of coordination, innovation, and creativity, most notably in the area of background data collection.

As described in the science chapter of the TIMSS 2011 Assessment Frameworks (Mullis, Martin, Ruddock, O'Sullivan, & Preuschoff, 2009), at each grade the science framework is organized around two dimensions: a content dimension specifying the domains or subject matter to be assessed within science, and a cognitive dimension specifying the domains or thinking processes to be assessed. The content domains and the topic areas within the domains are described separately for the fourth and eighth grades, with each topic area elaborated with specific objectives. There are three content domains for the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment: The following three cognitive domains describe the sets of thinking processes that students are likely to use as they engage with the science content: Knowing; Applying; and Reasoning. These cognitive domains are the same for both grades, encompassing a range of cognitive processes involved in working scientifically and solving problems throughout the primary and middle school years. Given the frameworks' broad coverage goals, the science assessment item pools were necessarily large-172 and 217 assessment items at the fourth and eighth grades, respectively-with approximately half multiple choice questions and half in a constructed response format in which students write their answers (see item counts by domain in Appendix B.1 and B.2). To keep response burden to a minimum, each student participating in the assessment responded to just a subset of the item pool, with IRT scaling used to estimate achievement on the assessment as a whole. About 60 percent of the assessment items at each grade were retained from previous TIMSS assessments (2003 and 2007) to provide a foundation for measuring trends in science achievement across assessments; the remaining 40 percent were developed for TIMSS 2011. Developing the assessment materials for TIMSS 2011 was a cooperative venture, involving the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from the participating countries throughout the entire process. Having reviewed their national science curricula in the light of the TIMSS assessment approach, NRCs met to update the assessment framework for 2011 in terms of the balance of content and cognitive domain coverage and the assessment topics to be included. To develop the assessment items needed for the field test, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center conducted an item-writing workshop for NRCs and their colleagues with particular backgrounds in science assessment and item development. Participating countries field tested the items and scoring guides with representative samples of students, and the results were scrutinized internally by the TIMSS 2011 panel of internationally recognized experts-the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee. INTRODUCTION"}, {"section_title": "Quality Assurance", "text": "The TIMSS science assessments were given to carefully selected and welldocumented probability samples of students at the fourth and eighth grades. The student sampling for TIMSS 2011 was conducted with careful attention to quality and comparability. Staff from Statistics Canada and the IEA DPC worked with National Research Coordinators on all phases of the sampling activities. The Statistics Canada sampling experts, in conjunction with the TIMSS 2011 sampling referee (Keith Rust, Westat, Inc.), evaluated the quality of the samples and found high levels of compliance with sampling and participation requirements, with the exception of a few cases that are annotated in the report. Appendix C provides detail about the national target population coverage and sampling participation rates. TIMSS 2011 made every effort to attend to the quality and comparability of the data through careful planning and documentation, cooperation among participating countries, standardized procedures, and rigorous attention to quality control throughout. For example, an extensive series of verification checks was conducted to ensure the comparability of the translations of the assessment items and questionnaires, detailed documentation was required to satisfy adherence to the sampling standards, and an ambitious quality assurance program was conducted to monitor the data collection."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS 2011 Reports", "text": "The results from TIMSS 2011 are presented in a series of major reports. This present report, TIMSS 2011 International Results in Science, summarizes fourth and eighth grade students' student achievement in each of the 63 participating countries and 14 regional benchmarking jurisdictions, and describes the educational contexts for science instruction. It includes trends in science achievement over time for participants in previous TIMSS assessments in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 as well as student performance at the TIMSS International Benchmarks. Achievement results also are presented for science content and cognitive domains. The Science Report presents a rich array of information about students' backgrounds and attitudes toward science, the science curriculum, teachers' education and training, classroom characteristics and activities, and school contexts for science learning and instruction. As a complement to this volume, the TIMSS 2011 International Results in Mathematics (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Arora, 2012) summarizes fourth and eighth grade students' mathematics achievement in each of the 63 participating countries and 14 regional benchmarking jurisdictions, and describes the educational contexts for mathematics instruction. It includes trends in mathematics achievement over time for participants in previous TIMSS assessments in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 as well as student performance at the TIMSS International Benchmarks. Achievement results also are presented for mathematics content and cognitive domains. The Mathematics Report presents a rich array of information about students' backgrounds and attitudes toward mathematics, the mathematics curriculum, teachers' education and training, classroom characteristics and activities, and school contexts for mathematics learning and instruction. The TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia: Education Policy and Curriculum in Mathematics and Science, Volumes 1 and 2 (Mullis, Martin, Minnich, Stanco, Arora, Centurino, & Castle, 2012) describes national contexts for mathematics and science teaching and learning in the 63 countries and several of the regional benchmarking jurisdictions that participated in TIMSS 2011. A chapter prepared by each participant summarizes the structure of its education systems, the mathematics and science curricula and instruction in primary and secondary grades, the teacher education requirements, and the types of examinations and assessments employed. Together with selected supporting data about the countries curricula collected via online questionnaires, the chapters comprising the two volumes of the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia provide an important resource for helping to understand the teaching and learning of mathematics and science around the world, with particular emphasis on schooling through the eighth grade. The online publication, Methods and Procedures in TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 , describes the methods and procedures used to develop, implement, and analyze the results from TIMSS 2011 and is available from the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center's website: http://timssandpirls.bc.edu. The fully documented TIMSS 2011 international database can be downloaded from the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center's website. In addition, special analyses are being conducted using the TIMSS and PIRLS database of fourth grade students. This report, TIMSS and PIRLS Chapter 1 contains the science achievement results for the 52 countries and seven benchmarking participants in the fourth grade TIMSS 2011 assessment and the 45 countries and 14 benchmarking participants in the eighth grade TIMSS 2011 assessment. To summarize science achievement across the participants at fourth and eighth grades, the chapter provides: Averages (means) and distributions of science achievement; Trends in science achievement over time for participants in previous TIMSS assessments in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007; Trends across grades-Relative achievement of the 2007 fourth grade cohort as eighth grade students in 2011; Achievement differences by gender; and Trends in achievement differences by gender. The results for percentages of students reaching the TIMSS International Benchmarks (Advanced, High, Intermediate, and Low) are presented in Chapter 2."}, {"section_title": "Science Achievement Across Countries", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TIMSS 2011 Science Achievement", "text": "This section reports the TIMSS 2011 science results as average scores and distributions on the fourth and eighth grade TIMSS scales, each of which has a range of 0-1,000 (although student performance typically ranges between 300 and 700). The TIMSS science achievement scales were established in TIMSS 1995 based on the achievement distribution across all participating countries, treating each country equally. At each grade level, the scale centerpoint of 500 was set to correspond to the mean of the overall achievement distribution, and 100 points on the scale was set to correspond to the standard deviation. Achievement data from subsequent TIMSS assessment cycles were linked to these scales so that increases or decreases in average achievement may be monitored across assessments. 1 TIMSS uses the scale centerpoint as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment. Exhibit 1.1 shows the distributions of student achievement for the participants in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment, including the average scale score with its 95 percent confidence interval and the ranges in performance for the middle half of the students (25 th to 75 th percentiles) as well as the extremes (5 th and 95 th percentiles). Similarly, Exhibit 1.2 shows the distribution of science achievement for participants in the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment. The first page of Exhibit 1.1 presents the results for the 50 countries that assessed students at the TIMSS target population of the fourth grade. In particular, the TIMSS target population for the fourth grade assessment is the grade that represents four years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1. 2 Level 1 corresponds to primary education or the first stage of basic education, with the first year of Level 1 marking \"systematic apprenticeship of reading, writing, and mathematics. \" However, IEA has a policy that children should be at least 9 years old before being asked to participate in a paper-andpencil assessment such as TIMSS. Thus, as a policy, TIMSS also tries to ensure that, at the time of testing, students do not fall under the minimum average age of 9.5 years old. So, England, Malta, and New Zealand, where students start school at a young age, were assessed in their fifth year of schooling, but still have among the youngest students and are reported together with the fourth grade countries. Exhibit C.1 in Appendix C shows the grades and average ages of the students tested across countries, together with information about the policies and practices related to age of entry to primary school across countries. The TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia contains further details, such as countries' policies about promotion and retention. The second page of Exhibit 1.1 shows the results for three countries that assessed their sixth grade students. To meet the needs of the increasing number of developing countries wanting to participate in TIMSS 2011, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center encouraged countries where the assessment was too difficult for fourth grade students to give the TIMSS fourth grade assessment at the sixth grade. The three countries that elected to assess sixth grade students were Botswana, Honduras, and Yemen (which also assessed its fourth grade students). The second page of Exhibit 1.1 also presents the results for the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade benchmarking participants. The benchmarking participants followed the same procedures and met the same standards as the countries, the difference being that they are regional entities of countries. Benchmarking participants at the fourth grade included Florida and North Carolina (US states), Alberta, Ontario, and Qu\u00e9bec (Canadian provinces), and Dubai and Abu Dhabi (emirates of the United Arab Emirates). Following the same approach as Exhibit 1.1, the first page of Exhibit 1.2 presents the results for the 42 countries that assessed students at the TIMSS target population of the eighth grade, the grade that represents eight years of schooling. For the TIMSS eighth grade assessment, IEA has a policy that students should be at least 13 years old before being asked to participate. Thus, TIMSS tries to ensure that, at the time of testing, students do not fall under the minimum average age of 13.5 years old. So, England and New Zealand, where students start school at a young age, are reported together with the eighth grade countries. Exhibit C.1 in Appendix C shows the grades and average ages of students at the time of testing across countries, together with policies related to age of entry into school. As with the fourth grade, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center encouraged countries where the TIMSS eighth grade assessment was too difficult for eighth grade students to instead assess students at a higher grade. The second page of Exhibit 1.2 shows the results for three countries that assessed their ninth grade students-Botswana, Honduras, and South Africa. The second page of Exhibit 1.2 also presents the results for the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade benchmarking participants. Benchmarking participants at the eighth grade included nine US states (Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and North Carolina), three Canadian provinces (Alberta, Ontario, and Qu\u00e9bec), and two emirates (Dubai and Abu Dhabi). For each section of Exhibit 1.1 and in Exhibit 1.2, participants are shown in decreasing order of average achievement. Also, there is a symbol by a participant's average scale score indicating if the average achievement is significantly higher (up arrow) or lower (down arrow) than the scale centerpoint of 500. TIMSS uses the centerpoint of the scale as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment. (In contrast, the international average, obtained by averaging across the mean scores for each of the participating countries, changes from assessment to assessment as the number and characteristics of the participating countries change.) Finally, several countries have annotations about 1) population coverage (detailed in Exhibit C.2); 2) sampling participation rates (explained in Exhibit C.8); and 3) the potential for bias in their achievement estimates (explained in the section after next)."}, {"section_title": "Achievement in TIMSS 2011 at the Fourth Grade", "text": "The results in Exhibit 1.1 (first page) show that many countries performed well in TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, with 27 countries having higher achievement than the scale centerpoint of 500 and several countries having average achievement above the High International Benchmark of 550. Because there are often relatively small differences between participants in average achievement, Exhibit 1.3 shows whether or not the differences in average achievement among the countries are statistically significant. Korea and Singapore were the top-performing countries in TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade. Looking at the results in Exhibit 1.1 and taking into account the information in Exhibit 1.3, it can be seen that these two countries performed similarly and had higher achievement than all of the other countries. The next highest-performing country was Finland, which had higher achievement than all countries except the two with the highest achievement, followed by Japan, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei. The United States was the next highest performing country, with achievement higher than all countries except the six top performers. Also included in the top 14 high-achieving countries were the Czech Republic, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Sweden, the Slovak Republic, Austria, and the Netherlands. The benchmarking states of Florida and North Carolina and the province of Alberta had performance similar to these countries. While there were small differences from country to country, there was a substantial range in performance from the top-performing to the lowerperforming countries. Eighteen countries had average achievement below the TIMSS centerpoint of 500. For the most part, these countries had average achievement above the Low (400) International Benchmark."}, {"section_title": "Very Low Performance on TIMSS 2011", "text": "It is a well-known principle of educational measurement that the difficulty of the items used to assess student achievement should match the ability of the students taking the assessment. In the context of assessing science achievement, measurement is most efficient when there is a reasonable match between the science ability level of the student population being assessed and the difficulty of the assessment items. The greater the mismatch, the more difficult it becomes to achieve reliable measurement. In particular, when the assessment tasks are much too challenging for most students, to the extent that many students are responding at chance level, it is extremely difficult to achieve acceptable measurement quality.

If there are substantial numbers of students with very low scores, their achievement is likely to be overestimated and consequently the overall achievement distribution becomes biased upwards. Educators and policy makers may work hard and make real strides in improving education from this assessment cycle to the next. However, because the achievement distribution at the earlier cycle was overestimated to begin with, the country would not see evidence of this improvement in the assessment results. The apparently poor return for all of the effort could be very disheartening to those who worked so hard and could prove a disincentive to further investment and effort. Having substantial numbers of students with very low scores in a country also makes it difficult to estimate performance separately for the science content and cognitive domains. The items comprising the science reasoning scale were particularly difficult for such countries. To identify countries where performance is deemed too low to provide reliable measurement of achievement and meaningful trend comparisons, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center conducted extensive investigations to detect when the quality of measurement erodes (Martin, Mullis, & Foy, in press). The proportion of students unable to respond to any items on the assessment was selected as the best indicator of degree of mismatch between students' skills and those demanded by the assessment. Although the absolute lower limit would be no items answered correctly, about half the items were in multiple-choice format and guessing on these was possible. Thus, beginning in 2011, the criterion for having achievement too low for estimation was established based on the percentage of the students having a score no higher than what a student would achieve by guessing on all the multiple-choice questions-essentially the percentage of students performing below chance. For each country, Appendix D shows the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation (Exhibit D.1 for the fourth grade and D.2 for the eighth grade). When, as in Morocco and Yemen at the fourth grade, the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation exceeded 25 percent, the country was annotated with the symbol \u0416. Achievement trends are not reported for these countries because of concerns about bias in the estimation of achievement for the student population. When, as in Kuwait and Tunisia, the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation exceeded 15 percent but did not exceed 25 percent, the country was annotated with the symbol \u03a8, indicating reservations about the reliability of the achievement estimates."}, {"section_title": "Achievement in TIMSS 2011 at the Sixth Grade", "text": "As a group, the countries assessing their sixth grade students had average achievement between 345 and 432.

For the eighth grade (and Finland at the seventh grade), there are 35 countries and nine benchmarking participants having data from 1995, 1999, 2003, or 2007 that can be compared to 2011, including eleven countries and two benchmarking participants that have data from all five TIMSS eighth grade assessments.

Exhibit 1.7 presents for the fourth grade a country-by-country graphical depiction of change in average science achievement from 1995 to 2011, with growth curves aligned country by country to facilitate comparisons of change from assessment to assessment. That is, the same scale is used for each country (10-point intervals), but the part of the scale shown differs according to each countries' average achievement. To complement Exhibit 1.6 and focus on long-term educational progress at the eighth grade, Exhibit 1.8 presents for the eighth grade a similar depiction of change in average achievement from 1995 (or 1999) to 2011 for the 25 countries and eight benchmarking participants that have comparable data from these assessment years. It is particularly interesting to consider the TIMSS 2011 achievement results in light of the information countries provided in the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia. Many countries are engaged in implementing important structural, curricular, and instructional reforms and are using the TIMSS results across the assessment years to monitor the impact on achievement of these reforms. Looking at the trends in fourth grade science achievement during the 1995-2011 period, there have been more countries with increases than with decreases. Of the 17 countries and three benchmarking participants with data spanning this period (see Exhibit 1.7), eight countries and one benchmarking participant had increases in average achievement, one country and one benchmarking participant had decreases, and eight countries and one benchmarking participants had no difference. Among the countries with the greatest increase from 1995 to 2011 were Iran, Portugal, Singapore, and Slovenia, with average achievement increases of 56 points or more.

This enables the 17 countries and three benchmarking participants that assessed both grades in both assessment years to examine how their performance relative to each other changed as the fourth grade students of 2007 became the eighth grade students of 2011. The results are presented in Exhibit 1.9, which shows average science achievement as a difference from the TIMSS scale centerpoint (500) for the fourth grade students in 2007 (upper-left panel) and in 2011 (upperright panel). The exhibit also shows achievement for the eighth grade students in 2007 (lower-left panel) and in 2011 (lower-right panel). The trends for the fourth and eighth grades (indicated by the gray horizontal arrows), however, were presented more fully in Exhibits 1.5 and 1.6, respectively.

For the TIMSS 2011 countries at the fourth grade, at sixth grade, and the benchmarking participants, it presents girls' average achievement, boys' average achievement, and the difference between the two averages. The bar graph shows the size of the achievement difference between boys and girls and whether that difference is statistically significant (as indicated by a darkened bar). International averages also are shown (averages across the mean scores for girls in each of the countries and the mean scores for boys in each of the countries). Exhibit 1.11 presents corresponding results for the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment. In each section of Exhibit 1.10, participants are shown in order by the increasing size of the difference between girls and boys in average science achievement. Overall, there was little achievement difference between girls and boys (International Average: 487 vs. 485). Of the 50 countries at the fourth grade, 23 had no significant gender difference in science achievement. Of the 27 remaining countries, 16 had relatively small differences favoring boys, and three had relatively small differences favoring girls. Eight countries had relatively larger differences favoring girls (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Tunisia, Qatar, Yemen, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait). At the sixth grade, there was a significant achievement difference favoring girls in Botswana. Among benchmarking participants, boys had higher average science achievement than girls in Qu\u00e9bec, Alberta, Florida, and North Carolina. Girls had higher achievement than boys in Abu Dhabi, UAE. As shown in Exhibit 1.11, gender differences in science achievement at the eighth grade were larger, on average, than at the fourth grade, with the difference favoring girls (International Average: 480 vs. 474). Similar to the fourth grade, the gender difference varied across countries, with no difference in 17 of the 42 eighth grade countries, a difference favoring boys in ten countries, and a difference favoring girls in the remaining 15 countries. As at the fourth grade, and consistent with findings from TIMSS 2007, the largest achievement differences favoring girls at the eighth grade were in Arabic-speaking countries from the Middle East (the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian National Authority, Jordan, Bahrain, and Oman).

Trends in Science Achievement by Gender Exhibits 1.12 and 1.13 show graphic representations across the TIMSS assessments in science achievement of boys and girls for the fourth and eighth grades, respectively. For each country that participated in one or more of the previous TIMSS assessments, these displays show how trends in science achievement have been influenced by differential performance by boys and girls. Because there are many different patterns across countries, the countries are presented in alphabetical order. The scale interval is the same for each country (10 points) to permit comparisons, although the part of scale shown differs according to each country's average achievement. For countries with gender differences in science achievement, the displays reveal progress (or lack thereof) over time toward gender equity. As described in the previous section, at the fourth grade, there is already gender equity in science achievement in many countries, but there are also countries where overall achievement is less than it might be if both boys and girls performed at the same high level. Countries in which fourth grade girls performed consistently below boys (i.e., in 2011 and on at least two other TIMSS assessments) include Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and the United States. In Germany, Italy, and the Slovak Republic, boys had higher average achievement than girls on the two most recent assessments (2007 and 2011); while in Georgia and Tunisia, girls had higher achievement than boys on these two assessments. Armenia, Hungary, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, and Slovenia had gender differences in earlier assessments but not in TIMSS 2011. At the eighth grade, with greater gender differences among countries than at the fourth grade, and data from across five TIMSS assessments, trends in science achievement for boys and girls follow a variety of paths. Boys consistently had higher achievement than girls (i.e., in 2011 and in one or more previous assessments) in nine countries: Australia, Chile, Ghana, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, and the United States. A similar pattern of boys outperforming girls also occurred in four benchmarking participants: the states of Indiana, Minnesota, and North Carolina, and the province of Alberta. Conversely, in eight countries-Armenia, Bahrain, Georgia, Jordan, Macedonia, Oman, the Palestinian National Authority, and Thailand-girls had higher achievement than boys in 2011 and in one or more prior assessments; and twelve countries and four benchmarking participants showed no gender difference in 2011, despite having gender differences on one or more previous assessments. Gender differences in average science achievement followed a different pattern in Lithuania and Malaysia; in these countries, girls outperformed boys in 2011 although boys had outperformed girls in at least one prior assessment.

This chapter presents the science results at the TIMSS 2011 International Benchmarks. To interpret achievement at the benchmarks, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center worked with the TIMSS 2011 Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee (SMIRC) to conduct a detailed scale anchoring analysis to describe science achievement at the benchmarks.

The science assessments at the fourth and eighth grade each were organized around two dimensions: a content dimension specifying the subject matter or content domains to be assessed, and a cognitive dimension specifying the thinking processes that students are likely to use as they engage with the content. As illustrated below, the fourth grade has three content domains: life science, physical science, and earth science. Life science received 45 percent of the assessment emphasis, physical science, 35 percent, and earth science, 20 percent. At the eighth grade, there are four content domains: biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. Biology received 35 percent of the assessment emphasis and physics received 25 percent, while chemistry and earth science each received 20 percent. The same three cognitive domains-knowing, applying, and reasoning-were used at both the fourth and eighth grades, although there was a little less emphasis on knowing at eighth grade and somewhat more emphasis on reasoning.

Students communicate their understanding of characteristics and life processes of organisms, reproduction and development, ecosystems and organisms' interactions with the environment, and factors relating to human health. They demonstrate understanding of properties of light and relationships among physical properties of materials, apply and communicate their understanding of electricity and energy in practical contexts, and demonstrate an understanding of magnetic and gravitational forces and motion. Students communicate their understanding of the solar system and of Earth's structure, physical characteristics, resources, processes, cycles, and history. They have a beginning ability to interpret results in the context of a simple experiment, reason and draw conclusions from descriptions and diagrams, and evaluate and support an argument.\n\nIn earth science, students communicate their understanding of Earth's structure, physical characteristics, resources, processes, cycles, and history. For example, they state two things that make up the Earth's crust and recognize that water covers most of Earth's surface. They describe one disadvantage of farming near a river and recognize that soil rich in decaying matter helps plants grow and that soils can change naturally over time. They also recognize how fish fossils are formed. Students demonstrate an understanding of the Earth in the context of the solar system. They recognize how long it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun and rotate on its axis as well as describe how that rotation causes day and night. They also explain why the size and shape of a shadow appears different at different times of the day.  In the table below, write the name of each part, and state its function. \nStudents communicate an understanding of complex and abstract concepts in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. Students demonstrate some conceptual knowledge about cells and the characteristics, classification, and life processes of organisms. They communicate an understanding of the complexity of ecosystems and adaptations of organisms, and apply an understanding of life cycles and heredity. Students also communicate an understanding of the structure of matter and physical and chemical properties and changes and apply knowledge of forces, pressure, motion, sound, and light. They reason about electrical circuits and properties of magnets. Students apply knowledge and communicate understanding of the solar system and Earth's processes, structures, and physical features. They understand basic features of scientific investigation. They also combine information from several sources to solve problems and draw conclusions, and they provide written explanations to communicate scientific knowledge.\n\nIn physics, students demonstrate a good understanding of states of matter and phase change. For example, students identify from a list of characteristics or properties those that change or remain the same as a liquid changes into a gas. Using knowledge that only gases fill an available space, they infer the spacing of particles in different samples of matter. Students can reason about electrical circuits and properties of magnets. They recognize how the arrangement of components in an electrical circuit affects the battery life and brightness of a light bulb. Students describe how to use a magnet to determine whether a metal bar is a magnet and recognize the relationship between the strength of a magnet and the number of paper clips it attracts. Students apply knowledge of forces, pressure, and motion. They explain the relationship between the orientation of a rectangular block and the pressure it exerts on the ground. Students apply knowledge of sound and light in everyday situations. They predict the effect of removing air from an enclosed jar on the propagation of sound in the jar, and, on a diagram of a person looking through a periscope, draw the path and direction of a light ray passing through it. In earth science, students apply knowledge and communicate their understanding of Earth's processes, structures, and physical features. For example, they explain how planting trees and terraced farming affects soil erosion. Given a diagram showing weather conditions at different elevations on a mountain, they identify the most likely location of a jungle. They also show understanding of the conditions under the Earth's surface by explaining why water from an artesian well can be hot, and state what fossil evidence would support the idea that two continents were once joined. Students apply knowledge and communicate understanding of the solar system. They recognize why the moon appears to change shape during the month and how a shadow changes as the sun moves. They also explain why an object's weight is less on the Moon than on Earth. Students understand basic aspects of scientific investigation. In an experimental situation, they identify which variables to control and can design an investigation. They compare information from several sources, combine information to predict and draw conclusions, and interpret information in diagrams, maps, graphs, and tables to solve problems. They provide written explanations to communicate scientific knowledge. Exhibit 2.31 presents Example Item 8, which requires students to communicate their understanding of an important concept in chemistry, in this instance by describing the kinds of changes that take place during a chemical reaction. To receive full credit for this constructed response item, students were required to describe two kinds of changes. On average across countries, only 24 percent of students were able to do so. Example Item 9 in Exhibit 2.32 asks students to demonstrate their understanding of a complex, abstract concept in physics by recognizing that the force of gravity acts on a person regardless of position and movement. On average internationally, 32 percent of the eighth grade students answered this item correctly, although as with many example items, there was great variation across countries, ranging from 13 to 63 percent correct. The TIMSS 2011 Science Framework describes scientific inquiry as a cross-cutting theme in the TIMSS science assessment. Eighth grade students are expected to be able to propose explanations of scientific phenomena based on evidence. Example Item 10 displayed in Exhibit 2.33, an item from the earth science domain, asks students to present fossil evidence to support the idea that two continents were once joined. Students found this item challenging. On average across the countries, only 18 percent of students were able to provide a correct answer.

As described in the TIMSS 2011 Assessment Frameworks, the science assessment is organized around two dimensions: a content dimension specifying the subject matter or content domains to be assessed in science, and a cognitive dimension specifying the thinking processes that students are likely to use as they engage with the content. Each item in the science assessment is associated with one content domain and one cognitive domain, providing for both content-based and cognitive-oriented perspectives on student achievement in science. There are three content domains at the fourth grade: life science, physical science, and earth science; and there are four domains at the eighth grade: biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. The same three cognitive domains-knowing, applying, and reasoning-were used at both the fourth and eighth grades. Knowing covers the student's knowledge of science facts, procedures, and concepts. Applying focuses on the student's ability to apply knowledge and conceptual understanding in a science problem situation. Reasoning goes beyond the solution of routine science problems to encompass unfamiliar situations, complex contexts, and multi-step problems. Chapter 3 presents the TIMSS 2011 results at the fourth and eighth grades for the content and cognitive domains. Previous TIMSS assessments have found that most countries performed relatively better in one or another of the content domains, and similarly, that countries can have relative strengths in one content domain compared to another. In addition to providing TIMSS 2011 average achievement for the content and cognitive domains, the chapter provides changes in achievement in the domains compared to TIMSS 2007, and achievement differences by gender."}, {"section_title": "High International Benchmark", "text": "Students apply their knowledge and understanding of the sciences to explain phenomena in everyday and abstract contexts.

The results are presented in descending order based on the percentage of students reaching the Advanced International Benchmark, first for countries that tested eighth grade students, and then for ninth grade countries and benchmarking participants on the second page. The percentage of students reaching the Advanced Benchmark is indicated in the bar graph with a black dot. Because students who reached the Advanced Benchmark also reached the other benchmarks, the percentages illustrated in the graph and shown in the columns to the right are cumulative. At the eighth grade, four East Asian countries had the largest percentages of students reaching the Advanced International Benchmark. Singapore had 40 percent of their students reach this benchmark, followed by Chinese Taipei (24%), Korea (20%), and Japan (18%). Next, the Russian Federation and England had 14 percent of their students reaching the Advanced Benchmark; Slovenia and Finland had 13 percent of their students reaching this level. Several of the US benchmarking states also had similarly high percentages of students at the Advanced Benchmark, including Massachusetts (24%), Minnesota (16%), Colorado (14%), Connecticut (14%), and Florida (13%).

For example, Italy and Norway had only 4 and 3 percent of students, respectively, reaching the Advanced Benchmark, but nearly all students (90%) reaching the Low Benchmark. As a point of reference, Exhibit 2.18 provides the median for each of the benchmarks at the bottom of each of the four right hand columns. By definition, half of the countries will have a percentage in the column above the median and half will be below the median. The median percentages of students reaching the International Benchmarks were as follows: Advanced-4 percent, High-21 percent, Intermediate-52 percent, and Low-79 percent. In comparison to the fourth grade, these percentages were lower at each level.

At the fourth grade, the countries with the largest percentages of students reaching the Advanced International Benchmark also were the countries with the highest average science achievement (see Chapter 1). The two countries with the highest achievement-Singapore and Korea-had the largest percentages of students reaching the Advanced International Benchmark. One-third of the Singaporean fourth grade students reached the Advanced Benchmark, as did 29 percent of the Korean students. Twenty percent of the students in Finland reached this level, followed by the Russian Federation (16%), Chinese Taipei (15%), the United States (15%), and Japan (14%).

At this benchmark, students had some elementary knowledge of life, physical, and earth sciences, and interpreted simple diagrams, completed simple tables, and provided short written responses to questions requiring factual information. As specified in the TIMSS 2011 Science Framework, almost half of the fourth grade assessment (45%) was devoted to items in the life science domain. Several items answered correctly by students achieving at the lower scale levels assessed knowledge of characteristics and life processes of living things, one of the topics in the TIMSS Framework. Exhibit 2.5 presents Example Item 1, a question requiring students to apply elementary knowledge about the physical characteristics of animals and illustrating performance at the Low International Benchmark. With an international average of 83 percent correct across the fourth grade countries, this item was relatively easy for students in most countries. Exhibit 2.6 presents Example Item 2, in which students must interpret a simple diagram and recognize that an iron nail completes an electric circuit. This elementary knowledge of physical science exemplifies the Low International Benchmark, where students demonstrated some basic knowledge of physical properties of matter. The international average was 71 percent correct, and this item was relatively easy for students in many countries. In life science, students demonstrate knowledge of some simple facts related to human health. For example, they state one effect the Sun can have on unprotected skin and name one thing humans can do to maintain good physical health. They also demonstrate some knowledge of behavioral and physical characteristics of animals. Students recognize that fat layers help keep some animals warm, that wings are common to birds, bats, and butterflies, and that birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm. Students exhibit an elementary understanding of ecosystems. They recognize a predator in a list of animals and match animals to their ecosystems. In physical science, students demonstrate some basic knowledge of energy and the physical properties of matter. For example, they recognize that an iron nail can complete an electrical circuit and allow a light bulb to glow, and they identify wind as the cause of movement in a sail boat. Students recognize that the vibrations that produce sound in a guitar start with the strings and, from a diagram, recognize which of a set of thermometer readings shows the hottest water.

At this level, students had basic knowledge and understanding of practical situations in the sciences, and they demonstrated ability to interpret information in pictorial diagrams and apply factual knowledge to practical situations. The majority of students in most countries reached this benchmark. As mentioned in discussing performance at the low level (Example Item 1), characteristics and life processes of living things was a topic in the TIMSS Science Framework. Example Item 3 in Exhibit 2.8 is a slightly more difficult life science item that requires students to pair three animals with their distinguishing biological characteristics. In TIMSS 2011, some of the constructed response items were worth 1 point and some 2 points, and the illustrative answers provided with the example items always show an answer that received full credit. The number of possible points for each constructed response item is indicated across the bottom of the exhibit. In this item, students who correctly identified the monkey, grasshopper, and octopus received the maximum score of 1 point. The international average percent correct was 58 percent, with a considerable range in performance across countries. In Korea, Singapore, and Hungary, the percent correct was 80 percent or more, compared to 16 percent or less in Morocco and Yemen. Exhibit 2.9 presents Example Item 4, a constructed response item from the domain of earth science exemplifying the basic, practical knowledge that characterizes student performance at the Intermediate Benchmark. Students answering this item correctly stated one form of energy the Earth receives from the sun. On average, across fourth grade countries, 54 percent of students answered correctly.

Eighth Grade TIMSS 2011 Low International Benchmark Exhibit 2.20 presents the detailed description of student achievement at the Low International Benchmark. At this benchmark, students recognized some basic facts from the life and physical sciences, and interpreted simple pictorial diagrams, completed simple tables, and applied their basic knowledge to practical situations. In biology at the eighth grade, the TIMSS 2011 Science Framework expects that students should be able to compare biological processes at the cellular level, including ideas about heredity. Exhibit 2.21 presents Example Item 1, which required students to recognize the basic biological fact that genetic material is inherited from both parents. On average across countries, this item was relatively easy and was answered correctly by 83 percent of the eighth grade students. In all countries and benchmarking jurisdictions, more than 60 percent of students answered the item correctly. In chemistry at this benchmark level, students had some basic knowledge of chemical formulas. Exhibit 2.22 presents Example 2, in which students must recognize the chemical formula for carbon dioxide. On average across countries, this item also was relatively easy, with 85 percent of eighth grade students answering it correctly. Students demonstrate some basic knowledge of biology. For example, they recognize that influenza is caused by a virus and that genetic material is inherited from both parents. In chemistry and physics, students have some basic knowledge of chemical formulas and properties of substances as they change states. They recognize some aspects of conductivity and energy. For example, they recognize which material is a conductor of electricity and the type of energy in a compressed spring. Students interpret simple pictorial diagrams, complete simple tables, and apply basic knowledge to practical situations. h Percent significantly higher than international average i Percent significantly lower than international average See Appendix C.3 for target population coverage notes 1, 2, and 3.

The international average percent correct for this item was 57 percent, although in some of the highest-performing countries (Japan, Korea, and Finland) 80 percent or more of the students answered the item correctly. In earth science at this benchmark level, students demonstrated an elementary understanding of Earth's processes. Exhibit 2.25 presents Example Item 4, an item in the earth science domain which requires students to apply their understanding of the processes of the water cycle. On average across countries, 63 percent of the eighth grade students correctly numbered each process in the order in which it takes place. However, the percentage of students answering correctly varied greatly across countries (14-92%), indicating that this particular earth science topic may be more widely taught in some countries than others. In biology, students demonstrate some understanding of human health. For example, students understand how vaccination helps prevent illness and which cells destroy bacteria. They also state why exercise is important for good health. Students apply their knowledge of life cycles, adaptation, and heredity. They recognize that a tree has growth rings. They also explain that an animal's coloration protects it from predators and that an acquired characteristic cannot be passed on to the next generation. Students interpret and explain information about ecosystems and the effect of population changes. They recognize an organism that is a producer. They analyze information about a lake ecosystem and explain how an introduced population can affect an existing population. Students have some knowledge of chemistry in everyday life. For example, they recognize that a fire can be stopped by cutting off the supply of oxygen, they recognize, from a description of indicator color changes, that neutralization has occurred, and, in the context of an investigation, they recognize the condition under which nails would rust. Students also have elementary knowledge of properties of solutions and the concept of concentration. They identify which of two solutions is more dilute and justify their selection. In physics, students are acquainted with some aspects of force, motion, and energy. For example, they recognize the position of a fulcrum that requires the least amount of force to move a heavy object. Given a diagram showing a ball being thrown upward, they state the force that causes the ball to fall. In addition, students draw conclusions from a line graph showing the results of an investigation comparing two heat sources. In earth science, students demonstrate an elementary understanding of Earth's processes and physical features. They describe a cause of earthquakes, recognize where active volcanoes are found and which soil change is due to a natural cause rather than human activity. Students demonstrate an understanding of the water cycle and knowledge of atmospheric conditions. They order the processes involved in the water cycle and match each process with its description. They recognize that air temperature at high altitudes is very low and that carbon dioxide is increasing over time in Earth's atmosphere. Students interpret information from tables, graphs, and pictorial diagrams and draw conclusions. They apply knowledge to practical situations and communicate their understanding through brief descriptive responses. a His pulse rate increased by 50 beats per minute. b His pulse rate took less time to slow down than to increase. c His pulse rate a er 4 minutes was 80 beats per minute. d His pulse rate returned to normal in less than 6 minutes.  h Percent significantly higher than international average i Percent significantly lower than international average See Appendix C.3 for target population coverage notes 1, 2, and 3.

They also demonstrated some scientific inquiry skills, and combined and interpreted information from various types of diagrams, contour maps, graphs, and tables; selected relevant information, analyzed, and drew conclusions; and provided short explanations conveying scientific knowledge. Example Item 5, shown in Exhibit 2.27, illustrates an item in the chemistry domain that requires reasoning. Students were asked to identify a property of metals and describe how this property could be used to determine whether an unknown substance is a metal or nonmetal. This item demonstrates the increasing sophistication in knowledge and skill demonstrated by students at the High International Benchmark, which is reflected in an international average percent correct of 35 percent. Exhibit 2.28 presents Example Item 6, an item from the physics domain that requires students to recognize that molecules of a liquid slow down as the liquid cools. This multiple choice item was relatively less difficult than Example Item 5, with 58 percent of eighth grade students, on average, answering the item correctly. Example Item 7, shown in Exhibit 2.29, illustrates a competence typical of students reaching the eighth grade High International Benchmark-interpreting information appearing in various types of diagrams (in this case, a contour map). This item was moderately difficult; on average across countries, 38 percent of students answered it correctly. As with Example Item 4, there was particularly wide variation across countries in the percentage of students answering this item correctly (4-84%), indicating that this topic also may be more widely taught in some countries than others. In biology, students demonstrate an understanding of aspects of human biology. For example, they recognize the food that is a good source of carbohydrates, recognize what happens to biceps and triceps when an elbow bends, and state one function of the uterus. They also demonstrate an understanding of characteristics, classification, and life processes of organisms. Students classify animals based on physical and behavioral characteristics. They indicate which gas is released into the air and which gas is removed during photosynthesis and animal respiration. Students communicate understanding of processes and relationships in ecosystems. They interpret food chains and recognize competition and predation relationships. They recognize factors that are likely to lead to a change in population size and can predict how populations change over time. They justify whether or not planting trees to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in a city is a good decision. In chemistry, students show an understanding of the classification and composition of matter. For example, students recognize elements and compounds from a list of symbols and formulas and recognize a diagrammatic representation of the structure of a water molecule. Given the chemical formula for an acid, they identify the number of atoms of each element in the molecule and the state of each of three substances at a given temperature from a table of melting and boiling points. Students show an understanding of chemical and physical properties and changes. They identify a property of metals and use it to determine whether an unknown substance is a metal or nonmetal, and they recognize chemical processes in everyday activities that involve energy absorption and release. Students use information presented in several tables to work through a multi-step investigation about the mass and density of gold jewelry. In physics, students apply their knowledge of forces and motion to everyday and abstract situations. For example, they can identify the forces acting on students sitting on a wall. In addition, they recognize an object likely to be used as a lever. Students apply knowledge about the relationship between depth and pressure in water. Given a diagram showing densities of objects and liquids and the objects floating or sinking in the liquids, they identify each liquid. Students apply knowledge to situations related to light and sound. They recognize the pathway of light for an object to be seen, apply their knowledge of light rays reflecting to identify the orientation of a hidden mirror, and explain why lightning is seen before thunder is heard. Students demonstrate basic knowledge of heat and temperature. They recognize what happens to gas and liquid molecules when temperature changes. In the context of an investigation, students explain the effect of temperature on diffusion. Students show an understanding of electrical circuits and properties of magnets and electromagnets. They explain which light bulbs in parallel and series arrangements are affected when one of them breaks. They also recognize how to increase the strength of an electromagnet. "}, {"section_title": "Relative Achievement by Science Content Domains", "text": "Exhibit 3.1 presents the average achievement for TIMSS 2011 participants in the fourth grade content domains of life science, physical science, and earth science relative to overall fourth grade science achievement. To provide a way for the TIMSS 2011 participants to examine relative performance in the content domains, IRT scaling was used to place achievement in each of the three domains on the TIMSS fourth grade science scale. The items on which the content domains were based varied in difficulty, as shown in Appendix B.3, which displays the average percent correct across the items in each domain. For example, internationally, the fourth grade students found the life science and physical science items to be somewhat less difficult (48% and 49% correct) than the earth science items (46%), on average. As shown in Appendix B.4, there was larger variation in the difficulty of the eighth grade content domains, with physics most difficult (38% correct, on average), followed by biology (42%), chemistry (43%), and earth science (45%). However, the scaling process took the differences in difficulty into account, so that average achievement for each of the content domains can be compared relative to overall science achievement at each grade level. In Exhibit 3.1, the first column presents average overall science achievement, and the next columns show average achievement in the three content domains of life science, physical science, and earth science. TIMSS 2011 participants are presented in order by overall science achievement, first for the fourth grade, followed by the sixth grade and the benchmarking participants. The average scale score for each content domain is shown, together with the difference between achievement in overall science and achievement in the content domain. Up and down arrows are used to indicate whether a country's average content domain score is significantly higher or lower than its overall science average score. Generally, the TIMSS 2011 participants with the highest achievement overall also had the highest achievement in the content domains. However, many countries performed relatively higher in one or two of the content domains compared to their overall performance; and relatively lower in one or two others. For example, among the top-performing countries, Korea performed relatively better in physical science and earth science than in science overall, and relatively less well in life science; Singapore performed relatively better in life science and physical science, but relatively less well in earth science; and Finland performed equally well in all three domains. Looking across the results in Exhibit 3.1, there is considerable diversity among countries with regard to their relative strengths and weaknesses in the content domains. At the fourth grade, in only four countries and one benchmarking participant was performance in each of the three content areas relatively the same as in science overall (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Romania, and the Canadian province of Alberta). Exhibit 3.2 presents average achievement in the eighth grade content domains of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science.

Because these three scales represent quite different skills, it was expected that the assessment items would have different difficulty levels. The average percent correct in the cognitive domains shown in Appendix E were 53 percent for knowing, 46 percent for applying, and 41 percent for reasoning at the fourth grade, and 49 percent, 41 percent, and 33 percent, respectively, at the eighth grade. However, as with the content domains, the IRT scaling adjusts for these difficulty levels and allows achievement in the three cognitive domains to be placed on the overall science scales for the fourth and eighth grades, so that TIMSS 2011 participants can compare performance in each of the three cognitive domains relative to overall science achievement. The presentation of results for the cognitive domains in Exhibits 3.3 and 3.4 follows the layout of results for the content domains (Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2). Similar to the results for the content domains, in general, the TIMSS 2011 participants with the highest science achievement overall also had highest achievement in the cognitive domains, although most countries showed a relative strength in one cognitive domain or another.

Of the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade participants that also participated in 2007 and have comparable data, some had increases and some had decreases in average science achievement over the period. From Exhibit 1.5 it can be seen that nine countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, Iran, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Tunisia) had higher average science achievement in 2011 than in 2007, and five countries (Australia, England, Hong Kong SAR, Italy, and New Zealand) had lower achievement. Exhibit 3.5 shows that in three of the countries with an overall increase-Czech Republic, Georgia, and Norway-the increase was due to improved performance in all three science content domains. However, in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden, the increase was due mainly to improvement in physical science, and in Iran and Japan due to increased performance in both physical and earth science. In Tunisia, the increase was due to improvement in life science and earth science. Among the countries with a decrease in overall science achievement, only Hong Kong SAR decreased in all three content domains. Of the others, the decline in Australia and New Zealand was due mainly to a drop in life and earth science performance; in England it was due to lower physical and earth science achievement; and in Italy it was due to a decrease in life and physical science achievement. Although not showing overall increases in science achievement between 2007 and 2011, Austria and the Slovak Republic both had increased achievement in physical science. Slovenia also had no overall science achievement difference, but had increased achievement in life science and a decrease in earth science. Singapore and the two Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, also with no overall difference, had a decrease in earth science achievement. Of the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade participants with comparable data from 2007, some had increased average science achievement over the period and some decreased. From Exhibit 1.6 it can be seen that seven countries (Iran, Korea, Norway, Palestinian Authority, Russian Federation, Singapore, and the Ukraine as well as the province of Qu\u00e9bec and the state of Minnesota) had higher average science achievement in 2011 than in 2007, and seven countries had lower achievement (Bahrain, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Syria, and Thailand). Exhibit 3.6 shows that only in Singapore and the province of Quebec was the overall increase due to improved performance in all four science content domains. In Iran, the increase was due to improved achievement in biology, chemistry, and physics; in Korea due to improved biology and chemistry; in Norway due to improved earth science; in the Palestinian Authority due to improved chemistry and physics; in the Russian Federation due to increased achievement in biology, chemistry, and physics; in the Ukraine due to improved biology, chemistry, and earth science; and in the state of Minnesota due to improved chemistry, physics, and earth science. In six of the seven countries with an overall decrease in science achievement, including Bahrain, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Syria, and Thailand, the decrease was evident in all four content domains. In Hungary, the remaining country, the decline was due to a drop in achievement in biology, physics, and earth science. Although showing no change in overall in eighth grade science achievement between 2007 and 2011, several countries had improved performance in one or more content domains, including Chinese Taipei (earth science), Ghana (physics), Italy and Slovenia (chemistry, earth science), Japan (biology, earth science), and the United States as well as its state of Massachusetts (chemistry, physics). There were also several participants with lower achievement in one or more content domains in 2011 without having lower overall science achievement, including England, Lebanon, Oman, and Sweden (physics), and the province of Ontario (chemistry).

As with the content domains, overall increases or decreases in science achievement since 2007 were reflected in increases or decreases in the cognitive domains. As shown in Exhibit 3.7, the overall increase in science achievement was the result of increases in all three cognitive domains in just two countries: Georgia and Norway. In the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Tunisia, the overall increase was due to increases in the knowing and applying domains, whereas in Denmark and Sweden it was the result of improvement in the applying domain. In Iran, the overall science increase was due to improved performance in knowing and reasoning, and in Japan due to improvements in applying and reasoning. Among countries with an overall decrease in science achievement, only in Hong Kong SAR was this decrease the result of lower achievement in all three cognitive domains. In Australia and England, the overall decrease was due to a decrease in knowing and reasoning, in Italy due to a decrease in applying and reasoning, and in New Zealand due to a decrease in knowing.

Singapore performed less well in knowing but better in reasoning. The Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, while not having lower overall science achievement, performed less well in knowing, and Ontario also performed less well in reasoning. Exhibit 3.8 shows that for three of the seven countries with higher average science achievement in 2011 than in 2007 (the Palestinian Authority, the Russian Federation, and Singapore), the increase was due to improved performance in all three science cognitive domains; whereas for Iran, it was due to improved performance in applying and reasoning, for Korea and Norway, in applying, and for the Ukraine in knowing and reasoning. The overall increases in the provinces of Qu\u00e9bec and state of Minnesota were due to improved performance in knowing and applying. In all seven of the countries where overall science achievement decreased since 2007, this decrease was the result of lower achievement in all three cognitive domains. Countries without an overall increase in eighth grade science achievement between 2007 and 2011, but with improved performance in one or more cognitive domains included Georgia (reasoning), Italy, the United States and the state of Massachusetts (knowing), and Slovenia (knowing and applying). Countries with a decrease in one or more cognitive domains but without an overall decrease in science achievement included Lebanon and Tunisia (knowing), and Lithuania (reasoning). Ghana, with no change in overall science achievement between 2007 and 2011, had a decrease in the knowing domain and an increase in reasoning.

At the fourth grade, girls had higher achievement in life science than boys in 18 countries and one benchmarking entity, compared with four countries and no benchmarking participants where boys outperformed girls. Conversely, boys had higher achievement in physical science than girls in 25 countries and five benchmarking participants, compared with seven countries and one benchmarking participant where girls outperformed boys. Also, boys had higher achievement in earth science than girls in 20 countries and five benchmarking entities, compared with eight countries and one benchmarking participant where girls outperformed boys. On average across countries, girls had an 8-point advantage in life science, and boys had a 1-point advantage in physical science and a 4-point advantage in earth science. At the sixth grade, girls in Botswana and Yemen performed better than boys in life science, and boys in Honduras performed better than girls in earth science. As shown in Exhibit 3.10, on average across the eighth grade countries, girls had a 12-point advantage in biology and a 10-point advantage in chemistry, while boys had a 2-point advantage in earth science. There was no significant difference between the achievement of girls and boys in physics. Girls outperformed boys in biology in 24 countries and two benchmarking entities, and in chemistry in 20 countries and one benchmarking participant. Boys outperformed girls in biology in seven countries and in chemistry in seven countries and four benchmarking entities. Boys outperformed girls in physics in 16 countries and eleven benchmarking participants, and in earth science in 16 countries and twelve benchmarking participants. Girls outperformed boys in physics in nine countries and one benchmarking entity, and in earth science in six countries and one benchmarking entity. Exhibits 3.11 and 3.12 present gender differences in the cognitive domains for the fourth and eighth grades. On average across the fourth grade countries, girls had higher achievement than boys in the reasoning domain. In eight countries and one benchmarking participant, girls outperformed boys in all three cognitive domains (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and the emirate of Abu Dhabi), while in six countries and one benchmarking participant, boys outperformed girls in all three domains (Austria, Belgium-Flemish, Chile, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, and the province of Alberta). At the eighth grade, on average across countries, girls outperformed boys in all three of the cognitive domains. Specifically, girls outperformed boys in all three domains in twelve countries and one benchmarking participant (Armenia, Bahrain, Georgia, Jordan, Macedonia, Malaysia, Oman, the Palestinian National Authority, Qatar, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the emirate of Dubai). Conversely, boys outperformed girls in all three domains in seven countries and one benchmarking participant (Chile, Ghana, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Tunisia, Honduras, and the state of Indiana).     h Average significantly higher than other gender \u03c8 Reservations about reliability of average achievement because the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation does not exceed 25% but exceeds 15%.

All TIMSS 2011 participants took part in the TCMA analysis except Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, Honduras (sixth grade participant), and the US benchmarking states at the fourth grade, and Bahrain, Georgia, Ghana, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, Honduras (ninth grade participant), and the US benchmarking states at the eighth grade. Exhibits F.1 through F.4 present the TCMA results for the TIMSS 2011 science test at the fourth and eighth grades. Exhibits F.1 and F.2 show the average percent correct on the science items judged appropriate by each country at the fourth and eighth grades, respectively. Exhibits F.3 and F.4 show the standard errors corresponding to the percentages presented in Exhibits F.1 and F.2. In Exhibit F.1, the bottom row of the exhibit shows the number of items, in terms of score points, identified as appropriate in each country. At the fourth grade, the maximum number of score points in the assessment was 181 points. 3 Reading along the bottom row, it can be seen that only eight participants-Singapore, Korea, Japan, Chinese Taipei, the Russian Federation, Chile, Tunisia, and Yemen-judged less than half of the science items to be included in their curricula, although interestingly, five of the eight were among the highest performers on the TIMSS 2011 assessment. Two countries, Thailand and Armenia, judged 100 percent of the items (all 181 score points) to be included in their curricula. A further 29 countries, including one sixth grade participant, and two benchmarking participants, judged 75 percent or more (136 score points) to be appropriate. At the eighth grade, the percentage of items judged appropriate was somewhat higher; five countries and one benchmarking participant accepted 100 percent of the items (all 233 score points), and a further 23 countries, two ninth grade participants, and two benchmarking participants judged 75 percent or more (175 score points) to be appropriate. Only Morocco, with 116 score points, judged less than half of the score points to be appropriate. Because most countries indicated that some items were not included in their intended curriculum at the grade tested, the data were analyzed Belgium ( * Of the 172 items in the Science test, some extended-response items were scored on a two-point scale, resulting in 184 score points.

Read across the row to compare that country's performance based on the test items included by each of the countries across the top. Read down the column under a country name to compare the performance of the country down the left on the items included by the country listed on the top. Read along the diagonal to compare performance for each different country based on its own decisions about the test items to include. to determine whether the inclusion of these items had any effect on the international performance comparisons. 4 The first column of data in Exhibits F.1 and F.2 show the average percent correct on all test items for each participant, together with its standard error. Subsequent columns show the performance of each participant on those items judged appropriate by the participant listed at the head of the column. Participants are presented in order of their performance based on average percent correct on all items, from highest to lowest. To interpret these exhibits, choosing a country and reading across its row provides the average percent correct for the students in that country on the items selected by each of the countries listed along the top of the exhibit. For example, at the fourth grade, Singapore, where the average percent correct was 77 percent on its own set of items, had 67 percent correct on the items selected by Korea, 70 percent on the items selected by Finland, 75 percent on the items selected by Japan, and so forth. The column for a country listed at the top shows how each of the other participants performed on the set of items selected as appropriate for that country's students. Using the set of items selected by the Russian Federation as an example, 58 percent of these items, on average, were answered correctly by students in Singapore, 57 percent by students in Korea, 63 percent by students in Finland, 61 percent by students in Japan, 58 percent by those in Chinese Taipei, and so forth. The shaded diagonal element in the exhibit shows how each country performed on the set of items that it selected based on its own curriculum. Thus, Russian students averaged 68 percent correct on the set of items identified by the Russian Federation for the analysis. For each country's selected items, the international averages across participating countries are presented in the lower part of the exhibit. These show that the selection of items by the participating countries varied somewhat in average difficulty, ranging at the fourth grade from 47 percent correct for those chosen by Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong SAR, and Croatia to 55 percent correct for those chosen by the Russian Federation. Similarly at the eighth grade, the average percent correct ranged from 42 percent for those items chosen by Singapore to 47 percent for those chosen by Jordan. Comparing the diagonal element for a country with the overall average percent correct shows the difference between performance on the set of items chosen as appropriate for that country and performance on the test as a whole. In general, countries performed better on their own item sets than on the items overall, although usually not by much. Singapore had one of the greatest differences. The average percent correct for Singapore across all fourth grade science items was 66 percent. The diagonal element shows that Singaporean students had a greater average percent correct (77 percent) across the set of items selected as appropriate for Singapore than they did overall. However, most participants had a difference of one or two percentage points between the two performance measures. In addition to Singapore, with a difference of eleven percentage points, other exceptions included Korea (a difference of 10 points), Japan and the Russian Federation (9 points), the Slovak Republic (6 points), and Chinese Taipei and Poland (5 points). At the eighth grade, the differences were generally less; the largest being in province of Alberta (5 points) and Japan, Slovenia, and Jordan (4 percentage points). It is clear that the selection of items does not have a major effect on the relative performance among TIMSS participants. Participants that had relatively high or low performance across all the science items also had relatively high or low performance on each of the various sets of items selected for the TCMA. For example, at the fourth grade, Singapore had the highest average percent correct not only on the test as a whole, but also on all of the different item selections, with Korea, Finland, and Japan next in order of performance on practically all selections of items. Although there are some changes in the ordering of countries based on the items selected for the TCMA, most of these differences are within the boundaries of sampling error. 5 Even when countries performed better on the items judged by them to be included in their curriculum than they did overall, their performance relative to other participants was changed little. As an example, consider the 200 score points selected by Slovenia at the eighth grade. The students in Slovenia did better on these items (58% correct) than on the test as a whole (54% correct). However, most other countries also did better on these particular items, with an international average of 46 percent correct compared with 44 percent correct overall. In general, the TIMSS participants that performed as well or better than Slovenia on the overall test also performed as well or better on the items selected by Slovenia. The TCMA results provide evidence that the TIMSS 2011 science assessment provides a reasonable basis for comparing achievement of the participating countries and benchmarking entities. This result is not unexpected; making the assessment as fair as possible was a major consideration in test 5 Small differences in performance between adjacent countries shown in this exhibit usually are not statistically significant. The standard errors for the average percent correct statistics based on the TIMSS 2011 sample are provided in Exhibits F.3 and F.4. For any sample average shown in Exhibits F.1 and F.2, it can be said with 95 percent confidence that the corresponding value in the population falls between the sample estimate plus or minus two standard errors.

Internationally, IEA studies in science through four cycles of TIMSS have found a strong positive relationship between students' science achievement at the fourth and eighth grades and home environments that foster learning. This chapter presents the fourth grade TIMSS 2011 science achievement results in relation to parents' reports about the following: 1) their children's home resources for learning, 2) their children's language experiences before starting school, 3) their educational expectations for their children, and 4) their children's attendance at preprimary education. The parents' data were collected using the TIMSS & PIRLS 2011 Learning to Read Survey in which students' parents or primary caregivers were asked to provide information about their child's home environment and early educational experiences, and so are available only for countries that administered both TIMSS and PIRLS to the same fourth grade students. The chapter also presents the eighth grade science achievement in relation to students' own reports about several aspects of their home environment and their educational expectations."}, {"section_title": "Home Resources for Learning", "text": "The TIMSS & PIRLS 2011 Learning to Read Survey asked students' parents to report on the availability of three key home resources highly related to student achievement in school: Parents' occupation; and Number of children's books in the home. In addition, students were asked about: Number of books in the home; and Availability of two study supports at home-An Internet connection and their own room. Research consistently shows a strong positive relationship between achievement and socioeconomic status (SES), or indicators of socioeconomic status such as parents' or caregivers' level of education or occupation. TIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA have found strong positive relationships between level of parents' education and/or occupation and their children's educational attainment. In general, higher levels of education can lead to careers in higher paying professions, higher socioeconomic status, and more home resources. However, the benefits of higher levels of parents' education can extend to having more positive beliefs and higher expectations toward educational achievement transfer to their children. Availability of reading material in the home likewise is strongly related to achievement in mathematics and science as well as in reading. IEA's TIMSS studies have consistently shown that students with a large number of books in the home have higher achievement in mathematics and science. Exhibit 4.1 presents the results for the TIMSS 2011 Home Resources for Learning scale, which was created based on parents' and students' reports about the five types of home resources described above. Results are shown for countries that administered both TIMSS and PIRLS fourth grade assessments to the same fourth grade students. The second page of the exhibit provides detail about the questions forming the scale and the categorization of responses. Students were scored according to the availability of the five home resources, with Many Resources corresponding to more than 100 books in the home, having both their own room and an Internet connection, more than 25 children's books, at least one parent having completed university, and one with a professional occupation, on average. Few Resources corresponds, on average, to having 25 or fewer books, neither of the home study supports, 10 or fewer children's books, neither parent having gone beyond upper secondary school, and neither having a business, clerical, or professional occupation. Countries are ordered by the percentage of students in the Many Resources category, with the fourth grade countries on the first page of the exhibit and the sixth grade and benchmarking participants on the second page. Internationally, on average, almost three-quarters of the fourth grade students (74%) were assigned to the Some Resources category. Seventeen percent, on average, were in the Many Resources category and nine percent internationally were in the Few Resources category, with a 131-point difference in their average science achievement (559 vs. 428). Students in the countries participating at the sixth grade had relatively few home resources, comparable to the fourth grade countries with the lowest levels of resources. Resources had a score of at least 11.9, which is the point on the scale corresponding to students reporting they had more than 100 books in the home and two home study supports, and parents reporting that they had more than 25 children's books in the home, that at least one parent had finished university, and that at least one parent had a professional occupation, on average. Students with Few Resources had a score no higher than 7.3, which is the scale point corresponding to students reporting that they had 25 or fewer books in the home and neither of the two home study supports, and parents reporting that they had 10 or fewer children's books in the home, that neither parent had gone beyond upper-secondary education, and that neither parent was a small business owner or had a clerical or professional occupation, on average.

Students Spoke the Language of the Test TIMSS has previously shown that, with some exceptions, countries with large proportions of students from homes where the language of the test (and consequently the language of instruction) is not often spoken had lower average science achievement than students who spoke the language of the test more often. Because learning any school subject is dependent on having a mastery of the language of instruction, which in turn is influenced by children's early language experiences, the language or languages spoken at home and how they are used are important factors in subsequent school achievement. As formal science instruction begins, children are likely to be at an initial disadvantage if their knowledge of the language of instruction is substantially below the expected level for their age. Exhibit 4.5 shows parents' reports about whether students who participated in the fourth grade TIMSS 2011 assessment spoke the language of the test before starting school. For students in the fourth grade, 91 percent across countries, on average, spoke the language of the test before starting school. However, the 9 percent who did not speak the language of the test before starting school had lower average science achievement on TIMSS 2011 (460 vs. 500). The results for the sixth grade and benchmarking students show that only about one-fourth (26%) of the students in Botswana spoke the language of the test before starting school, which is the lowest percentage among all entities that participated in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment. In the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment, students themselves reported on how often they speak the language of the test at home. As shown in Exhibit 4.6, for the eighth grade students, on average across countries, 79 percent always or almost always speak the language of the test at home, with 17 percent sometimes speaking it and 4 percent never speaking it. As with the fourth grade, average science achievement was higher for students who frequently speak the language of the test at home (481), compared to those who sometimes (448) or never (424) do so. Among the ninth grade participants, both Botswana and South Africa had very low percentages of students always or almost always speaking the language of the test at home (12% and 26%, respectively). These two countries had the lowest percentages of students speaking the language of the test at home, along with eighth grade participants Ghana (26%) and Tunisia (19%).  * Available only for countries that administered both TIMSS and PIRLS to the same fourth grade students because this item was included in the PIRLS Home Questionnaire completed by parents.

Parents' Educational Expectations for Their Children Studies over the past several years have found a positive relationship between parental aspirations for their children and academic achievement. For example, researchers studying longitudinal effects in the United States found that more communication between parents and students as well as higher parents' aspirations resulted in higher student achievement (Hong & Ho, 2005). Across four ethnic groups, parents' educational aspiration was the most powerful predictor of increasing student educational aspiration; ultimately, the greater the student's own educational expectations, the greater the student's academic achievement. Exhibit 4.7 presents parents' reports about their educational expectations for their children according to four education levels from highest to lowest: postgraduate degree, university degree, post-secondary, and upper secondary (or lower). Results are shown for countries that administered both TIMSS and PIRLS fourth grade assessments to the same fourth grade students. Across the TIMSS 2011 participants, parents have very high educational expectations for their children (to the extent that some parents may have misunderstood the question). Nearly one-third (30%) of the fourth grade students have parents who expect them to attain a postgraduate degree and another third (35%) are expected to graduate from university. Still, there was considerable variation in results across and within countries. Consistent with other research, the results show a positive relationship between parents' aspirations and students' average science achievement. Across the fourth grade countries, students' average science achievement increased with each successively higher level of education expected by their parents, to the extent that there was a 81-point difference between students whose parents expected a postgraduate degree at one end of the continuum and those whose parents expected upper secondary school (or lower) at the other end of the continuum (524 vs. 443). The results for the sixth grade and benchmarking participants were similar to the results at the fourth grade.

Exhibit 4.8 presents students' reports of their educational aspirations from the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment. As shown on the first page and similar to the parents of the fourth grade students, the eighth grade students had high expectations for further education, such that some students also may have misunderstood the question. However, looking at the countries that administered TIMSS and PIRLS to the same students at the fourth grade and also participated at the eighth grade, there was some degree of correspondence between the parents' responses and those by eighth grade students. Almost onethird (29%) of the eighth grade students expect to attain a postgraduate degree and more than one-fourth (27%) expect to graduate from university. Fifteen percent of the eighth grade students indicated that they did not know how far in school they would go. The eighth grade results also show a positive relationship between educational aspirations (in this case those of the students themselves) and average science achievement. Across the eighth grade countries, the students at each higher level of education expectation had higher average science achievement than the level below. Students expecting a postgraduate degree had a 99-point advantage in average achievement compared to those expecting to go no further than upper secondary school, about a full standard deviation on the TIMSS achievement scale (513 vs. 412).

The exhibit presents data on two resource components (More than 100 Books in Their Home as well as both Own Room and Internet Connection in Home) for all participants in the fourth grade TIMSS assessment, as well as data on an additional three resources for countries that participated in both TIMSS and PIRLS with the same students. On average, across all of the countries participating in TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, one-fourth of the students were from homes with more than 100 books in total, and slightly more than half (52%) reported having both their own room and an Internet connection at home. Across the countries participating in both studies at the fourth grade, on average, 30 percent of the students had at least one parent that had earned a university degree and 36 percent had at least one parent in a professional occupation, and the majority of students (58%) had more than 25 children's books at home. Exhibit 4.3 presents the results for the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment for the Home Educational Resources scale, which was created based on students' reports about three of the five types of home resources that comprised the fourth grade Home Resources for Learning scale-number of books in the home, availability of two home study supports, and parents' education. The second page of the exhibit provides detail about the questions forming the scale and the categorization of responses. Students were scored according to the availability of the three home study supports, with Many Resources corresponding to more than 100 books in the home, having both their own room and an Internet connection, and at least one parent having completed university, on average. Few Resources corresponds, on average, to having 25 or fewer books, neither home study support, and neither parent having gone beyond upper secondary school. Countries are ordered by the percentage of students in the Many Resources category, with the eighth grade countries on the first page of the exhibit and the ninth grade and benchmarking participants on the second page. Internationally, on average, two-thirds of the eighth grade students (67%) were assigned to the Some Resources category. On average, twelve percent were in the Many Resources category and 21 percent were in the Few Resources category, with a 116-point difference in their average science achievement (540 vs. 424). Exhibit 4.4 provides supporting detail about the availability of the specific home resources included in the Home Educational Resources scale for the eighth grade assessment.

"}, {"section_title": "Students Attended Preprimary Education", "text": "Preprimary education, in the form of preschool, kindergarten, or an early childhood education program, plays an important role in preparing children for primary school. For example, recent PIRLS assessments have found a positive relationship between years of preprimary education and reading achievement in the fourth grade. Also, recent analyses of longitudinal data in the United States and England found that preschool attendance was positively related to enhanced school performance, and that the duration of attendance was associated with greater academic improvement (Tucker-Drob, 2012;Sammons, et al., 2002). Besides giving students an early start in school and life, there are also broader reasons for countries to invest in preschool (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2012). For example, preprimary education provides an avenue for overcoming children's disadvantages and can help to break the generational repetitive cycle of poverty and low achievement. Although there is considerable variation across countries, according to the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia, some countries already have mandatory preprimary education (e.g., Austria, Hungary, and the Netherlands), some have nearly 100 percent enrollment even though attendance is not mandatory (e.g., Australia, Croatia, and Singapore), and a number of the remaining countries are working to increase enrollment in preprimary education. Of course, school policies of entering primary school at older ages (e.g., age 7 in Finland, Lithuania, and Sweden) permit opportunities for more years of preschool attendance than when children start primary school at younger ages (e.g., age 4 or 5 in England, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Northern Ireland). Exhibit C.1 in Appendix C contains information across countries, about the different policies and practices about the age of entry to primary school. Exhibit 4.9 presents the TIMSS 2011 parents' reports on the number of years their children participated in preprimary education for countries that administered both TIMSS and PIRLS to the same fourth grade students. In addition, for all participants in the fourth grade TIMSS 2011 assessment, the exhibit presents National Research Coordinators' reports of whether or not there was a national preprimary curriculum that includes science skills. It is noted that these preprimary curricula may involve only rudimentary observation and classification skills as well as perhaps experiencing some technology, yet twothirds of the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade countries indicated that their preprimary curriculum made such provision, as did all of the benchmarking participants. None of the three sixth grade countries reported a preprimary curriculum that included science skills. Although attendance in preprimary education differed dramatically from country to country, on average, 43 percent of the fourth grade students had at least three years of preprimary education and another 33 percent had less than three years but more than one year; eleven percent had only one year or less of preprimary education. Students with three years had higher average achievement (505) than their counterparts with less than three but more than one year (497) or one year or less of preprimary education (478). Most notably, however, the 13 percent of students, on average, that did not attend preschool had much lower average science achievement (454). There was a range across countries, but the majority of students did not attend preschool in Azerbaijan (64%) and Saudi Arabia (52%). Also, among the sixth grade participants, the majority of students in Botswana (56%) did not attend preprimary education.

The learning environment of the school can be a positive influence, encouraging a positive attitude toward academic excellence and facilitating classroom instruction. Considerable research has shown that higher levels of school resources are associated with higher achievement. However, the relationship between resources and achievement is complicated. First, a school can have a more socioeconomically advantaged student population, for example, because of its location or because it competes for students. Second, the school system can invest more money into schools for such things as facilities, teachers' salaries, equipment, and materials. It follows that the most successful schools are likely to have more socioeconomically advantaged students and better resources."}, {"section_title": "Schools with Students from Advantaged Home Backgrounds", "text": "The home backgrounds of students attending a school can be closely related to the learning environment, with the two reinforcing each other and being strongly linked to academic achievement. Students from home backgrounds supportive of learning are likely to have more positive attitudes toward learning and, perhaps, even better discipline. Beyond that, parents that have high educational expectations for their children are more likely to take an active interest in the quality of teachers and school facilities."}, {"section_title": "School Location", "text": "Depending on each country's characteristics, a school's location can have a substantial impact on whether the students attending that school typically are from economically and educationally advantaged home backgrounds. Also, depending on the country, the location of the school can provide access to important additional resources (e.g., libraries, media centers, or museums) or mean that the school is relatively isolated. To provide some information about the urbanicity of each school's location, TIMSS 2011 asked principals to describe the population size of the city, town, or area in which their schools were located. For the fourth grade science assessment, Exhibit 5.1 shows the percentages of students together with their average achievement for schools located in cities, towns, or areas of three different population sizes: cities of more than 100,000; cities or towns of 15,001 to 100,000; and small towns, villages, or rural areas of 15,000 or fewer people. Countries are presented in alphabetical order with the fourth grade on the first page of the exhibit, followed by the sixth grade and the benchmarking participants on the second page. On average, across the fourth grade countries, 31 percent of students attended schools in cities with more than 100,000 people, 27 percent attended schools in cities or towns of 15,001 to 100,000, and 42 percent in small towns, villages, or rural areas. In general, the fourth grade students attending schools in the largest cities had the highest average science achievement (497), followed by students in medium sized cities (484), and then those in smaller towns and rural areas (475). While this pattern held for the majority of the countries in the fourth grade assessment, there were also other patterns. In some countries, students attending schools in medium sized cities of 15,001 to 100,000 had higher average achievement than students in schools in larger cities, or there was not much difference in average achievement between the two. There were also a number of countries where average science achievement was highest among students attending schools in small towns or rural areas. The countries that assessed TIMSS 2011 in the sixth grade had relatively large percentages of students (64-77%) attending schools small towns or rural areas, and these students had lower average science achievement than students in schools in large or medium sized cities. Exhibit 5.2 shows principals' reports about school location for the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment, with percentages of students and average achievement for the eighth grade countries on the first page and results for the ninth grade and benchmarking participants on the second page. Compared to the fourth grade assessment, the results indicated a slight shift away from small towns and rural areas into large cities. For the eighth grade assessment, 37 percent of students were attending schools in cities with more than 100,000 people, 28 percent attended schools in cities or towns of 15,001 to 100,000, and 35 percent in small towns, villages, or rural areas. On average across countries, science achievement differences among students attending the three types of schools were somewhat more pronounced than at the fourth grade, with average achievement highest in the big-city schools (492), next highest in schools in medium sized cities (473), and lowest in schools in rural areas or small towns (463). As with the fourth grade, this pattern did not hold in all countries and there was considerable variation. School Composition by Student Background Ever since the Coleman report (Coleman, et al., 1966), researchers have recognized that the compositional characteristics of a school's student body can affect student achievement, and specifically that students from disadvantaged backgrounds typically have higher achievement if they attend schools in which the majority of students are from advantaged backgrounds. To provide information on this topic, TIMSS routinely asks school principals to report on two demographic characteristics of their schools: Economic home background; and Language home background. Previous assessments have found both to be strongly related to average science achievement. For example, in TIMSS 2007 the science achievement of students attending schools with a higher proportion of economically advantaged students was higher than for those attending schools with large proportions of disadvantaged students. Also, science achievement was highest for students in schools where most students spoke the language of the TIMSS assessment as their first language, and was progressively lower as percentages of students not having the TIMSS language as their first language increased. Exhibit 5.3 presents, for participants in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment, principals' economic categorizations of their schools according to three categories that are fully described on the second page of the exhibit. To summarize, the More Affluent schools had more than one-fourth of their students from affluent home backgrounds and not more than one-fourth from disadvantaged home backgrounds, and the More Disadvantaged schools had the reverse situation. The other schools were \"in between. \" Across the fourth grade countries, students were distributed relatively equally across three types of schools. On average, across countries at the fourth grade, 36 percent of the students attended schools with relatively more affluent students than disadvantaged students, and students in these schools had the highest average achievement (505). At the other end of the range, 30 percent of the students attended schools with relatively more disadvantaged students than affluent students, and students in these schools had the lowest average achievement (463). Although this overall achievement pattern was observed in most countries and benchmarking participants, there was a wide variation among participants in the percentages of students attending the three different economic categories of schools. Exhibit 5.4 presents the results for school composition by student economic background for participants in the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment. Similar to the fourth grade assessment, internationally students were distributed relatively equally across three categories of schools, with 32 percent of the eighth grade students attending schools with relatively more affluent than disadvantaged students and 36 percent attending schools with relatively more disadvantaged than affluent students. Again, the percentages of students in each school category varied considerably across countries. Also similar to the fourth grade assessment, average science achievement was highest among the eighth grade students attending schools with relatively more affluent students than disadvantaged students (501), and lowest among students attending schools with relatively more disadvantaged students (458). Exhibit 5.5 presents, for participants in the fourth grade assessment, principals' reports of the percentage of students in their schools who had the language of the TIMSS 2011 test as their native language. Approximately threefourths of the fourth grade students (73%) were in schools where almost all students (more than 90%) spoke the language of the TIMSS test as their native language, 15 percent were in schools where the majority of students (51-90%) were native speakers of the TIMSS test language, and 13 percent were in schools where half the students (or less) spoke the language of the test as their native language. Among countries participating at the sixth grade, Botswana was notable for having almost all students (92%) in schools in which 50 percent or fewer of students had the language of the TIMSS test as their native language. On average across the fourth grade countries, science achievement was highest among students in schools where almost all students had the language of the TIMSS test as their native language (488). Achievement was next highest in schools where 51-90% of students had the language of the TIMSS test as their native language (477), and was lowest in schools where half the students or less had the language of the TIMSS test as their native language (457). Among countries participating at the sixth grade, Botswana was notable for having almost all students (92%) in schools with half or less native speakers. Exhibit 5.6 presents, for participants in the eighth grade assessment, principals' reports of the percentage of students in their schools who had the language of the TIMSS 2011 test as their native language.

The extent and quality of school resources can have an important impact on the quality of classroom instruction."}, {"section_title": "School Resources", "text": "TIMSS collects information on the extent to which school resources are available to support science instruction by asking school principals about the degree of shortages or inadequacies in general school resources (materials, supplies, heating/cooling/lighting, buildings, space, staff, and computers) as well as about resources specifically targeted to support science instruction (specialized teachers, science equipment and materials, computer software, library materials, audio-visual resources, and calculators). Although \"adequacy\" can be relative, in each previous TIMSS assessment there has been a strong positive relationship between principals' perceptions of the absence of school resource shortages and average science achievement. Exhibit 5.7 presents the results for the Science Resources Shortages scale for participants in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment. Students were scored according to their principals' responses concerning twelve school and classroom resources (see the second page of the exhibit for details). Countries are ordered according to the percentage of students (from most to least) in schools Not Affected by resource shortages. Schools in this category had principals who reported that shortages affected instruction \"not at all\" for six of the twelve resources and only \"a little\" for the other six, on average. There was substantial variation across the fourth grade countries-from 0 to 63 percent, with an average of 22 percent of students attending well-resourced schools. Students in schools where instruction was Affected A Lot had principals who reported that shortages affected instruction \"a lot\" for six of the twelve resources and \"some\" for the other six, on average. All other students attended schools where instruction was Somewhat Affected by resource shortages. Countries are ordered according to the percentage of students (from highest to lowest) in schools Not Affected by resource shortages. Only two countries (Korea and Slovenia) had more than 50 percent of their students in schools Not Affected by resource shortages; a large majority of countries and benchmarking participants had more than 50 percent of their students in schools that were Somewhat Affected by resource shortages. Only eight of the 50 fourth grade countries and one benchmarking participant had more than 15 percent of their students in schools that were Affected a Lot. On average across countries, students in schools that were Affected a Lot by science resource shortages had lower science achievement (460 points) than students in schools that were Not Affected (495) or Somewhat Affected (485). Exhibit 5.8 presents the results for the Science Resource Shortages scale for participants in the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade assessment. As shown on the second page of the exhibit, the eighth grade scale was based on principals' responses concerning 13 school and classroom resources. The results were similar to the fourth grade results, with wide variation across countries in the percentage of eighth grade students attending schools that were Not Affected by resource shortages (1-64%), and only three countries having more than 50 percent of their students in such schools (Singapore, Slovenia, and Korea). Again, a large majority of countries and benchmarking participants had more than 50 percent of their students in schools that were Somewhat Affected by resource shortages, and only four of the 42 eighth grade countries and one benchmarking participant had more than 15 percent of their students in schools that were Affected a Lot. Also as at fourth grade, on average across countries, students in schools that were Affected a Lot by science resource shortages had lower science achievement (464) than students in schools that were Not Affected (494) or Somewhat Affected (474).

All other students attended schools where instruction was Somewhat Affected by resource shortages.   Teacher Working Conditions There is evidence that, in some countries, teacher shortages may exist partly as a result of poor working conditions. For example, a review of research from the United States suggests that teachers who leave the profession after just a few years are more likely to leave because of poor working conditions than because of low pay (Johnson, 2006). Although teachers' reports across countries are related to their expectations and need to be considered in the context of variations in economic situations, TIMSS 2011 asked the students' teachers to provide their views on the adequacy of their working conditions. More specifically, teachers were asked about five potential problem areas:\nStudents were scored according to their principals' responses characterizing five aspects on the School Emphasis on Academic Success scale. Students in schools where their principals reported a Very High Emphasis on academic success had a score on the scale of at least 13.1, which corresponds to their principals characterizing three of the five aspects as \"very high\" and the other two as \"high, \" on average. Students in schools with a Medium Emphasis on academic success had a score no higher than 8.9, which corresponds to their principals characterizing three of the five aspects as \"medium\" and the other two as \"high, \" on average.

Teachers with Moderate Problems reported \"moderate problem\" for three of five conditions and \"minor problem\" for the other two, on average. All other students had teachers that reported Minor Problems with their working conditions. About half of the students, on average, across the fourth grade countries were in schools where teachers had Minor Problems and about one-fourth were in schools with Moderate Problems. Students whose teachers reported Moderate Problems had somewhat lower science achievement, on average, than those whose teachers reported Minor Problems, and those students in turn had lower achievement than students whose teachers reported Hardly Any Problems (481, 487, and 494, respectively).

Exhibit 5.12 presents principals' reports about the existence and size of school libraries for participants in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment. In considering these results, it is important to realize that, because of variation in policies across countries regarding school libraries and classroom libraries, some countries have well-resourced classroom libraries rather than a larger central library, so the lack of a school library does not necessarily mean that children do not have access to a variety of books. Also, primary schools tend to be smaller than middle and secondary schools, and may have small libraries as a result of their small enrollments.\nStudents were scored according to their teachers' responses characterizing five aspects on the School Emphasis on Academic Success scale.

For example, a review of evaluation studies of computer use in US primary and secondary schools since 1990 found that computer tutorials in natural and social science classes have a strong record of effectiveness, and that simulation programs sometimes improve the effectiveness of science teaching, although the evidence is less definitive (Kulik, 2003). Exhibit 5.13 shows principals' reports about the availability of computers for instruction for participants in the TIMSS fourth grade assessment. Internationally, 38 percent of the fourth grade students, on average, were in schools that had 1 computer for every 1-2 fourth grade students, 30 percent were in schools with 1 computer for every 3-5 fourth grade students, and 24 percent were in schools with 1 computer for 6 or more students. There was considerable variation from country to country, with the highest computer-tostudent ratio in England (90% of students in schools with 1 computer for every 1-2 fourth grade students) and the lowest in Iran, Tunisia, and Yemen (7% or fewer students in such schools). On average, however, only 8 percent of the fourth grade students were in schools that did not have any computers available for instruction. The percentages of students in schools with no computers for instruction were higher for the sixth grade participants. The relationship between computer availability and average science achievement is difficult to interpret because it is highly interrelated with socio-economic levels and instructional practices. In the primary grades, computer instruction can be used for remedial purposes as frequently (if not more frequently) because it can provide an increased variety of stimulating and challenging activities. However, the fourth grade students with access to computers for instruction had higher average science achievement than those students with no access to computers for instruction. Exhibit 5.14 provides principals' reports about the availability of computers for instruction for participants in the TIMSS eighth grade assessment.

Information was collected from both students' principals and teachers, with the respective responses used to create scales. Exhibit 6.1 shows the principals' reports on the School Emphasis on Academic Success scale for the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment. As might be anticipated, principals had very positive attitudes about the emphasis on academics in their schools, so the three regions of the scale have been described as Very High, High, and Medium. Students were scored according to their principals' characterization of their school in terms of the five aspects. Students in schools with Very High Emphasis on academic success had principals characterizing three of the five aspects as \"very high\" and the other two as \"high,\" on average. Students in Medium Emphasis schools had principals characterizing three of the five aspects as \"medium\" and the other two as \"high, \" on average.

TIMSS 2011 used research conducted in the Netherlands (ten Bruggencate, Luyten, Scheerens, & Sleegers, 2012) to develop questions about principals' leadership styles. In both the fourth and eighth grade assessments, principals were presented a list of nine leadership activities and asked to indicate on which activities they spent \"a lot of time. \" Exhibit 6.5 presents principals' reports from the fourth grade assessment about the various activities on which they spend \"a lot of time. \" The pattern of varying reports from country to country can be observed among the fourth grade countries, sixth grade countries, and benchmarking participants. The first four activities about which principals were asked focused on school educational goals. On average across fourth grade countries, more than half of the students were in schools where promoting educational goals and developing educational goals occupied \"a lot\" of the principal's time (59% and 60%, respectively). Also, more than half of the fourth grade students had principals who spent \"a lot of time\" monitoring whether teachers implemented educational goals and monitoring students' progress to ensure goals are reached (53% and 57%, respectively). Principals also were asked about maintaining school discipline. Over two-thirds of students (68%) were in schools in which the principal spent \"a lot of time\" keeping an orderly atmosphere in the school and 44 percent had principals that spent \"a lot of time\" addressing disruptive student behavior. Exhibit 6.5 also shows that three other leadership activities were reported less frequently as occupying \"a lot\" of principals' time: advising teachers, initiating projects or improvements, and participating in professional development for principals. Exhibit 6.6 summarizes principals' reports from the eighth grade assessment about time spent on leadership activities. As at the fourth grade, reports vary considerably from country to country; however, summary results indicate that about two-thirds of the eighth grade students were in schools where the principal reported spending \"a lot of time\" promoting and developing the school's educational goals and monitoring whether those goals were implemented by teachers and achieved by students. Three-fourths of the eighth grade students were in schools where the principal devoted \"a lot of time\" to keeping an orderly atmosphere and more than half had principals that spent \"a lot of time\" addressing disruptive student behavior.

There is increasing research showing that a safe school environment is important for students' academic achievement.

It seems that safety at school can no longer be taken for granted, even at the fourth grade. TIMSS 2011 developed the Safe and Orderly School scale to provide information on the extent to which school safety might be related to science achievement. In both the fourth and eighth grade assessments, students' teachers were asked about the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with five statements: This school is located in a safe neighborhood; I feel safe at this school; This school's security policies and practices are sufficient; The students behave in an orderly manner; and The students are respectful of the teachers. Exhibit 6.7 presents the results for the Safe and Orderly School scale for the fourth grade assessment. Students were scored according to their teachers' degree of agreement with the five statements. Students in Safe and Orderly schools had teachers that \"agreed a lot\" with three of the five qualities and \"agreed a little\" with the other two, on average. Students in Not Safe and Orderly schools had teachers that \"disagreed a little\" with three of the five statements and \"agreed a little\" with the other two, on average. All other students attended Somewhat Safe and Orderly schools. There was substantial variation across countries, but on average across the fourth grade countries, the majority of students (53%) were attending Safe and Orderly schools. Almost all of the remaining students (43%) were in schools judged to be Somewhat Safe and Orderly. Only a small percentage of students (4%, on average) were in schools judged Not Safe and Orderly. On average across the fourth grade countries, the safer the school as reported by their teachers, the higher the students' average science achievement, with a 44-point difference between the average achievement of students at Safe and Orderly schools and that of students at Not Safe and Orderly schools (493 vs. 449). Exhibit 6.8 presents the corresponding Safe and Orderly School scale results for the eighth grade assessment. Students were assigned to one of the three school orderliness categories using the same criteria as at the fourth grade, and with broadly similar results.

There were similar percentages of students in schools with Moderate Problems at the fourth and eighth grades (11% and 13%). Further examination of the principals' reports of each of the discipline and safety problems indicates that the increase in the percentage of students attending schools with Moderate Problems and Minor Problems is largely because eight of these problems (classroom disturbance, cheating, profanity, vandalism, theft, intimidation or verbal abuse among students, students fighting, and intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers) often were \"not a problem\" at the fourth grade schools but were more often a \"minor problem\" at the eighth grade schools. Similar to fourth grade, the eighth grade students whose principals reported Moderate Problems in their schools had substantially lower science achievement, by 40 points on average, than those students whose principals reported Hardly Any Problems.

There is growing evidence that bullying in schools is on the rise, especially with the emergence of cyber-bullying, and that bullying does have a negative impact on students' educational achievement. To provide data about bullying in the participating countries, TIMSS 2011 created the Students Bullied at School scale, based on how often students experienced six bullying behaviors: I was made fun of or called names; I was left out of games or activities by other students; Someone spread lies about me; Something was stolen from me; I was hit or hurt by other student(s); and I was made to do things I didn't want to do by other students. Exhibit 6.11 provides the results for the Students Bullied at School scale for the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment. Students were scored according to their responses to how often they experienced six bullying behaviors (detailed on the second page of the exhibit). Students bullied Almost Never reported \"never\" experiencing three of six bullying behaviors and each of the other three behaviors \"a few times a year,\" on average. Students bullied About Weekly experienced each of three of the six behaviors \"once or twice a month\" and each of the other three \"a few times a year.\" All other students were bullied About Monthly. On average across the fourth grade countries, 48 percent of the students Almost Never experienced these bullying behaviors; across countries the percentages ranged from 17 to 80 percent. The majority of the fourth grade students reported being bullied either About Monthly or About Weekly. Internationally, on average across the fourth grade countries, 32 percent of the students were reportedly bullied About Monthly and 20 percent were bullied About Weekly. The fourth grade students' reports about being bullied were related to their average science achievement on TIMSS 2011. Each successive category of increased bullying was related to a decrease in average science achievement; there was a 33-point difference in achievement between students who were Almost Never bullied and those who were bullied About Weekly (497 vs. 464).

For example, students may indeed value science very highly and yet not agree that they \"need biology to learn other school subjects\" (question 2 on the scale), or that they \"need to do well in earth science to get the job I want\" (question on the scale). As a result, the Students Value Science scale may underestimate the extent to which students in separate science countries actually value science, and inflate the percentage of students in the Do Not Value category. This may somewhat explain the absence of relationship with science achievement in chemistry and physics and the anomalous finding of higher average science achievement among students who Do Not Value biology and earth science compared to those who do value these subjects.\nThe general/integrated science panel summarizes responses for countries where students are enrolled in science as a single subject.

In view of the importance of a well prepared teaching force to an effective education system, TIMSS 2011 collected a range of information about teacher education. In the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia, each country chapter describes the educational route to teacher certification, including any additional requirements such as passing an examination or completing an induction year. Each encyclopedia chapter also addresses the requirements and practices for ongoing teacher professional development. Chapter 7 in this report provides information about teachers' education, experience, professional development, and satisfaction with their teaching careers."}, {"section_title": "Science Teachers' Formal Education", "text": "There is growing evidence that teacher preparation is a powerful predictor of students' achievement, perhaps even overcoming socioeconomic and language background factors (Darling-Hammond, 2000). Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2 present teachers' reports about their highest level of formal education for the TIMSS 2011 fourth and eighth grade assessments, respectively. On average across the fourth grade countries, 23 percent of the students had science teachers with a postgraduate university degree, 57 percent had teachers with a bachelor's degree, 15 percent had teachers who had completed post-secondary education (usually a three-year teacher education program), and six percent had teachers with an upper secondary education. However, it is clear from examining the country-by-country results across the fourth grade, sixth grade, and benchmarking participants that different countries have different educational paths for becoming a primary level teacher. Similar results are shown in Exhibit 7.2 for the eighth grade students, although more students than at the fourth grade had teachers with bachelor's (63% vs. 57%) and postgraduate university degrees (27% vs. 23%)."}, {"section_title": "Teachers Majoring in Education and Science", "text": "In addition to the importance of a college or university degree or advanced degree, the literature reports widespread agreement that teachers should have solid mastery of the content in the subject to be taught. For example, in a review of teacher quality research, Rice (2003) examined the relationship between teachers' advanced degrees and student achievement and found a positive relationship between subject-specific advanced degrees and student achievement in mathematics and in science. Exhibit 7.3 shows the percentages of students in the TIMSS 2011 fourth grade assessment whose teachers had a major or specialization in primary education and if they also had a major or specialization in science. Similar to the situation with formal education, there was a great deal of variation across countries in the degree of specialization by primary school teachers in science education. On average across the fourth grade countries, 25 percent of the students were taught science by a teacher with a major in both primary education and science, and almost half by a teacher with a major in primary education but not in science. Just 11 percent of the fourth grade students were taught science by a teacher with a major in science but not in primary education, and another 13 percent by a teacher with some other major. In several countries, one-third or more of the fourth grade and sixth grade students had science teachers without university degrees (Italy, Honduras, Morocco, Romania, Tunisia, and Yemen). However, as explained in the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia, countries have been implementing new policies that increase their teacher education requirements. Science achievement was highest, on average, among students taught by teachers with a primary education major but not a science major (489), followed by students taught by a teacher with both majors (482), and then students taught by a teacher with some other major (479). Among the fourth grade students whose teachers had college degrees, average achievement was lowest among students taught by a teacher with a major in science but not in primary education (462). As shown in Exhibit 7.4, the situation for science teachers of eighth grade students was somewhat different. The majority of eighth grade students were taught science by teachers who had a major in science but not in science education (51%), or who had a major in both (28%). There were only small differences in average science achievement associated with the majors of the students' teachers; students taught by teachers with a major in science and science education had somewhat higher achievement (480) than the 11 percent of students taught by teachers majoring in science education but not science (470).

Teachers' Years of Experience It is difficult to examine the effects of teacher experience on student achievement, because sometimes more experienced teachers are assigned to students of higher ability and with fewer discipline problems, and other times the more experienced teachers are assigned to the lower-achieving students in need of more help. However, some research has addressed this selection bias problem; and experience can have a large positive impact primarily in the first few years of teaching, although the benefits can continue beyond the first five years of a teacher's career (Harris & Sass, 2011;Leigh, 2010). Exhibit 7.5 presents teachers' reports about their years of experience for participants in the TIMSS fourth grade assessment. On average across the fourth grade countries, teachers of science had been teaching for an average of 17 years. Forty percent of the students, on average, had teachers with 20 years or more of experience, and another 30 percent had teachers with at least 10 (but less than 20) years of experience. On average across countries, science achievement was highest for students whose teachers had 20 or more years of experience (494), compared to those whose teachers had between 10 and 20 years of experience (485), between 5 and 10 years of experience (483), or less than five years of experience (482)."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 7.4: Teachers Majored in Education and Science", "text": "Exhibit 7.6 shows science teachers' reports from the eighth grade assessment about their years of experience.

Also, the relationship between teacher experience and average student achievement was less pronounced among the eighth grade students. On average across countries, achievement was highest for students whose teachers had 20 or more years of experience or between 10 and 20 years of experience (480 in each case), compared to students whose teachers had between 5 and 10 years of experience (475), or less than five years of experience (471)."}, {"section_title": "Teachers' Professional Development", "text": "Evidence from recent meta-analyses of research conducted in the United States shows that teacher professional development focused on science content has a significant positive effect on student achievement (Blank & de las Alas, 2009) and that the amount of professional development (more than 14 hours) was an important factor (Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, & Shapley, 2007). Exhibit 7.7 presents, for the fourth grade TIMSS assessment, teachers' reports about areas of professional development in science in which they had participated in the past two years. Although there was considerable variation across countries, the most common areas of science professional development for teachers of fourth grade students were science content (35%), science pedagogy and instruction (34%), and science curriculum (34%). On average, about one-third of students had teachers who had professional development in each of these three areas. Integrating information technology into science and science assessment were somewhat less common areas of professional development, with 28 percent and 27 percent of students, respectively, taught by teachers who had professional development in these areas in the past two years. As shown in Exhibit 7.8, science teachers of students in the TIMSS eighth grade assessment reported somewhat higher levels of participation in science professional development than teachers of the fourth grade students. On average across the eighth grade countries, the majority of students were taught by science teachers who had participated in professional development in science pedagogy and instruction (58%), science content (55%), or science curriculum (53%) in the past two years.

Teachers' Preparation to Teach the TIMSS Science Topics Although a sound knowledge of science would seem to be a prerequisite for effective science teaching, evidence directly linking teacher preparation in science to the achievement of their students is scarce. A meta-analysis of the effects of teachers' subject matter preparation on their students' achievement in mathematics and science found some studies showing a positive effect, but in general results were mixed (Wilson, Floden, & Ferrini-Mundi, 2002). TIMSS 2011 gathered information from the teachers of students taking the assessment about whether they felt very well prepared, somewhat prepared, or not well prepared to teach the science content topics assessed by TIMSS. Exhibit 7.9 presents reports of teachers about their level of preparation to teach the science topics in the fourth grade assessment. The 20 science topics are shown on the second page of the exhibit, grouped by content domain (life science, physical science, and earth science). The exhibit presents for each participant the percentage of students taught by teachers who felt \"very well\" prepared to teach the TIMSS topics. The results are averaged across all 20 topics for a perspective on science overall, as well as separately by content domain: six topics in life science, eight topics in physical science, and six topics in earth science. On average across the fourth grade countries, 62 percent of students were taught by teachers who felt very well prepared to teach the TIMSS science topics. Across the content domains, a larger percentage of students had teachers who felt very well prepared to teach the life science topics (70%) than the physical science topics (62%) and the earth science topics (53%). However, these results varied considerably across countries; for example, in several countries larger percentages of students were taught by teachers who felt very well prepared to teach the physical science topics than the topics in the other two domains. Exhibit 7.10 presents reports of teachers about their level of preparation to teach the science topics in the four content domains covered by the eighth grade assessment. The 20 topics are shown on the second page of the exhibit, grouped by content domain (biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science). Compared to the fourth grade, a larger percentage of eighth grade students (72%) were taught by teachers who felt very well prepared to teach the TIMSS science topics. Across the content domains, most students had teachers who felt very well prepared to teach biology topics (77%), chemistry topics (82%), and physics topics (78%); however, fewer than half of the students (47%) had teachers who felt well prepared to teach the earth science topics.

Students were scored according to their teachers' responses, with Very Confident teachers being \"very confident\" in using three of the five instructional strategies and \"somewhat confident\" in using the other two, on average. All other teachers were considered to be Somewhat Confident. On average across countries, the majority of fourth grade students (59%) had teachers who were Very Confident in teaching science to the class; however, there was no significant difference between the average science achievement of these students (487) and that of the 41 percent of students whose teachers were only Somewhat Confident (485). There was considerable variation across countries, with the percentage of students having teachers who were Very Confident ranging from 14 to 95 percent. Exhibit 7.12 provides further information about the components of the Confidence in Teaching Science scale by showing the percentage of students whose teachers reported feeling \"very confident\" in using each of the five instructional strategies. On average across the fourth grade countries, teachers were most often very confident about helping students appreciate the value of learning science (68% of students taught by such teachers), adapting their teaching to engage student interests (63%), and answering student questions about science (62%). Teachers were less often very confident about explaining science concepts or principles by doing science experiments (51% of students) and providing challenging tasks for capable students (43%). Exhibit 7.13 shows results for the Confidence in Teaching Science scale for the eighth grade TIMSS assessment. On average across countries, a larger percentage of students had teachers who were Very Confident (73%) than at fourth grade, and unlike fourth grade, students who had teachers who were Very Confident had higher achievement (479) than did students who had teachers who were Somewhat Confident (467). Again, there was considerable variation among countries, with the percentage of students with Very Confident teachers ranging from 33 to 99 percent. Exhibit 7.14 provides information about the components of the Confidence in Teaching Science scale for the eighth grade assessment. Patterns of teacher confidence differed from those at fourth grade-on average across countries, teachers were most often very confident about answering student questions about science (81% of students taught by such teachers), explaining science concepts or principles by doing science experiments (72%), and helping students appreciate the value of science (70%). Teachers were less often very confident about adapting their teaching to engage student interests (65% of students) and providing challenging tasks for capable students (57%).

Teachers' Career Satisfaction Teachers who are satisfied with their profession and the working conditions at their school are more motivated to teach and prepare their instruction. Further, having teachers that can provide leadership is a dimension of teacher quality. However, developing master teachers requires retention in the profession. Teachers need to be committed to the profession and like it enough to continue teaching. It may be that some subject areas and locales would benefit from policies to reduce teacher attrition in order to improve student achievement (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2009). Exhibit 7.15 shows the fourth grade TIMSS assessment results for the TIMSS 2011 Teacher Career Satisfaction scale, based on how much teachers agreed with each of the following six statements: I am content with my profession as a teacher; I am satisfied with being a teacher at this school; I had more enthusiasm when I began teaching than I have now (reverse coded); I do important work as a teacher; I plan to continue as a teacher for as long as I can; and, I am frustrated as a teacher (reverse coded). Students were scored according to their teachers responses, with Satisfied teachers \"agreeing a lot\" with three of the six statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other three, on average. Internationally, on average, the majority of fourth grade students (54%) had teachers Satisfied with their careers. Another 41 percent of the students, on average, had teachers that reported being Somewhat Satisfied (mostly agreed \"a little\" instead of \"a lot\"). Despite the fact that satisfaction could be relative, and dependent on the teaching situation, very few fourth grade students had science teachers that expressed any dissatisfaction except in a small number of countries. On average across countries, at the fourth grade, science achievement was higher for students of Satisfied teachers (490) than for students of Somewhat Satisfied (483) or Less Than Satisfied Teachers (483), though this varied considerably from country to country. In particular, it is noteworthy that several of the highest-performing countries in science at the fourth grade-Singapore, Japan, and Korea-had among the lowest percentages of students taught by Satisfied teachers. As shown in Exhibit 7.16, on average across countries, the eighth grade science teachers reported somewhat lower levels of career satisfaction than the fourth grade teachers, with 47 percent of students taught by Satisfied teachers (compared to 54% at the fourth grade). However, taken together, almost all of the eighth grade students (92%) were taught science by teachers who were Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied with their careers. Similar to the fourth grade results, on average across countries, the eighth grade students taught by Satisfied teachers had higher science achievement (481) than those taught by Somewhat Satisfied 474 Students were scored according to their teachers' degree of agreement with six statements on the Teacher Career Satisfaction scale. Students with Satisfied teachers had a score on the scale of at least 10.1, which corresponds to their teachers \"agreeing a lot\" with three of the six statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other three, on average. Students with Less Than Satisfied teachers had a score no higher than 6.6, which corresponds to their teachers \"disagreeing a little\" with three of the six statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other three, on average.

Internationally, by the eighth grade, fewer students like learning science and feel confident in their abilities (compared to the fourth grade). In countries teaching science as separate subjects, students like learning chemistry and physics less than biology and earth science, and are less confident in their abilities in them. Engaging instruction, good nutrition, and enough sleep were related to higher achievement. However, by the eighth grade, only one-quarter of the students reported being engaged in their science lessons, and nearly as many reported being not engaged. Also, in the majority of eighth grade classrooms, instruction was limited because students were suffering from lack of sleep. This chapter considers the learning environment of the classroom itself, because classroom instruction is at the core of student learning. Previous chapters of this report have described how teaching effectiveness can be greatly influenced by students' home and school environments as well as by teachers' preparation. However, even though the curricular policies and school resources often set the tone for accomplishment, students' day-to-day classroom activities are likely to have a considerable direct impact on their science learning. TIMSS routinely presents very powerful evidence showing that within countries students with more positive attitudes toward science have substantially higher achievement, and the results from TIMSS 2011 are consistent with previous assessments. In addition to being motivated to learn, students need the opportunity to learn. Thus, this chapter also provides information about the instructional time devoted to science and the approaches teachers use to engage students in learning. It is difficult, however, for teachers to engage students in learning if students do not have the prerequisite skills or are too sleep deprived or disruptive to pay attention. Finally, an effective classroom environment for science learning involves using a variety of instructional approaches, capitalizing on technology, and at the eighth grade, extending instruction with homework and regularly assessing student progress."}, {"section_title": "Students' Attitudes Toward Science", "text": "Each successive TIMSS assessment has shown a strong positive relationship within countries between student attitudes toward science and their science achievement. Additionally, there is extensive research showing that students with more positive attitudes toward mathematics and science have higher average achievement in mathematics and science. For example, a recent meta-analysis of student attitudes toward school found that attitudes toward mathematics or science were related to mathematics and science achievement across 288 studies (Hattie, 2009). While positive attitudes and high achievement in science go hand in hand, it should be understood that the relationship is bidirectional, with attitudes and achievement mutually influencing each other. Students who are good at science also are more likely to enjoy learning science. Much research about students' attitudes toward learning has studied the complex phenomenon of motivation. For example, students' motivation to learn can be affected by whether they find the subject enjoyable and place value on the subject. In addition, students' motivation can be affected by their selfconfidence in learning the subject. TIMSS 2011 included scales about three motivational constructs: intrinsic value (interest), utility value, and ability beliefs. Essentially, intrinsic motivation refers to doing an activity because it is interesting or enjoyable, and the Students Like Learning Science scale was developed to measure students' interest in and liking of learning science. In contrast, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a desirable outcome. There are many types of external motivation from teacher praise, to good grades, to being accepted to a good university, to having a successful career and daily life. In particular, the TIMSS 2011 Students Value Science scale addresses students' attitudes about the importance of the subject and usefulness of the subject, sometimes called attainment value and utility value (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). Finally, motivation to learn includes having the feeling that you can succeed. The Student Confidence with Science scale assesses students' self-confidence or self-concept in their ability to learn science. A strong self-concept encourages students to engage with the instruction and show persistence, effort, and attentiveness."}, {"section_title": "Students Like Learning Science", "text": "Exhibit 8.1 presents the fourth grade results for the TIMSS 2011 Students Like Learning Science scale.

Exhibit 8.2 presents the corresponding results for the eighth grade on the Students Like Learning Science scale. Because 16 of the TIMSS countries teach science subjects separately (i.e., biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science) at the eighth grade rather than as a general or integrated subject, TIMSS asked students in these countries about their liking for the individual science subjects and the results were scaled separately for each subject. The first page of Exhibit 8.2 presents the results for general or integrated science for the eighth grade countries, and also for the ninth grade and benchmarking participants, as all of these teach science as a general or integrated subject. The second and third pages of the exhibit present the results for biology (second page) and chemistry, physics, and earth science (third page) in separate panels.

At the eighth grade, about one-third (35%) of the students, internationally, on average, Like Learning Science (compared to 53% at the fourth grade), and about one-fifth (21%) Do Not Like Learning Science. Accompanying the decrease from the fourth to eighth grades in liking learning science is a widening achievement gap between students who like learning science (515, on average) and those who do not (450). It is noticeable that some of the highest performing countries have the smallest percentages of students reporting positive attitudes toward learning science, such as Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Korea. The tendency of smaller percentages of students in some East Asian countries to report positive attitudes is consistent with previous TIMSS assessments. The relatively low percentages of students liking learning science may partially result from the high level of difficulty of the science being studied, and also these countries have a cultural tradition of serious attitudes toward learning. Across countries teaching the sciences as separate subjects, the average percentages of students liking learning biology and earth science (36% and 33%, respectively) were similar to the percentage liking general or integrated science, but fewer students reported liking learning chemistry (25%) and physics (26%).

In addition, the relationship between instructional time and student achievement is highly dependent on the effectiveness of the educational system. If an education system essentially is ineffective, increasing the amount of instruction time will have diminishing returns. Also, most countries implement levels of instructional time across their systems so that any variation is unintended and rarely related to achievement. Despite the difficulties in studying its effects, instructional time remains a crucial resource in considering students' opportunity to learn. If everything else about schooling was equal and of high quality, more instructional time should result in increased student learning. For example, a recent study published by the London School of Economics used data from PISA 2006 and from 10-and 13-year-olds in Israel to compare achievement estimates for the same students across curriculum subjects, and found that instructional time has a positive and significant effect on achievement (Lavy, 2010). Exhibits 8.6 and 8.7 present principals' and teachers' reports about the instructional hours per year spent on science instruction, respectively, at the fourth and eighth grades. The results for the time spent on science instruction were based on a series of calculations. As explained on the second page of the exhibits, principals provided the number of school days per year and the number of instructional hours per day. This information was combined to provide the yearly total number of instructional hours in each country shown in the first column of the exhibit. There was substantial variation across countries, but the fourth grade students in the TIMSS 2011 countries averaged about 900 hours per year of instruction, while those in the eighth grade averaged about 1,000 hours. Teachers reported the weekly amount of instruction in science. This information was combined with the data provided by principals to estimate yearly amounts of instructional time in science for each TIMSS 2011 participant (second column in the exhibits). On average, the fourth grade countries reported devoting 85 hours per year to science instruction, although the amount of instructional time varied widely across the fourth grade, sixth grade, and benchmarking participants, from a low of 39 to a high of 162 hours.  An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70% but less than 85% of the students. An \"s\" indicates data are available for at least 50% but less than 70% of the students.  An \"r\" indicates data are available for at least 70% but less than 85% of the students. An \"s\" indicates data are available for at least 50% but less than 70% of the students. An \"x\" indicates data are available for less than 50% of students. Instructional time for science was much greater at the eighth grade, with the eighth grade countries devoting an average of 158 hours to science instruction, and there was greater variability across countries, from 64 to 334 hours. The large increase in science instructional time compared to the fourth grade was mainly the result of the greater attention given to science instruction in the separate science countries. For these countries, the number of hours reported for each of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science is shown on the second page of Exhibit 8.7. The separate science countries devote 54 to 59 hours per year, on average, to each science subject, for an overall average of 225 hours of science instruction per year. It should be noted that the variation across countries in science instructional time at both the fourth and eighth grades (including the sixth and ninth grades, respectively, and the benchmarking participants) is due to countries spending different amounts of time on total schooling, and allocating different amounts of the total time to science instruction, and in different ways. Finally, it should be understood that providing time for instruction is a necessary but not sufficient condition for student learning; the time allocated for instruction is a resource that needs to be used effectively, and efficiently."}, {"section_title": "Students Taught the TIMSS Science Topics", "text": "The science content and topic areas assessed in TIMSS 2011 are elaborated in the Science Framework, with each topic area for the fourth and eighth grades presented as comprehensive lists of objectives.

Exhibit 8.8 presents teachers' reports about the TIMSS science topics that actually had been taught to students in fourth grade classrooms either prior to or during the year of the assessment. The exhibit shows, for each TIMSS participant, the percentage of students whose teachers reported that the students had been taught each of the topics, averaged across all science topics and across all topics within each science content domain. The topics are shown on the second page of the exhibit. At the fourth grade, teachers were asked about a total of 20 topics: six in life science, eight in physical science, and six in earth science. At the fourth grade, according to their teachers, 64 percent of students, on average, had been taught the TIMSS science topics overall. There was considerable variation across countries, from 93 percent in Kuwait to 38 percent in Japan. On average, the percentage of students taught various topics was highest for life science (75%), next highest for earth science (63%), and lowest for physical science (57%).

At the eighth grade, on average, 72 percent of students had been taught the science topics overall. Teachers' reports about the degree of implementation ranged from 98 percent in Macedonia to 39 percent in Norway. Chemistry had the greatest degree of coverage, with 81 percent of students having been taught the chemistry topics at the eighth grade, followed by physics, with 75 percent of students taught the topics. The coverage for biology and earth science was similar, with 68 percent of the students being taught the topics in each of those two content areas. It should be emphasized that there was considerable variation across participants in relative coverage of the topics in the content domains. National Research Coordinators were asked to indicate whether each of the TIMSS 2011 science topics was included in their countries' intended curriculum through the fourth or eighth grade, and if so, whether the topics were intended to be taught to \"all or almost all students\" or \"only the more able students.\" The results for the fourth and eighth grades are summarized in Exhibits 8.10 and 8.11. On average, across countries, the majority of the assessment topics were intended for all students-14 out of 20 at the fourth grade, and 17 out of 20 at the eighth grade. At the fourth grade, the results varied topic by topic and country by country. However, of the six life science topics, on average, five were included in the curriculum for all students and one was not included; of the eight physical science topics, five were included and two were not; and of the six earth science topics, four were included and two were not.

Collaborate to Improve Teaching Part of creating a school learning environment focused on academic success involves a staff that collaborates on curricular activities. For example, a study including a comprehensive theoretical review and a meta-analysis of studies about professional communities indicated a small but positive effect of professional communities on student achievement (Lomos, Roelande, & Bosker, 2011). Because teacher collaboration with colleagues is important in building a professional community, TIMSS 2011 included the Collaborate to Improve Teaching scale. Although the idea of teacher collegiality and collaboration can involve a variety of theoretical perspectives and terms, the TIMSS 2011 scale was designed to focus on the idea of collaboration for the purpose of improving teaching. Therefore, the scale was based on how often teachers interacted with other teachers regarding each of five areas: Discuss how to teach a particular topic; Collaborate in planning and preparing instructional materials; Share what I have learned about my teaching experiences; Visit another classroom to learn more about teaching; and Work together to try out new ideas. Students were scored according to their teachers responses, with Very Collaborative teachers having interactions with other teachers at least \"one to three times per week\" in each of three of the five areas and \"two or three times per month\" in each of the other two, on average. Exhibit 8.12 presents the results for the fourth grade. In general, most science teachers of fourth grade students reported a high degree of collaboration with other teachers with the goal of improving teaching and learning. Internationally, on average, about one-third of the fourth grade students (35%) had Very Collaborative teachers. Another 53 percent of students, on average, had teachers that reported being Collaborative (e.g., interacting two or three times a month for all areas).

Typically, teachers are asked to report how frequently they use various instruction activities and strategies, and such information can be very useful. However, in light of the growing body of evidence about the complexities of teaching and learning, researchers are beginning to understand these lists of activities cannot be used as proxies for the characteristics of good teaching. To help build a better bridge between curriculum and instruction, TIMSS 2011 collected information about the concept of student content engagement as described by McLaughlin, McGrath, Burian-Fitzgerald, Lanahan, Scotchmer, Enyeart, and Salganik (2005). According to this work, supported by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics, student content engagement focuses on the importance of the activity that brings the student and the subject matter content together. Engagement refers to the cognitive interaction between the student and instructional content, and may take the form of listening to the teacher or providing an explanation of a problem solution. It is the student's in-the-moment cognitive interaction with instructional content. To measure aspects of student content engagement, TIMSS 2011 developed both a teacher scale, called the Engaging Students in Learning scale, and a student scale called the Engaged in Science Lessons scale. Exhibit 8.14 presents the fourth grade results for the Engaging Students in Learning scale. The scale contains six items related to teachers' instructional practices intended to interest students and reinforce learning: Summarizing the lesson's learning goals; Relating the lesson to students' daily lives; Questioning to elicit reasons and explanations; Encouraging students to show improvement; Praising students for good effort; and Bringing interesting materials to class. Students were categorized according to their teachers' responses, with Most Lessons corresponding to teachers who used three of the six practices in \"every or almost every lesson\" and the other three in \"about half the lessons, \" on average. Many fourth grade students, 71 percent on average, internationally, had teachers that made efforts to engage them in instruction by using a variety of strategies in Most Lessons, and most of the remaining students had teachers that used engaging instructional practices in About Half the Lessons (with a few exceptions). Although the fourth grade students whose teachers used engaging instruction in Most Lessons had somewhat higher average science achievement than other students, the pattern varied considerably across the fourth grade, sixth grade, and benchmarking participants. Exhibit 8.15 presents the eighth grade results based on a somewhat shorter Engaging Students in Learning scale. At the eighth grade, two items were removed from the scale because relatively small percentages of students had teachers that frequently related lessons to students' daily lives, and even smaller percentages had teachers that routinely brought interesting materials to class (see Exhibit 8.16). Perhaps eighth grade teachers should make greater efforts to make science relevant to students' daily lives and provide interesting materials, especially in light of the drop by the eighth grade in students' liking science learning. On the other hand, teachers in some of the highest achieving countries reported the least use of these instructional practices.   enterpoint of scale set at 10.

Students were scored according to their teachers' responses to how often they used each of four instructional practices on the Engaging Students in Learning scale. Students with teachers who used engagement practices in Most Lessons had a score on the scale of at least 8.7, which corresponds to their teachers using two of the four practices \"every or almost every lesson\" and using the other two in \"about half the lessons, \" on average. Students with teachers who used engagement practices in Some Lessons had a score no higher than 5.7, which corresponds to their teachers using two of the four practices in \"some lessons\" and using the other two in \"about half the lessons, \" on average.

Across the eighth grade, ninth grade, and benchmarking participants, students often had somewhat higher average science achievement if their teachers used engaging instruction in Most Lessons rather than About Half the Lessons. Exhibits 8.17 and 8.18 present the results for the TIMSS 2011 Engaged in Science Lessons scale that looks at engagement from the student perspective. This scale asks how much students agree with the following five statements: Students considered to be Engaged had a score on the scale corresponding to \"agreeing a lot\" with at least three of the statements and \"agreeing a little\" with the other two, on average. Being in the Not Engaged category was based on a scale score corresponding to, at most, \"agreeing a little\" with no more than two statements and \"disagreeing a little\" with the other three, on average. All other students were considered to be Somewhat Engaged. At the fourth grade, internationally, on average, 45 percent of students reported being Engaged during their science lessons, another 47 percent reported being Somewhat Engaged, and only 8 percent reported being Not Engaged. Across the fourth grade, sixth grade, and benchmarking participants, there was a positive relationship between students' reports about being more engaged and average science achievement. Engaged students had higher achievement than their counterparts who reported being only Somewhat Engaged, and students Not Engaged had the lowest achievement (504 vs. 476 and 457, respectively). At the eighth grade, internationally, on average, smaller percentages of students than at the fourth grade reported being engaged in their science lessons. In countries teaching general or integrated science, only 29 percent of the eighth grade students, on average, reported being Engaged during their science lessons. The majority (51%) reported being Somewhat Engaged and 21 percent reported being Not Engaged. For the general or integrated science countries, there was a direct relationship between student engagement and average science achievement-the more engaged students reported being, the higher their average science achievement; and this held across the eighth grade, ninth grade, and across benchmarking participants. Among the separate science subject countries, students reported somewhat more engagement in biology and earth science lessons (33% and 31% Engaged, respectively) than in chemistry and physics lessons (26% and 27% Engaged, respectively). In each of the science subjects, students reporting being engaged in their lessons had higher science achievement than those who were only somewhat or not engaged.

To begin, students need the prerequisite science skills before they can make gains in achievement. Because prior knowledge guides learning, effective science teachers assess students' knowledge, skills, and conceptual understanding, and link new ideas, skills, and competencies to prior understandings. Lack of prerequisite knowledge and skills are psychological barriers to further science learning, because it is well known that students' new learning depends on that prior knowledge: \"Every new thing that a person learns must be attached to what the person already knows\" (McLaughlin et al., 2005, p. 5). Exhibit 8.19 presents teachers' reports at the fourth grade about whether their science instruction was limited by students lacking prerequisite knowledge or skills. On average, internationally, 28 percent of the fourth grade students were in classes where students had the necessary prerequisite skills for science instruction to proceed according to teachers' plans, and 60 percent were in classes where instruction was limited to some extent. It is consistent with teachers' reports that the students in classes where instruction was progressing unimpeded had higher average science achievement than did their counterparts in classes where instruction was limited to some extent (501 vs. 485). Also consistent with teachers' reports, average science achievement was substantially lower (460) for the fourth grade students in classrooms where instruction was limited \"a lot\" because students lacked the prerequisite knowledge or skills. This overall pattern also was evidenced at the sixth grade and for the benchmarking participants. Exhibit 8.20 presents teachers' reports at the eighth grade about whether their science instruction was limited by students lacking prerequisite knowledge or skills. On average, internationally, just 20 percent of the eighth grade students were in classes where students had the necessary prerequisite skills for science instruction to proceed according to teachers' plans. According to their teachers, 61 percent were in classes where instruction was limited to some extent and 19 percent in classes where instruction was limited \"a lot.\" As students progress through school, the curriculum becomes increasingly advanced and, not surprisingly, greater percentages of students fall behind, which typically results in some differentiation in instruction for different groups of students. Especially, taking into account some type of tailored curriculum and instruction for groups of students, it is distressing that, according to their teachers, relatively few students at the eighth grade are receiving the full instructional benefit that could be provided. Eighth grade students in classes where instruction was not limited had higher average science achievement than did their counterparts in classes where instruction was limited to some extent (496 vs. 478).

Unfortunately, some children in many countries around the world suffer from hunger, and a growing body of research, mostly in developing countries, is providing evidence that malnutrition has a negative impact on educational achievement. Similarly, a number of studies in a variety of countries have shown sleep duration and quality to be related to academic functioning at school. For example, a Dutch researcher found that chronic sleep reduction can affect school achievement directly and indirectly via motivation and engagement (Meijer, 2008). Exhibit 8.21 presents teachers' reports at the fourth grade about the degree to which their science instruction was limited by students' lack of nutrition or not having enough sleep. On average, internationally, 71 percent of the fourth grade students were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited because students were lacking in basic nutrition. These fourth grade students had higher average science achievement than their peers in classrooms where instruction was limited \"some\" or \"a lot\" due to lack of basic nutrition (493 vs. 467). It is of considerable concern that 29 percent of the fourth grade students, on average, were reported to be suffering from lack of basic nutrition; and this percentage is much higher in some countries, including those that participated at the sixth grade. Teachers reported that 54 percent of the fourth grade students, on average, were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited by students suffering from not enough sleep. However, it is unfortunate that 46 percent, on average, were in classrooms where instruction was limited \"some\" or \"a lot\" by students suffering from lack of sleep. The achievement gap for sleep deprivation was somewhat less than that related to lack of nutrition, but the fourth grade students suffering from some amount of sleep deprivation did have lower average science achievement than their more alert counterparts (by 11 points on average). Again, there was considerable variation across countries in teachers' reports about the percentages of fourth grade students suffering from not enough sleep. According to their teachers, in a number of TIMSS 2011 countries and benchmarking participants, the majority of students were at least somewhat sleep deprived. Exhibit 8.22 presents the eighth grade teachers' reports about the degree to which their instruction was limited by students' lack of nutrition or not having enough sleep. On average, internationally, 64 percent of the eighth grade students were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited because students were lacking in basic nutrition. These eighth grade students had higher average science achievement than their peers in classrooms where instruction was limited \"some\" or \"a lot\" due to lack of basic nutrition (485 vs. 461). More than one-third (36%) of the eighth grade students, on average, were reported to be suffering from lack of basic nutrition; and this percentage was much higher in some countries, including those that participated at the ninth grade. Teachers reported that 42 percent of the eighth grade students, on average, were in classrooms where instruction was \"not at all\" limited by students suffering from not enough sleep. However, again, it is a matter of considerable concern that the majority of eighth grade students (58%), on average, were in classrooms where instruction was limited \"some\" or \"a lot\" by students suffering from lack of sleep. Similar to the results at fourth grade, the achievement gap for sleep deprivation was somewhat less than that related to lack of nutrition, but the eighth grade students suffering from some amount of sleep deprivation did have lower average science achievement than their counterparts (by 11 points). Again, there was considerable variation across countries in teachers' reports about the percentages of eighth grade students suffering from not enough sleep. According to their teachers, however, in a number of TIMSS 2011 countries and benchmarking participants, as much as two-thirds of students were at least somewhat sleep deprived.

For example, the most recent recommendations for effective instructional practices of the US National Research Council include an emphasis on inquiry activities (National Research Council, 2011). A recent meta-analysis across 138 studies indicated that using some level of inquirybased instruction had a positive relationship with student understanding and retention of science content. In particular, instruction emphasizing active thinking and drawing conclusions from data or providing hands-on experience with scientific phenomena were associated with increased likelihood of scientific understanding (Minner, Levy, & Century, 2009). Previous TIMSS studies have presented teachers' reports about the frequency with which they engaged in a range of inquiry-related activities. TIMSS 2011 takes this approach further, using IRT scales to summarize teacher reports at the fourth and eighth grades. The Emphasize Science Investigation scale at the fourth grade is based on teacher reports of how often, in teaching science, teachers ask students to engage in the following six activities: Exhibit 8.27 presents the results for the fourth grade assessment. Students were categorized according to their teachers' responses, with About Half the Lessons or More corresponding to teachers who used all six activities in \"about half the lessons, \" on average. All other students had teachers who emphasized science investigation in Less than Half the Lessons. As shown in the exhibit, teachers of science at the fourth grade vary widely across countries in their use of inquiry activities, with the percentage of students taught by teachers emphasizing science investigation in About Half the Lessons or More ranging from 4 percent in Norway to 80 to 86 percent in Iran and Tunisia. On average across the fourth grade countries, 40 percent of students were taught by teachers emphasizing science investigation in half tof he lessons or more, and 60 percent had teachers emphasizing investigation less frequently. This pattern was similar among the sixth grade and benchmarking participants. There was no relationship between emphasis on science investigation and average science achievement. Exhibit 8.28 presents the results for the eighth grade on the Emphasize Science Investigation scale, which includes the six instructional activities from the fourth grade scale and one additional activity more suited to eighth grade students: \"Use scientific formulas and laws to solve routine problems. \" Compared to the fourth grade, there was greater use of investigation in science instruction, with almost half of the students (48%) taught by teachers emphasizing investigation in About Half the Lessons or More. Although on average across countries, science achievement was somewhat higher among students whose teachers more frequently emphasize inquiry activities (479 vs. 474), both the frequency of inquiry activity use and its relationship with science achievement varied considerably across the eighth grade, ninth grade, and benchmarking participants.

Computer Activities During Science Lessons According to the TIMSS 2011 Encyclopedia, countries are investing in technology as a way to enhance teaching and learning. Availability of computers and other technology in the science classroom can facilitate successful implementation of the curriculum. For example, as described in the Contextual Framework chapter of the TIMSS 2011 Assessment Frameworks, computers and the Internet provide students ways to explore concepts in-depth, trigger enthusiasm and motivation for learning, enable students to learn at their own pace, and provide students with access to vast information sources. Besides giving students access to the Internet, computers can serve a number of other educational purposes. While initially limited to learning drills and practice, they are now used in a variety of ways including tutorials, simulations, games, and applications. New software enables students to pose their own problems and explore and discover mathematics and scientific properties on their own. Computer software for modeling and visualization of ideas can open a whole new world to students and help them connect these ideas to their language and symbol systems. A recent study summarizing 25 metaanalyses determined that computer use in the classroom has a significant positive effect on achievement at all grade levels and in all subjects (Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami, & Schmidt, 2011). Exhibit 8.29 contains teachers' reports about the prevalence and types of computer-based activities used as part of science instruction at fourth grade. The range of computer availability across countries was very large, from 7 percent of the students in Iran to 85 percent in New Zealand. Internationally, on average, less than half (47%) of the fourth grade students had computers available during their science lessons. Average science achievement was equivalent between those fourth grade students with computers available and those without computers available. Teachers reported that 24 to 25 percent of the fourth grade students, on average, were asked to use a computer at least monthly to do scientific procedures or experiments or to study natural phenomena through simulations. Somewhat larger percentages were asked to use a computer at least monthly to look up ideas and information (41%) and to practice skills and procedures (31%). The range in computer availability across the benchmarking participants reflected the fourth grade results across countries. However, the students participating at the sixth grade had less access to computers for science instruction than did the fourth grade TIMSS students, on average. At the eighth grade, reports about computer availability and use were similar to those at the fourth grade (see Exhibit 8.30). Internationally, on average, less than half (46%) of the eighth grade students had computers available during their science lessons, ranging from 12 percent in Ghana to 84 percent in Kazakhstan. Students with computers available during their lessons had slightly higher science achievement than students without computers available. Approximately one-third (28-39%) of the eighth grade students, on average, were asked to do the following on at least a monthly basis: look up ideas and information, do scientific procedures or experiments, study natural phenomena through simulations, process and analyze data, and practice skills and procedures. As would be anticipated, computer use in science lessons varied considerably across countries at the eighth grade, as well as for the benchmarking participants. Countries participating at the ninth grade had less computer availability, including South Africa, Botswana, and Honduras.

TIMSS has consistently shown that the amount of homework assigned for mathematics and science varies both within and across countries. In some situations, homework is assigned typically to students who need it the most to keep up to their classmates. In other situations, students receive homework for practice or as an enrichment exercise. Because of the different approaches and policies associated with assigning homework, it generally shows mixed results in relation to average student achievement. The eighth grade students in TIMSS were asked how often their teacher gives homework in science (or biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science for separate science countries) and how much time they usually spend on it when it is given. Weekly time on science homework was estimated by multiplying the frequency of assignment by the amount of time spent. Exhibit 8.31 presents the results, with countries ordered by the percentage of students reporting they spent 3 hours or more per week. However, spending as much time as this on science homework was relatively rare. Among countries teaching science as general or integrated subject, the range was from a high of 11 percent of students in Malaysia to 1 percent in England and Korea and to zero in Japan. It should be mentioned that although students in several of the high-performing East Asian countries report relatively small amounts of homework, many of them attend special tutoring schools. On average, internationally, only 5 percent of the eighth grade students reported doing as much as 3 hours of science homework per week, and these students had the lowest average science achievement. The majority of students (67%) reported doing 45 minutes or less of weekly science homework, and a further 29 percent reported doing more than 45 minutes but less than 3 hours-these students had the highest average science achievement. Both Botswana and South Africa at the ninth grade had relatively high percentages of students reporting 3 hours of science homework per week, although the percentages for benchmarking participants were more comparable to the international averages at eighth grade. For each of the four science subjects, eighth grade students in separate science countries reported about the same amount of homework as students in general or integrated science countries reported for science overall.
