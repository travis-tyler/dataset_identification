[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Key words: magnetic resonance imaging atrophy morphometry normality aging sex\nProper normative data of anatomical measurements of cortical regions, allowing to quantify brain abnormalities, are lacking. We developed norms for regional cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes based on cross-sectional MRI scans from 2713 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years using 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. Models predicting regional cortical estimates of each hemisphere were produced using age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The explained variance for the left/right cortex was 76%/76% for surface area, 43%/42% for thickness, and 80%/80% for volume. The mean explained variance for all regions was 41% for surface areas, 27% for thicknesses, and 46% for volumes. Age, sex and eTIV predicted most of the explained variance for surface areas and volumes while age was the main predictors for thicknesses. Scanner characteristics generally predicted a limited amount of variance, but this effect was stronger for thicknesses than surface areas and volumes. For new individuals, estimates of their expected surface area, thickness and volume based on their characteristics and the scanner characteristics can be obtained using the derived formulas, as well as Z score effect sizes denoting the extent of the deviation from the normative sample.

However, one difficulty to determine whether an individual displays significant cortical variations of potential pathological origin is the lack of proper normative values, allowing to quantify the extent of the deviation from the normality of a given individual, adjusted for personal characteristics. Indeed, cortical measures are substantially influenced by various factors including sociodemographic factors, such as age and sex (Fjell et al., 2009; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Sowell et al., 2007; Storsve et al., 2014; Thambisetty et al., 2010; Walhovd et al., 2011) as well as total intracranial volume (Barnes et al., 2010; Crivello et al., 2014) .\nVery few attempts have been proposed to produce neuromorphometric normative values (Kruggel, 2006; Walhovd et al., 2011) , stemming from the fact that three major hurdles needed to be overcome. The first is the requirement to use automated segmentation procedures, in order for measurements to be replicable. The second is to use a large sample of individuals, since sufficient representability is needed over a wide age range. The third is the necessity to incorporate data from multiple scanner configurations in order to allow the normative values to be usable for most researchers, as these characteristics (e.g. manufacturer and magnetic field strength) have an effect on the measurements (Govindarajan et al., 2014; Han et al., 2006; Kruggel et al., 2010; Potvin et al., 2016b) .

Moreover, for PPMI, additional exclusions were made for participants with a Geriatric Depression Scale (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986 ) score of more than 5 (inclusion criterion used in the ADNI and AIBL databases). All original images were visually inspected and four participants were discarded because of evident abnormalities. Five participants with extreme eTIV values were also excluded (Z scores higher than 3.29, p < .001). In order to have similar age means between manufacturer and MFS strata, 30 participants of 65 years or older were randomly selected and removed from the GE 1.5T strata. The final sample included 2713 individuals aged between 18 and 94 years (mean: 47.6, SD: 21.7), with a similar proportion of men (n=1361) and women (n=1352). More than half of the scans were acquired using Siemens (n=1550), a third using Philips (n=787), and 14% using GE (n=376) units. Fifty-five percent of the images were obtained using 3T MFS (n=1482). Most of the datasets also had information regarding handedness (78%), race (63%), and education (58%). Based on the available data, the vast majority of the normative sample was right-handed (92%), Caucasian (82%; African 10%; Asian 7%), and had completed high school (95%).

This validation sample was not used to build the models predicting normative values.\nWe also validated the normative values using clinical samples of individuals with SZ (n=72; Age: 38.2 \u00b1 13.9, range 18-65; 19% female) from the COBRE dataset and mild AD (n=50 Age: 72.7 \u00b1 7.7, range 56-87; 44% female) randomly selected from the ADNI-2 dataset.

"}, {"section_title": "Segmentation", "text": "Cortical segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer (version 5.3), a widely used and freely available automated processing pipeline that quantifies brain anatomy (http://freesurfer.net). All raw T1-weighted images were processed using the \"recon-all -all\" pipeline with the default set of parameters (no flag options were used). We used the regional cortical surface areas (white surface area), thicknesses, and volumes comprised in the aparc.stats output files, which is the parcellation produced by the default atlas (Desikan-Killiany or DK; Desikan et al., 2006) . Freesurfer was running on an Ubuntu Server 12. 04 LTS platform on a Dell PowerEdge R910 computer with four Intel Xeon E7-4870 2.4 GHz.\nThe technical details of FreeSurfer's procedures are described in prior publications. Briefly, this processing includes motion correction (Reuter et al., 2010) , removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure , automated Talairach transformation, intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998) , tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction (Fischl et al., 2001; Segonne et al., 2007) , and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class (Dale et al., 1999; Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl and Dale, 2000) . Once the cortical models are complete, a number of deformable procedures can be performed for further data processing and analysis including surface inflation (Fischl et al., 1999a) , registration to a spherical atlas which is based on individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl et al., 1999b) and parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure (Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2004) . This method uses both intensity and continuity information from the entire three dimensional MR volume in segmentation and deformation procedures to produce representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface (Fischl and Dale, 2000) . The maps are created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and are therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. Procedures for the measurement of cortical thickness have been validated against histological analysis (Rosas et al., 2002) and manual measurements (Kuperberg et al., 2003; Salat et al., 2004) .\nIn addition, FreeSurfer uses a model-driven approach, matching the new image to a template of manually segmented training set images. Each voxel is then labeled based on the probabilistic information given by the image matching procedure. All structures defined in the a priori segmentation are therefore represented in the new image.\nEstimated intracranial volume (eTIV; Buckner et al., 2004) was taken from the aseg.stats Freesurfer output file. To assure the validity of outermost eTIV values, we verified the registration of the 5% lowest and highest values. Visual inspection of each brain segmentation was conducted using FreeView (http://freesurfer.net) by scrolling the entire brain at least through the coronal and axial planes. For each cortical region, the criterion for failed segmentation was inadequate inclusion (e.g. dura mater, ventricle) or omission of approximately 100 voxels or more. The mean percentage of exclusion across regions was 1.8% (SD: 2.5). For analyses on the whole left and right cortical hemispheres, participants with a segmentation error on any of the regions were excluded, resulting in 2073 and 2068 participants, respectively.\nWe verified the generalizability of the surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes produced by FreeSurfer by quantifying the influence of a different hardware setup on these measures (Xubuntu 12.04 on VirtualBox 4.3.10 installed on an iMac 10GB 1067 MHz DDR3 with 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 and OS X Yosemite 10.10.4). These measures were compared with those generated by the setup used to produce normative values on a random subset of the normative sample (n=50)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Surface area, thickness, and volume prediction Statistical analyses are based on our previously published study on normative data for subcortical regions (Potvin et al., 2016b) . Linear regression models predicting cortical measures were built using age, sex, eTIV, MFS, and scanner manufacturer as predictors. Quadratic and cubic terms for age and eTIV were tested, as well as the following interactions: age X sex, eTIV X MFS, MFS X manufacturer, and eTIV X manufacturer. To avoid overfitting and maximize generalizability of the predictions, the best predictive model was determined with a 10-fold cross-validation (Hastie et al., 2008) backward elimination procedure, retaining the model with the subset of predictors that produced the lowest predicted residual sum of squares using SAS 9.4 PROC GLMSELECT (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). For each selected final model, the fit of the data was assessed using R 2 (one minus the regression sum of squares divided by the total sum) and individual predictors' weight was measured by semi-partial eta squares (squared semi-partial correlations). In order to exclude potential abnormalities and produce valid predictive model for each brain subdivision, outliers with surface area/thickness/volume Z scores higher than 3.29 (p < .001) were excluded. Depending on the region, between 0 and 33 outliers out of 2713 were excluded."}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "In addition to the cross-validation procedure, the predictions of the models were validated using the independent validation sample of healthy controls by first calculating a validation R 2 (squared correlation between observed and predicted measures). Then, we tested the mean difference between observed and predicted cortical measures using independent two-sample t-tests (since predicted values are not produced using the observed measure and thus, observed and predicted measures are not correlated) with Bonferroni correction. We then examined the validity of the normative values to show expected patterns of normality deviations using the Z score effect sizes (described below) in the validation samples of healthy individuals and of individuals with AD and SZ.\nFinally, with the available data (see Table 2 ), we assessed the influence of voxel size and plane acquisition on cortical surface, thickness and volume by adding these variables to the final models. We also assessed the impact of a different computer hardware setup on the cortical measures generated by FreeSurfer using dependent onesample t-tests with Bonferroni correction.\n"}, {"section_title": "Normative statistics", "text": "Z score effect sizes (Z OP ) were obtained by subtracting the Observed value from the Predicted value divided by the root mean square error (also called residual standard deviation or standard error of estimate) of the model predicting normative values (Crawford et al., 2012) .

Furthermore, based on work from Crawford and colleagues (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2006; Crawford et al., 2012) , we also provide as Supplementary material a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet producing various normative statistics for an individual, including prediction intervals, single case significance test of value abnormality, effect size and estimated percentage of the normative population with a smaller surface area, thickness or volume. Single case significance test of value abnormality was computed by the formula below, a t-statistic with N -k (number of predictors) \u22121 degrees of freedom using the difference between actual (Y 0 ) and predicted (\u0176) values, divided by the standard error of the predicted value where S Y\u2022X represents the root mean square error of the model predicting normative values, r ii identifies offdiagonal elements of the inverted correlation matrix for the k predictor variables, r ij identifies elements in the main diagonal, and z 0 = (z i0 , \u2026, z k0 ) identifies the patient's scores on the predictor variables in Z score form (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2006) .\nThis procedure also yields an unbiased point estimate of the value abnormality that can be supplemented with confidence intervals following a non-central t-distribution (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Prediction of cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes Fig. 1 displays the explained variance (R 2 ) for the whole left and right cortical hemispheres.

Fig. 2 illustrates the effects related to the participants' characteristics using standardized predicted values. For all figures, fits were standardized according to the standard deviation of the true values. Age and eTIV had similar effects for surface area and volume, which were relatively linear. Surface area and volume decreased by approximately one and two standard deviations (SD) from 18 to 96 years, respectively. In opposition, the reduction of cortical thickness according to age was non-linear as it became more pronounced after the 6 th decade of life and dropped by more than three SDs across adulthood. In contrast to surface area and volume results, eTIV had little effect on cortical thickness. Men had clearly larger bilateral surface area and volume than women (approximately 1SD), but thickness was similar. Fig. 3 shows the standardized fitted values for the effects related to the scanner. The strongest effects were for cortical thickness, followed by volume.

Fig. 4 illustrates the R 2 related to each predictor according to each cortical region measure. In general, age was the best predictor for most regional thicknesses and volumes while eTIV was the best predictor for most regional surface areas. Figs. 5 to 8 illustrate the age effects on cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes for each region. The effect of age was heterogeneous across regions. For example, unlike most regions, many temporal regions showed that thickness slightly increased between the second and fifth decade of age before decreasing. Indeed, for thickness in these temporal regions (e.g. entorhinal and temporal pole), age had little R 2 ( < 2%), indicating minor predictive value compared to other regions (overall mean: 21%).\nTogether, scanner characteristics (manufacturer, MFS, and their interaction) generally predicted a limited amount of variance, but their effects were stronger for thickness (mean: 7%, range: 1-25%) than surface area (mean: 1%, range: 0-4%) and volume (mean: 3%, range: 0-10%)."}, {"section_title": "Healthy controls", "text": "For the whole cortical hemispheres, the generalization of the models was satisfactory as shown by the mean difference between validation and original R 2 (Left/Right): 1.0%/\u22121.6% for surface area, 12.5%/10.4% for thickness, and 2.5%/2.4% for volume (positive values meaning that the prediction in the independent sample was better than in the sample used to build the model).

Neuroimaging lags in this respect, as normative values are nearly nonexistent. The present study is an attempt to continue to fill this methodological gap by developing normative data for regional cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes in healthy adults according to age, sex, eTIV, and scanner MFS and manufacturer. The results clearly show that age, sex, and eTIV have major influences on these cortical measures and need to be taken into account to assess deviations from the mean of healthy adults. The models predicting normative values were validated in an independent sample of healthy adults and analyses in individuals with SZ and mild AD confirmed the ability of the normative values to detect morphometric normality deviations.\nUse of the normative data.\nIn order to properly use the normative data, the user must produce morphometric measures with FreeSurfer 5.3 with default parameters, that is, \"recon-all -all\" without any flag option. Within the manuscript we provide formulas in order to compute expected surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes according to an individual's characteristics alongside those of the scanner being used, as well as Z scores indicating the effect size of the deviation from the normative sample. We have included as Supplementary materials a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet able to compute Z scores for an individual, as well as various statistics including single case significance test of volume abnormality and estimated percentage of the normative population with a smaller volume. In addition, we provide a python script producing normative Z scores for multiple participants using the default cortical atlas (Desikan-Killiany), but also able to use other parcellation protocols including Desikan-Killiany-Tourville, Ex vivo and subcortical atlases (Potvin et al., 2016b and 10. Individuals with SZ and mild AD showed Z OP score deviations in regional cortical measures that were expected (Bakkour et al., 2009; Dickerson et al., 2009; Haijma et al., 2013; Sabuncu et al., 2011; Vita et al., 2012) . For SZ, deviations from the normative sample were observed in several regions with the highest effect sizes being mainly in frontal and lateral temporal areas. For mild AD, deviations from the normative sample were also noticed in many regions, but were especially prominent for the medial temporal, temporopolar and lateral temporal cortices, and inferior parietal cortex. Z OP effect size can also be particularly valuable for case-control study in order to evaluate how well the morphometric measures of a control group compare with the normative values. Indeed, small control groups are unlikely to be representative of the healthy adult population and it might result in overestimating or underestimating case-control differences.\nOne should note that model fit strongly varies according to brain regions and measures. Therefore, the higher the model R 2 is, the more sensitive the normative Z score or Z OP is likely to detect normality deviation compared to the raw value (surface area/thickness/volume) because its denominator (RMSE) will be smaller. Conversely, models with low R 2 will likely result in abnormality detection closer to what would be obtained using raw values since their denominator are high. "}, {"section_title": "Effect of age", "text": "Despite the fact that the predictors selection procedure retained quadratic and cubic age terms for better predictions in most regions, age plots show that age effects for surface area and volume were essentially linear, but for thickness, the measure generally appears to decrease at a higher rate when age was above 60 years old. Our results seem similar to that of other groups (McKay et al., 2014; Storsve et al., 2014) . For example, the non-linear relationships of age on thickness replicate results from McKay et al. with a sizable (N=1010) sample (McKay et al., 2014) , which showed quadratic effects in most cortical regions for thickness, but not for surface area. Moreover, unlike most regions, the thickness of the entorhinal cortex and temporal pole were nearly flat or slightly increased until the fifth decade of life before slightly declining. Similar results were also observed in another study using a large (N=1660) sample (Hasan et al., 2016) , but other results from adults of similar age (23-87 years old) showed a relatively stable thickness before declining after the sixth decade of life (Storsve et al., 2014) . Indeed, the impact of age on the thickness of the entorhinal cortex and temporal pole was minimal (R 2 < 5%) unlike nearly all other regions in our study. This makes sense with results from a twin study suggesting that the entorhinal cortex was one of the regions that was most highly influenced by environmental factors in terms of surface area and thickness (Panizzon et al., 2009 ). "}, {"section_title": "Differences between men and women", "text": "Many studies using various methodologies attempted to measure differences between men and women in terms of cortical volume (Fjell et al., 2009; Jancke et al., 2015; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Pintzka et al., 2015; Sowell et al., 2007) and thickness (Fjell et al., 2009; Govindarajan et al., 2014; Luders et al., 2006; McKay et al., 2014; Sowell et al., 2007) , generally focusing on the whole cortex. For cortical volume, the conclusions of these studies were that the effect of sex disappeared or was minor (with men having larger cortical volumes) when taking into account head compartment volume. For example, one study using a large sample reported that men had significant larger cerebral cortex volumes than women after removing the variance explained by eTIV with a difference in terms of standardized residuals of approximately 0.2 (Fjell et al., 2009) . For cortical thickness, the conclusions are inconsistent between studies. Fjell et al. (2009) , as well as others (Govindarajan et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2014) , reported no significant cortical thickness differences between men and women, but other results in well matched young adults indicated thicker cortex in women compared to men in most cortical areas (Luders et al., 2006) while another study using a wide age range (7 to 87 years old) observed the same effect, but specifically in the inferior parietal, lateral temporal, and inferior frontal regions (Sowell et al., 2007) . However, these discrepancies are likely to be related to differences in segmentation techniques since the former studies (Fjell et al., 2009; Govindarajan et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2014) used FreeSurfer while the latter studies (Luders et al., 2006; Sowell et al., 2007) used in-house algorithms.\nUnlike these previous studies, our approach allowed for a systematic comparison of the respective weight (R 2 ) of each predictors' effect on cortical morphometric measures. Our results on whole hemispheres indicated that sex had a greater effect on cortical surface area than age, nearly no effect on cortical thickness, and a smaller, but substantial, effect on cortical volume compared to age and eTIV. Despite methodological differences, this corroborates to some extent previous findings showing that compared to women, men have somewhat larger cortical volumes (Fjell et al., 2009) due to differences in terms of cortical surface area (McKay et al., 2014) rather than cortical thickness. Furthermore, in terms of regional measures, our models showed that men had generally larger regional surface areas and volumes than women, but women had thicker cortex compared to men in most areas. However, the magnitude of the sex effects for cortical thickness were negligible (R 2 < 2%), in line with previous studies who reported minimal or no sex effect on cortical thickness (Fjell et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2014) . In line with previous reports using large samples, we did not observe substantial age by sex interactions (R 2 < 1%), indicating that the morphometric changes through aging is equivalent between men and women (Fjell et al., 2009; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Sowell et al., 2007 ; see also Thambisetty et al., 2010) . Magnetic field strength and scanner manufacturer Similar to our previous results on subcortical regions (Potvin et al., 2016b) , MFS and manufacturer had limited effects on cortical measures compared to age, sex and eTIV. The influence of these factors on surface areas and volumes was generally minimal, but was more important for thickness, which could be substantially influenced by MFS depending on the region (R 2 range 0 to 16%). Our results agree with previous reports (Govindarajan et al., 2014) which state that 1.5T MFS generally yields thinner cortex than 3T for most areas, but with some exceptions (e.g. cuneus, pericalcarine, frontal poles), with increased thickness at 1.5T compared to 3T. The influence of MFS is not surprising since cortical thickness relies on identification of white matter and pial surface areas and higher MFS results in better white/gray matter contrast (Kruggel et al., 2010) , which in turn is likely to improve accuracy of detecting these boundaries."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The sample used in the present study was recruited using a nonprobability sampling method and is therefore not necessarily representative of the healthy adult-population. In fact, it included healthy participants that volunteered for research studies involving MRI in academic-led environments. Based on the available characteristics, the participants were mainly right-handed Caucasians with at least a high school degree. Nevertheless, the sample was one of the largest used in such studies (nearly 3000 participants), encompassing 23 subsamples provided by 21 independent research groups, including participants from various countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and USA), as well as images originating from three scanner manufacturers at either 1.5T or 3T. Such an amalgam of data is likely to be more representative and yield more robust normative values than results produced within restricted geographical regions and using specific scanner characteristics. Indeed, our validation procedure using a randomly selected, independent sample showed highly concordant predictions in terms of R 2 for nearly all measures.\nDue to its relatively recent development and use in medicine over the last two decades, longitudinal MRIs of individuals throughout their lifetimes are not available at the moment. The design of our study was cross-sectional and thus, may encompass cohort biases. For example, we cannot rule out differences of brain developments between older and younger participants due to specific environmental differences (e.g. diet, education and medical care access). However, further studies using longitudinal scans over several years might help controlling to some extent potential cohort biases. Moreover, while we included two central scanner characteristics (i.e. MFS and manufacturer), it was not possible to take into account the potential influence of many others. For example, scan sequence, scanner model within manufacturers, and coil type, can have an impact on derived morphometric measures (Kruggel et al., 2010) . Finally, many morphometric measures had nonlinear age effects and future work are needed to verify whether norms solely based on older adults would be more sensitive to normality deviation in this population than norms based on a wider age range such as the present study.
