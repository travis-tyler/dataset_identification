[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background. This study investigates the role of private practitioners in the dental safety net,"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A majority of states -30 as of January 2014 -are currently implementing some form of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 1 It is widely recognized by professional and governmental policymakers that the low level of Medicaid participation among dentists is a cause for concern. Limited availability of participating dentists acts as a major barrier to care for low income populations. A recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that over half of reporting states had serious challenges ensuring that they had enough dentists available to treat Medicaid enrollees -more than any other health care provider. 2 Private practice dentists play a vital role in the oral health safety net since the public safety net, including federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) and other public health clinics, lacks sufficient capacity to ensure access to care for low income Americans. 3 The American Dental Association (ADA) estimates that approximately 27% of dentists nationally treat Medicaid-insured patients. 4 Despite this relatively low participation in Medicaid, private practitioners provide the greatest volume of care to Medicaid enrollees, given the size of the private dental workforce relative to public safety net capacity. In 2009, it is estimated that approximately 54% of dental care provided to children enrolled in Medicaid was provided by private general and pediatric dentists. 5 The American Dental Association (ADA) also estimates that 8.7 million children and 17.7 million adults will gain some form of dental benefits by 2018 through ACA-related changes to the health care delivery system, many as a result of expanded Medicaid coverage. 6 If demand for dental services increases with the ACA-related expansion of dental benefits, then the considerations for workforce sufficiency are considerable, especially for those with coverage through Medicaid.\nDentists' most commonly reported barriers to Medicaid participation include low reimbursement rates, administrative burdens, and undesirable patient behaviors, including high rates of broken appointments. [7] [8] [9] Iowa Medicaid generally reimburses 40 to 50 percent of the amount charged by dentists in the region. The average fee charged for a periodic oral evaluation in the region (including North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri) is $38.58, and the rate of Iowa Medicaid reimbursement for the same service is $16.37. 10, 11 While low reimbursement rates are often cited as the primary reason for not accepting\nMedicaid patients, 7 the ADA found that fewer than half of non-participating dentists would treat\nMedicaid patients even if fees were raised to meet overhead costs. 4 Iowa provides dental benefits to low income children through the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program and offers relatively comprehensive dental benefits to adult Medicaid enrollees. 12 Medicaid reimbursement rates for dental procedures in Iowa lag behind national averages; an adult prophylaxis is reimbursed at approximately 90% of the national average and a pediatric prophylaxis is reimbursed at 80% of the national average. 13 Examining Medicaid participation in states where Medicaid fees have been adjusted reveals that increased reimbursement levels alone are not always sufficient to improve access to dental care. 2, 9 At least one study suggests that combining fee increases with streamlined administration, case management, and improving dentists' attitudes provide the most gains in Medicaid participation. 9 Additionally, increased ethnic and racial diversity of the dental workforce is consistently linked to higher rates of Medicaid participation. [14] [15] [16] Despite being recognized as barriers, attitudes as they relate to treating Medicaid enrollees are rarely considered when researching this topic. Most existing literature describes relationships between demographic characteristics of dentists and Medicaid participation [15] [16] [17] or perceptions of the Medicaid program. 8, 14, 18 Dentists' attitudes about altruism and other aspects of social responsibility remain poorly described. It has been documented, however, that dentists often feel tension between their roles as business owners and their societal obligations. 19 This concept of social responsibility is closely linked to the professional obligations and privileges of dentistry.\nTo help prepare for Iowa's ACA-related Medicaid expansion, we conducted a survey of private practice dentists in Iowa to understand the capacity of the private dental safety net for the influx of new enrollees as well as describe relationships between current Medicaid participation and attitudes about social responsibility, the Medicaid program, and Medicaid enrollees. This survey was conducted as part of a larger project to examine current capacity of the health care safety net in Iowa and to identify opportunities and challenges for providing care to the populations receiving dental coverage with full implementation of the ACA."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "In early 2013, a survey was mailed to all general dentists engaged in private practice in Iowa (N=1,101). The basic questionnaire was modified from a previous version developed by the University of Iowa Public Policy Center and College of Dentistry. 20 We included additional items to ask dentists about their attitudes towards social responsibility, the Medicaid population,\nand commonly reported problems with the Medicaid program.\nThe survey was pre-tested for format and content validity by members of a national advisory committee, which included representatives from organized dentistry, academic experts, dental safety net providers, and government agencies. Members received iterative versions of the survey and provided feedback via cognitive interviews. The Iowa Dental Association supported the survey with an announcement encouraging members to participate in the project. Dentist mailing addresses were obtained from the Iowa Dentist Tracking System (IDTS), which maintains information about all licensed dentists in the state. 21 After receiving an initial invitation to participate, dentists received a postcard reminder two weeks later, followed by a second survey mailing two weeks after that. Dentists were offered the option to complete the survey online. The online version of the survey was identical in content and similar in format to the paper version. No incentives were offered to encourage participation. Dentist participation was voluntary and confidential; by answering questions and returning surveys, consent was implied. This survey was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board."}, {"section_title": "Dentist practice characteristics", "text": "We obtained information about dentist age and gender from the IDTS. Survey items asked about dentists' practice arrangements (e.g., solo versus group practice) and perceived workload during the previous 12 months. Workload was categorized as \"too busy\", \"busy, but not overworked\", and \"not busy enough\". 16 Practice urbanicity was defined at the county level and categorized using 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs) as metropolitan (RUCCs 1-3) or nonmetropolitan (RUCCs 4-9)."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dentist attitudes", "text": "We included a series of survey items to measure altruistic attitudes among dentists, attitudes about Medicaid program administration, and attitudes about Medicaid enrollees (Table   1 ). Dentists were asked to indicate on a four-point scale the degree to which they disagreed or agreed with each statement (1=strongly disagree, 4=strongly agree). These statements were adapted from a previous survey provided to dental students 23 that was modeled on a study that examined attitudes towards social responsibility among medical students. 24 We also provided dentists with a list of commonly reported problems with the Medicaid program and asked to indicate how important each factor was in their decision accept Medicaid patients. Response options ranged from 1 (\"not at all important\") to 4 (\"extremely important\").\nLikert scales were produced by combining conceptually related items and calculated as the mean of scores across items. Internal consistency of scales was assessed using Cronbach's \u03b1.\nItem-total correlations were used to assemble scales and ensure construct validity (see Appendix); exploratory factor analysis was used to check for concept unidimensionality of each scale."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "A scale measuring altruistic attitudes among dentists was built with seven survey items (Table 1) Two additional Likert items were analyzed separately and assessed dentists' concerns about having the only practice in the area that accepts Medicaid and their ability to provide comprehensive treatment to Medicaid enrollees (Table 1 ). Higher scores here indicate more concern with each issue."}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Participation", "text": "The dependent variable for this study was current Medicaid participation analyzed as a dichotomous variable (yes or no). For this study, we defined a dentist as participating in the Medicaid program if they answered \"yes\" when asked whether they currently accept new\nMedicaid patients into their practice. If dentists responded affirmatively, they were also asked whether they accepted all Medicaid patients who contacted their office and how seriously they were considering stopping their acceptance of new Medicaid patients. Dentists were also asked what proportion of their current patients was covered by Medicaid."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "Bivariate analyses using the chi-square test and Student's t-test compared demographic characteristics of respondents based on Medicaid participation. Additionally, we examined whether dentists' attitudes varied with Medicaid participation. Effect sizes were estimated using the partial-biserial correlation coefficient, rpb, and provide a measure of the magnitude of association between independent variables with Medicaid participation; these are reported in the Appendix. Correlations values of .37, .24, and .10 were considered to represent large, medium, or small effects. 26 We constructed two logistic regression models to identify predictors of accepting new "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic characteristics of survey respondents", "text": "Of the 1,101 eligible primary care dentists, 651 completed and returned surveys for an adjusted response rate of 59%. Survey respondents were comparable to the overall population of general dentists in age and gender. However, survey respondents were significantly more likely to be solo practitioners (65% versus 53% of all general dentists; p<.001). The majority of respondents were male dentists between the ages of 30-59 years (Table 2) . Almost half were solo practitioners and the majority lived in metropolitan counties. Overall, dentists who lived in nonmetro areas were significantly more likely to accept Medicaid patients (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Medicaid participation", "text": "Fifty-six percent of dentists reported that they currently accept new Medicaid patients into their practice. Among these participating dentists, 28% indicated that they accepted all new\nMedicaid patients who contact their office, while 72% accepted only limited numbers of new patients (i.e. only children or their own patients who go on Medicaid). On average, participating dentists reported that approximately 15% of their current patients were enrolled in Medicaid (range: 1-89%)."}, {"section_title": "Dentists' attitudes", "text": "Dentists who participate in the Medicaid program scored significantly higher on the scale measuring altruistic attitudes than nonparticipating dentists (p<.001, Appendix Table A3 ); this scale demonstrated a medium-large effect size (rpb=.32, Appendix Table A3 ). Participating dentists also had significantly more positive attitudes towards administration of the Medicaid program (p<.001); attitudes about administration demonstrated a medium effect size as an independent variable (rpb=.22). However, there was no significant difference in attitudes about\nMedicaid patients between the two groups (p=.36). Participating dentists had significantly greater concern about being the only practice in the area that accepts Medicaid (p=.01) and were significantly less concerned about their ability to provide Medicaid patients with comprehensive dental treatment (p<.001); both of these variables demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (rpb=.17, .14, respectively). Dentists who participated in Medicaid perceived problems with the Medicaid program to be significantly less important than nonparticipating dentists (p<.001), with this variable demonstrating a small to medium effect size (rpb=.19).\nA scale that described dentists' importance of perceived problems with the Medicaid program was included in the regression analysis. Additionally, we examined items that comprised this scale individually. Regardless of current Medicaid participation, low reimbursement was rated as the most important factor affecting dentists' decisions to participate in the Medicaid program, followed by broken appointments, and denial of payment (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Regression analysis", "text": "In the multivariable logistic regression model (N=484), none of the demographic characteristics were statistically significant predictors of Medicaid participation ( 27 , it is unknown whether this affected dentists' decision to participate in Medicaid.\nWe conducted this survey to also examine how dentists' attitudes were associated with Medicaid participation. Medicaid participation did not differ significantly with any demographic characteristic in the final model (Model 2; Table 4 ). Although there is some evidence that dentists in nonmetro areas are more likely to accept Medicaid patients 11 , this study did not find an association between practice location and Medicaid participation, although this relationship showed a trend towards significance (Table 4) . However, participating dentists did have significantly different attitudes towards administration of the Medicaid program and the patient population.\nWe also found significant differences in how dentists perceived problems with Medicaid.\nInterestingly, the importance of reimbursement rates did not differ significantly between dentists based on their Medicaid participation (Table 3) These generally favorable attitudes are reflected in participating dentists' perceptions of problems with the Medicaid program. In general, dentists who accept Medicaid enrollees viewed commonly reported problems as less important to their decisions about Medicaid participation.\nLow reimbursement rates were the most important factor for both groups of dentists; whether this factor acts as a barrier to participation appears to be attenuated by other factors, including attitudes about social responsibility.\nOne interesting finding from our study is that dentists who accept new Medicaid patients had less favorable attitudes about treating these patients. However, this relationship may not necessarily reflect negative attitudes about Medicaid enrollees: this scale included statements about the severity of oral health problems experienced by Medicaid patients and difficulty treating them. These findings may indicate a more realistic perception of the challenges dentists face treating this patient population."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "Our findings from this cross-sectional survey have several potential limitations. First, nonresponse bias could have affected our results, although we did not find any evidence of response bias when we compared demographic characteristics of survey respondents and nonresponders. Secondly, as a cross-sectional study we can only describe the relationships between dentist characteristics and Medicaid participation. Altruistic attitudes may have led dentists to treat low income patients or altruism may develop after involvement with this population; likely, it is a bidirectional relationship. We were also unable to identify if any of our respondents were in practice together, which may have biased findings; however, this is likely to be a nondifferential source of bias. Finally, dentists' self-reported responses may suffer from social desirability bias if dentists were inclined to answer items in a way that portrayed them more favorably; however, this bias would likely lead to an overestimation of Medicaid participation, altruism, and attitudes about the population."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Despite several decades worth of research indicating that dentists perceive low reimbursement rates to be a significant barrier to participating in Medicaid, several recent studies have demonstrated that increased reimbursement levels do not always translate into improved participation rates. 2, 9 Reimbursement rates and other perceived administrative burdens are difficult to modify at a systems level and characteristics of the Medicaid population, such as case severity, are even less modifiable. However, our findings demonstrate that Medicaid participation is significantly associated with dentists' attitudes, including views on social responsibility.\nThese attitudes may be potentially shaped by educational and professional experiences such as service-learning and community-based clinical experiences. 28, 29 However, studies have demonstrated a decrease in idealistic attitudes towards caring for underserved populations throughout dental school, 23, 30 although it is unclear whether these changes are the result of a true decline in altruism or reflect more realistic attitudes about the complexity of this issue.\nAs states move forward with ACA-related Medicaid expansion, ensuring an adequate supply of dentists willing to accept these enrollees may require innovative strategies that aim to change dentists' attitudes and perceptions alongside administrative reform."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 1.
