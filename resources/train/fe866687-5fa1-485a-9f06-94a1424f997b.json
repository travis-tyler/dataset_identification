[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "To confront the global threat of COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020), many SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been rapidly decoded and promptly released from the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017) . To elucidate characteristics of this virus in various aspects, we must introduce various research methods other than the phylogenetic tree construction, such as those used in big data analyses. The present study focuses on mono-and oligonucleotide compositions, which vary significantly among species and viruses. It should be mentioned that the composition of short oligonucleotides, especially of dinucleotides, has been used as a good phylogenetic parameter \"genome signature\" (Karlin et al., 1998). Many host factors (e.g., nucleotide pools, proteins and RNAs) are involved in viral growth, and human cells may not present an ideal growth condition for invading viruses from nonhuman hosts. Therefore, efficient growth after the invasion will likely require changes in the virus genome. To study this viral adaptation, we previously analyzed time-series changes in mono-and oligonucleotide compositions of three zoonotic RNA viruses (Zaire ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus and influenza virus) and identified time-series directional changes that were detectable even on a monthly basis (Iwasaki et al., 2011 (Iwasaki et al., , 2013 Wada et al., 2016) . Additionally, an analysis of 25,000 influenza virus genomes showed that the directional changes were very similar between H1N1 (starting in 1918), H3N2 (starting in 1968) and H1N1/2009 (starting in 2009) (Wada et al., 2016) .\nThese reproducible changes of the three independent invasions are thought to reflect viral adaptive processes for efficient growth in human cells. special preprocessing. As a fairly common characteristic of big data analysis (e.g., time-series word count), the effects of erroneous data appear to naturally decrease with the increase in the data size.\nGenome sequences of Zaire ebolavirus were downloaded from the Virus Variation Resource database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/) (Hatcher et al., 2017) on May 3, 2020. The word-count program can be obtained from k_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp."}, {"section_title": "Time-series changes in mononucleotide composition", "text": "To investigate whether time-series changes, which were previously found for Zaire ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus and influenza virus (Wada et al., 2016) , occur also in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from humans, we plotted the mononucleotide composition (%) of each strain of SARS-CoV-2 in an order corresponding the isolation date, after the removal of the polyA-tail in advance (Fig. 1a) . We first noticed the presence of the data that appear to be outliers and found that these were often derived from the sequences where the number of Ns (unknown nucleotides) is greater than 1000; this should be an unavoidable situation in the case of urgent sequencing, such as SARS-CoV-2. Even in the presence of the outliers, we have observed a time-series decrease in C% and an increase in U%, although slight.\nIn the next analysis ( Fig. 1b) , rather than removing the noisy outliers, we tabulated the virus strains for each month of collection and calculated the mononucleotide composition (%) therein, as we previously done in the time series analysis of Zaire Next, we compared the change observed for SARS-CoV-2 with that for Zaire ebolavirus, which started the epidemic in West Africa in March 2014. Although the number of ebolavirus sequences is much smaller than SARS-CoV-2, there are 15 months in which more than 10 strains per month have been reported, allowing us to see how long directional increases and decreases will be sustained. Using March 2014 as the start (0 in both the horizontal and vertical axes), the level of increase or decrease of each mononucleotide is plotted for each month (Fig. 1d) . The previous study analyzed the three regions (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) separately and observed some regional differences, but the present study did not distinguish the three regions. Although there is some variation in data points that may be due to the regional difference and the small number of sequences, each nucleotide clearly undergoes a directional change (Fig. 1d ). Fig. 1e shows both SARS-CoV-2 (reddish brown symbols) and ebolavirus (blue symbols) on a single figure. Since the shape of the symbol is identical in both viruses, it is clear that the direction of change in C% is reversed between the two viruses."}, {"section_title": "Time-series changes in dinucleotide composition", "text": "Next, we analyze the time series change in each dinucleotide composition (%) in the monthly tabulated SARS-CoV-2 and ebolavirus genomes. The first and second panels in Fig. 2a show the differences from the start month for 16 dinucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 and ebolavirus, respectively. In both viruses, various dinucleotides are clearly increased or decreased. Since the same symbol is used for the two viruses, it is clear that the direction of increase or decrease of individual dinucleotides differs between the two viruses. The last panel shows the data for both viruses, but here we have selected the first and second highest dinucleotides for the increase or decrease level in the last month of each virus. Although there are some differences between the dinucleotides, the trend of increase and decrease appears to slightly slow down after about six months from the ebolavirus epidemic start.\nSince the mononucleotide composition changes time-dependently ( Fig. 1) , it is obvious that the dinucleotide composition changes. However, there may exist some properties that become apparent only when analyzing continuous nucleotides. By focusing on the value (Obs/Exp) obtained by dividing the observed value of the dinucleotide (Obs) by the expected value from the mononucleotide composition (Exp), the effect of the mononucleotide change can be reduced. Fig. 2b shows the time-series difference in each J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof month's Obs/Exp value for each dinucleotide. In both viruses, there is a clear increase or decrease in various dinucleotides, but the types of dinucleotides that increase or decrease often differ from those observed in Fig. 2a and between the viruses. The last panel shows the data for both viruses; here we have selected again the first and second highest examples for the increase or decrease level. The time series pattern of Obs/Exp for ebolavirus in Fig. 2b appears to be more complex than that in Fig. 2a . When it comes to continuous nucleotides, the relationship to biological functions that include various molecular mechanisms of the viral adaptation to human cells should become more relevant than with mononucleotides, and this may be a reason for the complex pattern in Fig. 2b .\nHere, we should note that one important difference between SARS-CoV-2 and Zaire ebolavirus is positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses, respectively. Therefore, there is a possibility that the reverse direction of nucleotide changes for the two viruses is related with the reverse coding strand of these virus genomes. If so, the direction of the mono-and dinucleotide changes between the two viruses should be completely reversed.\nSince this systematic reverse was not observed for both mono-and dinucleotides, the difference between the two viruses observed in Figs. 1 and 2 should not reflect the difference in the coding strands of these viruses."}, {"section_title": "Rapidly increasing 20-mers", "text": "Sequential extension of the oligonucleotide length from dinucleotide will provide clues to elucidate the molecular adaptation mechanisms, but we next analyzed the occurrence of 20-mers in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as previously conducted for ebolavirus and influenza virus (Wada et al., 2016 (Wada et al., , 2017 . For these highly mutable viruses, the time-series analysis of long oligonucleotides such as 20-mers is unambiguously important for designing the PCR primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides that can be used for a sufficiently long period (Wada et al., 2017) . Since the polyA-tails were removed in advance, none of the 20-mers was present more than once in each genome. Therefore, it is important to mention that the occurrence level (%) of a certain 20-mer in each month's viral population corresponded to the occurrence level (%) of the strains with the 20-mer sequence in the viral population.\nHere, it should be mentioned that the frequency of 20-mers is a very high-dimensional vector data of 4 to the 20th power (1.0995116e+12), but the 20-mers used in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof SARS-CoV-2 genomes are limited to a very small fraction of this vast number of dimensions; i.e., it is an analysis of high dimensional sparse data, which becomes increasingly important in recent big data research. In the following analysis, occurrences of only 20-mers present in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes were counted, and therefore, the time-series histogram analysis could be conducted with no difficulty.\nWhen we happened to search for 20-mers that were absent in all 16 strains isolated in December 2019, then emerged and increased in occurrence, we unexpectedly found a group of rapidly increasing 20-mers. This remarkable peculiarity is shown in Fig. 3a ;\nhere, we focused on all 39,990 types of 20-mers that were present in April 2020 but absent in December 2019 and analyzed their occurrence level (%) in the April population. The first histogram (reddish brown) displays the number of types of 20-mers present within each 3% width of the occurrence level in the April population.\nIn the area with a very low occurrence level, the vertical axis value is near 40,000, which is almost the same to all 39,990 types emerged after December 2019; i.e., almost all 20-mers that newly emerged exhibit a very low occurrence level in the April population. However, when the vertical axis is displayed as a log (blue) scale, peculiar data (marked with a long arrow) become evident at the position where the horizontal value is more than 80% in the April population and the vertical log value is 1.903 (= 80).\nTo be more precise, sixty types of 20-mers have an occurrence level of 82%, and twenty types have an occurrence level of 81%. When analyzing time-series changes in the occurrence level of the eighty 20-mers, a very similar pattern of monotonic increase was observed for all eighty 20-mers (Fig. 3b) ."}, {"section_title": "Genomic positions of rapidly increasing 20-mers and their time-series occurrences", "text": "We next focus on the eighty 20-mers that have rapidly and monotonically increased their intra-population frequency. Homology searches (BLASTn) against the viral genome sequences showed that they can be grouped into four sets of twenty 20-mers locating apart on the viral genome; the twenty 20-mers at each genomic location are shifted by one base, resulting in a single 39-mer. Figure 4 presents sequences of four 39-mers found at the four genomic positions: Seq1 in 5' UTR, Seq2 in Orf1a for nsp3, Seq3 in Orf1b for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Seq4 in S for surface glycoprotein. Figure 4 presents also four pre-mutation sequences found in December strains in the upper row. Figure 3c shows the time-series changes in a total of eight J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 39-mers; the sequences before and after the mutation (symbols in green and reddish brown, respectively) were distinguished by the additional letters B and A: e.g., Seq1B\nand 1A. The 39-mers observed before or after mutation show a clear monotonic decrease or increase, respectively; i.e., no bottleneck-type frequency reduction is observed for the postmutation 39-mers.\nLooking at Fig. 3a , clearly distinctive data are also observed in the 32-24% range (marked with a short arrow), and the BLASTn analysis gave the results presented in Fig.   4 . The twenty 20-mers with an occurrence level of 32% belonged to a 39-mers are located in Orf3a (Seq5) and the twenty 20-mers with an occurrence level of 27% belonged to a 39-mers are located in Orf1a for nsp2 (Seq6). In the case of the occurrence level of 24%, twenty-two 20-mers belonging to a 41-mers are located in N for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Seq7). Interestingly, this mutation is not a point mutation, but three bases are changed at once, and therefore, the number of 20-mers with the mutation in focus increased from twenty to twenty two. Figure 3d shows the time-series changes in four 39-mers and two 41-mers listed in Fig. 4 ; those found before or after mutation show a clear monotonic decrease or increase, respectively.\nNext, we re-examined the time series changes of the 20-mers (Fig. 3c ) in more detail.\nEven for the 20-mers belonging to the same 39-or 41-mer, there is a slight difference in the occurrence level, which is observed as a slight bulge in the data at the same location in Fig. 3c . This slight diversity was found to be caused by the mutations that occur around the interested mutations in a very small number of strains. Although the possibility of sequencing errors cannot be ruled out, we think this slight diversity reflects the random fluctuation caused by neutral mutations occurred around the interested mutations."}, {"section_title": "Search for the hidden advantageous mutations", "text": "To understand molecular mechanisms of viral adaptation to human cells, it is unambiguously important to find mutations that favor proliferation in human cells and human-to-human transmission. Suzuki and Gojobori (1999) developed a method for detecting positively selected sites in protein coding genes, by comparing the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, and Suzuki (2006) applied it to influenza virus genomes. We next explain that the present histogram and time-series J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof analysis, which does not rely on sequence alignment, is also a method for detecting positively selected sites in RNA virus genomes.\nThe most important characteristic of the positively selected advantageous mutations should be their rapid increase in the intra-population frequency. By assuming that the requirement for advantageous mutations is a rapid increase in intra-population frequency, we next search for candidates for advantageous mutations. Seven mutations in focus are good candidates for the advantageous mutations, but advantageous mutations are very rare compared to the neutral mutations that are hitchhikingly synergistic to the driver-type advantageous mutation. It is thus important to distinguish the genuine advantageous mutation from the hitchhiker-type neutral mutations. To do so, we should thoroughly search for candidates for advantageous mutations and rank them in an order of the increase level of their intra-population frequency, so far concerning the virus population compiled by the GISAID database. If we can find such a mutation that increases the intra-population frequency more rapidly than the interested mutations, or at a similar level, the interested mutations in Fig. 4 may become the possible hitchhiker-type neutral mutations synergistic to the newly found mutation.\nAt first, we have to explain the characteristic of the present histogram analysis shown in Fig. 3a . There, we exhaustively analyzed all 20-mer sequences that were absent in all December (2019) strains but present in April (2020) strains. Therefore, the hidden advantageous mutation \"X\" is missed only when such mutable sites that can counteract the X's intra-population expanse are present within 19 bases both upstream and downstream of the X mutation. To search for the X mutation, we should analyze the sequences shorter than 20-mer. Additionally, the restriction of non-existence in the December population is removed, because the X mutation may exist in a few December strains.\nFor all 15-mers found in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, Fig. 5a shows the histogram for their increase levels (%) in the April population from that in the December population. The pattern is very similar to that listed in Fig. 3a , and importantly, all cases of more than 20% increase are limited to the 107 (= 15x7 + 2) types of 15-mers with the seven mutations in focus; the addition of 2 in parentheses is due to a three-nucleotide change found in Seq7. It is worthy to note that ten out of the 59,922 type of 15-mers in April have two copies on the genome, but the two copies are also present in all December J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof strains and their occurrence levels very slightly decrease in April, which does not affect the search for the X mutation. When it comes to 10-mers, more than 1200 out of a total of 47,002 types have multiple copies, but the 10-mers with the increase exceeding 20% are limited to 72 (= 10x7 + 2) with the interested mutations.\nIn the case of 7-mer, approximately 60% of the 12,203 types present in April have multiple copies and some have more than twenty copies, and therefore, the result is expected to be complicated by the cumulative effect caused by many mutations occurring around the interested mutations. However, all 7-mers with more than 20% increase are limited to 51 (= 7x7 + 2) types with the interested mutations, showing the extraordinarily rapid increase in their intra-population frequency. Even though, the histogram pattern has changed significantly; the region of the high values (marked by a long arrow) has begun to split, with the highest value reaching near 90%. It should be noted that the top three were GGGUGUU, UUUUUAC and CUUUUUA (i.e., U-and/or G-rich sequences), whose increase is predicted from the mono-and dinucleotide increase ( Figs. 1 and 2) . In other words, the effect of the mono-and dinucleotide increase is also becoming apparent.\nMost 5-mers are present in more than one hundred copies on the genome, and a few have ten thousand copies. Despite this, the top 20 (= 5x4) have the mutations in Seq1-4.\nHowever, the distribution in the histogram is continuous in the region below 40%, and the 5-mers with and without the mutations in Seq5-7 were mixed."}, {"section_title": "Oligonucleotides shorter than 5-mer", "text": "When shortening the oligonucleotide length to 4-mer, there appeared two cases with over 200% increase, and this was because the highest UUUU has the mutation in both Seq1 and 2 and the second highest UUAC has the mutation in both Seq2 and 3 (Fig. 4) .\nIn addition, UGUU with no mutation in Seq1-4 appeared in the sixth position; UGUU is the most abundant 4-mer in April, with an average of over 300 copies per genome, and its increase is predictable from the mono-and dinucleotide increase. Even when shortening the oligonucleotide length to 3-mer, the top five had the Seq1-4 mutations.\nWe thus concluded that there is no hidden advantageous mutation that expands its J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof intra-population frequency at a faster rate than the Seq1-4 mutations, during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from January to April 2020.\nNext, we discuss the mutations in Seq5-7. When shortening the length to 4-mer, some 4-mers, as well as 5-mers, increased at the same level as those for the Seq5-7 mutations, and interestingly, even the cases that were not expectable from the mono-and dinucleotide increase were observed in a high order: e.g., AAAU and AAUU.\nInterestingly, these corresponded to the 4-mers that constitute the 15-mers, whose increase level was in the eighth position (12% increase in Fig. 5) ; for detail of the Seq8, see the legend to Fig. 4 . We thus concluded that there is no hidden advantageous mutation that expands its intra-population frequency at a faster rate than the mutations in Seq5-7."}, {"section_title": "Characteristic of sequences determined by PCR method and order of appearance of the interested mutations", "text": "First, we should point out that the viral sequence determined by the PCR method is of an average property of multiple viral copies isolated from one patient. Even if a neutral mutation occurs in a certain viral genome, unless the copy number at the start of the infection is relatively low and the neutral mutation occurs in a very early stage of the infection, the mutation is not reflected in the determined sequence of the patient because of the PCR averaging operation.\nNext, we explain the order of the mutations found in Seq1-7. The mutations in Seq1-4 appeared first in the following two January strains; the hCoV-19/Germany/BavPat1/2020|EPI_ISL_406862|2020-01-28 carried mutations in Seq1, 2 and 4 and the hCoV-19/Zhejiang/HZ103/2020|EPI_ISL_422425|2020-01-24 carried mutations in Seq2, 3 and 4; i.e., mutations in Seq2 and 4 were commonly present in these two strains. However, the mutation in Seq5-7 had not yet emerged in A more detailed discussion will require epidemiological information, but from the results of the time series analysis alone, we can conclude that the Seq4 mutation is the genuine advantageous mutation, most significantly increasing the intrapopulation frequency from January to April. The Seq7 mutation is also considered to be an advantageous mutation, because this mutation appeared after the strain with the Seq4 mutation has reached a significant number. While the possibility that either Seq5 or 6 is a neutral mutation cannot be ruled out, both are considered to be advantageous mutations because the mutations are nonsynonymous between amino acids with different chemical properties. A characteristic finding of the present study is the exclusion of the possibility of mutations that increased intrapopulation frequency more rapidly than the Seq1-7 mutations."}, {"section_title": "A sequence alignment-free method for searching advantageous mutations", "text": "As explained in Introduction, a wide variety of technologies must be introduced to combat emerging infectious diseases, such as COVD-19. The present study has attempted to develop a sequence alignment free method that will become a complement to the phylogenetic tree construction in viral evolutionary studies. We focused on the technological development, rather than discussing biological implications of the obtained results. Time-series analysis of occurrences of oligonucleotides of diverse lengths can unveil various characteristics hidden in the virus genome. Furthermore, the present method can extensively search for advantageous mutations (i.e., unveil the hidden ones) and rank them in an increase level for their intra-population frequency. All methods used here are suitable for big data analysis. In addition, although there are a significant number of viral sequences that contained many Ns, the present analysis does not require any special preprocessing. As a characteristic of big data analysis, the effects of erroneous data naturally decrease with the increase in the data size. The present method should become a powerful complement to the phylogenetic tree method in the viral evolutionary study. Combining it with an unsupervised-type AI (Iwasaki et al., 2011 (Iwasaki et al., , 2013 can provide a powerful method for obtaining novel knowledge from big data of viral genome sequences. vertical axis of the histogram shows logarithms (blue), and nonexistence in the logarithmic display is shown expediently as 0. Long and short arrows indicate the data locating in the highest and next highest region of interest, as described in Fig. 3a .
