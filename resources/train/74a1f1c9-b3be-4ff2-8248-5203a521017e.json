[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In 1998 the first comprehensive life cycle inventory for biodiesel produced in the United States from soybean oil was completed (Sheehan et al.) . The inventory and model assumptions were developed by a large stakeholders group and several peer reviewers that included experts from numerous disciplines and institutions. The study developed a broad-based inventory that included energy use, greenhouse gases, and other air emissions. In addition, a full life-cycle inventory was constructed for petroleum diesel to compare the energy requirements and environmental costs of petroleum diesel versus biodiesel. Other biodiesel studies have been done since Sheehan et al., but none have matched the detailed information or collaborative effort used to produce the original report.\nOne of the most often cited result from Sheehan et al. is that the fossil energy ratio (or energy balance) of biodiesel is equal to 3.2. In other words biodiesel yields 3.2 units of energy for every unit of fossil energy consumed over its life cycle. By contrast, it was found that petroleum diesel's life cycle yielded only 0.83 units of energy per unit of fossil energy consumed. The purpose of the following analysis is to update the energy life-cycle of the model to determine if any significant changes in the original inventory have occurred since the model was first developed ten years ago. For example, the adoption of new technologies in the farm sector, the soybean processing sector, and in the biodiesel industry are expected to effect the life-cycle energy use."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Much of the attention directed toward renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, is focused on the perception that they have superior environmental properties compared to their petroleum fuel counterparts (EPA ,2002; Knothe et al. 2005 ). In addition, developing renewable fuels is desirable because they are derived from sustainable sources of energy, whereas petroleum fuels come from oil, a finite resource that is rapidly being depleted. However, the production of renewable fuels generally involves a significant amount of fossil energy, e.g., petroleum fuel is used to cultivate and harvest the soybeans used to make biodiesel. The amount of fossil energy used for biodiesel must be measured over the entire life-cycle of biodiesel production to determine the extent in which it depends on petroleum fuels. The degree in which biodiesel is renewable is largely a factor of the amount of petroleum fuel used for its production.\nIt is beneficial to know the renewability of a biofuel for two reasons. First, it is useful to know how much a biofuel relies on petroleum energy for its production --the less a biofuel depends on petroleum energy, the larger contribution it can make to increase and diversify our total fuel supply. Secondly, the renewability of different biofuels can be compared by policymakers and others to determine which biofuels are the most productive in terms of reducing our dependence on petroleum energy. The Fossil Energy Ratio (FER) of a biofuel is one indication of its renewability. A biofuel's FER is defined as the ratio of the energy output of the final biofuel product to the fossil energy required to produce the biofuel. FER is expressed as:\nEstimating FER begins with defining the entire production system of biodiesel, which includes four subsystems: feedstock production, feedstock transportation, biodiesel conversion, and product distribution. An inventory is then developed that identifies and quantifies all the fossil energy inputs used in each subsystem. All significant sources of energy are included in the inventory, such as the liquid fuel and electricity used to directly power equipment in the system. The energy content of materials that are made from energy resources, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and other petrochemicals are also included in the inventory. The energy values of all fossil resources used in the system are adjusted by energy efficiency coefficients to take into account the energy used to convert fossil resources into usable energy. These coefficients include the energy required to mine, extract, and manufacture the raw energy materials into the final energy product. Estimates of electricity generation are based on the weighted average of all sources of power, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric. The electricity used in the system is increased to account for production and transmission loss factor. The overall efficiency of electricity production in the US electricity production increased from 32% as reported in NREL report to 35.28% in 2006 35.28% in (EIA, 2007 . Including the transmission efficiency of 91% (Which was not included in NREL report), the energy used in biodiesel production was multiplied by factor of 3.1 to account for general and distribution losses.\nHexane extraction method is commonly used to extract oil from soybean seed. The most common method used for converting soybean oil into biodiesel is called transesterification, which was the conversion method modeled by Sheehan et al, and also used in this study. Oil extraction and transesterification results in the production of two important coproducts, soybean meal and crude glycerin respectively. Since this energy life-cycle focuses exclusively on biodiesel, the energy associated with the production of the other two coproducts must be estimated and excluded from the inventory. Since detailed information is often not available to measure the exact energy requirements of the individual coproducts, an allocation method can be used to assign coproduct values. There are several allocation methods that can be used to estimate the energy value of coproducts. In general, no allocation rule is always applicable and the appropriate method should be chosen on a case-by-case basis. For more discussion on allocation rules see Shapouri et al. (2002) . The Sheehan et al. study used a mass based allocation method. This method is commonly used because it's easy to apply and provides very reasonable results (Vigon et al., 1993) . This method simply allocates energy to the various coproducts by their relative weights. In order to provide a consistent comparison of the original Sheehan study, this study also used the mass based allocation method. This allocation rule separates the energy used to produce the soybean oil and biodiesel from the energy used to produce the soybean meal and glycerin respectively in the following manner:\nwhere E 1 is energy input for agriculture/bean transport, f 1 is mass fraction of oil of harvested crop; E 2 is energy input for oil extraction/oil transport, f 2 is mass fraction of oil production; and E 3 is energy input for transesterification/biodiesel transport and f 3 is biodiesel fraction of the final product.\nOver the past several years, the energy balance of soybean biodiesel has been reported by different researchers with considerable variation in results. To better understand the causes behind these differences, Pradhan et al. (2008) compared four different studies that estimated the net energy ratio of biodiesel. They found that the diversity in results among the studies was caused by data differences, conflicting system boundaries, the treatment of labor as an energy input, and differences in energy ratio definitions. By far the largest cause for the contradicting results reported was due to the difference in the method used to allocate the energy between biodiesel and its meal co-product."}, {"section_title": "Data Description and Trends", "text": "At the time of the Sheehan et al. study, the most recent detailed data available on soybean production was from USDA's 1990 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS (formerly called the Farm Costs and Returns Survey, FCRS) is conducted annually, but to reduce survey costs, USDA does not undertake detailed surveys of every commodity each year. Thus, the ARMS covers a major commodity in detail about every 4 years, with the most recent survey on soybeans occurring in 2002. The ARMS soybean survey only covers major soybean producing states and detailed data is only reported for a selected number of these states. In 1990, state-level estimates were available for fourteen states and the 2002 soybean survey provided detailed state-level data on 20 states. These 20 states are responsible for 98% of the soybean production. The sample size of this state-level data is large enough to provide statistical reliable estimates to represent state averages, but not national averages. The Department of Agriculture uses other versions of the ARMS to gather annual data for national soybean production estimates but they are limited compared to the ARMS soybean survey, which is the only USDA source that provides detailed data on machinery and fuel use.\nTo stay competitive, U.S. Farmers are continually looking for ways to minimize their input costs and increase productivity. Therefore, the 2002 ARMS soybean data would be expected to reflect some changes in soybean production practices (table 1). The most significant change in U.S. soybean production since 1990 is the use of genetically engineered (GE) soybeans, which have had a major effect on pesticide use. The 1990 ARMS soybean production data used in the Sheehan et al. report did not include any GE soybeans, because they had not been introduced into U.S. agriculture yet. However, by 2002 the rapid rise in GE soybeans had reached 75 percent of the soybeans planted and today almost all soybeans in the United States are GE varieties (ERS, 2007) . Genetically engineered soybeans with herbicide tolerant and pest management traits increase yields through improved weed and pest control. Using GE soybeans also reduces pesticide use and costs (Heimlich et al., 2000) (Thorson, 2008) . Moreover, most of the herbicide used in soybean is now in the form of glyphosate which is about 10 times less toxic and more environmentally friendly than traditional herbicide such as Alachlor. A measure of toxicity level of a pesticide is its oral Reference Dose (RfD) established by EPA. Reference dose (RfD) is an estimate of a daily exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. RfD for Glyphosate is 0.1 mg/day/kg (EPA 1981) which is ten times higher than 0.01 mg/day/kg for alachlor (EPA 1984) . Alachlor was a major herbicide used in year 1990 when in year 2006, 89% of the herbicide used was Glyphosate based. Lime data is made available by Payne, 2006 Source: NASS, USDA\nThe annual ARMS data shows that the amount of fertilizers and pesticides applied on total soybean acreage varied from year to year (figure 1). The fertilizer usage patterns per acre follows a similar time trend for each fertilizer type. Insecticides were applied in less than one percent of the total acreage during 1990 -1993, hence the insecticides application rates during this period are omitted in the chart. The total number of states used to estimate the weighted average of the fertilizer and pesticide application rates varied year to year, the lowest being 8 states in the year 2001 and the highest of 29 states in the year 1990. There have also been major changes in the soybean crushing industry that are expected to reduce the energy requirements of biodiesel. Unfortunately, the best data available to Sheehan et al. on oil crushing was based on a single plant that was 17 years old at the time of the study. Although adjustments were made to the model to modernize the plant, it's unlikely that it was a good representative of a typical crusher of the time. Thus, the typical plant in operation today is much newer than the plant modeled by Sheehan et al. Furthermore, these newer plants are more energy efficient due to the adoption of energy saving technologies that reduce production costs. Process improvement in extraction plants has continued with increasing emphasis on energy efficiency, cost reduction, reducing hexane loss, quality of meal and oil, and increased capacity. For instance, the current acceptable level of solvent loss is one-third of the level used by U.S. extraction plants in 1970 (Woerfel, 1995) .\nLikewise the amount of energy required to convert soybean oil into biodiesel using the transesterification has decreased over the past decade because producers have adopted energy-saving processing equipment to minimize production costs. The rise of larger biodiesel facilities with corresponding larger energy requirements has prompted greater emphasis on minimizing energy costs. The capital cost of adding energy saving technologies is more than offset by the reduction in energy costs. For example, heat integration technologies have resulted in the capture and reuse of heat that was previously discharged. Improvements in the catalytic technology used to produce biodiesel have resulted in higher conversion efficiencies of soybean oil into biodiesel. Reclaiming and reusing the wash water stream used to purify biodiesel has eliminated the need for waste water treatment."}, {"section_title": "Energy Life-Cycle Inventory", "text": "This section describes the inventory and data used to construct the four subsystems of the biodiesel life-cycle; feedstock production, feedstock transportation, biodiesel conversion, and product distribution."}, {"section_title": "Feedstock Production", "text": "The farm input data for soybean production was obtained from several sources The farm input data in table 1 were weighted by state production to derive average energy used for U.S. soybean production. The weighted average soybean yield for the state data equaled 38 bushels per acre in year 2002 (table 1) . The weighted average energy input use and the weighted average yield were used to estimate the energy required to produce a bushel of soybeans in the United States. The direct energy inputs were converted to British thermal units (BTU) using low-energy heat values (table 2). It was assumed that electricity generation came from a combination of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower at the same proportion as national average. The energy equivalents of hexane and methanol used in NREL study differ significantly than those used in this study from new results. Hexane energy used in NREL study is one-half and methanol energy is twice than the updated values considered in this study.\nThe energy used for planting the seed and other farm activities such as land preparation, plowing, weeding, fertilizer and pesticide application, irrigating, harvesting and drying is included in total farm fuels and electricity estimates (table 1) . The fuel required to haul soybeans to a local biodiesel plant or distribution center is also included. The estimates in table 1 do not include the energy used to mine, extract, and manufacture the raw materials into the final energy product. The sum of these energy values must be added to the values in table 1 to estimate the total energy associated with each farm input required to produce a bushel of soybeans. This final calculation will be performed in the result section.

Assuming a regular corn-corn-soybean crop rotation only one third of the field will be planted with soybean on any given year.\nThe theoretical minimum distance to supply soybeans for a 100 million gallon/year oil production plant located at the center of a square grid assuming only one third of the area planted with soybean at random is about 48 miles with average yield (38 bu/ac) and oil content (18% oil).

The estimation was based on the total distance of 800 miles and the modes of transportation used were barge, truck, and rails.

The first stage, the removal of the oil from the soybean is often called crushing and the most common method used to convert the oil into biodiesel is a process known as transesterification."}, {"section_title": "Oil Extraction from Soybeans", "text": "The separation of the soybean into oil and soybean meal, which is generally referred to as crushing, can be done by crushing using mechanical extruders, but more commonly the oil is extracted from the soybean using the chemical process hexane extraction (figure 4). Soybeans are cleaned, dried to a required moisture level, tempered and then typically cracked and the hulls removed. The hulls may then be further treated by heating (toasting) and grinding and are either sold as soybean hulls or blended with the soybean meal that is later extracted in the process. The dehulled beans are then conditioned and flaked prior to hexane extraction where the beans are mixed with hexane, a solvent which separates the oil from the remaining portion of the bean (figure 4). The oil and hexane mixture are treated in a recovery system where the hexane is removed and recycled for additional processing. The crude soybean oil is degummed and may be deodorized, bleached and neutralized. The oil depleted beans are then treated to remove any remaining solvent, dried, cooled , ground and sometimes mixed with the soybean hulls to produce soybean meal, an important livestock feed (figure 4).\nA soybean processing facility uses energy in the form of electricity to power motors and provide lighting. Natural gas and process steam are used to provide heat for drying. Soybeans entering the process are first dried to obtain a 10% moisture content (Erickson, 1995) . Then the beans are processed thru mechanical rolls to loosen the hulls which are then heated in a hull toaster. The hulls are ground and mixed with the soybean meal or they may be sold as a separate product. The dehulled beans are conditioned by heating, cut into flakes and fed to the oil extraction unit where the oil in the beans are dissolved with hexane. Steam is then introduced into the system to separate the hexane from the oil. Hot air and cooling water are used in the final heating and drying of the oil. The oil depleted, dried soybean meal from the extraction process is then ground to a uniform size and in some cases blended with the soybean hulls to produce soybean meal. "}, {"section_title": "Conversion of Soybean Oil into Biodiesel", "text": "The conversion of soybean oil into biodiesel is done by reacting the oil with an alcohol, usually methanol, and a catalyst, normally sodium hydroxide in large reactors. After the soyoil, methanol, and catalyst have reacted the resulting mixture is centrifuged to remove excess methanol, glycerin and other impurities. After the centrifuge step, the mixture is then washed with water and dried to become biodiesel (figure 4). The stream of methanol, glycerin and other impurities are then treated with a small amount of acids and bases to remove any remaining fatty acids. The remaining material is then distilled to recover the methanol and most of the water. The excess methanol and water are recovered and reused to avoid waste and reduce input costs. The crude glycerin is often sold to companies that refine the glycerin so it can be used in the production of a variety of other products, including fiber glass resin, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, liquid laundry detergents, soaps, deicers, and antifreeze. Electrical energy is used to drive the pumps, centrifuges and mixers, while thermal energy is needed in the distillation column to recover the excess methanol and remove the final rinse water from the biodiesel. Thermal energy is also used to heat the soyoil to accelerate the conversion process."}, {"section_title": "Soy Oil Transportation", "text": "Most of the biodiesel plants have oil extraction and biodiesel conversion facilities co-located together, which saves the energy spent in transporting oil.

As discussed above the energy requirements for producing the biodiesel coproducts, i.e., soybean meal and crude glycerin have been removed from the biodiesel inventory. In addition, estimates in table 4 also include the energy used to mine, extract, and manufacture the raw materials used to produce the final energy product. The sum of these energy values was included in the estimates to derive the total energy associated with each farm input required to produce a bushel of soybeans. Input efficiencies for fossil energy sources which were estimated with Argonne's GREET model were used to calculate these additional energy input values. In particular, GREET estimated the energy efficiency of gasoline at 80.5 percent; 84.3 percent for diesel fuel; 89.8 percent for LPG; 94.0 percent for natural gas; and 98.0 percent for coal (Shapouri et al., 2002) . Boiler efficiency of 80 percent was used for the steam production (Ahmed et al., 1994) and the conversion efficiency of 70 percent was used for methanol production from natural gas (Kiso and Arashi, 1998) .

The reduction in the electricity (45%) and natural gas energy (28%) contributed in the reduction of total oil crushing energy."}]
