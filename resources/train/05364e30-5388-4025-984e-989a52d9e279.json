A\u03b2 is generated from the transmembrane polypeptide called amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretase enzymes [1, 2] . \u03b2-secretase or \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) is the important rate-limiting enzyme and its increased activity may lead to the elevation of A\u03b2 in the brain [1, 2] . Previous studies discovered that AD subjects have increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) BACE enzymatic activity compared with the controls [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . So researchers hypothesized that BACE enzymatic activities in CSF may become potential biomarkers for AD.\nThe recent development of a sensitive assay for BACE in CSF makes it feasible to study the association between CSF BACE enzymatic activity and AD [13] . Moreover, the use of quantitative traits in genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been shown to increase statistical power over case-control designs [14] .

A source of BACE using either purified recombinant truncated BACE, human or rhesus monkey CSF was co-incubated with this BACE substrate.

Interestingly, SNP single nucleotide polymorphism, Chr chromosome this study is the first to show that the rs1481950 risk variant in ATP6V1H significantly affects CSF BACE activity. We found statistically significant differences in CSF BACE activity between the two genotype groups (GG + GT and TT). It is worth noting that this statistical differences between gene polymorphism of ATP6V1H and CSF BACE activity existed in both AD (P = 0.0027) and MCI groups (P = 0.0003). These results indicated that the rs1481950 risk variant (G) in ATP6V1H might significantly increase the CSF BACE activity especially in the AD and MCI individuals. Rs1481950 is in an intronic region. Current studies haven't found the exact mechanisms of impairing the expression of ATP6V1H. However, the roles of intronic regions which have been ignored all the time have attracted the attention of scientists. And more and more studies have proved that intronic region may play some important roles in controling the initiation and termination of transcription. Moreover, common molecular mechanisms for an intronic SNP to alter mRNA levels are to affect transcription, RNA elongation, splicing, or maturation [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .\nThe ATPase, H + transporting, lysosomal 50/57 kDa, V1 subunit H gene (ATP6V1H) at Chr8q11.2 encodes for the V1H subunit of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) [23, 24] . ATP6V1H gene was mainly studied and discussed about its roles in diabetes in previous researches and the data showed that the down-regulation of its gene expression correlates with the presence of type-2 diabetes [25] . Though there is still no research point out a direct relation between ATP6V1H gene and AD, some studies about encoded protein and metabolic process of BACE indicate that mutations of ATP6V1H gene may contribute to the increased BACE activity. V-ATPase belongs to the rotary ATPase family and is a multiprotein membrane complex. The most important function of V-ATPase is to acidify intracellular compartments by using the energy gathered from ATP hydrolysis to pump protons [23] . One of the most important influence factors of BACE activity is PH. Acidic Intracellular environment (PH = 4.5) is optimal for BACE activity. So the dysfunction of V-ATPase may lead to the change of the acidic Intracellular environment and then influence the BACE activity. BACE activity is also associated with mature processing. The mature process of BACE requires the formation of disulfide bonds, glycosylation and some other modification processes [26] . These steps occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi body and may be influenced by the changes of the intracellular environment. Moreover, V-ATPase also plays an important role in lysosomal acidification. Lysosomal pathway is an important degradation pathway of BACE protein [27, 28] . To sum up, V-ATPase may play some important roles in both BACE protein levels and activity.\nThe results also showed that mutations of rs1481950 had significant correlations with the atrophy of ADrelated encephalic regions including middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the results showed that mutations of rs1481950 had significant correlations with the CSF p-tau. These results indicated that mutations of rs1481950 may relate to AD and may influence the volume of AD-related encephalic regions by changing the metabolism of some AD-related proteins such as tau.\nIn this study, we did not find any significant differences in CSF BACE activity among the three diagnostic groups. This aspect of our research is in line with two previous studies including an ADNI cohort study [29, 30] . Some previous studies show different results including increased activity in MCI and AD [31] , and increased BACE1 activity in MCI but not in AD [13, 32] . These inconsistent results may be explained by the characteristics of the study samples, the wide range of BACE1 activity measurements, and the large overlap between the groups.\nThere are several potential limitations of this study. First, the ADNI-1 sample was limited in sample size when CSF BACE data, different genotypes and diagnosis subgroups were taken into consideration, which makes effective sample size small for some tests. Thus, it will still be necessary to replicate these findings in a larger dataset. Second, recent studies also indicated that except CSF BACE, plasmatic BACE was also associated with AD [33] . The associations among gene polymorphism, CSF BACE, plasmatic BACE and AD still need further study. Third, our sample was restricted to Caucasians to avoid genetics stratification across ethnicities, while all the genes may show different frequencies and polymorphisms in different populations. The relationships between these genes and AD need to be tested in more populations. Fourth, the ADNI database did not cover the detailed classification of the AD patients (sporadic and familial; early onset and late onset). So further studies with a better profile of AD patients should be tested for comparative purposes with other studies."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, after a separate GWAS of CSF BACE, we found a top SNP (rs1481950) in ATP6V1H gene with the P value reaching genome-wide significance and seven suggestive SNPs with the P value lower than 10 \u2212 5 .
