There was a significantly higher APOE4 allele frequency in the high cortical grey matter PET tau group, comparing to low cortical grey matter PET tau group (p=0.048). No significant difference in neuropsychological function was found between APOE4 allele carriers and non-carriers.\nInterpretation: There is an association between higher cortical grey matter tau burden as seen with [F-18]AV-1451 PET tracer SUVR, and the APOE4 allele in former professional and semi-professional players at high risk of concussions.

Retrospective analysis of pathological case series revealed that CTE was associated with irritability, impulsivity, aggression, depression, memory and cognitive impairments, as well as heightened suicidality (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Although the pathological changes of CTE were originally described in boxers (6) (7) (8) , confirmed CTE cases come from a variety of contact sports including American football, hockey, wrestling, and soccer; as well as from military personnel and non-sport related concussions (2, 9, 10) . Two recent studies found strong dose-response relationships between number of years played contact sports and CTE neuropathology (11, 12) . The clinical and pathological presentations of CTE overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, but CTE pathology has its own distinct features (2, 9) . The pathognomonic lesion of CTE, as defined by a National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) meeting, consists of irregular hyperphosphorylated tau deposits in neurons and astroglia, preferentially at the depths of the sulci in the superficial cortical layers and around blood vessels (13) . \u03b2-amyloid and TAR DNA-binding protein inclusions are also reported in some studies (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . There are currently no ante-mortem biomarkers for the tau pathology of CTE, and the diagnosis is made based on post-mortem neuropathological examination of the brain tissue.\nPhosphorylated tau, the pathological substrate of CTE is similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease but has its own distinct features (26) . The use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [F-18] AV-1451 ([F-18]T807; Flortaucipir, AVID Radiopharmaceuticals), a tau specific tracer, allows the detection of abnormal aggregates of phosphorylated tau protein in vivo in AD (27) . Its use in AD has been widely examined and tracer retention correlated with post mortem NFTs containing tau in the form of paired helical filaments (27) (28) (29) (30) . As well, binding was higher in AD patients than in patients with mild cognitive impairment or healthy controls, and tracer binding was associated with worsening cognitive function (31) . PET imaging with [F-18]AV-1451 tau specific tracer shows promise as a potential in vivo biomarker of CTE pathology, however its ability to reliably detect CTE lesions is unclear and requires more investigation (32) (33) (34) . One study reported mildly elevated PET tau binding in two out of nine amyloid negative patients at risk for CTE, with the distribution pattern consistent with CTE pathology stages III-IV. This result suggests PET tau might not be sensitive to CTE lesions in early disease stages (33) . Earlier case reports of this tracer in formerly concussed athletes presented cases of former National Football League (NFL) players with a history of multiple concussions (35, 36) . The first case was of a 71-year-old with memory impairments and a clinical profile similar to AD. The amyloid PET scan was negative so no evidence of AD pathology. The PET tau tracer [F-18]AV-1451 showed predominantly subcortical signal, with the highest signal coming from the basal ganglia and substantia nigra (35) . Tracer retention in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra regions has previously been pathologically confirmed to be off-target binding (27) , but a more recent study described the basal ganglia binding to be correlated with age-related iron accumulation in that region (27, 37) . The second case of [F-18]AV-1451 tracer binding was in a 39 year old athlete with progressive neuropsychiatric issuesspecifically emotional lability and irritability. The amyloid scan was negative, largely ruling out AD pathology, and the PET [F-18]AV-1451 tau scan showed a higher tracer signal in the cortex (36) . Other signal increases were noted in the midbrain, globus pallidus, and the hippocampus, with the midbrain and globus pallidus being pathologically confirmed off-target binding sites (27, 36, 37) . Another study examined the use of the same PET tau tracer in veterans with blast neurotrauma, and found increased tracer signal in the frontal, occipital, and cerebellar brain regions (32) . Finally, a more recent cohort study using [F-18]AV-1451 PET tau tracer found increased bilateral superior frontal, bilateral medial temporal and left parietal SUVRs in 26 former National Football League players comparing to 31 controls. Tau SUVRs in these regions correlated with total years of tackle football among the former players cohort (12) . Even though the exact CTE incidence among athletes is unclear, not all individuals with exposure to contact sports and repetitive head impacts develop CTE (4, 5, 22, 23) . Genetics might play a role in increasing CTE susceptibility. There is growing evidence that some genetic polymorphisms increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (38, 39) . Allelic variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases (40) . The two missense polymorphisms in APOE underly the three molecular isoforms (41) : APOE epsilon 2 (\u03b52), APOE epsilon 3 (\u03b53), and APOE epsilon 4 (\u03b54). APOE4 has been shown to increase the risk of AD (39, 41) . The exact mechanism by which APOE4 influences AD risk is not yet understood, however increasing evidence points to the amyloid hypothesiswhere APOE4 directly, and indirectly influences amyloid beta metabolism (42) . The relationship between APOE alleles and tau pathology is less clear. Some authors propose an interaction between amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, where amyloid fibrils increase tau phosphorylation and aggregation (43) . Therefore, APOE4 may have an indirect effect on tau accumulation through amyloid. However, some in vitro animal studies demonstrated a direct effect of APOE on tau pathogenesis (44, 45) . In context of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), APOE4 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with TBIs (41) . Additionally, the APOE4 allele has been associated with elevated post-concussion symptoms in military veterans (46) , and increased phosphorylated tau levels in the brains of a blast-injury mouse model (47) . This provides limited, but possible evidence for an association between APOE and tau pathology in TBI cases.\nAnother polymorphism implicated in neurodegeneration is in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, which is responsible for the production of tau protein (48) . Mutations in the MAPT gene may lead to abnormal structure and function of tau, and currently almost 60 MAPT mutations are linked to neurodegeneration. There are two main MAPT haplotypes -H1 and H2 (38, 49) . The H1 haplotype is associated with an increased risk of developing 4-repeat tauopathiesprogressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Previous research highlighted that the H1 haplotype is significantly overrepresented in pathologically confirmed CBD and PSP populations, compared to controls (50) (51) (52) (53) . The literature examining MAPT haplotypes in relation to head impacts and CTE is limited, however one study found a slight increase in frequency of MAPT H1/H1 genotype in men with contact sports exposure and confirmed CTE pathology, comparing to men with contact sports exposure without CTE pathology and to clinical controls (23) .\nThis study examines the effect of the APOE4 allele and MAPT H1H1 on SUVRs of PET tau-specific [F-18]AV-1451 tracer in former professional contact sport athletes at risk for CTE. We hypothesize that carriers of APOE4 allele and/or H1H1 carriers will have higher PET [F-18]AV-1451 signal."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Thirty-eight athletes engaged in sports with high risk of concussions were included as part of this ongoing study.

All between-group demographics and neuropsychological testing comparisons were completed using an independent samples t-test, with the type of scanner comparison completed using Fisher's exact test. The number of concussions was not found to be normally distributed, therefore all between-group concussion number comparisons were completed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Due to the small sample size, participants had to be grouped based on APOE4 carrier and non-carrier status. Regarding the MAPT genecarriers of H1H2 and H2H2 diplotypes had to be grouped together and compared to carriers of H1H1 diplotype. The difference in mean cortical grey matter PET [F-18]AV-1451 SUVRs between carriers and non-carriers of specific alleles and diplotypes was determined using one-way ANCOVA, controlled for age. Neuropsychological assessment scores between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers were also determined using an independent samples t-test. The cortical PET tau SUVR values among the study population presented on a continuum, ranging from 0.95 to 1.57.

The results of this study showed a significant association between the presence of an APOE4 allele and higher cortical grey matter PET [F-18]AV-1451 SUVR, currently believed to be a marker of tau burden in AD. As well, APOE4 carriers were more frequent among the high cortical PET tau group, compared to the low cortical tau group. No association was found between MAPT H1H1 carrier status and cortical grey matter PET [F-18]AV-1451 SUVR.\nThe exact direct or indirect mechanism that implicates APOE in tau burden is still unclear. APOE is present in the cytoplasm of nerve cells, where it may interact with other molecules in an isoformdependent manner (71) . Tau is a microtubule-associated protein implicated in axonal transport (72) , and previous findings show a decreased affinity of APOE4 towards the microtubule-binding domain of tau protein (71) . This makes tau more vulnerable to being hyperphosphorylated, and therefore unable to bind microtubules, leading to its aggregation and consequently pathology (73) . Furthermore, APOE4 showed increased binding to A\u03b2 which is implicated in increased senile plaque formation in AD (74, 75) . Autopsy studies showed greater staining for senile plaques in the brains of APOE4 homozygotes than APOE3 homozygotes (58, 75) . In the most recent literature, tau and amyloid were proposed to work together synergistically to amplify each other's abnormal aggregation and subsequent tau-associated cognitive decline, specifically in the context of AD (76) . In the current study, of the 9 participants who had CSF analysis all were negative for AD biomarkers. The remaining 29 participants showed no typical AD atrophy on MRI or tracer signal retention on PET, so there is no obvious evidence to suspect that the results of our study are due to an underlying AD pathology. Our cohort is that of former contact sport athletes at risk for neurodegeneration, especially CTE, and the pathophysiology behind CTE is mainly defined by abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. The exact pathophysiology behind the toxic function of tau aggregates remains unclear. However, it is hypothesized that abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau disrupt the normal cellular transport within the axons, leading to synapse loss and ultimate neuronal deathresulting in disrupted neural circuits and eventual cognitive decline (77) . Previous studies highlight a close relationship between tau pathology, neuronal loss and disease severity in AD and other tauopathies (78, 79) . The lack of association between tau burden and MAPT H1H1 may not be unexpected given that this diplotype prevalence is elevated in PSP and CBD, wherein the underlying tau pathology is a 4-repeat isoform tauopathy and a straight filament, whereas CTE is similar to AD with a mixture of both 3-and 4-repeat and a paired helical filament, and so very different (80) .\nThe role of APOE4 in concussion remains unclear. Most previous studies examining the potential effect of APOE4 included TBIs of various severity in diverse populations, making between-study comparisons difficult. An association between APOE4 alleles and concussion has been reported in college athletes (73, 74) , and there is evidence for an increased risk of bleeding following TBI in APOE4 carriers, which may prolong recovery (74) . A prospective study in college athletes did not, however, find an association between APOE4 and the risk of first concussion (81) . Among army veterans, APOE4 allele carriers showed poorer performance on memory tasks following TBI compared to non-carriers but no difference in executive function (82) . A meta-analysis showed an association between APOE4 and increased risk of poor outcome 6-months post TBI (83) . However, another study using the same 6-month post TBI follow up duration found no relationship between APOE4 and patient prognosis (84) . Specific to athletes, the presence of APOE4 has been associated with increased symptom reporting following a sportrelated concussion (46) and boxers who were APOE4 carriers showed worse neurological outcome (85) . There does not appear to be an increased risk of suffering a concussion in APOE4 carriers (73, 74) . The results of our study are similar to previous research, where we found no significant association between APOE4 and concussion history or performance on neuropsychological assessments, however, we did find that APOE4 carriers had elevated tau burden as measured with PET [F-18]AV-1451.\nThere are a number of limitations to the current study. First, the small sample size and lack of a replication cohort limit the statistical power. As well, the total years of play for all athletes was not collected, missing an opportunity to examine the effect of total years of play on neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. Next, participant cohort is highly varied with regards to age, concussion number, and performance on neuropsychological tests. There is also no matched healthy control group. Presence of a reliable control group with no history of contact sports would have provided a PET tau SUVR cut-off that could be used to divide participants into groups with normal and elevated tau burden. Furthermore, making a comparison between the high and low PET tau groups by dropping the middle third of the cohort decreased the total number of participants significantly, reducing the power for that specific analysis. Another limitation is the solely neuropathological nature of CTE diagnosis, leaving us unable to tell whether any of the participants have underlying CTE related changes. The results of this study are thus generalizable to former professional and semi-professional sport athletes at high risk of concussions with no evidence of active neurodegenerative changes. One limitation of the current study is lack of information with regards to race of included participants. Previous studies reported differences in APOE allele frequencies between populations(86-89), and APOE4 was found to be a determinant of AD risk in whites. Earlier studies reported that African Americans and Hispanics have an increased frequency of AD regardless of their APOE genotype, however the most recent literature showed that APOE4 has a weak association with AD incidence among African Americans and Hispanics, in comparison to white populations (88, (90) (91) (92) (93) . With regards to MAPT, the H2 haplotype was reported to be almost exclusively Caucasian in origin (94) . Finally, the use of cerebellar grey matter as a PET reference region has been widely studied and established for use in AD, but not in concussion. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported within a concussed cohort (95) , and therefore the cerebellum might not be the ideal reference region in TBI cases. One study examining the [F-18]AV-1451 tracer in veterans with blast neurotrauma used a different reference region (ie. isthmus of cingulate) for its PET tau analysis(32) rather than the usual reference region of the cerebellum used in the athletes' PET studies described above (32, 35, 36) . Further research is warranted in this area.\nOverall, our results suggest a relationship between APOE4 and tau burden as measured by [F-18]AV-1451 in the brain of athletes at risk for delayed neurodegeneration and CTE. A marked feature of CTE pathology is the abnormal aggregates of phosphorylated tau protein within the cortex in the form of NFTs. The increased tracer signal in the cortex of APOE4 carriers could signify a neurodegenerative process and PET tau may be a biomarker for this process, but more research is needed to establish that. for intellectual content.
