[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Understanding innovation is core to understanding economic growth. Unfortunately, defining and quantifying innovative activity is extremely difficult. Much of the research in the U.S. concerning innovation has attempted to measure inputs to innovation. 1 Some of these efforts focus on counts of patents while others focus on capturing research and development activities. As an example of the latter, since 1953, the National Science Foundation (NSF) in conjunction with two U.S. statistical agencies has collected data on research and development activities in the U.S. We use data from this survey, the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), to provide a detailed picture of the top R&D performing firms in the U.S. economy. In this manner, we hope to provide a view of some of the innovative activities in the U.S. We create an unusually rich portrait of these top R&D performing firms by combining SIRD data with a research dataset developed at the Census Bureau. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) provides a limited set of information for nearly all establishments in the U.S. non-farm private economy for the period 1976 to 2010. Thus, the LBD enables us to supplement the firm-level information from the SIRD with establishment-level information. Linking the SIRD and the LBD allows us to describe the evolution of the top R&D performing firms in the U.S and to compare R&D performing firms to firms in the whole economy. We start by looking at all firms that performed R&D in 2003. We find R&D performing firms comprise a small percentage of all U.S. firms. We analyze the distribution of R&D expenditures among these firms. We examine whether various firm characteristics, such as size, age, and structure impact the firm's decision to conduct R&D, and if so, by how much. Narrowing our focus to the top 200 R&D performing firms, we compare these top 200 firms to other R&D performing firms and firms in the rest of the economy. To preview our findings, we find top R&D firms are more likely to be large, older, multinational, multi-unit firms in the manufacturing sector who engage in international trade when compared to other R&D performing firms. Our focus then moves to the dynamics of these top 200 firms, paying attention to their persistence and evolution. We find R&D performing firms, and in particular the top 200 R&D performing firms, are persistent relative to firms in the economy as a whole. More than half of the top 200 R&D performing firms in 2003 are over 25 years old, whereas only slightly more than a tenth of all the firms in the economy in 2003 are over 25 years old. In terms of their evolution, most of the top 200 R&D firms in 2003 that were also in existence in 1976 (and had R&D data in both years) were also top R&D performers in 1976. These firms managed to stay on top by more than doubling their real R&D expenditures. Top 200 R&D firms in 2003 who existed in 1976 but were not in the top group made their way into the top 200 by 2003 through even more dramatic increases in R&D expenditures. For the smaller set of R&D top performers in 2003 who did not exist in 1976, most of them started out as relatively small single units. These entrants then experienced rapid growth. Our study contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, very few studies follow the evolutionary path of R&D performing firms. Our study, which utilizes Census microdata allows us to follow 200 of the top performing R&D firms in 2003 back to 1976 (and potentially back to 1957) and chart their evolution. Second, the coverage of our cross-sectional study is much larger than existing studies looking at the determinants of R&D activity. The largest study in the current literature uses Compustat data for publicly-traded companies and more often, studies focus on a subset of firms that are known to conduct R&D (i.e., they suffer some selection bias). Our sample, when weighted, is representative of the U.S. economy where the majority of firms conduct little to no R&D. While we examine the characteristics of firms that undertake R&D activity, we do not examine outcomes -i.e., whether R&D expenditures are translated into innovations and ultimately into higher economic and productivity growth. Clearly not all R&D expenditures result in innovations and not all innovations result in productivity growth. 2 Our study instead focuses on the potential relationship between R&D expenditures and various firm attributes. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides context for our analysis by summarizing results of existing work on the characteristics and evolution of R&D performing firms. Section 3 describes the data and measurement issues. Basic firm characteristics of R&D performers are described in Section 4. The main results regarding the dynamics of the top 200 R&D performing firms are presented in Section 5. Section 6 provides conclusions and some potential future extensions to our research."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Our main variable of interest in this paper is R&D activity, which we proxy by total R&D expenditures. Other researchers measure innovative activity by company R&D expenditures, counts of innovations from trade journals, patent counts, and patent citations. 3 Each of these measures has strengths and weaknesses and some are simply not available for all of the firms in our sample. 4 While there are numerous strands in the economic literature concerning the characteristics of firms that successfully undertake R&D activity, we focus on those areas of the literature we can address with our data. 5 For our cross-sectional study, we examine the effects of firm size, firm age, firm structure, trade status, and industry competitiveness on R&D. For the evolution study, we analyze R&D expenditures, firm size, firm age, and firm structure."}, {"section_title": "Firm Size", "text": "One of the early commentators on the effects of firm size on innovation was Schumpeter (1942) who believed large firms are the engines of innovative activities. Arguments that large firms are more likely to engage in innovative activities often cite large firms' relative advantage in terms of risk diversification and access to internal funds. Furthermore, when a large firm has significant market control, the firm is more likely to be able to capture the output of the innovation. Many authors have offered counter arguments for why large firms are in fact less likely to be innovators. These arguments include that large firms face greater coordination issues and lack the flexibility needed to stay on the cutting edge of innovation. 6 The discussion is similar to the debate concerning firm size and other economic activities such as job creation and destruction (see Jarmin, Haltiwanger, and Miranda, 2013). As summarized below, most of the empirical evidence suggests at best a weakly positive relationship between firm size and innovations (as measured by R&D expenditures). Griliches (1980) examines the relationship between R&D expenditures and firm size using a sample of large R&D performing companies from the SIRD. His baseline regression results suggest that there is a positive relationship between R&D expenditures and size. However, once he includes controls for data issues (imputations) and differences in specialization, this relationship disappears. 7 Similarly, Cohen et al. (1987) find the positive relationship between firm size and R&D expenditures disappears once they control for industry (and remove outliers). 8 However, they do find size has a positive impact on the probability that the firm is an R&D performer. Meanwhile, other studies document the positive relationship between firm size and R&D expenditures. Bound et al. (1984) using Compustat data from 1976 find R&D expenditures rise with firm size. Akcigit and Kerr (2010), using the same underlying datasets that we use, also find R&D expenditures rise with firm size. Many of these authors refine the analysis between size and expenditures to consider the relationship between R&D intensity and firm size. For example, Bound et al. 5 Some examples of items that have previously been linked with R&D activity include institutional ownership (Bushee 1998;Aghion et al. 2013), and R&D experience (Garcia-Quevado et al. 2011;Guellec and de la Potterie, 2003;Myriam and Michel 2007) Unfortunately, due to incomplete nonpanel coverage of the survey and lack of financial information linked to the survey, we are unable to verify the findings from these cases. 6 Teece (1992) questions the relevancy of this argument about firm size and innovation: \" [d]iscussions of the link between firm size and innovation are outmoded because the boundaries of the firm have become fuzzy in recent decades. Strategic alliances -constellations of bilateral agreements among firms -are increasingly necessary to support innovative activities (p. 447).\" 7 Griliches (1980) uses SIRD data from 1957-65 linked to Census of Manufactures data and Enterprise Statistics data. His sample is 883 large R&D performing manufacturing companies (companies with at least 1,000 employees). Company size is the log of the average of the value added output for the company in 1957 and 1963. R&D expenditures are the log of the R&D total expenditures cumulated over 1957-1965. 8 Cohen et al. (1987) use line of business data for about 300 large companies in the U.S. (1984) find R&D intensity is roughly constant over firm size but that there are nonlinearities in the relationship: very small and very large firms are more R&D intensive than average-sized firms. Akcigit and Kerr (2010) show R&D intensity falls with firm size. Using Compustat data, Akcigit (2009) also finds R&D intensity is negatively related to firm size. Other work refines the discussion of firm size and innovation to take into account other characteristics of the firm besides industry. Audretsch (1987, 1988) find there is an interaction between firm size and market structure when analyzing innovations. 9 Specifically, large firms have an innovation advantage in relatively concentrated markets, while small firms have an innovation advantage when markets are more competitive. A series of papers examines the relationship between firm size and types of R&D. Mansfield (1981) shows large firms carry out disproportionately more basic R&D but disproportionately less R&D aimed at new products and processes. Cohen and Klepper (1996) refine the argument concerning firm size and R&D activity to focus on the relationship between business unit size and the composition of R&D activity in terms of product versus process innovation. 10 They find large firms have a cost-advantage when it comes to R&D relative to small firms and this advantage is especially evident for process innovations. Akcigit and Kerr (2010) categorize R&D as exploration or exploitation using patent data linked to the SIRD. Exploration R&D represents a firm's attempt to create a new product or become the leader in a market (measured as patents that do not self-cite). Exploitation R&D represents a firm's refinements to improve existing product lines (measured as patents that self-cite). Their results reveal exploitation R&D is associated with larger scale firms, while exploration R&D does not have as strong a firmsize relationship.\nIn keeping with much of the empirical literature using Census microdata, we measure firm size by the number of employees at the firm. 34 It is clear that Top2003 firms are larger than other R&D performing firms. As shown in Table 2, the median Top2003 firm has over 11,000 employees, while the median R&D performing firm has 28 employees. 35 These differences are even more stark when compared to all firms in the U.S. economy. To further highlight the relationship between firm size and R&D, Figure 6 breaks down the number of R&D performing firms and their activity by firm size. Firms with more than five thousand employees comprise around 1% of all firms reporting R&D, yet contribute more than 60% of total R&D expenditures. Figure 7 shows the relationship between size (log Employment) and R&D expenditures. There is a positive relationship between firm size and R&D and the elasticity is almost one-to-one, which is similar to the findings in Bound et al. (1984) who looked at publicly-traded firms in Compustat."}, {"section_title": "Firm Age", "text": "The debate on business dynamics and firm size has shifted more recently to firm age. Jarmin, Haltiwanger, and Miranda (2013) use the LBD to reexamine the relationship between firm size and employment growth. While the existing literature had found a positive relationship between firm size and employment growth, they discover this relationship disappears once they control for firm age. Most new jobs are created by young businesses and young businesses also have a high job destruction rate. Given these findings, we consider firm age along with firm size in this paper. Akcigit and Kerr's (2010) model predicts that younger firms are more innovative than older firms. They posit this is because \"[b]y their nature, the smaller firms and new entrants are focused on exploration innovations (p.2).\" They find evidence consistent with this in their data, but 9 Innovations are measured using the Small Business Administration's database of innovations derived from information listed in over 100 technology, engineering, and trade journals. Thus, they measure the outcomes of innovative activities rather than one of its inputs, R&D expenditures The correlation between their measure of innovations and total R&D expenditures is only 0.48 but when focusing on company R&D expenditures is 0.75. We rely on total R&D expenditures in this paper. 10 The important difference between product and process innovation relates to the appropriability of the innovation. Process innovations cannot be sold in disembodied form to other firms, thus all benefits must be captured within the firm. Firms that are larger can spread these costs over a larger amount of output. do not formally look at the impact of age noting that the relationship in their model is driven by the positive relationship between firm size and firm age.\nThere are multiple ways to define the age of a firm. For example, age can be defined from the first appearance of the firm identifier or based on the age of the oldest establishment associated with the firm. Following Jarmin, Haltiwanger, and Miranda (2013), we define firm age as the age of the oldest establishment associated with the firm in the first year the firm identifier appears in the LBD. 36 Since the LBD begins in 1976, the oldest possible age for a firm in 2003 is 27 years. Top performing R&D firms tend to be older firms. As shown in Table 1, in 2003, the median age of firms in the LBD is 11 and for the subset of multi-unit firms is 25. The median age of all firms with positive R&D expenditures in 2003 is 16 and the median age of the Top2003 firms is censored at 27. Figure 8 shows the percent of firms by age category for the whole economy (all firms in the LBD), for multi-units only (all multi-unit firms in the LBD), for firms with 34 Some researchers measure size using output or sales. Griliches (1980) uses value-added output. Acs and Audretsch (1987) and Akcigit and Kerr (2010) use sales as the denominators when calculating their innovation rates. Akcigit and Kerr (2010) also categorize firms by the number of their establishments. 35 To ensure no confidential information is disclosed, reported medians are \"fuzzy\" medians, where the \"fuzzy\" median is the mean of all observations between the 45 th and 55 th percentiles. 36 Establishment age is defined as the first appearance of an establishment in the LBD with positive employment. We require positive employment because we measure firm size by employment. Note because employment is defined in the LBD as of March 12 th , it is possible for an establishment to have zero employment and positive payroll in a given year. positive R&D in 2003, and the Top2003 firms for the year 2003. Top2003 firms are older firms. Close to 65% of Top2003 firms are 27 years old or older, while only about 6% of the Top2003 firms are 10 years old or younger. (Recall that we also know from the \"Griliches\" dataset that over 35% of Top2003 firms have been in existence and doing R&D for over 45 years.) In the whole economy, only around 17% of firms are 27 years old or older, while about 50% of firms in the whole economy are 10 years old or younger. A more apt comparison is between the ages of the Top2003 firms and the ages of multiunit firms in the LBD. About 20% of multi-unit firms in the LBD are 10 years old or younger, while only about 6% of the Top2003 firms are 10 years old or younger. Top2003 firms are also older than firms with positive R&D expenditures in 2003; about 25% of these firms are 27 years old or older."}, {"section_title": "Firm Structure", "text": "There are many aspects of the firm's structure that could impact innovation. We focus on very basic characteristics: whether the firm contains multiple establishments (multi-unit) and/or multiple broad locations (multinationals). These characteristics will help us understand the evolution of R&D performers over time. Specifically, we know that most firms start out as small, single-unit firms (Haltiwanger, 2011) we want to determine if the large R&D performers retain this structure or whether they expand in terms of the number of establishments and in the diversity of location. We are interested in whether a firm becomes a multi-unit firm, a conglomerate firm, and/or a multinational firm. While there are very interesting questions about more details concerning other forms of diversification and firm structure (such as the ownership structure), we do not have the data to answer many of these questions. 11\nR&D performing firms are more than twice as likely to be multi-unit firms than SIRD respondents as a whole. Further, approximately 87% of all R&D expenditures in 2003 are associated with multi-unit firms. When comparing to the economy as a whole, we use employment as our metric of economic activity. Employment at multi-unit firms in 2003 accounts for close to all employment at Top2003 firms, 92% for R&D performers, and 57% for all firms. Thus, the economic activity of Top2003 firms is more concentrated in multi-unit firms than is the case for R&D performers as a whole and for the economy as a whole. Top2003 firms have over 50,000 establishments associated with them in 2003. There is large variation in the number of establishments in each firm. The median number of establishments in Top2003 firms is 60, with the maximum number of establishments exceeding a thousand establishments. By comparison, the median number of establishments for both R&D performers who are multi-units and multi-units in the whole economy is three in both cases. 37 We also look at whether the R&D activities take place within stand-alone R&D laboratories or in production facilities. The prevalence of stand-alone laboratories may be related to the industry of the firm. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the R&D expenditures for R&D performing firms so we cannot distinguish between firms that perform R&D at multiple locations from firms that perform R&D in a centralized location (unless they occur over multiple states). However, using the LBD we can provide some information about the prevalence of establishments that are dedicated to R&D. We define these dedicated establishments as those establishments that are classified as being in Scientific Research and Development Services (NAICS 5417, hereafter R&D Services). In 2003, R&D performing firms where the firm as a whole is classified in R&D Services had 12.5 billion dollars in total R&D expenditures, which represents about 6% of total R&D expenditures. Thus, most R&D expenditures are taking place in firms that are not classified as dedicated to scientific R&D research. Just under 5% of R&D performers in 2003 have at least one establishment in this industry. However, more than 60% of the Top2003 firms have at least one establishment in R&D Services. Of these Top2003 firms, 17% have a single establishment in R&D services and roughly 25% have two to five establishments in R&D services."}, {"section_title": "Multi-Units", "text": "A very large literature has formed around the debate over whether conglomerates allocate resources more efficiently than do stand-alone firms (see for example Scharfstein and Stein, 2000). Not surprisingly, this debate extends to the area of innovation. Those arguing that conglomerates are likely to encourage innovation note firms that offer more product lines have greater diversification in their revenue streams, which allows them to engage in more R&D due to their ability to spread risk more evenly (Doi, 1985). Yet, in the same study looking at the 101 largest manufacturing firms in Japan in the 1980's, Doi finds a negative relationship between diversification (e.g., the number of products offered) and R&D activity. The empirical evidence has been mixed. For example, two recent papers using patents as the measure of innovative activity come to very different conclusions. Belenzon et al. (2009) find most innovating firms in the U.S. are publicly traded conglomerates (innovation also includes a measure of scientific publications). On the other hand, Seru (2010) finds U.S. conglomerates produce not only fewer innovations but that these innovations are of lower quality than standalones. Our study, which ties in the firm's single/multi-unit status with R&D data for a large representative set of firms will address this question."}, {"section_title": "Multinationals", "text": "Trade between subsidiaries is another common explanatory variable used to determine the level of R&D. The reasoning is similar to the multi-segment argument: multinationals can spread the risk of R&D more evenly across locations (with the caveat that multinationals can also engage in greater specialization). Offshoring low-value tasks abroad allows the domestic firm to engage in more high-skilled, specialized activities, such as R&D. On other hand, it has been suggested that offshoring and royalty payments to subsidiaries may substitute for in-house R&D expenditures (Siddharthen, 1988). There are almost no empirical studies that analyze how multinational activity or trade impacts the R&D decision, making ours one of the first.\nAnother distinguishing characteristic of R&D performers is their substantial amount of trade (imports plus exports) and multinational status. In 2003, one out of five firms that perform R&D are multinationals and nearly all Top2003 firms are multinationals. These multinational R&D performing firms appear to be substantively different from the typical R&D performing firm in the SIRD sample. For one, they are much larger than average. The average multinational R&D performing firm has 1,860 employees (versus the 444 employees found in the typical R&D firm) and conducts nearly three times as much R&D as the average R&D performing firm and more than 30 times as much R&D as non-multinational firms ($23M versus $0.8M). Finally, we find that the firms in our sample who are multinationals are more likely to have positive R&D activity. Of the firms in our sample, more than 38% of multinational firms have positive R&D. These figures imply there is potentially a significant relationship between R&D activity and multinational activity. Trade also appears to be linked with R&D as the cumulative trade (imports plus exports) of R&D performers accounts for nearly 60% of U.S. trade, and the Top2003 account for nearly a third of all U.S. trade. Besides importing and exporting at higher levels, R&D performers are also more likely to trade in general. Close to 55% of all R&D performers in the 2003 SIRD executed at least one international transaction, compared to 8% of all SIRD respondents. The R&D performers who had at least one international trade transaction also appear to be different from the average R&D firm. They perform nearly twice as much R&D as the average R&D firm, and nearly 15 times as much R&D as firms that do not trade ($9M versus $0.6M). They are also on average 15 times larger than R&D performing firms that do not conduct trade."}, {"section_title": "Industry Competitiveness", "text": "Firms that have greater monopolistic power have greater incentives to innovate because they are able to better appropriate the returns from their R&D investment (Gilbert and Newbery, 1982;Blundell et al., 1999). On the other hand, in highly competitive industries, R&D may equate to the survival of the firm so that more firms engage in R&D activity. Aghion et al. (2005) hypothesize that the relationship between competition and innovation is an inverted U-shape. In their model, competition has the effect of simultaneously increasing the profit that comes from innovation while also reducing the incentives for innovation. In our analysis, we construct Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI) for firms based on their lead 4-digit NAICS industry code and levels of employment to test this notion. To summarize, the literature has identified numerous characteristics associated with R&D expenditures. These studies have been conducted mainly on a small subset of known R&D performing firms or publicly-traded firms, which limits their applicability to firms across the economy. Our linked SIRD-LBD sample, when weighted, is representative of U.S. economy and provides insight into both the types of firms who choose to conduct R&D in the first place, as well as the level of their activity.\nWe calculate a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) measure of industry competitiveness for each industry. We calculate the HHI by first calculating the share of employment of the firm relative to the total employment of all firms classified by the lead 4-digit NAICS code. We then sum up the squares of this figure for all firms within each industry code. Firms in less competitive markets will have higher HHI. In Table 1, we see R&D performers are in less competitive industries than firms as a whole and that TOP2003 firms are in even less competitive industries than R&D performers."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measurement Issues", "text": "The empirical exercises in this paper use four micro-level Census datasets. The primary dataset is the firm-level SIRD data which is available from 1972 to 2007. We supplement this R&D data with earlier SIRD data from the \"Griliches\" historical dataset, data from the LBD, and data on trade and multinational status from the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). In this section of the paper, we describe the relevant features of these datasets. As with all Census confidential data, results reported from empirical exercises using these data must pass strict disclosure avoidance review. Operationally, this means that all identifying information will be suppressed in this paper. 12"}, {"section_title": "Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD)", "text": "Apart from case studies, much of the literature on R&D activity in the U.S. relies upon either Compustat data or SIRD data. Both datasets have strengths and weaknesses in terms of scope and availability of related information. We rely on the SIRD as we are able to link it directly to other Census microdatasets that provide broad coverage of the U.S. economy. Bound et al. (1984) note in spite of definitional differences, the two datasets are relatively similar at the industry level for company R&D expenditures. Researchers have used the SIRD microdata to examine the relationship between R&D expenditures and firm productivity; buyouts, mergers and acquisitions; patenting activity; learning by doing; and import competition. 13 The SIRD collects information on R&D performed by businesses (as opposed to academia or government) in the U.S. . The SIRD collects data on total R&D expenditures and details of these expenditures by type (basic research, applied research, and development) and source of funding (Federal R&D funds versus company R&D funds). 14 The SIRD was collected as a joint partnership between the NSF (the sponsoring agency) and the Census Bureau from 1957 to 2007. Starting with the reference year 2008, the SIRD survey underwent a substantial redesign and was renamed the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). We provide a detailed discussion of the SIRD sample selection process and various data and measurement issues in our Data Appendix. The SIRD sample scope and coverage have changed over time making comparisons using the entire sample over time difficult. In addition, certain data items are collected as mandatory questions (as opposed to optional questions) and therefore are likely to have higher response rates (and thus likely higher quality data). Further, industry is not collected on the survey but rather is derived from establishment-level data rolled up to the firm level using payroll as the activity variable. Thus, all of the R&D expenditures in a firm are assigned to only one industry potentially masking the diversity of R&D activity. Furthermore, using payroll as the activity measure may be misleading in some cases; we discuss this issue in more detail in the Data Appendix. Finally, since the SIRD is a firm level rather than establishment-level survey, mergers and acquisitions complicate our attempts to link firms over time. These data issues lead us to our basic strategy of focusing on the core activities of large R&D performers. That is, we focus mostly on data from mandatory questions and companies that are likely to have been included in the SIRD with certainty. A useful way to think about the SIRD survey is as\"\u2026 two surveys in one. One survey which has existed from the earliest days of the data collection is a survey of companies thought to have the largest R&D expenditures. (NRC p.79, 2005)\" We chose to focus on the large R&D companies. This is not a novel strategy when using the SIRD; numerous other research papers using the microdata from the SIRD have also focused on large companies (Griliches, 1986). 13 Productivity: Griliches (1980Griliches ( , 1986, Lichtenberg and Siegel (1991), Nguyen and Kokkelenberg (1991), Adams and Jaffe (1994). Buyouts, mergers and acquisitions: Siegel (1989, 1990), Ravenscraft (1993a, 1993b). Patenting activity: Kerr and Fu (2008), Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). Learning by doing: Jarmin (1996). Import competition: Scherer and Huh (1992). 14 The SIRD also collects data on items such as net sales, total domestic employment, distribution of R&D by state, number of scientists and engineers, wages and salaries of R&D personnel, costs of materials and supplies consumed, and depreciation on R&D property and equipment. In the SIRD, total R&D expenditures include the following: basic research (\"the planned, systematic pursuit of new knowledge or understanding toward general application\"), applied research (\"the acquisition of knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need\"), and development (\"the application of knowledge or understanding toward the production or improvement of a product, service, process, or method\"). These variables do not include quality control, routine product testing, market research, sales promotion, routine technical services, or research in the social sciences. Total R&D expenditures are for R&D that is performed both within the respondents' company and within the U.S. (see section A.2 in the Data Appendix for more details). Figure 1 shows the level of total R&D expenditures in constant dollars as measured by the SIRD from 1953 to 2007 for the published data (solid line) and the underlying available microdata (dashed line). 15 The microdata come close to replicating the published totals in most years, but there are some years where they noticeably diverge. Generally speaking, differences between the published and microdata reflect revisions to the SIRD data. These revisions were applied to the published data but were not carried back to the original micro-level source data. Revisions to the data can occur for a variety of reasons (see Section A.3 of the Data Appendix). We cannot incorporate these revisions into the micro-level data, so we are mindful of suspiciously large changes in our data. The SIRD microdata contain a firm identifier from the Business Register; thus, it is possible to link SIRD microdata over time and to microdata from other Census datasets. The firms in the SIRD are linked over time using consistent firm identifiers that were derived from Census firm identifiers but modified to account for changes in Census processing. The files are cleaned to take in to account differences in data retention policies over the years (that is, in some years, prior year observations were stored with the current year). 16 There are close to 500,000 firm-year observations representing over 300,000 firms in the longitudinal SIRD dataset spanning 1972. In 2003, the SIRD contains approximately 31,000 firms with approximately $200 billion in R&D expenditures. 17 The firms in the SIRD include a number of firms that do not report positive R&D expenditures. In this paper we distinguish between all of the firms in the SIRD (\"R&D sample\") and firms in the SIRD who report positive total R&D funds (\"R&D performers\"). Only about 20% of the firms in the SIRD reported positive total R&D expenditures in 2003. One of the difficult issues faced when drawing the SIRD sample is identifying firms that perform R&D. In order to be included in the certainty sample in 2003, a firm had to have R&D expenditures of at least $3 million in the 2002 SIRD or to be in top 50 of their strata or state in terms of payroll. 18 The SIRD survey \"imposes a burden on nine firms to find just one that does reportable R&D.\" 19 Consistent with this issue of finding a needle in a haystack, close to 85% of the firms in the longitudinal file appear for only one year in the SIRD. 20 It is important to keep in mind that firms may exit the sample for many reasons other than the death of the firm. The SIRD microdata concerning non-activity is less reliable in earlier years due to the way missing and zero values are captured. Thus, we restrict our analysis of nonactivity to 1994 and later. We find that only about 20% of the firms in our sample actually reported positive R&D expenditures for 1994-2007. Focusing on a slightly more limited set of years, over 60% of firms in 1994-2006 appear in only one year. 21 Of these \"one and done\" firms, only 3% have positive R&D expenditures. While there are a significant number of \"one and done\" firms, we also see many firms appear in the SIRD across multiple years. About 10% of firms in the SIRD appear for between 2 and 6 years. 22 At the other end of the distribution, close to 500 firms appear in every year of the SIRD. as noted earlier, we choose the level of total R&D expenditures as our metric for \"top\" R&D performers. An alternate measure of top R&D performers is the intensity of R&D effort (e.g., ratio of R&D expenditures to total sales revenue). We focus on the level of R&D expenditures since this provides a more direct link to the aggregate level of R&D expenditures in the U.S. There are some firms that have very high R&D intensity measures because they have very little output but do not contribute significantly to overall R&D activity in the U.S. For convenience, we refer to the firms with the top 200 highest total R&D expenditures in 2003 as the \"Top2003\". Before focusing on the top 200 R&D performing firms for one year, it is helpful to look at the characteristics of the top 200 R&D performing firms for our main sample period. We identify the top 200 R&D performing firms based on their total R&D expenditures in each year. Figure 2 shows the published level of total R&D expenditures in constant dollars as measured by the SIRD from 1953 to 2007 (solid line) and the R&D expenditures of top 200 firms in each year for comparison (dashed line). The top 200 firms account for close to the total amount of R&D expenditures until about 1985. Since then, the top 200 firms account for a decreasing share of total R&D expenditures. Nevertheless, the top 200 firms in 2003 still account for about two-thirds of the $200 billion R&D expenditures by businesses. 23 We now focus on the Top2003. There are over 4,500 firm-year observations for the Top2003 in the longitudinal SIRD dataset spanning 1972-2007. Relative to the sample as a whole, these firms appear in more SIRD samples. In fact, approximately 40% 20 The Census Bureau added a question concerning R&D expenditures to its Report of Organization Survey (ROS) to help build the survey frame for the SIRD. R&D questions were also added to the 2007 Economic Census. 21 We do not include 2007, our last year of data, in this analysis of \"one and done\" firms since firms that appear only in 2007 may appear in later years. 22 Firms that appear in multiple years of the SIRD may have gaps in their data (e.g., appear in the data, disappear from the data, and then reappear in a later year). Gaps in the data are expected given the nature of sample selection for the SIRD. Of the firms that appear in multiple years in our data, 51% have no gaps in their data. 23 \"It is estimated that the largest 100 firms account for 54 percent of R&D spending.\" National Research Council (2005), page 20. Note, changes over time in this fraction may be affected by changes in the sample frame and sampling methodology. of Top2003 firms appear in every year and about 85% appear in at least 10 years of the longitudinal SIRD dataset. There are a few instances of gaps in the data, but for the most part, the firms appear in multiple contiguous years. Figure 3 shows the number of Top2003 firms in the SIRD from 1972 to 2007 (solid line) and the number of Top2003 firms that are in the SIRD and among the top 200 R&D performers in that year (dashed line). 24 Many Top2003 firms that are in the SIRD sample historically are also among the top 200 R&D performers in earlier years. Also, there is a small, but notable, drop off in the number of Top2003 firms from 2003 to 2007. This drop is primarily attributable to merger and acquisition activity. SIRD 1957-1977SIRD microdata for 1957-1977 have been recovered for a subset of firms. 25 These data are used in Griliches (1986) and consist of 1957-1977 firm-level data from the SIRD matched to data from Enterprise Statistics and Census of Manufactures data for selected years. The sample is limited to certainty companies from the 1972 SIRD and the final sample contains approximately 1,100 companies. Fortunately, we are able to link the Griliches dataset to the main SIRD dataset using the firm identifiers. In this way, we extend our dataset back to 1957 for a subset of firms."}, {"section_title": "Griliches Dataset of Partial Historical", "text": "We match around 40% of Top2003 firms to the historical Griliches dataset. Over 90% of the matched firms (over 35% of all Top2003 firms) had positive R&D expenditures in 1957. Since the recovered data do not contain the universe of firms or even all SIRD firms, we are limited in our ability to draw conclusions from our match of Top2003 firms to the Griliches data. However, we can say that over 35% of Top2003 firms have been in existence and performing R&D for over 45 years."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Business Database (LBD)", "text": "The Business Register (BR) contains nearly all non-farm private business establishments in the U.S. economy. In 2003, there are approximately 6.1 million establishments in the BR (Fairman et al., 2008). The BR includes information on employment, payroll, industry, and location. 26 The LBD links establishments in the BR over time starting with the year 1976 with a focus on creating high quality links over time (see Jarmin and Miranda, 2002). 27 By matching to the LBD, we can determine whether a firm is in existence in a given year even if the firm does not appear in the SIRD in that year. This allows us to see some of the history of a firm even prior to its appearance in the SIRD. We determine the status of a firm in a given year by relying on the existence of its component establishments in the LBD. Since the LBD only goes back to 1976, SIRD firm-year observations from 1972 through 1975 cannot be matched to the LBD. Using the LBD also enables us to create a measure of firm age (left-censored in 1976). We also use the LBD to learn more about the structure of R&D performing firms. We look at whether firms are single unit or multi-unit and if they are multi-unit the number and nature of their underlying establishments. Given the LBD represents the universe of operating establishments, we expect the match rate between the SIRD and the LBD to be high. We do not expect the match rate to be perfect for a given year since there may be instances when changes in a firm are captured more quickly in one source than in the other. There are two types of firms in Census microdata: firms with more than one establishment (multi-unit firms) and firms with only one establishment (single-unit firms). The matching algorithm used to match SIRD firms to LBD establishments differs for single-units and multi-units. For 1976 to 2007, we are able to match approximately 96% of the single-unit firm-year observations and 99% of the multi-unit firm-year observations from the SIRD to the LBD. We match a very high percentage of Top2003 firms to the LBD. 28 Finally, for 2003 only, we match the entire SIRD to the LBD. As with Top2003 firms, we are able to match a high percentage of SIRD firms to the LBD. We match nearly all multi-unit firms and over 95 percent of single-unit firms"}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD)", "text": "In addition to the LBD, we also link SIRD firms to the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD). The LFTTD contains firm-level transaction data on firm imports and exports from 1992 to 2008. For each transaction, it records the product class (industry code), value, quantity shipped, shipment date, destination/origin, and whether the transaction was conducted between related parties. 29 We use the 2003 LFTTD data in our analysis of R&D performers in 2003. We create a measure of the volume of trade the firm engages in by aggregating the transaction-level import and export data to the firm level. We also use the LFTTD to determine if a firm is a multinational: if a firm has at least one \"related\" party transaction we classify the firm as a multinational. 30"}, {"section_title": "Snapshot of Top R&D Performing Firms", "text": "In this section, we provide a snapshot of R&D performing firms, paying special attention to the Top2003 firms. We start by providing some summary statistics on these firms and then provide details on their size, age, and structure. We compare these Top2003 characteristics to all R&D performing firms, all multi-unit firms, and all firms 28 In some cases, a firm that appears in year t in the SIRD does not appear in year t in the LBD, but we find it in surrounding years of the LBD. This leads to gaps in the data from the LBD. We attempted to fill in these data gaps using various imputation measures but find that we introduce outliers by doing so. Thus, our establishment-year data from the LBD includes some missing values for our Top2003 firms. 29 Transactions are \"related\" if one party controls 6 percent or more of the other party. 30 A similar definition of multinationals is in Bernard et al. (2009). in the economy. 31 Our matching technique allows us to match approximately 1.7 million (sampleweighted) firms from the SIRD in 2003 with the LBD. We limit our sample to the respondents with data on R&D expenditures, which reduces our sample to 1.3 million firms. Table 1 shows summary statistics for the SIRD-LBD match. The matched sample is fairly representative of the whole economy with some minor differences. Matched respondents are disproportionally more likely to be multi-unit firms and are slightly older than the typical LBD firm (compare columns 1 and 3). R&D performing firms are notably different from other firms. R&D performers represent roughly three percent of the total number of firms in our matched sample. They are twice as likely to be multi-unit firms and 20 times more likely to be multinational firms than SIRD respondents as a whole. R&D performers are nearly 15 times larger on average, slightly older and conduct significantly more trade than the average firm. These effects are magnified when we look at the Top2003 firms. Table 2 provides some additional information on R&D performers and Top2003 firms. Top2003 firms account for approximately 65% of total R&D expenditures in 2003. More than half of the scientists and engineers in R&D performing firms work for Top2003 firms. Figure 4 shows much of R&D expenditures are concentrated among the highest spending firms by plotting the distribution of R&D expenditures among the firms in the sample using a kernel density function in 2003. Concentration of R&D activity among Top2003 firms is not restricted to 2003. Figure 5 traces the R&D expenditures of Top2003 firms back to the Griliches data (when possible) and shows total R&D expenditures for all firms (based on the published data). The share of total R&D expenditures accounted for by Top2003 firms varies over time, but generally speaking this group of firms has accounted for at least 40% of total R&D expenditures over our main sample period . We find the persistence of large R&D performing firms over such a long period interesting, and we explore this phenomenon further when we trace the evolution of these firms in Section 5. Equipment, and Chemicals. These three industries also comprise the majority of R&D expenditures in Top2003 firms. Not surprisingly, given known issues with assignment of firms to Wholesale Trade in the pre-2004 SIRD, the next largest concentration of firms in Top2003 firms is in Wholesale Trade. 32 Firms in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (NAICS 54, hereafter PST Services) account for about 14% of total R&D expenditures. In Top2003 firms, PST Services firms account for 7% of total R&D expenditures."}, {"section_title": "Industry composition of R&D activity is presented in", "text": "To compare to the general economy, we use employment as our measure of economic activity. 33 In 2003, employment in manufacturing accounted for about 65% of employment in Top2003 firms, 57% of employment of R&D performers, but only 17% of employment in multi-units and 14% of employment in the economy. Interestingly, the percent of employment accounted for by employment in PST Services is essentially constant at about 5% across the Top2003, R&D performers, multi-units, and the whole economy."}, {"section_title": "Summarizing Characteristics of R&D Performers and of Top2003 Firms", "text": "The preceding discussion has provided a detailed comparison of Top2003 firms to other R&D performing firms and to other firms more generally. In this section, we use regression analysis to closely examine the relationship between R&D expenditures and firm characteristics. To motivate the structure and components of our estimating equation, we incorporate some preliminary findings (such as the log-log relationship between firm size and expenditures) and include the measurable components drawn from Census microdata. Our initial estimating equation is of the form: log RD = \u03b2 1 log SIZE + \u2211 \u03b4 AGE + \u03b2 2 log TRADE + \u03b3 MU + \u03b7 MNC + \u03b2 3 log HHI + \u03b8 i + \u03b5 Where RD is firm R&D expenditures, SIZE is firm employment, AGE k are various firmage dummies, TRADE is total trade by firm (imports + exports from the LFTTD), MU is a dummy for multi-unit firms, MNC is a dummy for multinational firms, HHI is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index measure of industry competitiveness, and \u03b8 i are industry effects. All regression results are weighted by the SIRD sample weight and run on 2003 data only. Since we are taking logs, firms with positive R&D are included in the sample. We first run OLS on this estimating equation. Regression results are shown in Table 4. Column (1) shows the simplest regression and the near-unit elasticity of firm size on R&D activity. 38 When we include the firm age dummies (Columns 2 and 3), we find that controlling only for age, older firms contribute more towards R&D than very young (0-5 years old) firms, but the effect is insignificant. Once we control for firm size, however, the oldest firms (27+) and middle-aged firms (11-15) seem to spend fewer resources on R&D than the very young firms (0-5 years old). Looking at firm and industry structure (Columns 4 and 5), firms that trade, are multinational, multi-unit and in less competitive industries all have significantly positive effects on R&D expenditure prior to accounting for size. Once size is included, we see the magnitudes of the variables decline significantly and the multiunit dummy loses its significance. After accounting for all variables in our specification (Column 6), we find size still plays the dominant role in determining how much firms spend on R&D. Multiple issues may exist with this first estimation attempt. For one, we do not account for the possible bias of excluding all of the non-R&D performers. To account for this selection bias, we implement a Heckman selection model which corrects for this bias by including a Heckman correction term (i.e., inverse Mill's ratio) in the regression. In addition to the selection bias, there may be issues with bias in our log-linear specification due to heteroskedasticity of the sample data. With a log-linear specification, our results may actually underpredict the real effect of these variables (see Haworth and Vincent (1979) and Santos- Silva and Tenreyro (2006) for discussion) due to the concavity of the log function. This disadvantage also applies to the two-stage Heckman selection model which relies heavily on homoscedastic data. Therefore, as an alternative specification, we include Poisson psuedo-maximum likelihood estimation (PPML) which is consistent with heteroskedastic data and also has the benefit of being able to handle zeroes in the dependent variable. 39 Regression results of the improved specification are shown in Table 5. The initial Probit stage of the Heckman selection model (Column 1) reveals that size, trade volume, and multi-unit status are the biggest determinants for whether a firm decides to perform R&D. Results corrected for selection are in Column 3. For the most part, we see relatively small differences between the corrected and uncorrected results (Column 2). Not surprisingly, since multi-unit status was a major predictor of reporting positive R&D, we see a significant jump in magnitude of this coefficient. The PPML estimator results (Column 4) are similar to the log-linear specifications. Many of the coefficients have slightly larger magnitudes and slightly smaller standard errors in the PPML specification as opposed to the log-linear specifications. A rough interpretation of the coefficients tells us that a 1% increase in employment size translates to roughly a 0.8% increase in R&D spending. We see older firms spend less on R&D than very young firms. Trade volume and multinational status are also positively related to R&D spending, as is a firm's multi-unit status. Finally, we see that firms in less competitive markets (i.e., those with higher HHI) spend more on R&D. This result is consistent with the idea that firms better able to appropriate the returns to R&D are spending more on R&D. Having examined the features characterizing top performing R&D firms, we next explore the evolution of these firms."}, {"section_title": "Dynamics of Top R&D Performing Firms", "text": "We now turn our attention to the dynamic properties of Top2003 firms. We begin by examining the persistence of Top2003 firms. Here we are interested in whether the firms existed for a long time and, if so, whether they have also been large R&D performers for a long time. We start by examining the persistence of the Top2003 firms. We briefly consider the flip-side of persistence and examine whether the top 200 firms in 1976 exist in 2003 and are large R&D performers in 2003. We finish our persistence analysis by looking at the persistence of top 200 firms more generally.

By design, firms can be out of the SIRD sample and still be in existence. Therefore, we use the LBD to examine the persistence of Top2003 firms. As an initial exercise, we look for the first appearance of the firm identifier in the LBD. Over half (57%) of Top2003 firms appear in the first year of the LBD, 1976, while only 20% of multi-unit firms in the whole economy in 2003 appear in the first year of the LBD. R&D performers are also persistent relative to firms in the whole economy; 30% of 2003 R&D performers and 14% of firms in the whole economy appear in the first year of the LBD. 40 The first appearance of the firm identifier in the LBD is not always a good measure of persistence because mergers and acquisitions can change firm identifiers over time. Therefore, we also look for the first appearance of any establishment of the firm in the first year the firm identifier appeared in the LBD. By this measure, 65% of Top2003 firms, 41% of multi-units, 46% of R&D performing firms, and only 17% of firms in the whole economy appear in the LBD in 1976. Figure 9 shows the percent of Top2003 firms in existence by year using the following methods to define the firm's first year: (1) first year firm identifier appears in the SIRD; (2) first year firm identifier appears in the LBD; and (3) first year the oldest establishment in the firm (in the first year the firm appears in the LBD) appears in the LBD. Many more firms are identified as in existence using the match to the LBD. This figure demonstrates it is necessary to match the SIRD to the LBD to look at the evolution of Top2003 firms."}, {"section_title": "Persistence of Top R&D Firms More Generally", "text": "While our focus in this paper is on the top 200 R&D performing firms in 2003, we take a moment here to consider the top R&D performing firms in 1976 (henceforth referred to as Top1976).Specifically, we look at the persistence of Top1976 firms through a view forwards over time. We find 58% of the Top1976 are still in existence in 2003 according to the LBD and about 55% of Top1976 firms are in the 2003 SIRD. In terms of their R&D performance over time, over 30% of the Top1976 are still in the top 200 performing R&D ranking by 2003. In fact, the Top1976 firms make up more than half of the Top2003 total R&D expenditures (55%) and more than 35% of total R&D expenditures in 2003. 41 The persistence and survival of top R&D performing firms in 1976 and 2003 appears to hold for other years. As an additional exercise, we look at the 5-year survival rates of top performing R&D firms in each year. Between 1976 and 2003, roughly 90 -95% of the top 200 R&D firms in each year are still in existence 5-years later, with the rate being relatively stable over time. This compares to the roughly 75-85% survival rates of all R&D performing firms during the same period and the 75-80% survival rate of all firms in the LBD with 5 employees or more. This pattern of persistence is also robust to alternative definitions of top performing firms. We separate the sample to look at the composition of firms that make up 50, 65, and 75 percent of total R&D and find similar results with survival rates in the 95 percent range in all years. 42"}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Top2003 Firms", "text": "We examine the evolution of Top2003 firms being careful to use the LBD to determine whether or not a firm is in existence for a particular year. In our initial examination of the evolution of Top2003 firms, we focus on three broad types of firms: 41 Unfortunately, we cannot compare the Top1976 firms that managed to stay at the top with the firms that ceased existing altogether due to identification issues resulting from mergers and acquisitions during the time period. 42 Although the persistence rate is relatively stable, the number of firms that make up 50, 65, and 75 percent of total R&D changes over the time period. Between 1976 and 2003, the number of firms that make up 50 percent and 65 percent of total R&D triples, while the number of firms that make up 75 percent of total R&D almost quadruples. large continuers, growing continuers, and new firms. The first group refers to firms that are already large in terms of R&D activity at the start of our sample. The second group refers to firms that exist at the start of our sample but are not large R&D performers. Finally, the last group refers to firms that are not in existence at the start of our sample. We start by focusing on the R&D activity of these three groups. Since we are interested in the evolution of R&D activity over time, we create a measure comparing R&D activity in 2003 to R&D activity in 1976 (the ratio of real total R&D expenditures in 2003 to real total R&D expenditures in 1976). We define stable continuers as those firms whose ratio of R&D activity is relatively stable over time (specifically, as a ratio less than two). We define growing continuers as firms whose real R&D activity more than doubles over time. These measures compare the firm in 2003 to the firm in 1976 and thus account for firm-specific effects. However, we need to be careful in this interpretation since the firm itself may have changed through mergers and acquisitions over this time. Thus, we also use an alternate definition based upon absolute rankings within a cohort, that is, our measure of Top1976. Using this definition, cohort-stable firms are firms that are in Top1976. Cohort-switching firms are firms that were in existence in 1976 but who were not in the Top1976. The last group of firms consists of firms born after 1976 where we can see their complete evolution from birth. Recall that about 65% of the Top2003 firms can be considered continuers from 1976 (see Section 4.2). Unfortunately only 40% of the Top2003 firms appear in the SIRD in 1976. That is, we are only able to construct our measures of stable/growing and cohortstable/cohort-switching continuers for slightly more than half of the relevant firms. Of these firms, one-third had real R&D total expenditures about the same magnitude in 2003 as in 1976, while the other two-thirds at least double their total R&D expenditures over this period. Using the cohort definition, one-quarter of the firms move into the top cohort over time, while three-quarters of the firms are in the top cohort in both 1976 and 2003. In sum, of the Top2003 firms in existence in 1976 and for whom we can measure their R&D expenditures, most of them are in the top cohort as well in 1976 and most of them hold on to their position by more than doubling their R&D expenditures over time. For those firms not in the top cohort in 1976, not surprisingly, their change in R&D expenditures was even more dramatic thus allowing them to push into the top cohort by 2003. The last group consists of firms that entered after 1976, about 35% of Top2003 firms. 43 For this group, we can examine their complete evolution. We are particularly interested in whether these firms start as small firms as most firms in the economy do, or whether they start as larger or even multi-unit firms. 44 We can also examine their growth over time. If these firms are like those surviving firms in the rest of the economy (recall we know these firms survive to 2003), we would expect these firms to show rapid growth in size when they are young and that much of this growth will be from expansion of existing establishments rather than additon of establishments (see Jarmin, Haltiwanger and Miranda, 2013). We find over 70% of these firms entered as single unit firms and that they have a median employment of about 15 employees in their birth year. 45 The birth year differs for these new firms, but five years out from their birth year, these firm have a median employment of close to 500 employees. 46"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Research", "text": "We use firm-level microdata to create a detailed picture of the top R&D performing firms in the U.S. We look at characteristics of these firms in 2003 and follow the top 200 R&D performing firms back through time looking at both their persistence and their evolution. Critical to our analysis was the ability to combine survey data on R&D expenditures with data from the LBD on the universe of private non-farm businesses in the U.S. Linking SIRD data to the LBD enabled us to determine important dynamics of R&D performing firms that are not possible to determine using a survey with a rotating panel. In addition, the use of the LBD allowed us to compare R&D performers and non-performers to firms in the economy as a whole. Finally, our use of the LBD and LFTTD provided us with more information about the R&D performers themselves. We find top R&D performing firms are large, multi-unit, multinational older firms that conduct trade transactions. Many of the top R&D performing firms in 2003 are also among the top performing firms in 1976. In order to stay at the top, these firms more than double their R&D expenditures over the period. Of the top R&D performing firms in 2003 that were not top performing firms in 1976, some exist in 1976 and then move to the top by greatly expanding their R&D expenditures. Lastly, some of the top R&D performing firms in 2003 do not exist in 1976. Most of these entering firms start out as relatively small single units and then experience rapid growth. While we look at many interesting characteristics of the top R&D performing firms in this paper, there are many areas for future work. In terms of the evolution of these firms, we could investigate the roles of merger and acquisition activity and the transformation from a non-employer firm to an employer firm. For the latter, we could examine the transition using either the non-employer universe or perhaps the LEHD data (to track employees as they move to different firms and perhaps start up their own new firms). It would be interesting to take the flip side of our evolution analysis and examine how many of the fastest growing firms in the LBD had R&D expenditures. This work would complement the work in Akcigit and Kerr (2010) and some exploratory work that Jarmin and Miranda have done using the LBD. We are also interested in a more detailed study of how the survival rate of R&D performing firms differs from other nonperforming firms after a variety of firm and industry-level controls similar to Fernandes and Paunov (2012). 45 We define a firm's birth year in the same way we define firm age as the first year the oldest establishment in the firm (at the first appearance of the firm ID in the LBD) appears in the LBD. We designate a firm as starting out as a single-unit if the firm has one establishment in its first year and that establishment is a single-unit. 46 This is consistent with what Himmelberg and Petersen (1994) find for high-tech industries. They note \"High growth rates are not uncommon in high-tech industries. For example, in the computer industry, a number of start-ups reached Fortune 500 size in just a few decades\" (p.43). Finally, a more ambitious line of research alluded to in our introduction, would be to include some analysis of the outcomes of the R&D expenditures. Using Census microdata, we could measure the productivity growth at our top R&D performing firms and compare to the productivity growth of other firms, similar to Acemoglu et al. (2012). In summary, there are many avenues that could be explored using these rich data to further our understanding of the innovative processes in the U.S. economy. 3 Medians shown are \"fuzzy\" medians calculated as the mean of all observations between the 45 th and 55 th percentiles. 4 To avoid potential disclosure of confidential data, some numbers shown in this column have been rounded.

For example, in the early years, the SIRD used a panel drawn every five years that was not refreshed. Thus, it was impossible for the SIRD to capture new firms within a panel. In 1992, the SIRD switched to using an annual panel and the sample size was approximately doubled. 50 In addition, due to issues related to the collection of data on R&D by state (see below), a certainty component was added so that the 2003 SIRD includes with certainty the largest 50 firms (by payroll) for each of the 50 states. Therefore, the number of firms in the survey varies over time for reasons unrelated to the size of the underlying population. One of the challenges in using the SIRD is that these changes in the survey make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons of aggregate statistics over time. Our focus on the top 200 firms partly mitigates this problem as does our reliance on the LBD to provide additional aggregate statistics. The second issue concerns coverage. The SIRD is collected via a long form and a short form. In recent years, the two forms are both used in a given year: the short-form for non-certainty cases and the long-form for certainty cases. However, in earlier years the short-form was used for certainty cases in even years and the long form for certainty cases in odd years. Thus some data are collected only for long form cases. 51 Additionally, not all questions are asked every year. Only a core set of data are collected every year: domestic net sales and receipts, domestic employment, number of R&D scientists and engineers, total costs incurred for R&D, total costs incurred for R&D from Federal funds, and the cost of R&D by state. These are also the only questions that were deemed mandatory for most of the survey years. While of interest, the non-mandatory questions are often sparsely populated. 52 In this paper, we focus on the questions that were mandatory in all years. We use all of the available microdata for these questions and thus use reported, edited, and imputed data. One of the most important variables that we use is R&D expenditures; thus, we replicate the exact question used to collect this information in 2003 in Table A2. The third issue concerns the industry coding in the SIRD. The SIRD does not collect information on industry; instead an industry code for a firm is derived from establishment-level data from the Business Register using a hierarchical algorithm. This algorithm assigns a four-digit NAICS code based upon establishment-level payroll. 53 Thus all of the R&D expenditures in a firm, even a very diverse firm, are assigned to only one industry. In addition to suppressing the diversity of R&D activity, this process can also result in striking changes in R&D activity by sector when large firms are reassigned. 54 Furthermore, as traditional manufacturing firms increasingly include wholesaling activity, this method of allocating R&D activity based upon payroll resulted in the allocation of an increasing amount of R&D activity to the wholesale trade sector. During the processing of the 2004 SIRD, the increasing allocation of R&D activity to this sector came under scrutiny. As a result of this scrutiny, much of the R&D for wholesale and management sectors was redistributed. 55 We do not apply this type of redistribution to the 2003 microdata for our analyses for disclosure avoidance reasons. However, in future work we plan to use these improved industry codes when creating a measure of industry concentration since we are pooling industries in that case. The fourth issue concerns the SIRD data on the location of R&D expenditures by state. Unlike the industry codes, the SIRD does collect information on location; however, it is only collected on the long form. Moreover, prior to 2001, it was not a mandatory data item. Some observers have noted that state R&D expenditure totals are likely subject to issues related to the small underlying population of R&D performing firms in the states. These issues mean there are large variations in state totals over time that reflect the impact of small populations being given large weights. For this reason, the 2003 SIRD includes with certainty the largest 50 firms (by payroll) for each of the 50 states. 56 The final issue concerns the impact of mergers and acquisitions on the SIRD data. Because the SIRD is a company-level as opposed to an establishment-level survey, mergers and acquisitions can cause spurious changes in R&D expenditures over time. Scherer and Huh (1992) attempt to address this issue by creating a smoothed series. Griliches and Mairesse (1981), when using Compustat data, try to mitigate the impact of mergers and acquisitions on the data through a variety of methods (e.g., dropping the company, allowing the company to exist before and after mergers and acquisitions). They find that about 20% of their firms have jumps in the number of plants, employees, and sales suggesting that the company has undergone mergers and acquisitions. We have not yet addressed this issue, but we plan to do so in the future."}, {"section_title": "A.3. Comparing Microdata to Public Data", "text": "As noted in the text, the microdata sometimes differ from the public aggregate data due to data revisions. We note the following three examples as described in NSF (2007b). For the 2003 data, a very large company did not respond and so had its data imputed. Upon comparing this to publicly available data, it was realized that the imputation was too low. For the 1999 data, a large company was given a large weight. The next year it was picked as a certainty company and its weight dropped to one, causing a large spurious change in total R&D expenditures for that company. A revision 54 National Research Council (2005), page 31. 55 At the same time, industry classifications for the information, professional, scientific, and technical services, and management of firms and enterprises sectors were also examined. Firms in all of these sectors were subject to a manual review in which firms were reclassified based on primary R&D activity usually as defined by their primary product or service. For more details, see National Science Foundation (2009b), Appendix A. 56 National Research Council (2005), pp. 63 and 181. in methodology caused a \"dramatic\" revision to the 1991 data. (This was the change in scope discussed earlier where the SIRD started to use an annually refreshed panel and the sample size was doubled.)"}]
