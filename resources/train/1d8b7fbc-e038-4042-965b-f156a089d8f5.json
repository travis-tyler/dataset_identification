Better adaptation decision-making hinges on the ability of coastal communities to understand the spatial distribution of coastal water-tables in addition to local information of the processes that control changes in water table depth, such as the extent of local tidal forcing. Results from this project reveal that, within the study area, the land area flooded by groundwater inundation comprises the majority of coastal inundation (approximately 97% of the total flooded area) under the 0.44-ft SLR scenario. Under the 0.83 to 1.83-ft SLR range, the contribution of groundwater inundation to total flooded areas decreases, but still comprises more than 70% of total flooded area. The widespread contribution from groundwater flooding reveals that rising water tables induced by SLR are both a current and future risk that the scientific community must continue to monitor. These results expose the importance of enhancing groundwater monitoring networks, especially within surficial aquifer systems, in order to gain a better understanding of how coastal water tables are responding to rising sea levels."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SEA LEVEL RISE IMPACTS: MARINE AND GROUNDWATER INUNDATION", "text": "Sea level rise (SLR) is a complex and multi-facet impact of global climate change surrounded by high levels of uncertainty regarding magnitude and timing of impacts. Sea levels have risen approximately eight inches over the last century and the National Climate Assessment has set upper limits of SLR at 6.6 feet by 2100 (Burkett and Davidson, 2012). Certain coastal cities in the United States (U.S.) are uniquely vulnerable to SLR given local land characteristics, regional land subsidence, hydrogeological settings, tide and wave energy dynamics, and anthropogenic water resource management decisions. In order to spatially grasp the enormity of this threat to coastal communities, over 10% of the United States population reside within 3.3 feet of the high tide zone (Bolter 2014). Vulnerable cities along the U.S. coastline already experience the impacts of SLR to their natural resources, critical assets, and infrastructure. For example, Miami, Florida and Norfolk, Virginia experience frequent nuisance flood events, defined as minor coastal flooding during high tide as a result of increasing sea levels (Sweet et. al 2014). The impacts of SLR manifest in two main forms of coastal flooding: marine inundation (also called coastal flooding) and groundwater inundation, depicted in Figure 1. Marine inundation is flooding from \"above\" the land surface that results from a combination of storm surge, elevated high tides, river inflow, and waves. Conversely, groundwater inundation is flooding that originates from \"below\" the land surface as sea level rise and/or heavy rainfall lift the water table to an elevation that penetrates the land surface with groundwater, which can consist of freshwater, saltwater, or a combination of freshsaline water. While groundwater inundation is a slow-onset coastal hazard, coastal communities are already witnessing the impacts of elevated  water tables. For example, New Jersey city planners recently abandoned more than 120 groundwater water supply wells because of saltwater contamination (Chang 2011). Extreme weather events contributing large volumes of flooding and runoff can induce rapid groundwater-level rise. Figure 2 depicts the response in a United States Geological Survey (USGS) groundwater well in a tidal estuary located in Virginia Beach, VA during hurricane Sandy in October 2012; the water table rose almost two feet in a few days in response to storm water infiltrating into the water-table aquifer. Shallow water-tables, therefore, increases flood risk because of limited storage space for infiltration and retention of water."}, {"section_title": "COASTAL FLOOD INUNDATION METHODS", "text": "While the scientific community has begun to rapidly develop climate models and large databases to reflect the most current and accurate projections of SLR, the majority of this information focuses on the impact of marine inundation on coastal lands and resources. Despite advanced research on tidal forcing in coastal aquifers, SLR and coastal inundation forecasts typically neglect the influence of SLR on changes in unconfined aquifer storage capacity (Kuan et. al 2012). Specifically, these models only use ground surface elevation to identify areas that are at risk to coastal flooding (i.e., \"bathtub\" models). This approach over-simplifies the hydrological processes that occur during SLR because it only considers marine inundation and discounts the possibility of superelevation of groundwater as a result of SLR (Romah 2012). The distance from the land surface to the top of the surficial aquifer, the water table depth, is an important parameter to include in comprehensive flood inundation assessments (Matson and Fels 1996). A review of the literature on groundwater modeling and water-table mapping suggests that limited guidance for how to rapidly access large-scale coastal groundwater vulnerability to SLR, especially in areas with limited data availability, slows advances in developing comprehensive flood inundation models that include water table conditions. Hydrogeologists have produced significant research on groundwater-seawater interaction focused on saltwater intrusion and its impact on water quality; however, research concentrating on tide-induced groundwater-level fluctuations leading to groundwater inundation is less common. Furthermore, research focused on tideinduced groundwater-level fluctuation mainly explores processes in confined aquifers. Recent studies suggest unconfined coastal aquifers are more susceptible to rising water table levels induced by SLR due to higher permeabilities and hydraulic conductivities (Watson 2010). Another challenge involves complexities inherent in modeling water table response to SLR, especially temporal uncertainties. Many coastal vulnerability assessments discount the potential for saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers by pointing to the lag time that occurs between sea level change and landward migration of the salt-freshwater interface (Watson 2010). However, while sea-level change typically occur over geologic time scales, recent studies suggest that saltwater intrusion relative to the SLR can occur on much shorter time intervals than previously thought (Watson 2010;Feseker 2007). Rotzoll and Fletcher (2012) explored groundwater inundation under various SLR scenarios in Hawaii, finding that factoring in groundwater inundation more than doubles previous flood predictions with marine inundation alone. These findings present an interesting opportunity to synthesize and expand upon coastal groundwater research in order to develop a modeling methodology to map a continuous water table surface for the U.S. East Coast, an area that is uniquely vulnerable to the threats of rising sea levels given the concentration of population and critical asset."}, {"section_title": "COASTAL GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS", "text": "The water table is the surface of saturated conditions beneath the land surface. Below the water table, all pores in soil, sediment, or rock are saturated: completely filled with water (Matson and Fels 1996). Monitoring groundwater levels typically involves measuring depth to groundwater at individual points along the water table, where water rises to the elevation of the water table in a screened groundwater observation well. The height that water rises within a well, is also referred to as hydraulic head, which is a measure of the total available energy available to move groundwater. The depth of the water table below land surface depends on many dynamic environmental conditions and processes affecting the rate at which water enters and leaves the saturated zone (Matson and Fels 1996). In general, when the recharge (rate at which aquifer receives water) exceeds the discharge (rate at which aquifer releases water), the water table rises. When discharge exceeds recharge, the water table lowers. In coastal areas, the general pattern of freshwater groundwater flow is from inland recharge areas, where groundwater levels and hydraulic heads are typically highest, to coastal discharge areas where groundwater levels are typically lowest (Barlow 2003). Aquifers are saturated geologic materials beneath the water table, which store usable quantities of water to a well or spring (Barlow 2003). The ability of an aquifer to transmit water is a function of the material's hydraulic conductivity, which is a measure of the total energy available. Units of a geologic formation that have low permeability can separate and confine other aquifers. Thus, aquifers can be in an unconfined or confined state. An unconfined aquifer is not surrounded by impermeable material and therefore, the water table is not confined from the atmospheric pressure. Water table aquifers are characterized as being \"unconfined\" since the head in the aquifer is at approximately the same elevation as the water table and because the surface is not confined by impermeable material (Barlow 2003). Coastal aquifers are groundwater environments bordered by a marine system that oscillates in a periodic and predictable manner along with tidal patterns (Anderson 2014). This fluctuating boundary condition results from the interaction between fresh and saline groundwater (Xun et. al 2015). Groundwater flux to oceans, known as 'submarine groundwater discharge' (SGD), varies with tides and contributes nutrients and water to nearshore environments (Abarca 2013). The groundwater table in aquifers in the coastal zone typically lies above mean sea level. As a result of this elevation gradient, groundwater in the coastal zone generally flows seaward, referred to as topographically driven groundwater flow (Anderson2014). The freshwater-saline water interface exists due to the density differences between the two layers, with heavier saltwater residing beneath freshwater. Short timescale variations such as tides, waves, and extreme weather events as well as longer timescale variations such as seasonal, inter-annual and inter-decadal variations in flowrates, and millennial variations in sea levels affect the landward and seaward extent of ocean-groundwater interactions (Anderson 2014). While sea-level changes typically occur over geologic time scales, accelerated rates of local relative sea level rise over the past few decades suggest that rising sea levels intruding coastal aquifers can lift the water table on much shorter time intervals than previously thought (Watson 2010; Feseker 2007)."}, {"section_title": "GROUNDWATER LEVEL RESPONSES TO SEA LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS", "text": "The landward migration of the salt-freshwater interface will likely have a nonlinear response to SLR due to the transient processes of recharge or discharge associated with a changing climate and coastal heterogeneity (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). While anthropogenic activities such as land use changes and groundwater extraction are major drivers of the inland migration of the saline-wedge, natural hydrologic process such as rising sea levels, tidal effects, and changes in rainfall patterns are anticipated to aggravate the problem (Chang et. al 2011). The multiple drivers controlling the response of groundwater-levels to SLR challenges our understanding of the interactions and combined effects of these processes. Uncertainty regarding the differential response of specific locations to the various drivers further complicates the analysis. The predominant driver dictating the landward migration of the saline wedge will likely have significant spatial variability; in some places, groundwater extraction initiates saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, while accelerated rates of SLR (i.e., SLR 'hotspots') induces super-elevation of groundwater levels in other places. A review of the literature on groundwater dynamics identifies the following drivers of the inland migration of the saline-wedge in response to SLR, with the relative contribution of each of these drivers depending on specific local characteristics (i.e., locally dominant hydrological processes):"}, {"section_title": "TIDAL FORCING", "text": "Earth tides are the result of the gravitational pull on the Earth (and its water) from the Moon and Sun. The water-table in unconfined aquifers typically lies above mean sea level, and fluctuate in response to daily tidal oscillations and other low-frequency sources of ocean energy such as waves (Rotzoll and Fletcher). If the Earth were a perfect sphere without large continents, all areas would experience two equally proportioned high and low tides every lunar day. However, the large continents on the planets block the passage of the tidal bulge as the Earth rotates. As a result, tides establish complex patterns within each ocean basin. The timescales over which tides fluctuate differ from place to place and also impact oscillations in groundwater levels. Fluctuations in groundwater levels, also called amplitudes, decrease exponentially with distance from the nearest fluctuating water body (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). Groundwater levels become less sensitive to the influence of tidal forcing with increasing distance inland. Therefore, better understanding of seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers and the ability to spatially delineation the extent of tidal forcing on groundwater levels is vital for accurate coastal inundation forecasts. Groundwater response to tidal fluctuations strongly depends on the local hydrogeological setting, which can be constructed through estimation of aquifer properties. (Dong et. al 2012)."}, {"section_title": "AQUIFER PROPERTIES", "text": "Understanding and quantitative prediction of groundwater-level response to transient stresses on aquifers, such as SLR, requires information on coastal aquifer properties. Aquifer properties govern the storage capacity of the aquifer (i.e., aquifer Storativity) and how fast water can travel through the aquifer (i.e., aquifer Transmissivity, a product of hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness). These properties depend on the composition of the aquifer and vary spatially due to geologic heterogeneity (Senior and Goode 1999). Geologists commonly obtain data on aquifer properties by conducting pumping tests (Xun et. al 2015), a technique that estimates aquifer properties at a local scale. Another method involves estimation of aquifer properties through use of equations that compare ocean tide measurements and corresponding groundwater levels at observation wells over a period of time (Xun et. al 2015;Carr and Kamp 1969). The accuracy of this method relies on accurate field data collection; specifically, appropriate temporal collection of field data that captures seasonal, climactic, and human-induced processes. Therefore, results of pumping tests found in local hydrogeological surveys likely contain lower error estimations of aquifer properties. Differential vulnerabilities to SLR in confined and unconfined aquifers also reveal the importance of aquifer properties on groundwater level fluctuations. Ataie Ashitani et. al (2001) investigated tidal effects on groundwater dynamics in unconfined aquifers, finding that tidal impacts increase in influence with additional confining layers of the aquifer. Conversely, other studies anticipate higher vulnerability of unconfined aquifers to SLR due to the higher discharge rates through the overlying higher-permeability layers commonly associated with unconfined aquifers (Watson 2010). Furthermore, unconfined aquifers typically lie above mean sea level and therefore face increased potential for groundwater inundation relative to existing conditions."}, {"section_title": "TOPOGRAPHY", "text": "While the water table does not directly mimic topography due to heterogeneity of the underlying geology, topographic gradients do influence coastal groundwater levels. Coastal groundwater levels often reflect the surface relief of the land due to capillary effects of sediments, what the USGS refers to as \"a subdued replica of the land-surface topography\" (USGS 2015). Topography also regulates the direction of groundwater flow, as groundwater flows from high to low-pressure areas in the aquifer (referred to as topographically driven groundwater flow). As sea levels rise, the gradient driving topographically driven groundwater flow will decrease, resulting in reduced ability for the aquifer to hold back migration of the saline wedge (Anderson 2012).

However, recent studies forecast falling rates of precipitation to accelerate landward migration of the saline wedge because of reduced fresh groundwater flow to the coast. Under steady-state conditions, the position of the saline wedge stays close to the shoreline because of the equilibrium maintained by fresh groundwater flow against offshore tidal and wave energy. Falling rates of fresh groundwater flow might disturb this balance and result in movement of the saline wedge (Anderson 2012)."}, {"section_title": "GROUNDWATER PUMPING", "text": "Overexploitation of groundwater recourse in coastal regions intensifies land subsidence, a phenomenon known to accelerate the impacts of relative SLR.

These aquifers were significantly affected by the Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater, a large impact crater formed by a meteorite or comet digging a 6,000-foot deep crater at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The impact shuffled the confining layers in the sedimentary formation for significant inland distances, providing channels for seawater to intrude. As a result, unique hydrogeological features were formed, such as the anomalous inland saltwater wedge where groundwater far from the Atlantic Ocean in inland aquifers is unexpectedly salty (Barlow 2003;Figure 7 and 8) Groundwater in the Hampton Roads area is a heavily used resource. Industrial withdrawals from the two largest groundwater pumping centers in the Virginia Coastal Plain have resulted in two regional cones of depression that have water-level declines as great as 200 feet (McFarland and Bruce 2006). While it would seem that lower waterlevels would reduce risk of groundwater inundation due to increased storage capacity of rainfall and coastal inundation, the opposite is true; overexploitation of groundwater resources near the coast increases rates of saltwater intrusion since large withdraw centers cause reversed hydraulic gradients from seaward to inland (Anderson 2012;McFarland and Bruce 2006). The migrating saltwater wedge has dynamic impacts on unconfined aquifer units as it has the potential to lift the water-table on rapid temporal scales.

Depth-to-water (DTW) is typically very shallow along surface-water features, such as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and wetlands (Walker et implemented an approach, called the \"Relative Altitude\" method, to support mapping water tables at higher accuracies using 1) measured water-table depths 2) elevation data, and 3) location of surface-water features. These datasets can be synthesized to develop a linear regression (LR) equation that statistically relates measured water-table depths to values of relative altitude at the well (land-surface elevation relative to that of the local receiving-water body). The Relative Altitude method was initially used to estimate a continuous water-table surface for the Hampton Roads region, but resulted in a significant overestimation/ underestimation of the water table elevation in some places (see Appendix E for detailed methodology of the Relative Altitude approach). This is due to the fact that the regression equation reflects conditions associated with local hydrogeology. Over large areas, the relation between relative land-surface altitude and observed water-table depth below land surface might differ. Therefore, instead of using regression to make estimates of water table elevations, the original, long-term average water-table elevations at USGS observation wells 4 and extracted surface-water elevations were aggregated into a single point shapefile in ArcGIS. A Kriging interpolation algorithm was then used to calculate the estimated, continuous water-table surface. A key assumption of the interpolation method is that the boundaries of surface-water features represent an intersection of the water table with the land surface (Martin and Andres 2008). Therefore, the LiDAR DEM was used to extract elevations of surface-water features. Figure 9 illustrates the watertable terms used in the interpolation method. This analysis consists of two primary steps: data compilation and interpolation.

In ArcGIS, the following steps were used to extract elevations from surface-water features: 1 Results of performing these steps on the NHD (waterbody layer) and NWI (layers included = estuarine and marine deepwater wetlands, freshwater ponds, lakes, and rivers) data revealed that the delineation of surface-water features derived from these datasets did not maintain the correct spatial configuration of these features in comparison to their location within the LiDAR DEM. Resolution differences between the publicly-available datasets and the LiDAR DEM would introduce significant error into this analysis when elevations are extracted. For example, some NHD/NWIdelineated features protruded into  neighborhoods of higher elevations (green polygon, Figure 10), therefore not capturing the true elevation of the surface-water features. Thus, an alternative method was used to delineate surface-water features. A threshold elevation of zero feet was selected by visually inspecting the LiDAR DEM to approximate an elevation range that would best capture surface-water features. This elevation corresponds to approximately MSL since the NAVD88 datum is approximately 0.25 feet higher than MSL in southeast Virginia (Figure 11). The Reclassify tool was implemented in ArcGIS to delineate all gird cells that were less than or equal to this threshold elevation. This raster was converted to a polygon feature, and Step 1-4 above were implemented to extract elevations along these delineated surface-water features. Figure 10 depicts the differences between the delineated NHD, NWI, and \"Threshold Method\" surface-water features.

Inspection of the resulting elevation values (i.e. estimated water-table elevations) revealed that there were values that were significantly lower than -0.25 feet, going as low as -6.0 feet. Because the elevations of the water table is above MSL under static conditions, extracted elevations that were less than -0.25 feet are generally considered to be non-representative of local conditions and were therefore removed from the dataset.

Geostatistical interpolation techniques use sample points taken at different location in a landscape and creates (interpolates) a continuous surface. In general, things that are closer together tend to be more alike than things that are farther apart. To account for this distance relationship, interpolation weights values of closer points more heavily than those farther away (ESRI 2015). To prepare for interpolation, the water-table elevations extracted along surface-water features were aggregated with the water-table elevations (long-term average conditions) at the USGS observation wells in the study area using the Merge tool in ArcGIS. Using the measured water-table elevation sample points within the study area, a Kriging algorithm was implemented in the ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst to create predictions for unmeasured locations within the same area. Kriging assumes that at least some of the spatial variation in the measured water-table elevations can be modeled by random processes with spatial autocorrelation, predicts values at unmeasured locations, and assesses the uncertainty associated with a predicted value at the unmeasured locations."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Interpolation Results", "text": "Within the kriging family, there are many different interpolation methods. Three kriging interpolation methods were explored here: 1) ordinary kriging with spherical variogram, 2) ordinary kriging with exponential variogram, and 3) universal kriging with linear drift and exponential variogram. A variogram is the variance of the difference between two variables at two locations, which is a function of the degree of spatial dependence (ESRI 2015). Cross validation is a technique used to assess how well the interpolation model predicts the values at unknown locations. The Geostatistical Analyst computes cross validation through the \"leave-one-out\" approach, where one point is left out and the rest of the points are used to predict a value at that location. The point is then added back into the dataset, and another point is removed. The Geostatistical Analyst does this for all sample points in the dataset and provides pairs of predicted and known values that can be compared to assess the model's performance. Model validation is another technique the Geostatistical Analyst performs to check whether model parameters were chosen ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst (Desktop Extension) graphic, obtained from: http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/geostatistical correctly for the dataset, for example, choice of semivariogram model, lag size, and search neighborhood. To create the best models for the water-table elevation dataset, the \"Optimize Model\" option was selected which calculates values for parameters using an iterative cross validation technique. Geostatistical Analyst also produces graphs and summaries of the measured values versus the predicted values. Several different kriging models were implemented on the water-table elevation dataset. The three models (ordinary/spherical, ordinary/exponential, and universal/exponential with linear drift) were compared by analyzing the resulting scatterplots of predicted versus true values to determine which type of kriging interpolation method worked best. With autocorrelation and a good kriging model, the values should scatter around the 1:1 line (the grey lines in the Figures  13-15 below). It is a property of kriging that the slope of this line is typically less than 1, since kriging tends to underpredict large values and overpredict small values (ESRI 2015). Figures 13, 14, and 15 show the results of the fit of the models. Figure 15 (universal/exponential with linear drift) performed best, shown by the proximity of the blue and grey lines (i.e. very close to 1:1). One reason why this model performed best is that the surficial aquifer system typically slopes, gently, towards the ocean. Introducing drift, therefore, accounts for the inclusion of this sloping gradient. The total mean error of the interpolation is -0.012, computed by the Geostatistical Analyst by taking the average of all of the differences between measured and predicted values. This means that, on average, the water-table elevation is underestimated by 0.012 feet (or 0.14 inches), a relatively small error overall. After cross-validation was performed and the universal kriging with linear drift method was chosen as the best model for interpolation, the Geostatistical Analyst produced a continuous surface of water-table elevations throughout the study area.

Delineation of surface waters that share a hydrologic connection with the ocean under current mean sea level (MSL) conditions (i.e. SLR = 0 feet) was created in ArcGIS using NOAA's hydrologic connectivity method (NOAA 2012). This approach to modeling hydrological connectivity uses a LiDAR DEM to classify grid cells as \"flooded\" only if the elevation of the cell is below sea level and if it is connected to an adjacent grid cell that was flooded or open water. This method defined connectivity with the 'eight-side rule' (Figure 17), a raster modeling approach that classifies a grid cell as connected if its cardinal and diagonal directions are connected to a flooded grid cell (Poulter and Halpin 2008). The NOAA hydrological connectivity approach requires a continuous tidal surface grid as an input data layer, which was obtained from NOAA's Office for Coastal Management (OCM) on July 17, 2015. This layer was created by interpolating Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) tidal values derived from long-term NOAA tide gauge water level time-series. The surface layer was originally vertically referenced to NAV88 meters, but re-projected in ArcGIS to match the spatial reference of the LiDAR DEM. MHHW is defined as the average of the higher high water height of each tidal day over the National Tidal Datum Epoch, the official standardized 19-year time period over which tide observations are taken and reduced to obtain mean values (i.e., MHHW) for tidal datums) (NOAA 2015). The surface represents an extension of the MHHW tidal data datum, covering all tidally-influenced areas along the coast. NOAA created this data layer to support mapping of tidally-based inundation scenarios on high resolution digital elevation models. This layer along with the LiDAR DEM were used as inputs for the NOAA hydrological connectivity approach (NOAA 2012; Appendix F). Delineation of tidally-influenced surface waters in a section of the study area is illustrated in Figure  18. In order to calculate distance to the nearest hydrologic-connected surface water, an empty raster was created in ArcGIS by reclassifying all cells in the LiDAR DEM to a value of one. The Euclidian Distance tool in was then implemented to calculate the distance of each raster pixel to the nearest hydrologically connected surface water.

An analysis of spatial-temporal variation in water level fluctuations in the USGS daily time-series reveals useful information about the aquifer system. It was hypothesized that the diurnal tidal component would be the most significant period. This hypothesis was explored by using spectral analysis in Matlab to study the response of the coastal unconfined aquifer system to tides in order to reveal dominant time-scales driving water-table fluctuations (Shin et al 2000). Spectral analysis requires a continuous time-series to identify significant periods. Therefore, a continuous, daily USGS-time-series was downloaded and processed for a small-subset of coastal USGS wells in Virginia located at varying distances from the same fluctuating water body ( Figure  15). Daily amplitudes at the 4 wells were calculated first computing the long-term average depth to water-table, and then subtracting the daily minimum (representing the shallowest water-level in that day) from the long-term average ( Table 1 in Appendix A). This daily amplitude represents positive fluctuations in groundwater levels. This value was selected over the negative fluctuations because 1) the purpose of the analysis was to observe the influence of tides on raising groundwater levels and 2) the trough and crest of the wave likely propagate through the aquifer at different rates ( Figure 19). Ten years of continuous, hourly water levels were collected from NOAA's Tides and Currents website for the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel tidal gauge. In order to compare the tidal time series to the groundwater well time series, the hourly tidal time series was also analyzed at the daily timescale for positive fluctuations only. For the timeseries, the entire time record is divided into sub-periods based on the number of total years the timeseries covers. Then,  averages for each of the resulting components were computed to obtain a final \"smooth\" component. A filter was also applied on the timeseries to enhance interesting components and remove the ones that hide the cycle of interest, for example, noise that might be associated with groundwater withdrawals, rainfall recharge, and evapotranspiration. Fourier analysis of a timeseries involves extraction of the series of sines and cosines that when superimposed, will reproduce the timeseries. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) by converting a signal from its original domain of time into a function of frequency. By using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Matlab, a power spectral density function was created which allows for the identification of important frequencies. The results of the analysis on 1) hourly and daily tidal timeseries and 2) the daily groundwater level timeseries for Site A are show below since this information is used as an input for the next step (i.e. calculating amplitude response in the aquifer "}, {"section_title": "STORATIVITY (S) AND TRANSMISSIVITY (T)", "text": "Coastal aquifer composition is typically heterogeneous, a mixture of aquifer condition (confined, unconfined), and aquifer materials (Anderson 2012). As described in Section 2.2, the Virginia Coastal Plain surficial aquifer is characterized by significant local heterogeneities as a result of the Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater shuffling the sedimentary formation. While inclusion of these local heterogeneities, such as identifying hydrogeological features that can convey the tidal signal further into the aquifer, would possibly improve the model's predictive ability, this type of analysis requires a more comprehensive dataset at the regional scale. The purpose of this portion of the analysis is to spatially delineate tidal amplitude attenuation with distance from the shoreline in the surficial, unconfined aquifer system. Simplifying the observations to one dimension by assuming homogeneity of aquifer properties throughout the study area allows estimates of extent of tidal propagation throughout the unconfined portion of the aquifer system. The Columbia aquifer in the Virginia Coastal Plain is predominantly composed of interbedded gravel, sand, silt and clay (Meng and Harsh 1988), and is unconfined throughout the study area (Harsh and Laczniak 1990). The unconfined or water-table portion of the Columbia aquifer is a key hydrologic unit in Virginia, supplying water to rural and domestic users and a major source of recharge to the underlying confined aquifer system (Harsh and Laczniak 1990). Saturated thickness of the Columbia aquifer ranges from approximately 15 feet near the western extent to 80 feet in the southeastern part of the study area (Harsh and Laczniak 1990). Because of the permeable character of the aquifer and its near-surface location, the unconfined aquifer is highly susceptible to contamination (Martin and Andres 2008). Eq. (2) requires estimates of transmissivity and storativity, or a single value representing the ratio of these two parameters (i.e. S/T). Transmissivity is the rate of flow through a unit width of aquifer of a given saturated thickness (Duffield 2015). Transmissivity is related to the aquifer's thickness and hydraulic conductivity, which is the rate of flow under a unit hydraulic gradient through a unit cross-sectional area of an aquifer, as follows (Duffield 2015):"}, {"section_title": "T = Kb", "text": "where T is transmissivity [m 2 /day] and b is aquifer thickness [m] McFarland (1998) developed a digital numerical model of the ground-water-flow system in the Virginia Coastal Plain as part of the Regional Aquifer System Analysis Program of the USGS. Aquifer properties were derived based on aquifer hydraulic properties measure in groundwater observation wells. Results from the model indicate the transmissivity of the Columbia aquifer ranges from 500 to 1,000 feet squared per day (ft 2 /day) in the in the western extent to about 1,000 -1,500 ft 2 /day in the southeastern portion of the study area ( Figure 16). Visual averaging of this McFarland's (1998) modeled transmissivity layer ( Figure 21) produced an average transmissivity estimate of 1,000 ft 2 /day (or 41.67 ft 2 /hour) for Equation (1). Storativity (S) is defined as the volume of water released from storage per unit surface area of an aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head (Duffield 2015). Fewer storativity values are reported for the unconfined portions of the Columbia aquifer. However, specific yield (Sy), also known as drainage porosity, in unconfined aquifers is approximately equal to storativity since the release from specific storage (Ss) is typically orders of magnitude less (Ssb << Sy) (Duffield 2015)."}, {"section_title": "S = S y", "text": "where S is storativity [dimensionless], and S is specific storage [m] A specific yield of 0.15 was reported in Harsh and Laczniak (1990) and estimated by Crushing (1973) from analysis of an aquifer test collected on the Eastern Shore Peninsula of Virginia. This value is in close agreement with that estimated in other hydrogeological studies of the Virginia Coastal Plain (Harsh and Laczniak 1990;Cosner, 1975;Chapelle and Drummond, 1983). Therefore, a value of 0.15 was used to simulate storage for the unconfined parts of the aquifer. Based on the literature review of aquifer hydraulic properties, the ratio of S/T = ~0.00015 (where S was estimated to be 0.15, and T was estimated to be 1,000 ft2/day). In order to compare this documented ratio for the area of analysis, the long-term positive fluctuations for each groundwater observation well, derived in Section 3.3.1, was plotted against the linear distance to the nearest hydrologically-connected surface water in Excel. The distance parameter was computed in ArcGIS using the Near tool from each well point shapefile to the polygon shoreline layer (i.e. hydrologically-connected surface waters generated in Section 3.3.3). The y-axis (groundwater data) was log-transformed and a logarithmic function was fitted to the data, producing the following equation: By setting the slope (-0.03) of this equation equal to the square root portion of Equation (1) , , the observed S/T ratio was computed to be 0.00023. This values is in close agreement to the S/T ratio that was derived from documented aquifer properties from hydrogeological investigations.

Two continuous amplitude grids were created, one for the 12-hour period, and one for the 24-hour period, since these tidal components were both determined to influence groundwater amplitudes in this region. While the 12-hour fluctuation has a large amplitude to start with (1.2 feet), it is attenuated more rapidly. Conversely, the 24-hour fluctuation has a smaller amplitude to start with (0.14 feet), and is attenuated less rapidly. Larger periodicities, such as monthly or annual signals, were deemed negligible since their amplitudes were very small.

Pixels were classified as flooded by groundwater inundation if the water-table elevation was higher than the LiDAR land surface elevation. To visualize the impact of groundwater inundation only on land, a mask was created in ArcGIS using the current conditions of hydrologic connectivity in polygon form as the input layer. This mask was used to extract only flooding that occurred on land. Maps of marine inundation were created by using NOAA's Detailed Methodology for Mapping Sea Level Rise Inundation (NOAA 2012). This approach can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for local and regional tidal variability and hydrological connectivity by isolating LiDAR DEM cells that are hydrologically connected to the ocean or adjacent flooded cells using the 8-side approach (NOAA 2012). Appendix E contains the detailed steps require for this analysis. Figure 16 illustrates how the extent of hydrological connectivity changes from presentday sea level to 2 feet of SLR.

Comparisons are shown for different areas in northeastern Virginia Beach, including an overview coastal inundation in northeast Virginia Beach, and coastal inundation in a beach, urban, and residential setting surrounded by wetlands. Visual analysis of comparisons reveal that marine inundation, even under the 1.83 foot SLR scenario, makes a much smaller impact that combined marine and groundwater inundation. Groundwater inundation extends much further inland, creeping in from beneath the land surface and flooding roadways, parking lots, yards and some buildings. Impacts also include greater extent of flooding on beaches and estuaries as the water-table alone these shorelines is more affected by tidal forcing."}, {"section_title": "Flooded areas by marine inundation shown within a small section of the study area, specifically in northeastern Virginia Beach near First Landing State Park.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Flooded areas including groundwater inundation shown within a small section of the study area, specifically in northeastern Virginia Beach near First Landing State Park.", "text": "Yellow box depicts extent of sub-area analyzed for marine vs. groundwater inundation.

In the 0.83 feet to 1.83 feet of SLR range, the flooded area by groundwater inundation is approximately four times greater than marine inundation alone. The significant increase of contribution from marine inundation can be attributed to the non-linearity of the local impacts of SLR due to topography within the study area. Once the threshold of half a foot is reach, the land inundated by marine inundation increases more rapidly. A key assumption of this flood inundation analysis is the linear increase in watertable height with SLR. This assumption is generally applicable in flux-controlled systems where the seaward groundwater flux is maintained, for example, in freshwater-lens aquifers underlain by saltwater that is directly connected to ocean fluctuations (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). However, the transient climactic and geophysical processes associated with a changing climate, such as shifting coastlines and changing patterns in recharge or discharge, may lead to a nonlinear response of the water table to rising sea levels (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS", "text": "Results of this work reveal that low-lying lands in Hampton Roads are highly vulnerable to the impacts of groundwater inundation from SLR. The flooded area including groundwater inundation is more than three times the area flooded by marine inundation alone. Therefore, in order to avoid underestimation of flood risk, coastal inundation forecasts must consider the compounding effects of these flood hazards. As sea level rise lifts the coastal water table, densely populated urban areas will observe more frequent incidences of standing pools of brackish water maximized at high tide due to prevention of infiltration and drainage associated with shallow water-tables (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). Risks associated with elevated groundwater levels in urban settings include long-term water management issues due to aquifer salinization, damage to underground and low-lying infrastructure in coastal cities, overwhelming existing stormwater and municipal drainage systems, and disruption of coastal community emergency services, business, commerce, travel, and livelihoods. For example, saturated soil conditions and standing water on a property compromise the structural integrity of buildings and underground infrastructure. The high hydrostatic pressure associated with water-tables pressing up against infrastructure can lead to cracked foundations of homes and buildings, corrosion of underground pipes or building materials if groundwater is saline or brackish, or result in long-term issues with mold associated with internal water damage. The information produced by this modeling research can be used to prioritize areas identified as having especially shallow water-tables. Individuals and community planners should consider relocating critical assets, businesses, and dwellings to higher and dryer lands or improving local drainage in these high-risk areas. Groundwater inundation also threatens the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems and resources. For example, groundwater inundation exacerbates the flooding along our beaches, estuaries, and tidal rivers. Impacts of marine inundation from storm surge and wave overtopping coupled with shallow water-tables could lead to accelerated beach and shoreline erosion. Implementation of natural infrastructure, such as planting wetland grasses or building oyster reefs, is a potential adaptation solution to mitigate some of the adverse impacts of shallow water-tables on natural ecosystems. Visualization of combined marine and groundwater inundation at various spatial and temporal scales offers innovative opportunities to implement creative adaption solutions to combat these compounding coastal flood hazards. Spatial mapping of regional-scale impacts of tidal forcing on groundwater levels is useful for city and statelevel climate adaptation planning. Planners and managers can use this information for design decisions about urban drainage, wastewater treatment, roadways, and locations of important city assets such as hospitals (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). This type of information might also be useful at the individual and/or community level. One foreseeable challenge for climate change adaptation is the ability for communities and individuals to align their critical decisions to the 'multi-scale reality' of climate impacts with a spatial focus on local impacts. While the majority of climate-related flood hazard planning occurs at the regional level, there has been a parallel, growing interest from individuals and communities for downscaled, flood prediction information (Vogel and Moser 2007; Glavovic and Smith 2014). In order to empower individuals and communities to intellectually participate in adaptation solutions, they must have access to flood risk assessment data scaled to the parcel-level. Therefore, it will become increasingly important to use high-resolution environmental datasets when developing models or tools for coastal hazard risk assessment. If more user-friendly tools are made available to the public, it is more likely that individuals and communities will engage in SLR adaptation and make smarter investment and land use decisions."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "Limitations of this project include two sources of uncertainty. The first source of is the inherent uncertainty associated with modeling the coastal water table. Estimates of water-table elevations are affected by multiple parameters, including length, timing, and completeness of the groundwater level time series, as well as choice of interpolation methods. Therefore, maps of continuous water table elevations are estimates, and the values represent the average conditions with associated uncertainty. The second limitation involves the uncertainty associated with the validity of the assumptions in modeling how the water table will respond to SLR. The key assumption of the coastal flood inundation analysis was that there will be a linear increase in water table elevation with SLR (i.e. a unit increase in SLR adds the same unit increase to the water table elevation). This assumption might fall apart due to the transient climactic and geophysical processes associated with a changing climate. Specifically, shifting coastlines and changing patterns in recharge or discharge may lead to a non-linear response of the water table to rising sea levels. Another related source of uncertainty is that the position of the coastline in this model is static, meaning that the computed tidal attenuation (in Section 3.3.3) stays constant even with changes in the position of mean sea level. In reality, tides will be able to propagate further inland when the position of the shoreline moves landward, thus adding a higher contribution to inland water table height. Therefore, this model might be underestimating contribution from tidal forcing on coastal water tables. Despite these limitations, obtaining a representation of the water-table is crucial for more accurate characterization of flood risk with SLR. Better adaptation decision-making hinges on coastal communities' ability to understand of the spatial distribution of coastal water-tables in addition to local information of the processes that control changes in water-table depth, such as the extent of local tidal forcing. Uncertainty should not paralyze action or scientific investigation, especially since successful adaptation planning requires early forecasting of how SLR will impact our coastal resources into the future. In addition to flood inundation forecasts, estimates of water-table depth is an important variable in many engineering, hydrological, environmental management, and regulatory decisions. Water table depth is an important input variable, map layer, and parameter for a wide variety of hydrologic and environmental models, such as modeling groundwater flow direction and velocity and pollution transport (Matson and Fels 1996)."}, {"section_title": "AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESERACH", "text": "New developments in resolution and availability of environmental data in addition to expanding utilization of spatial analysis make it possible to overcome problems associated with mapping water-tables, especially in regions with inadequate groundwater monitoring networks. This research demonstrates how water-table mapping along with tidal forcing is possible through assimilation of multiple publiclyavailable datasets such as long-term groundwater level timeseries, LiDAR-derived DEM to assign elevations to surface-water features, and long-term tide gauge water level timeseires. Geospatial modeling that synthesizes these datasets provides a relatively accurate and precise and time efficient means of estimating coastal water-tables elevations that can be incorporated into coastal inundation assessments as well as other hydrological and environmental models. Obtaining additional groundwater-level monitoring data in surficial aquifers would enhance the horizontal and vertical resolutions of interpolation techniques, as interpolation accuracy improves with added measurements.
