[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: The aging of the United States population poses significant challenges to American healthcare and informal caregiving systems. Additional research is needed to understand how health promotion programs and policies based on a socio-ecological perspective impact the health and well-being of older persons. The purpose of this study was to investigate personal characteristics and supportive environments associated with poor health among older individuals aged 65 and over. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design and was guided by a conceptual framework developed by the authors to depict the relationship between personal characteristics and environments associated with poor health status. Environment types included in this study were family, home, financial, neighborhood, and healthcare. The sample was comprised of 1319 adults aged 65 years and older residing in Central Texas. From a random selection of households, participants were administered a mail-based survey created by a community collaborative effort. Descriptive statistics and three binary logistic regression models were fitted to examine associations with poor health status (i.e., physical, mental, and combined physical/mental). Results: Two personal characteristics (number of chronic conditions and educational level) were consistently related (p < 0.05) to health outcomes. Supportive family, home, financial, neighborhood, and health care environmental factors were shown to be related (p < 0.05) to various aspects of physical or mental health outcomes. Conclusions: Multidimensional factors including personal characteristics and protective environments are related to health status among older individuals. The unique roles of each environment can help inform public health interventions to create and enhance support for older adults to engage in healthful activities and improve their physical and mental health."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The aging population in the United States has reached 43 million persons and is growing rapidly with the aging of the baby boomer cohort [1] .

Our study examined several factors explored in other research examining the role of multilevel health determinants, demonstrating the continuing relationship between these factors into later life.\nConsistent with previous research [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] , this study confirms that chronic disease is an important factor influencing physical and mental health of the older individuals. According to CDC, chronic conditions are the costliest, common health issues affecting Americans, but are also preventable.\nFurther, as in other studies, we found that older persons with higher education were less likely to be in poor physical and mental health. There is considerable research documenting the strong association between education and health outcomes [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Having a higher education attainment is associated with an increased health-related knowledge, healthier lifestyle and environments, and a sense of personal control over circumstances [10] . A study with a large sample size from the National Health Measurement Study found that persons aged 35 to 89 years with lower education level had worse health-related quality of life than those with higher education level [19] .This study showed that participants who were female were less likely to report poor physical health. The literature on gender differences and physical health shows conflictive results [14] [15] [16] [65] [66] [67] [68] . Possible explanations for the discrepancy may include differences in the measurement of physical health as well as variations in the sex-ratio and disability-related conditions among samples. Our study did not investigate gender differences in prevalence of chronic diseases; thus findings discrepancies warrant further examination.\nThis study is unique because it examines the associations of 5 different types of environments on physical and mental health. All environments (family, home, financial, neighborhood, and healthcare environments) were significantly associated with poorer health in our study population. Consistent with the literature [69] [70] [71] , results in this study indicate that those who were married were less likely to report poorer physical health than those not married.\nIn our study participants that had a regular healthcare provider were less likely to report poorer physical health than those experiencing opposite circumstances. Other authors found a negative association between health and healthcare utilization [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . These discrepancies may be related to health-status measurements and disability-related conditions among samples. Our study found that higher financial needs were significantly associated with poorer physical health, which is consistent with previous research [17, [78] [79] [80] . An intriguing finding in our study was that for each additional person living at home, participants were significantly more likely to be in poorer physical and mental health. There are two possible explanations for this result. One explanation is that the elders in the household are carrying the burden of financially supporting others in the family. Research conducted in California indicates that when an older adult supports one adult child at home, their cost of living increases by at least 50% [81] . A second explanation is that because of their poor health older persons tend to live with family members, besides the spouse, as a safety net strategy. For instance, The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey found that for older individuals living with family members was positive for their self-rated health, but it was associated also with a higher risk of functional and cognitive impairment [82] . Other studies found an association between functional impairment and not living alone at home [83] .\nOur findings indicate that participants perceiving to live in a neighborhood with trusted and helpful neighbors were less likely to report poor mental health. This is consistent with previous research [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . A study conducted using data from the 2010 National Outcome and Assessment Information Set found that living alone and insufficient social support were predictors of hospitalizations and poor health among elderly individuals [53] . Research in Australian rural communities discovered that increased community support and personal support were predictors of well-being [23] .\nStudy findings related to housing conditions and physical and mental health resonate with previous research [40] [41] [42] [43] . One study conducted with adults determined a positive impact between housing improvements and physical and mental health [90] .\nGiven, our findings surrounding social ecological factors [91] and structural and social determinants of health [44] being significantly associated with poor physical and mental health, we suggest further research in this area. For example, previous work in Texas has looked at health behaviors predictive of poor health, namely physical activity as it relates to older adults [92, 93] . These findings show the importance of both perceived and objectively measured characteristics of one's environment, especially as environments perceived as more cohesive or measured objectively as walkable [92] have been shown to be associated with a greater likelihood of meeting certain thresholds of physical activity through walking. Walking is particularly important for older adults, as it has been shown to be the most common form of physical activity among this age group [94] ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study was based on a cross-sectional design; therefore, causal inferences cannot be made. Future research should incorporate longitudinal data to determine causal associations throughout the life course. Although one of the strengths of this study is the use of a large data set, due to the sampling technique used and because data were collected in only one region in Texas, findings of this study may be generalized only to older adults living in areas with similar demographic characteristics to the study participants. It should be noted that there was considerable case attrition when applying inclusion criteria for this study (approximately 400 cases were omitted because of missing data). About half of cases omitted were missing data related to their access to healthcare, which may have biased our sample towards those with some form of health insurance (lack of insurance is typically associated with those of less education, less affluence, and certain races/ethnicities). Further, given the vast majority of older adults in the target area reported being white, these results are limited in generalization to other more diverse racial or ethnic groups. Future research should incorporate a more diverse group of individuals for greater generalizability. Although health status was measured using a valid, reliable instrument, dependent and independent variables were measured using a self-report instrument, which could have led to some biases. For instance, data was not collected to determine if study participants were actually receiving social services they reported needing. In addition, not all variables were asked that would give context about each environment (independent variables) and its contribution to the health status of participants. Measures of family and neighborhood environments did not elicit additional information from participants which could have been useful to investigate more in depth the association between these constructs and health status. Finally, other potential protective environments relevant to health status of older individuals, such as the built-environment and social network, were not included in this study."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Despite its limitations, this study shows that multidimensional factors including personal characteristics and protective environments, such as family, home, finances, neighborhood, and access to healthcare, all come into play to determine poor or good physical and mental health of older individuals. Given the growth in older adults [1] , this study is especially timely for policy makers and other stakeholders seeking to identify risk factors for poor health among older adults. This study provides relevant information that may inform public health interventions aiming to improve physical and mental health among older adults. Our study findings suggests a need for chronic disease-self management interventions tailored for older adults, which have been shown to be effective in reducing and controlling chronic conditions [95, 96] . Families could also be exposed to programs educating and empowering them to become a strong, positive support for their older adult co-habitant. Community and public health efforts could focus activities and events at local venues to promote neighborhood cohesion, capacity building, and social support for older persons. Finally, access to healthcare could be increased by providing mobile clinics or telehealth services, as well as providing elders with low-cost transportation to attend physician visits."}]
