[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Recently, multi-task based feature selection methods have been used in multi-modality based classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, in traditional multi-task feature selection methods, some useful discriminative information among subjects is usually not well mined for further improving the subsequent classification performance. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a discriminative multitask feature selection method to select the most discriminative features for multi-modality based classification of AD/MCI. Specifically, for each modality, we train a linear regression model using the corresponding modality of data, and further enforce the group-sparsity regularization on weights of those regression models for joint selection of common features across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we propose a discriminative regularization term based on the intra-class and inter-class Laplacian matrices to better use the discriminative information among subjects. To evaluate our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on 202 subjects, including 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients, and 52 healthy controls (HC), from the baseline MRI and FDG-PET image data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The experimental results show that our proposed method not only improves the classification performance, but also has potential to discover the disease-related biomarkers useful for diagnosis of disease, along with the comparison to several state-of-the-art methods for multi-modality based AD/MCI classification."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As the common form of dementia worldwide, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary neurodegenerative brain disease occurring in elderly people. It was first described by a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906 and was named after him (Berchtold and Cotman 1998) . It was reported that there were 26.6 million AD patients in the world in 2006 (Berchtold and Cotman 1998) . Also, it is predicted that 1 in 85 people will be affected by AD by 2050 (Brookmeyer et al. 2007 ). There is a prodromal state between normal aging and AD, called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) . Most individuals with MCI will eventually progress to dementia within 5 years (Gauthier et al. 2006) . There is no cure for AD and no treatment to reverse or halt its progression. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of AD and MCI is very important to delay the disease progression. However, since the change of AD-related brain is prior to the symptom of AD, it is critical to detect those changes for early diagnosis of AD. Recently, neuroimaging technology is increasingly used to identify such abnormal changes in the early stage of AD (Cheng et al. 2012; Petersen et al. 1999; Sui et al. 2012; Ye et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011) .\nEarly studies on AD/MCI classification mainly focus on using a single modality of biomarker, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (De Leon et al. 2007; Fan et al. 2008; McEvoy et al. 2009 ), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Higdon et al. 2004; Morris et al. 2001; De Santi et al. 2001) , cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Mattsson et al. 2009; Shaw et al. 2009 ), etc. However, in those studies, some useful complementary information across different modalities of biomarkers is ignored, which is helpful for further improving the accuracy of classification. Recently, several researchers have explored to combine multiple modalities of biomarkers (Apostolova et al. 2010; Fjell et al. 2010; Landau et al. 2010; Walhovd et al. 2010; Jie et al. 2013 ). For instance, Hinrichs et al. (Hinrichs et al. 2009 ) combined two modalities, i.e., MRI and PET, for classification of AD. Bouwman et al. (Bouwman et al. 2007) proposed to combine two modalities of MRI and CSF to identify MCI patients from healthy controls (HC). Fellgiebel et al. (Fellgiebel et al. 2007 ) used PET and CSF to predict cognitive deterioration in MCI. Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2011 ) combined three modalities, i.e., MRI, FDG-PET and CSF, to classify AD/MCI from HC. Gray et al. (Gray et al. 2013 ) used four modalities, i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, CSF and genetic information, for AD classification. These existing studies have suggested that different modalities of biomarkers can provide the inherently complementary information that can improve accuracy in disease diagnosis when used together (Apostolova et al. 2010; Fjell et al. 2010; Landau et al. 2010; Walhovd et al. 2010; Foster et al. 2007 ).\nIn multi-modality based classification methods, traditional feature selection approaches, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and t-test, are often performed to help select the disease-related brain features for training a good learning model (Tibshirani 1996; Wee et al. 2012) . However, one main disadvantage of those feature selection methods is that they usually ignore the inherent relatedness among features from different modalities. Recently, multi-modality based feature selection methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. For example, Huang et al. (Huang et al. 2011 ) presented a sparse composite linear discrimination analysis to recognized ADrelated ROIs from multi-modality data. Liu et al. (Liu et al. 2014 ) proposed a multi-task based feature selection with each task corresponding to a learning model using individual modality of data and embedding inter-modality information into multitask learning model for AD classification. Gray et al. (Gray et al. 2013 ) constructed a multi-modality classification framework based on pairwise similarity measures which come from random forest classifiers for the classification between AD/MCI and HC. However, in those methods, some useful discriminative information, such as the distribution information of intra-class and inter-class subjects, is not well mined, which may affect the final classification performance.\nTo address that problem, in this paper, we propose a new discriminative multi-task feature selection (DMTFS) model, which considers both the inherent relations among multimodality data and the distribution information of intra-class subjects (i.e., subjects from the same class) and inter-class subjects (i.e., subjects from different classes) from each modality. Specifically, we first formulate feature selection on multi-modality data as multi-task learning problem with each task corresponding to a learning problem on individual modality. Then, two regularized terms are included into the proposed DMTFS model. Specifically, the first term is the groupsparsity regularizer (Ng and Abugharbieh 2011; Yuan and Lin 2006) , which ensures only a small number of common brain region-specific features to be jointly selected from multimodality data. Furthermore, we introduce a new Laplacian regularization term into the proposed objective function, which preserves the compactness of intra-class subjects and the separability of inter-class subjects, and hence induces the more discriminative features. Finally, we adopt the multikernel support vector machine (SVM) technique to fuse multi-modality data for performing classification of AD/ MCI. To evaluate the proposed method, a series of experiments are performed on the baseline MRI and FDG-PET image data of 202 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which includes 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients, and 52 HC. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method, in comparison with the existing multi-modality based methods. Figure 1 shows the overview of our proposed framework, which contains three major steps, i.e., image pre-processing and feature extraction, discriminative multi-task feature selection, and multi-kernel SVM classification. In this section, before giving the detailed descriptions of these steps, we will first introduce the subjects used in this study."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The dataset we used in this study is obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.adni-info.org).

The ADNI is committed to evaluate the progression of early Alzheimer's disease, i.e., MCI, by combining some technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other clinical diagnosis, which greatly improve the efficiency of diagnosis, and save the time of treatment and the cost to the patients.\nFollowing our previous works (Zhang et al. 2011 , we evaluate the proposed method on the baseline MRI and FDG-PET data of 202 ADNI subjects, which contain 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI converters (MCI-C) and 56 MCI non-converters (MCI-NC)), as well as 52 healthy controls (HC).

With atlas warping, we can partition each subject image into 93 regions of interests (ROIs). For each of the 93 ROIs, we compute the GM tissue volume from the subject's MRI image. For PET image, we first rigidly align it with its respective MRI image of the same subject, and then compute the average value of PET signals in each ROI. Therefore, for each subject, we can finally obtain totally 93 features from MRI image and another 93 features from PET image."}, {"section_title": "Discriminative Multi-Task Feature Selection (DMTFS)", "text": "Before deriving our proposed discriminative multi-task feature selection (DMTFS) method, we first briefly introduce the traditional multi-task feature selection (MTFS) model . Suppose\nN\u00d7d as training subjects from the m -th modality (i.e., task), and \nwhere M is the number of modalities, \u2016W\u2016 2,1 =\u2211 j=1 d \u2016w j \u2016 2 s the l 2,1 -norm of weight matrix which calculates the sum of l 2 -norm of w j (Yuan and Lin 2006) , and w j is the j-th row of W which represents the weight vector of the j -th feature across M tasks. Here, the l 2,1 -norm is adopted to enforce the group sparsity on the weight matrix, i.e., encouraging a number of rows in the weight matrix being zero. The first term in Eq. (1) is the empirical loss function, which measures the error between predicted value obtained from learning model and the true value. \u03bb is a regularization parameter which balances the relative importance of both terms. The larger \u03bb value means the more zero rows appear in the weight matrix, i.e., few of features are preserved.\nIn MTFS model, a linear function (i.e., f(x)=w T x) was used to map the data from the original high-dimensional feature space to one-dimensional space. This model only focuses on the relationship between label and subject, and thus ignores the distribution information of subjects from each modality, such as the compactness of intra-class subjects and the separability of inter-class subjects. This kind of information may help induce the more discriminative features and thus further improve the classification performance. Figure 2 illustrates an example. Here each color denotes a class, and the points with the same color denote that they come from the same class. The arrows with green color denote that green points (which are intra-class nearest neighbors) should be closer to the central green point in the new feature space. Also, the arrows with purple color denote that purple points (which are inter-class nearest neighbors) should be far away from the central green point in the new feature space. Intuitively, Fig. 2 shows that intra-class samples should be closer while inter-class samples should be far away in the new feature space.\nTo address this problem, inspired by some recent works (Cai et al. 2007; Xue et al. 2009 ), we propose a new discriminative regularization term to preserve the distribution information of subjects. To be specific, in each modality, for each subject x i m , we first seek its k nearest neighbors, i.e., n( \nThen, to preserve the discriminative and structural information of two graphs during linear mapping, we introduce a new discriminative regularization term as:\nWhere\nand With the regularizer in Eq.

(9)."}, {"section_title": "Optimization algorithm", "text": "In our study, we use the Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) technique Liu 2999) to solve the optimization problem in Eq. (9).

(13) into d separate sub-problems, for which the analytical solutions can be easily obtained.

Here, we find the optimal values of \u03b1 m by using a coarse-grid search on the training subjects with range from 0 to 1 and the interval value of 0.1. Finally, the LIBSVM toolbox (Chang and Lin 2011 ) is adopted to perform SVM with the mixed kernel defined in Eq. (15). "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Classification performance", "text": "In this paper, we adopt 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the classification performance. Specifically, we divide the whole samples into 10 parts, leaving one part for testing and the remaining parts as training data in each cross-validation. This process is repeated for 10 independent times to avoid the bias in random partition of samples. Four performance measures, including classification accuracy (ACC) measuring the proportion of subjects correctly classified among the whole subjects, sensitivity (SEN) measuring the proportion of AD or MCI patients correctly classified, specificity (SPE) measuring the proportion of healthy controls correctly classified, and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), are used to evaluate the classification performance of different classification methods. We compare our proposed DMTFS method with several other methods, including multi-task feature selection method (denoted as MTFS) , and multi-modal classification method proposed in (Zhang et al. 2011 ) using the least absolution shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) as feature selection (denoted as MML). For further comparison, we also concatenate the MRI and PET features into a long feature vector, followed by the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) (Pudil et al. 1994 ) for feature selection, and then using the standard SVM for classification. Table 1 lists the comparison of different methods for AD/MCI classifications. Figure 3 plots the ROC curves of different methods.\nFrom Table 1 and Fig. 3 , we can see that our proposed method outperforms the other methods in all performance measures for both AD and MCI classifications. Specifically, our method achieves the classification accuracies of 95.92 % and 82.13 % for AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC, respectively, while the best accuracies of other methods are only 92.07 % and 74.17 %, respectively. In addition, our method achieves high AUC values of 0.97 and 0.82 for AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC, respectively, showing better diagnostic power than the other methods for AD/MCI classifications.\nOn the other hand, we also perform experiments on classifying MCI converters (MCI-C) from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC), with the corresponding results shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4 . As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 4 , our proposed method achieves better classification performances than other methods for MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classification. Specifically, our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 71.12 % for MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classification, which is nearly 10 % higher than the best result by other methods.\nIn addition, we perform significance test on the classification performances between our proposed method and other compared methods by using the standard paired t test under the significance level of 95 %. Table 3 shows the results of t test between our method and any other method. As we can see from Table 3 , for all the three classification tasks, i.e., AD vs. HC, MCI vs. HC, and MCI-C vs. MCI-NC, our proposed method is significantly better than other compared methods, which again shows the advantages of our proposed method.

Figure 5 plots the top 15 selected brain regions for MCI vs. HC classification. As can be seen from Fig. 5 , our method can effectively identify those disease-related brain regions such as hippocampal, amygdala, precuneus, and temporal pole, which have been reported to be relevant with AD in the previous studies (Dai et al. 2009; Del Sole et al. 2008; Misra et al. 2009; Solodkin et al. 2013; Van Hoesen and Hyman 1990; Wang et al. 2012) .
