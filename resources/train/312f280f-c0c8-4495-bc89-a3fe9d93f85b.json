[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "CoastalGIS is a program to deliver geographic information to planners, decision makers and citizens of Lake Superior,s north shore. The project uses the Internet is the primary vehicle for information delivery -data and supporting materials are housed at www.nrri.umn.edu/coastalgis. Data are delivered in two formats -as downloadable shapefiles for users with desktop GIS systems and via and Internet Map Server, which allows users to access data using only a PC and standard web browsers. This project comprised four specific tasks:"}, {"section_title": "1) Add series of newly released local and national GIS data sets", "text": "The project added a number of recent data sets related to land use/land cover. These included the 2002 National Land Cover dataset, a classification of land use and land cover at a 30 m pixel resolution, the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) assessment of landscape change (also at 30 m resolution) and an NRRI forest land classification that used multitemporal Landsat imagery to classify forests types to the genus or species level. 2) Add high-resolution spatial data to townships within the Coastal Program boundary The development of advanced data compression algorithms and improved map server software allowed us to deliver high resolution data (the previous site delivered primarily low-bandwidth line and polygon data). At the same time, a number of very high resolution data sets (< 2 m pixels resolution), such as the 2003 National Agricultural Imagery Program have become available. Other high-resolution data sets include the Digital Ortho Quarter Quads (grayscale or CIR rectified imagery), topographic relief models and scanned materials such as digital raster graphics. We now provide access to these data sets via the Internet Map Server."}, {"section_title": "3) Deliver data provided by the Minnesota Lake Superior Coastal Program", "text": "The Coastal Program has funded a number of GIS related projects that did not have a convenient mechanism for delivery. We cooperated with Coastal Program staff to identify and prioritize spatial data currently held by the Minnesota Lake Superior Coastal Program to include in the data delivery system."}, {"section_title": "4) Develop and implement training for citizens and decision makers on hot wo", "text": "use the information located on the CoastalGIS website. We conducted a series of training workshops and presentations for citizens and decision makers. The intent of the workshops was to show citizens and decision makers why these data are important, how to access and analyze the data, and how to make meaningful interpretations of the results. Workshops were structured as hands-on computer labs in which attendees worked with data relevant to their issues or locality. The following sections summarize the accomplishments for each of the tasks."}, {"section_title": "Work Completed", "text": "Task 1: Add series of newly-released data sets to the CoastalGIS website. We added a series of spatial data and metadata for several broad categories of geographic data, including the recent National Land Cover Data (NLCD) set, derived from 2002 LANDSAT imagery and released to the public in summer 2004. The data set classifies land cover into 21 classes (e.g. low and high intensity residential, row crop, grasses, deciduous forest, woody and emergent wetlands, quarries, others) and is mapped at a 30 m pixel resolution. These data are useful for quantifying the proportions of land types within watersheds, townships, or other kinds of summary units. A related data set is NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), which is a national baseline describing land cover change in coastal regions. C-CAP is available for 1995, 2005 and a 1995-2000 change data set. The intent of these data sets are to assess urban growth, changes to natural resources, and allow trend analysis for land use planning; they are derived from analyses of NLCD data. We also added a Landsat TM based forest classification of northeastern Minnesota, developed at the Natural Resources Research Institute (UMD) by Peter Wolter. This classification is a more specific forest cover type classification for northeastern Minnesota. The classification is based on Landsat TM data from early summer in conjunction with key ancilliary MSS and TM dates to capture phenological changes of different tree species. In addition to satellite data, National Wetlands Inventory data were used to post-classify cover types that were initially confused in terms of spectral reflectance but were known to be associated with different soil moisture regimes. The classification discriminates different forest cover types, typically on a species-level. Of greatest significance, aspen-birch, maple, black ash, and tamarack were successfully classified. All data from Task 1 are available at three spatial extents: the Coastal Program boundary, the Lake Superior basin (catchment boundary), and by each of the 7 counties that intersect the Coastal Program boundary. This strategy allows users to select the range of data they need to address a particular question. The data are delivered as zipped downloadable ArcView shapefiles, according to the following schema: Horizontal Coordinate Scheme: UTM Ellipsoid: GRS1980 Horizontal Datum: NAD 83 Units/Resolution: Meters UTM Zone: 15 All data have associated metadata created according to the Minnesota Geographic Metadata Guidelines; information on these guidelines can be found at http://www.gis.state.mn.us/stds/metadata.htm A full listing of data is presented in Table 1. In addition to the 30 m data described in Task 1, we developed Internet Map Server sessions that allow access to various high resolution data sources. These include color aerial photographs from 2003 (Farm Service Administration), black and white Digital Ortho Quarter Quads (DOQQs) from 1990, or 1:24,000 topographic maps. These background data sets are used in many of the CoastalGIS IMS sessions, including the Lake Superior Oblique Photoset, and Duluth Township Stormwater Planning Tool. This task also included the implementation of a new javascript \"Zoom To:\" tool that allows the user to \"zoom in\" to (select) particular city or township. These IMS techniques are also being used by the related LakeSuperiorStreams.org project, which allows a user to generate maps by watershed: http://gisdata.nrri.umn.edu/website/northshorestreams/viewer.htm The Western Lake Superior Oblique Photo Set uses the high resolution datasets described above as a backdrop for viewing the Coastal Program's sequence of 35 mm photographs of the Lake Superior coastline from Duluth to the Canadian Border. The site can be accessed at http://gisdata.nrri.umn.edu/website/northshorephotos/viewer.htm The oblique photos have been incorporated into the MN Beaches website (www.mnbeaches.org), a GIS based application which is updated biweekly during summer to show beach closures based on fecal coliform counts along Minnesota's Lake Superior coastline. \u2022 In 2006 and 2007 we conducted a series of training sessions and presentations to a diverse range of citizens and local government officials on the access and application of spatial data layers offered through the CoastalGIS website. The primary audiences for these workshops were local decision makers and citizens from within the Minnesota Lake Superior Coastal Program boundary. The training sessions were hands-on computer exercises, with users going on-line to view and analyze data through the Internet Map Service. The presentations walked users through the various sets of data available on the site and demonstrated the use of the download utilities and Internet Map Server. We found that, with respect to spatial data layers delivered as shapefiles, end users that were interested in downloading data for use in ArcGIS typically had capabilities needed to analyze and process these data sets. Training sessions were held on-site in Duluth township and in the UMD Library's computer laboratory -in both cases we partnered with existing venues to capitalize on facilities and audience. The workshops introduced the CoastalGIS website in general, and described specific elements within the administration, ownership, land cover, basemap and other broad categories of the site. The laboratories described new capabilities we added to Internet Map Server, such as hierarchical-organized data menus. We covered basic navigation and use of common tools such as Identify and Measure. We also covered less common uses of IMS, such as the Query function and the procedures for moving data into an Excel worksheet. Training sessions were typically followed by a Q and A period that discussed problems or concerns with the site, and recommendation from the group were subsequently used to improve the site. We also had extended discussions on how end users can best use this information, and what future additions would be desirable from a management perspective. George Host conducted a hands-on training session in conjunction with the COSEE Lake Superior Exploration Workshop in July 2006. The 15+ participants included citizen scientists and educators both within and outside the Coastal Program region. The focus was on using data for decision making and education, and covered specifics of the data set, exercises in data retrieval, and discussions on data interpretation. Former UMD Master's student John Geissler conducted two training sessions in October 2006 with Duluth township landowners for using CoastalGIS data and the derivative stormwater planning tool. His presentation described CoastalGIS spatial data sets and how information on watershed, soils, wetlands, topography and aerial photos can be used interactively with IMS map server to aid in land use planning. He further described the interactive tool developed through CoastalGIS with additional funding through the Coastal Program's STAR grant and the University of Minnesota Duluth's Center for Community and Regional Research. A novel extension to the Internet Map Server was a utility to accept parcel ID numbers and use this ID to launch an IMS map view with data layers specific to that parcel. These original training sessions for CoastalGIS and the parcel analysis tool have become a regular course offering through the Boulder Lake Environmental Learning Center at the UMD Library Computer Lab. The courses were offered Jan 9, Feb 6, Oct 9 in 2007 and Jan 30, 2008. The success of these courses demonstrates there is a continuing interest among citizens in the data and utilities from this project. In addition to training sessions, we presented CoastalGIS at a number of professional conferences, meetings and informal public workshops, as listed below. Values in parentheses are estimated number of attendees. The server report shows that the site receives a large volume of traffic distributed fairly evenly across the year. The top search items include, as expected, GIS, Minnesota, and coastal, but also the Data Index (#2) and the IMS Primer (#4), indicating that the site really is being used as a data resource."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "CoastalGIS has become a comprehensive repository for downloadable and interactive spatial data within the Minnesota Coastal Program Boundary, adjacent watersheds, and surrounding counties. It has provided a home for fundamental datasets for the coastal watersheds at both moderate and high resolutions, as well as for historic GIS projects funded through the Coastal Program. CoastalGIS has become an important element of other data intensive initiatives, including LakeSuperiorStreams.org and MinnesotaBeaches.org. Through funding from EPA5s Great Lakes National Program Office, we are creating larger data repository for basic data and environmental stressors for US and Canadian Lake Superior watersheds. The CoastalGIS design will be used as a template for this larger initiative. Because of the interest of this and other projects, we fully expect that CoastalGIS will continue to remain an active and sustainable repository for spatial data for assisting in land use decisions and planning for the region."}]
