[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To gain further knowledge on the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we sought to characterize cognitive performance, neuroimaging and plasma-based AD biomarkers in a cohort of non-demented adults with down syndrome (DS). The goal of the down syndrome biomarker Initiative (DSBI) pilot is to test feasibility of this approach for future multicenter studies. We enrolled 12 non-demented participants with DS between the ages of 30-60 years old. Participants underwent extensive cognitive testing, volumetric MRI, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET; 18F-florbetapir), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) and retinal amyloid imaging. In addition, plasma beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) species were measured and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping was performed. Results from our multimodal analysis suggest greater hippocampal atrophy with amyloid load. Additionally, we identified an inverse relationship between amyloid load and regional glucose metabolism. Cognitive and functional measures did not correlate with amyloid load in DS but did correlate with regional FDG PET measures. Biomarkers of AD can be readily studied in adults with DS as in other preclinical AD populations. Importantly, all subjects in this feasibility study were able to complete all test procedures. The data indicate that a large, multicenter longitudinal study is feasible to better understand the trajectories of AD biomarkers in this enriched population.

Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) comprise the largest group with genetically determined AD, with a worldwide population of about six million people. In March 2013, the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) launched a pilot study named the Down Syndrome Biomarker Initiative (DSBI; Ness et al., 2012) . With the DSBI pilot, the ADCS' goal was to initiate a longitudinal biomarker study similar to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in individuals with DS, who represent a population highly enriched for developing AD. The ultimate aim of this work is to aid the development of preventive therapies for the dementia associated with both DS and AD, based on the apparent common pathogenic role of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) in the two conditions.\nThe tight link between genetic determinants of AD and the overproduction of A\u03b2 provides compelling support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis and has been the focal point in the development of disease-modifying drugs for AD (for review, Sperling et al., 2011) . We hypothesize that disease-modifying treatments for AD and DS should begin prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms to prevent extensive neurodegeneration and thus necessitate a clear understanding of biomarker changes throughout the course of the disease.\nThe study of DS provides a unique opportunity to characterize the preclinical changes associated with predisposition to AD. DS, or trisomy 21, affects 400,000 people in the U.S. with an incidence of 1/691 live births (Parker et al., 2010) and is caused by meiotic non-disjunction, leading to an extra copy of chromosome 21, on which the APP gene resides.\nRecent data suggest that AD biomarker changes in DS are similar to those observed in familial and sporadic AD. For example, studies demonstrate a six-fold increase in plasma A\u03b2 in individuals with DS as compared to age-matched non-DS individuals (Schupf et al., 2001 (Schupf et al., , 2007 (Schupf et al., , 2010 and A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data in DS are consistent with AD patients (Sabbagh et al., 2011 (Sabbagh et al., , 2015 Handen et al., 2012) . Furthermore, as seen in familial and sporadic AD, presence of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 allele is generally associated with greater accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques in the brains of adults with DS (Hyman et al., 1995; Lemere et al., 1996) . Presence of ApoE \u03b54 allele is also associated with an earlier age of onset of dementia (Schupf et al., 1996; Deb et al., 2000; Coppus et al., 2008; Prasher et al., 2008) .\nPostmortem studies indicate that adults with DS have a similar, prominent pattern of cerebral atrophy involving the medial temporal lobe structures, as seen in the early stages of AD (Hof et al., 1995; Teipel et al., 2004; Mullins et al., 2013) . Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of age-related brain changes in DS demonstrate the same pattern of hippocampal-specific atrophy observed in AD. Furthermore, the hippocampal atrophy in DS correlates with changes in memory measures (Krasuski et al., 2002; Beacher et al., 2010) . Hypometabolism on regional fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET also correlates with onset of dementia in older adults with DS (Schapiro et al., 1992a,b; Pietrini et al., 1997) .\nIn this study, we collected structural MRI, A\u03b2 PET, FDG PET, retinal A\u03b2, plasma A\u03b2 species, and cognitive performance measurements in a cohort of 12 non-demented adults with DS aged 30-60. Our goal was to establish feasibility of conducting a biomarker-intensive study in adults with DS."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Participants", "text": "The DSBI pilot enrolled 12 non-demented subjects for a 3-year longitudinal study of AD biomarkers (see Table 1 for Schedule of Events). The present analysis is restricted to the baseline data. Four non-demented subjects were in each age range: 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60. Inclusion criteria limited enrollment to individuals having a chromosome karyotype of DS due to Trisomy 21. Subjects were required to have a caregiver, absence of other neurological and psychiatric disorders, and be capable of and willing to perform study procedures. Having a clinical diagnosis of dementia was considered exclusionary as was presence of 6 months of progressive cognitive or functional decline as per ICD-10 criteria (Sheehan et al., 2015) . Exclusion of a diagnosis of dementia was also based on absence of evidence of recent deterioration in cognitive function found not secondary to medical illness (e.g., hypothyroidism, sleep apnea) in conjunction with absence of a significant decline in function over a period of 6 months or more. The diagnosing neurologist was experienced with dementia in DS and incorporated diagnostic recommendations from the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (Moran et al., 2013) . All participants or their legal representatives provided written informed consent before partaking in the study in accordance with the regulations and approval of the ethics committee (Luciana, 2003; Smith et al., 2013) . The tests selected from this battery for this study were as follows: motor control (MOT): the subject is asked upon appearance of a crossmark on the screen, to touch it as quickly and accurately as possible using the index finger of their dominant hand. This is essentially a practice routine to become skilled with regards to touchscreen use. The outcome parameter is median reaction time (RT): the subject is asked to hold the index finger on the holding button on the button box and keep it pressed until a circle on the screen lights up and then touch that circle with the index finger as quickly and accurately as possible. In the Simple condition, there is only one possible circle that will light up (Simple RT).\nIn the five-choice condition, any of five circles can light up (five-Choice RT). Paired associated learning (PAL): the subject is shown 2-8 (max) distinct visual patterns, each at one of eight positions inside of an octagon on the screen. The task is to memorize which pattern occurred where. After the memorization stage, each pattern is shown in the center of the screen and the subject has then to touch one of eight possible positions where the pattern first occurred. Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was developed for the dual purposes of identifying and characterizing abnormal cognitive decline in the older adult and as a neuropsychological screening battery for younger patients (Randolph et al., 1998) . It is a brief, individually administered test that can be used to measure cognitive decline or improvement. The full battery is composed of 12 subtests assessing the: immediate memory, visuospatial abilities, language, attention and delayed memory. In this study, seven subtests of the RBANS were used to assess immediate and delayed memory, as well as the language capacities (subtests: list learning, story memory, list recognition, list recall, picture naming, semantic fluency, digit span)."}, {"section_title": "Vineland-II", "text": "Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-II) parent/caregiver interview form.
