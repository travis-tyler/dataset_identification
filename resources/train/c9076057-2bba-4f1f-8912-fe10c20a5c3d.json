Thanks to cuttingedge technological and methodological advances in genomic and proteomic analysis, we foresee unlimited methodological possibilities for understanding and modifying the role of genes and protein in disease (Esvelt and Wang, 2012; Mostafavi et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2012) . Gene expression (GE) examination has been of crucial value, revealing disease-specific differentiated genes/molecular-pathways and gene-gene networks with a direct effect in neuropathological and cognitive/clinical deterioration (Mostafavi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013) . However, neurodegenerative conditions may take decades to develop and GE mapping techniques are quite recent, hence the unavailability of individual GE datasets covering a given disease's whole evolution. All reported studies are based on cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal data, while we continue to lack long-term datasets covering the several phases underlying neurodegeneration.\nIn addition, due to its highly invasive nature, brain GE studies in neurodegeneration are based on post-mortem tissue samples. There are major challenges associated with the translation/extrapolation of ex-vivo results to in-vivo conditions (Ferreira et al., 2018) . This could imply that disease mechanisms (e.g. gene-gene causal networks) and potential biomarkers identified with post-mortem data may well not be entirely generalizable to live patients. In this sense, peripheral molecular measurements (e.g. plasma GE) may be used to cross-validate postmortem based methodologies and findings, potentially providing minimally invasive in-vivo biomarkers for accurate patient screening in the daily clinic and clinical trials implementation. Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive longitudinal peripheral datasets, covering multiple disease stages at the individual level, makes in-vivo dynamic molecular analyses unpractical. Consequently, this affects the identification of robust peripheral biomarkers across continuous disease stages and variants.\nDue to the proven ability to disentangle temporal components from high-dimensional crosssectional data, novel unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer a viable opportunity for dealing with the previous limitations. The data-driven reconstruction of pseudo-temporal paths to order observations (e.g. cells, subjects) is revolutionizing omics studies, enabling for the first time the mapping of complex dynamic processes using cross-sectional \"snapshots\" (Cannoodt et al., 2016; Gupta and Bar-Joseph, 2008; Magwene et al., 2003; Welch et al., 2016) . Based on the ML inference of a low dimensional space embedded in a population's omics data, and by creating a relative ordering of the individuals, we can accurately identify a series of molecular states that constitute a longitudinal trajectory for a process of interest (Campbell and Yau, 2018) . When used in RNA-seq studies, this novel technique has provided an unprecedented insight into the evolution of multiple pathologies. It has also allowed tracking and dissecting differentiated spatiotemporal programs in single-cell analysis (Briggs et al., 2018) .\nDriven by the imperative of a better understanding and an earlier detection of neurodegeneration, here we extend pseudotemporal trajectory inference (TI) to the analysis of both post-mortem and in-vivo (blood) GE neurodegenerative samples. Firstly, to better address important methodological limitations in data exploration and visualization, we introduce the contrastive Trajectory Inference (cTI) algorithm. This allows the unsupervised identification and ordering of enriched patterns in a diseased population (e.g. Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases) relative to a comparison background population (e.g. healthy elderly). Next, we analyze GE samples from blood plasma of 744 subjects in the spectrum of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and from 1225 autopsied brains in the spectrum of LOAD and Huntington's disease (HD). Our method provides molecular pathological scores that are highly predictive of neuropathological and cognitive/clinical deterioration. The results are strongly consistent for both in-vivo and postmortem data. In addition, it allows identification of genes and molecular pathways driving neurodegenerative progression, as well as analysis of (dis)similarities in molecular disease mechanisms at brain and peripheral tissue levels. The inference of contrasted genetic trajectories is a promising tool for understanding complex neuropathological mechanisms and for minimally invasive patient screening at the daily clinic, with practical implications for implementing personalized medical interventions in neurology."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Inferring Enriched GE Neurodegenerative Trajectories", "text": "GE, neuropathology and cognitive/clinical deterioration in 1969 demented and non-demented subjects from three large-scale studies were assessed (see Figure 1 , and Datasets 1-3 in Star Methods). GE and neuropathology evaluations from both dataset 1 (N=489, ROSMAP Study) and dataset 2 (N=736, HBTRC database) were performed in autopsied brains, with genetic profiling from the PFC. GE from Dataset 3 (N=744, ADNI database) was obtained from in-vivo blood samples, with all subjects also having brain imaging evaluations including amyloid PET, tau PET and/or structural MRI.\nAiming to uncover the molecular reconfigurations underlying neurodegenerative evolution, we proceeded to reorder the GE patterns (Fig. 1 ). For this, we implemented a novel unsupervised algorithm for detecting enriched trajectories in a diseased population relative to a background dataset (e.g. normal controls; see cTI subsection in Star Methods). A distinctive feature of cTI is the use of a contrastive Kernel PCA algorithm (Abid et al., 2018) , which controls by the principal components of the background data to optimize the exploration and visualization of the target. It is a generic algorithm, adaptable to different types of data (e.g. genomic, proteomic, imaging, clinical) and nonlinear effects. Each GE dataset was firstly adjusted for relevant confounding covariates (e.g. RIN, age, gender and/or educational level; see details in Statistics, Star Methods). Next, the cTI was independently applied to the three populations, providing population-specific trajectories starting on the background data. Each trajectory is composed by the concatenation of a subset of subjects, which follows a given behavior in the data's dimensionally reduced space. We hypothesized that the position of each subject in these GE trajectories would reflect individual proximity to the pathology-free state (the background) or, if analyzed in the inverse direction, proximity to advanced disease states. Correspondingly, a GE-pseudotime value ([0,1] range) is calculated for each subject, with relatively low values for subjects with final positions close to the background data, and high values for subjects on the distant extremes of the population. Notice that GE-pseudotime could then be assumed as an individual molecular score of pathological progression, whose validity is tested in the following subsections. See also Figure 1 . c) The high dimensional data is automatically reduced to an enriched space (~5 features) via a contrastive Kernel PCA algorithm (cKPCA (Abid et al., 2018) ), which optimizes the exploration and visualization of the target population's data. d) In the contrasted Principal Components (cPC) space, each subject is assigned to a GE-trajectory. The subject's position in the corresponding GE-trajectory reflects the individual proximity to the pathology-free state (the background) and, if analyzed in the inverse direction, to the advanced disease state. An individual GE-pseudotime score is calculated, reflecting the distance to these two extremes (background or disease). e) When taken as an individual molecular score of disease evolution, the GE-pseudotime strongly predicts neuropathological and/or cognitive measurements. f) Both in peripheral and brain tissues, the cKPCA's loadings (or weights) allow the identification and posterior functional analysis of most informative genes in terms of pathological evolution."}, {"section_title": "Post-mortem GE Trajectories Predict Neurodegenerative Severity", "text": "Firstly, we analyzed the GE trajectories obtained for the ROSMAP study (dataset 1, N=489). The results showed a clear association between the obtained molecular disease score (GE-pseudotime) and the autopsied tau and amyloid assessments, with a higher GE-pseudotime value implying an advancer neuropathologic state. Group differences in GE-pseudotime values were statistically tested via ANOVA tests with permutations. We found robust significant associations between the GE-pseudotimes and Braak stages ( Fig. 2a; F=5 .57, P<0.001, FEWcorrected), Cerad stages (Fig. 2b; F=8.39, P<0.001, , and a composite variable (Braak+Cerad) reflecting the simultaneous presence of tau and amyloid (Fig. 2c; F=5.82, P<0.001, . Notice ( Fig. 2c ) a clearer GE-pseudotime correspondence with the composite (Braak+Cerad) variable than with Braak and Cerad stages separately. This is in line with the concurrent accumulation of both amyloid and tau in LOAD, considered indispensable markers for characterizing this disorder's progression (Serrano-pozo et al., 2011).\nNext, we explored the generalizability of these results in the considerably more heterogeneous database from HBTRC (dataset 2, N=736), including two different disorders (LOAD and HD) and nondemented controls. In consistence with the previous findings, we observed (Figs. 2d-e) a positive association between the individual molecular disease score and the levels of neuropathologic affectation in both disorders. The GE-pseudotimes were significantly associated with the Braak stages ( Fig. 2d ; F=7.87, P<0.001, FEW-corrected) and the Vonsattel stages (Fig. 2e; F= 18.80, P<0.001, . The fact that this population included multiple disorders did not seem to affect the robustness of the subject ordering in relation with disease progression, which supports the identification of a promising biomarker for the analysis of comorbid neurological conditions. "}, {"section_title": "Blood GE as a Robust Biomarker of Neuropathological Severity and Cognitive/Clinical Deterioration", "text": "Next, we aimed to investigate if the unsupervised ordering of GE patterns present in the blood can reflect neuropathological severity and, importantly, if it could be used as a marker of present and future cognitive deterioration. If successful, the latter could have strong implications for the in-vivo detection of future disease evolution in the clinic and to decide if a patient should be therapeutically treated or not. To test this, we identified the enriched GE trajectories in the plasma of 744 participants in the spectrum of LOAD from ADNI (dataset 3), taking as background those subjects without cognitive/clinical alterations or any evidence of cerebral infarcts, amyloid or tau deposition (see amyloid/tau PET imaging and neuropathology evaluation for Dataset 3, in Star Methods).\nIn line with our previous findings with the ROSMAP and HBTRC post-mortem data, the ADNIbased results (Figs. 2f-j) showed a significant predictive power of pathological severity. The individual GE-pseudotime values vastly reflected the differences in tau positivity ( Fig. 3f P=0.06). Altogether, these results support that, in the context of LOAD and the ADNI population, the subject's temporal ordering based on enriched blood GE patterns is strongly reflective of neuropathological, clinical, and memory severity, being also a solid early predictor of future memory and executive function loss. It is, however, a considerably less powerful predictor of cross-sectional cognitive control. "}, {"section_title": "In-Vivo and Post-Mortem Molecular Pathways Underlying LOAD Progression", "text": "Next, we aimed to identify the genes, molecular functions and pathways responsible for the accurate prediction of neurodegenerative progression. We also intended to clarify if similar predictive mechanisms were common to the periphery (blood) and brain tissues. In this context, the GE-cTI can provide a quantitative mapping of the most influential genes during the process of diseased trajectories inference. Specifically, the cKPCA's loadings (or weights) reflect how much each specific gene, in the original high dimensional space (i.e. ~40K transcripts), contributed to the reduced low dimensional space from which the trajectories were obtained. Thus, we used these weights to select the genes most influential on the subject's ordering, i.e. those genes driving the observed population differences predictive of neuropathological and cognitive/clinical alterations across the disease's evolution (see Statistical Analysis, Star Methods). Based on the dataset-specific identified genes, we then performed large-scale gene functional analyses with the Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) classification system (Mi et al., 2013) . Of note, this analysis was restricted to ROSMAP and ADNI populations, mostly related to LOAD evolution (unlike the HBTRC database, also including HD patients).\nFor the ROSMAP brains, we found 87 highly influential genes with 26 functional pathways (Figs. 4a, c, . These GO overrepresented pathways were highly sensitive for the detection of biological processes that are commonly associated with neuropathological and cognitive deterioration mechanisms, including oxidative stress response, axon guidance, histamine H1 receptor mediation, angiogenesis, inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling, Wnt and VEGF signaling, apoptosis, and Alzheimer's disease-amyloid secretase. Notably, 80% of these 26 highly predictive molecular pathways in the neurodegenerating brain (ROSMAP) were also among the most relevant pathways detected in the blood data (ADNI). The common blood-brain functional pathways relevant for LOAD progression included gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCKR) signaling, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, B cell activation, angiogenesis, Wnt signaling, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, among others ( Fig. 4c and Table S4 ).\nCommon functional pathways CCKR (associated with appetite control and body weight regulation (Perry and Wang, 2012) ), PDGF (with a significant role in blood vessel formation (Amaral et al., 2018) , B cell activation (involved in immune system response), and VEGF and angiogenesis (linked to the formation of new blood vessels), evidenced the direct relationship between the central nervous system and the body, both in health and in disease. Their unsupervised datadriven identification is, therefore, supporting the crucial importance of studying the periphery-brain axis (e.g. bidirectional gut, immune and vascular interactions with brain integrity) for a better understanding of systemic pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Interestingly, we also found another 20 highly influential molecular pathways in the blood that were not identified in the brain (Figs. 4b,c and Tables S2,5 ). This finding may be associated with multiple causes, including an increased pathological comorbidity in the periphery relative to the brain and/or crucial methodological limitations (i.e. the analysis of two different populations with divergent disease characteristics, and the use of different GE mapping techniques with dissimilar sensitivity/specificity capacities). In (a-b) , the bars show the number of genes associated to the main GO overrepresented categories. In (c), the color scale indicates the presence level (in %) of each functional pathway (e.g. dark blue for absent pathways, red for highly represented pathways). For lists of genes and pathways, see Tables S2-5 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Due to the typically long developing period of most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, we lack exhaustive longitudinal datasets covering the continuous molecular transitions underlying disease progression. Consequently, almost all our knowledge of the subjacent pathological mechanisms is based on data \"snapshots\" taken and analyzed at a few disease stages. Here, we aimed to overcome this crucial gap by inferring the intrinsic temporal information contained in large-scale neurodegenerative datasets. For that, we implemented a novel pattern analysis method that detects enriched GE trajectories in a diseased population (e.g. subjects progressing towards dementia) relative to a background population (e.g. a clinically normal control group). Our results in three different GE datasets (ROSMAP, HBTRC, ADNI) support the strong predictive power of this technique for identifying individual neuropathological stages and/or cognitive deterioration. This may well have broad implications for uncovering the dynamic mechanisms of molecular pathology, patient stratification in the clinic, and monitoring response to personalized treatments in neurodegeneration.\nA minimally invasive molecular test for neurodegeneration could lead to better treatment and therapies (Ray et al., 2007 ). An additional aim of this study was to identify an in-vivo peripheral biomarker able to predict the individual's pathophysiology and cognitive decline. When tested in 744 blood samples from ADNI, the proposed GE-cTI showed a significant association with both amyloid and tau positivity (Figs. 3a-c) . Furthermore, it was able to strongly predict both the current cognitive function and its future decline (Figs. 3e-h ). The fact that the proposed ML model is unsupervised (i.e. the neuropathological and cognitive variables are not used to train a predictive model), guarantees absence of possible circularity or data overfitting. Consequently, we can infer that the obtained genetic trajectories and the associated GE-pseudotime values are direct measures of molecular integrity, obtained independently of phenotypic variables, and would therefore be useful as unbiased biomarkers in clinical applications.\nOur analysis of most relevant molecular pathways for predicting LOAD progression revealed a striking similarity between peripheral and intra-brain pathological mechanisms. Eighty percent of the most predictive molecular pathways identified in the brain were also identified as top predictors in the blood. These pathways support the importance of studying the peripheral-brain axis (see Results, last subsection), providing further evidence for a key role of gut-brain interactions (Mayer et al., 2014; Westfall et al., 2017) , vascular structure and functioning (Bell and Zlokovic, 2009; Iturria-Medina et al., 2017 , and immune system response (Gendelman, 2002; Labzin et al., 2018; Streit et al., 2004) . The multi-tissue analysis based on genetic trajectories may be particularly useful for clarifying both local (tissue-specific) and systemic (interorgans) neurodegenerative mechanisms.\nOur method built on the pseudotemporal trajectory inference field (Cannoodt et al., 2016; Gupta and Bar-Joseph, 2008; Magwene et al., 2003; Welch et al., 2016) . Modeling the dynamics of gene regulation, rather than focusing on static time points, is crucial for clarifying cellular transitions and what goes wrong in the case of disease (Cannoodt et al., 2016) . We attempted to extend previous models by incorporating the use of a novel contrastive dimensionality reduction technique (Abid et al., 2018) , which allows detecting enriched patterns in the population of interest while adjusting by confounding components in the background population (e.g. concurrent aging effects). In a set of complementary analyses (data not known), we observed that, in comparison with other state-of-the-art TI methods (Campbell and Yau, 2018; Welch et al., 2016) , this extension provides a considerably higher sensitivity to detect diseased GE components (i.e. other methods could not predict neuropathology, nor cognition). In addition to uncovering disease dynamics, cTI may enable the data-driven identification of new subpopulations within a heterogeneous neurodegenerative population (Cannoodt et al., 2016; Trapnell, 2015; Trapnell et al., 2014) , with strong implications for precision medicine and the selective enrollment of patients in clinical trials. Furthermore, once the data is ordered, it could also improve the inference of causative regulatory interactions underlying a disorder (Cannoodt et al., 2016) .\nAnother advantage of cTI (and TI in general) is the ability to deal with high dimensional data. This is a key feature for the concurrent analysis of multi-omics, potentially allowing the exploration of multiple and complementary modalities, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and epigenomics. Contrastive trajectory inference can be also applied to the analysis of data from other fields, including multi-modal brain imaging, environmental and cognitive/clinical information. Finally, although our study is focused on neurodegenerative evolution, in general, cTI can be applicable to the study of multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions."}, {"section_title": "STAR METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "This study used GE data (Ntotal=1969) from three large-scale databases (see Table S1 for demographic characteristics).

Enrollment required no known sign of dementia. Upon death, a post-mortem neuropathologic evaluation is performed that includes a uniform structured assessment of AD pathology, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, and other pathologies common in aging and dementia. The pathologic diagnosis of AD uses NIA-Reagan and modified CERAD criteria, and the staging of neurofibrillary pathology uses Braak Staging (Braak H, 1991 ). An RNA integrity (RIN) score >5 and a quantity threshold (5 mg) for each sample were required (Bennett et al., 2014) . cRNA was hybridized to Illumina HT-12 Expression Bead Chip (48,803 transcripts) via standard protocols using an Illumina Bead Station 500GX (Webster et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013) .\nDataset 2. 736 individual post-mortem tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex BA9 of LOAD patients (N=376), HD patients (N=184) and nondemented subjects (N=173) were collected and analyzed (Zhang et al., 2013) . All autopsied brains were collected by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC; GEO accession number GSE44772), and include subjects for whom both the donor and the next of kin had completed the HBTRC informed consent (http://www.brainbank.mclean.org/). Correspondingly, tissue collection and the research were conducted according to the HBTRC guidelines (http://www.brainbank.mclean.org/). Postmortem interval (PMI) was 17.8 \u00b1 8.3 hr, sample pH was 6.4 \u00b1 0.3 and RNA integrity number (RIN) was 6.8 \u00b1 0.8 for the average sample in the overall cohort.\nAs previously described in (Zhang et al., 2013) , RNA preparation and array hybridizations applied custom microarrays manufactured by Agilent Technologies consisting of 4,720 control probes and 39,579 probes targeting transcripts representing 25,242 known and 14,337 predicted genes. Arrays were quantified on the basis of spot intensity relative to background, adjusted for experimental variation between arrays using average intensity over multiple channels, and fitted to an error model to determine significance (Emilsson et al., 2008) . Braak stage, general and regional atrophy, gray and white matter atrophy and ventricular enlargement were assessed and cataloged by pathologists at McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA, USA). In addition, the severity of pathology in the HD brains was determined using the Vonsattel grading system (Vonsattel et al., 1985) .\nDataset 3. This study used a total of 744 individual data with blood GE information, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.usc.edu). The participants underwent multimodal brain imaging evaluations, including amyloid PET, tau PET and/or structural MRI. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array (www.affymetrix.com) was used for gene expression profiling from blood samples. Peripheral blood samples were collected using PAXgene tubes for RNA analysis (Saykin et al., 2015) . The quality-controlled GE data includes activity levels for 49,293 transcripts. All the participants were characterized cognitively using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a composite score of executive function (EF), a composite score of memory integrity (MEM) (Gibbons et al., 2012) , and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscales 11 and 13 (ADAS-11 and ADAS-13, respectively). Also, they were clinically diagnosed at baseline as healthy control (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) or probable Alzheimer's disease patient (LOAD)."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "F-AV-45 (amyloid specific) and 18 F-AV-1451 (tau specific) PET images were acquired for a subset of 660 and 166 subjects, respectively.

Using the amyloid images, subjects were categorized as amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) or negative (A\u03b2-) by applying a cutoff of 1.11 to a Florbetapir composite SUVR normalized by the whole cerebellum reference (Described in ADNI_UCBERKELEY_AV45_Methods_12.03.15.pdf file, ADNI database).
