For example, Wigle, White, & Parish (1988) compared the reading, math, and writing achievement of both low and high IQ LI) students during late childhood and early adolescence. They found that mean IQ declined over time, as did math achievement scores, while reading and writing scores remained stable. Other studies also document the gap in math achievement between LI) and non LD students (e.g., Kavale & Reese, 1992), although most of these studies have not specifically examined such gaps for science achievement. In a large scale study of LD students in the state If Iowa, Cone and his colleagues found that placement into special education services for LD students occurred more frequently due to deficiencies in reading and spelling during the early school years, while placements due to mathematical problems generally did not occur until the upper elementary years (Cone, Wilson, McDonald Bradley, & Reese, 1985). They also reported that the discrepancy between IQ and achievement for ID students increased with age. Similar findings involving age are reported in several other large scale surveys of LD students' characteristics (e.g., Ackerman, Anhalt, & Dykman, 1986;Norman & Zigmond, 1980;Sheppard & Smith, 1981). Research has demonstrated that a number of factors may contribute to the achievement gaps between LD and non LI) students. For example, Zentall and Ferkis (1993) suggest that LD students' problems with mathematics are due to a combination of problems with cognitive ability, cognitive style, and inadequate curricular materials. Montague and Applegate (1993) suggest that LD students approach mathematical problems differently than do their non-disabled peers because they lack certain cognitive strategies which are needed for effective problem solving. Shepard and Adjogah (1994) found that differences in the language processing abilities of LD and non LI) students is related to differences in science achievement. These and other student-specific characteristics are important determinants of students' ability to solve mathematical and scientific problems."}, {"section_title": "School-Level Factors That Influence Achievement", "text": "A number of studies, reviews, and reports suggest that the transition from elementary to middle level schools has detrimental effects on the achievement and motivation of early adolescents (Andaman & Maehr, 1994;Carnegie, 1989;Eccles & Midgley, 1989;Eccles et al., 1993;Simmons & Blyth, 1987;Wigfield, Eccles, MacIver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991). Nevertheless, studies to date have not examined specifically the effects of this transition on the math and science achievement of LD early adolescents. A number of studies show that as students move from elementary to middle grade schools, achievement, motivation, and attitudes decline. In a large-scale longitudinal study of over 2,000 early adolescents, Eccles, Midgley, and their colleagues demonstrated that many of the negative changes that occur over the transition are due to contextual changes in the school environment (ie,, Eccles & Midgley, 1989;Wigfield et al., 1991). For example, while the elementazy school is characterized by small classes, projects, efficacious teachers, and cooperation, the middle school environment often tends to stress rote memorization, basic skill; competition, and less creative assignments. In addition, middle school teachers often feel less efficacious than do elementary school teachers (Midgley, Anderman, & Flicks, 1995), and this contributes to changes in student performance and attitude (Nedgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989). Simmons and her colleagues (e.g., Simmons & Blyth, 1987) demonstrated that changes in motivation and seW-esteem over the transition are directly related to contextual changes in the school environment. For example, one study found that girls who moved into a traditional middle school setting displayed a decline in self-esteem, while girls who remained in a K-8 school and Add not make a transition until at least the ninth grade did not experience this decline. In fact, the girls who attended the traditional middle school were still at a significant disadvantage even after entering high school These and other studies (e.g., Seidman, Allen, Aber, Mitchell, & Feinman, 1994) suggest that the middle school environment is antithetical to the needs of early adolescents. Eccles and Mideey refer to this as a problem of \"stage-environment\" fit -adolescents are at a stage of development when they need to be in an environment where they can experience independence, growth, cooperation and creativity; however, the typical middle school provides an environment which stresses competition, grades, relative ability, and rote memorization (Eccles & Midgley, 1989). While research has demonstrated that this change in environment has detrimental effects on adolescents in general, studies to date have not examined specifically the effects of these transitions on LD students. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of this transition on LD students, since the transition may exacerbate and contribute to achievement gaps during early adolescence. The present study examined the relationships between school-type and achievement gaps in math and science between LD and non LD adolescents, after controlling for student-level variables which are predictive of achievement. Since prior studies have documented that student level factors such as gender, grades in school, ethnicity, perceptions of the quality of teaching, and socioeconomic status are predictive of math and science achievement (e.g. Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989;Young & Fraser, 1993;1994) these factors are controlled before examining effects of school-type on the achievement gap. Specifically, the central hypothesis of the present study is that LD students who do not experience a school transition during early adolescence will eperience kss of an achievement gap than L13 students who do have to make a transition, after controlling for student-level variables. The present study utilizes a relatively new statistical technique, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), to examine the organiz,ational effects of school context simultaneously with the effects of student characteristics on math and science achievement. HLM is a technique which allows for the simultaneous modeling of individual and grouped data. Consequently, HLM allows for more accurate analyses of students who are \"nested\" in schools with different characteristics than do more traditional statistical techniques."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sank", "text": "Data for the present study come from the base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS; National Center for Education Statistics, 1994). NELS is a longitudinal study sponsored by the US Department of Education Office of Educational Research and improvement. The purpose of NELS was to examine the achievement, progress, and development of eighth graders and their schools. After the initial study was conducted in 1988, some of the students were followed-up eveiy two years through 1994. The present study used a sub-sample from the NELS data set. The sample includes 1946 eighth grade students from 78 schools. This sample was arrived at by including students from all schools that contained at least three LD students in the NELS sample. Since many NELS schools had no LI3 participants, or only one or two LD participants, these schools were eliminated since it would be difficult to obtain useful differentials in achievement between the LD and non LD students. The number of participants in the schools included in the study range from 13 to 34 students per schooL Of the selected participants, 296 (15%) were classified as LD, and 1608 (85%) were not L13.1 Since the study contains many schoc ; from different regions, different criteria were used for LD classification in various schools. The criteria used for inclusion as an L13 student in the present study are that the student is classified as LI) by the school, and that the student receives some special education services during the school day. Specifically, there is one question in the NELS parent survey which asks the parents, \"Is your eighth grader currently enrolled in any of the following special programs/services?\" One of the specific items then asks parents to indicate if their eighth grader receives \"special education services for students with learning disabilities.\" The 296 LD students included in the present study represent all of the students whose parents indicated that they were enrolled in special education services for students with L13 during the eighth grade, and who were aLso in NELS schools that containe d at least three LI3 students in the NELS sample. Parents also were asked to indicate if their children experienced any other exceptional conditions. According to the parents of the students included in the present study, 16 of the LD students (5.4%) and 24 of the non LD students (1.5%) had a visual handicap; 21 of the LD students (7%) and 30 of the uon 1.13 students (1.8%) had a hearing I Reported frequencies do not always total 1946 due to missing data on some measures for various students. problem; 9 of the LD students (3%) and 2 of the non LD students (0.1%) were deaf, 28 of the ID students (9.4%) and 21 of the non LD students (1.3%) had a speech problem; 5 of the LD students (1.7%) and 16 of the non LD students (1%) had an orthopedic. problem; 7 of the LD students (2.3%) and 23 of the non LD students (1.4%) experienced other physical disabilities; 38 of the LD students (12.8%) and 55 of the non LD students (3.4%) had emotional problems; 9 of the ID students (3%) and 49 of the non LD students (3%)were enrolled in bilingual or bicultural education services; and 8 of the LD students (2.7%) and 12 of the non LD students (0.7%) were enrolled in English as a Second Language programs. Because the subsequent hierarchical analyses require a minimum number of students per school (see Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992), students with these various other disabilities were included in the ID and non LD samples.2 The full sample of LD and non LD students is evenly divided by gender (51% male, 49% female). Ninety-six percent of the students attend public schools, with the remaining 4% attending private or religious schools. Schools vary in type from K-8 (7%), K-12 (3%), 6,7, or 8-12 (12%), 3,4, or 5-8 (14%), 6-8 or 7-8 (44%), and 7-9 or 8-9 (16%). The full size of the eighth grade enrollment varies greatly, ranging from small eighth grade enrollment (18% of the sample have only 1-49 students in their class), to large enrollment (10% of the sample are in classes with over 400 students). Most students are in medium sized eighth grade classes (30% have class sizes of between 100-199 students). Twenty percent of the students attend urban schools, 44% attend suburban schools, and 36% attend rural schools. Twenty-one percent of the students belong to minority groups (primarily African American, Ifspanic/Latino-American, and Native American). Since the present study includes a sub-sample of the 78 NELS schools with at least three LD students in the NELS sample, the data are not generalizable to the full sampling frame of NELS; consequently, in the present\\study, unweighted data are reported. The students in the sample come from varied backgrounds. Family income for students in this sample varies, with the mean family income ranging from $20,000-$35,000. The mean family size is 4.5 individuals per household. Seventy-five percent of the eighth graders indicated cusrently having some college plans. In terms of ability grouping, 23% are not ability grouped for math instruction, while 77% are grouped by ability. In science, 37% are not ability giouped while 64% are ability grouped."}, {"section_title": "Construction of Student-Level Variables", "text": "Below is a description of the development of each of the student-level variables. A plethora of variables can be used in studies predicting effects on academic achievement. The student-level variables chosen for the present study represent only the major demographic individual characteristics which prior research has identified as being important in studies of achievement of LD students (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, minority status, grades in school, plans for the future see Ackerman et aL, 1986;Cone et al., 1985;Norman & Zigmond, 1980;Sheppard & Smith, 1981;Wig le et al., 1988). In this study, I also included a measure of locus of control, and a measure of Audents' perceptions of the quality of teaching in their schools. The justification for the inclusion of these variables in presented below. The items used to calculate all scales are presented in the appendix. Grades. Students indicated on a 5 point scale their average grades in math, science, English, and history since the sixth grade. The measure was calculated from the mean of these four variables, in z-score format (Cronbach'S'Alpha = .76). Gender, LD, College and Minority Statue. Dummy variables representing gender (1 = female, 0 = male), college plans (1 = yes, 0 = no) and LD status (1 = LD, 0 = non LD) were created.. The study also includes a dummy variable for minority status, where students who are African American, Hispanic/Latino-American, or Native American are elassified as minorities, while students who are Caucasian or of Asian/Pacific Island decent are classified non minority for the present study (minority = 1, non-minority = 0). Percepdons of Quality of Teaching. A measure of students' perceptions of the quality of teaching in their school was included, because research suggests that students' perceptions of teacher evectations, beliefs, and behaviors have a strong impact on motivation and achievement, particularly during late childhood and early adolescence (e.g., Graham, 1984;Tvlidgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989;Weinstein, Marshall, Sharp, & Botkin, 1987). In addition, recent school reform efforts specifically aimed at making learning environments more developmentally appropriate for early adolescents have emphasized the importance of students' perceptions of various aspects of teaching (cf, Anderman & Maehr, 1994;Maehr, Midgley, & Colleagues, in press). Students responded on a four point scale, indicating how much they agreed or disagreed with various statements about their perceptions of teaching in their school. Using principal components factor analysis, a five item composite was created from the z-score of the mean on the five items (the teaching is good, teachers are interested in students, teachers praise my effort, I feel put down by teachers, teachers really listen to what I have to say). The final scale exhibited good reliability (Cronbach's Alpha = .78). Socioeconomic Status. This variable was constructed from parental data, and is a composite of mother and father's educational levels, occupations, and family income. The final variable is standardized (see NCES, 1988, for full details on the construction of this variable). Locus of Control. A measure of locus of control was included, since research on students causal attributions suggests that LD (and BD) students often adopt an external locus of control, and that locus of control is an important predictor of academic achievement, particularly in LD populations (Aponik & Dembo, 1983;Foley & Epstein, 1982;Tur-Kaspa & Bryan, 1993). This factor was calculated to be as similar as possible to the locus of control measure used in the Iligh School and Beyond Study (NCES, 1994). The final measure is a z-score, where a low score is indicative of low levels of control, and a high score indicates high perceptions of control over one's life."}, {"section_title": "Construction of School Level Variables", "text": "School Transition Variables. Two dummy coded variables were created from administrator reports of school type. One variable represents schools in which there is nn transition until at least the 9th grade; most students in this classification attend K-8 or K-12 schools. The other variable represents students who experienced a transition at grades 6 , 7, or 8. The comparison group consisted of students who made a transition at grades 3, 4, or 5. Attendance Rate. An administrator in each school supplied the average daily attendance rate for eighth grade students in the schooL This rate includes excused and unexcused absences. The attendance rate was standardized using a z-score calculation. School Safety. A composite measure of school safety was included in this study, since violence and safety in schools are important determinants oflearning and achievement (cf, Berliner, 1993;Jose-Kampther, 1994), and since levels of safety may vary by middle school type (e.g., Liadquist & Molnar, 1995;Weishew & Peng, 1993). Using items to which administrators responded, principal components factor analysis was used to identify a factor which represents how safe each school is. A high score on this factor indicates that vandalicm, weapons, and theft are a major problem in this school (Cronbach's Alpha = .80, see appendix for items)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "I first present means and standard deviations for LI) and non LD students in table 1.

Table 2 contains correlations between individual (student-level) predictors."}, {"section_title": "11111", "text": "Insert Tables 1 and 2 About Here The LD students exhibit lower math and science achievement, and lower overall grades. The LD students also report lower levels of locus of control, and do not aspire to attend college as much as do the non LD students. The LD students in the sample come from somewhat lower SES backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "Hierarchical Linear Models", "text": "While numerous studies document achievement differences between LI) and non LD students (e.g., Cone et al., 1985;Kavale & Reese, 1992), most of the studies only have included individual characteristics of students as predictors of achievement. It is plausible that these differences in achievement may vary across schools --LD students in one school environment may outperform LI) students in other schools, once individual differences have been controlled for. In this study, I use HLM to separate the within school variation in LD students' achievement from the between school variance in achievement. By using HLM, one can model both individual student characteristics and school-level characteristics into a more comprehensive model. The model takes both student and school-level variables into account. FILM is a relatively new statistical technique which is extremely useful for examining the effects of various organizational contexts on individual outcomes. Bryk & Raudenbush (1992) note that aggregation bias can occur when variables take on different meanings at different organizational levels. As an example, they discuss the common use of socioeconomic status (SES) as a variable in educational and psychological research. At the individual or \"student\" level, SES may serve as a measure of the resources available in a student's home; but, at the \"school\" level, the average SES may represent the resources available in the school It is statistically inappropriate to assign the average level of SES for all students in a given school as a student-level variable indeed, this is not a characteristic of the individual student, but a characteristic of the school that the student attends. By using FILM in such situations, researchers can break down the relationships between SES and a dependent variable (e.g., achievement) into separate Level-1 or \"student\" and Level-2 or \"'school\" models (see Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992, pp. 84-85). Consequently, in the present study, the use of FILM allows for the simultaneous examination of student and school-level factors that may be related to the lower achievement of LD students in math and science. Just as SES may vary between schools (i.e., some schools have a higher average SES than do other schools for variety of reasons), the difference in achievement between LD and non LD students .,lso may vary between schools. Research clearly suggests that LID students do not perfonm as well in math and science as non LD students (Ackerman et al, 1986;Cone et al, 1985;Norman & Zigmond, 1980;Sheppard & Smith, 1981;Wigle et al, 1988). However, no studies to date have used multilevel analyses to separate student and school characteristics in order to help to explain the types of environments which may account for these differences. From a more technical perspective, multilevel regression techniques such as HLM calculate standard errors of the estimates more appropriately than do more common ordinary least squares (OLS) approaches (Patterson, 1991). When researchers use OLS techniques with nested data, the standard errors often are calculated as too small Therefore, confidence intervals are also calculated as being too small."}, {"section_title": "How Much Does Achievement Vary Between Schools?", "text": "First, an unconditional FILM model was calculated, examining the amount of variance in math and science achievement that lies between schools for both LD and non LD students. Since one of the major purposes of the present study is to examine schoollevel effects on math and science achievement of LD students, it is important to examine the amount of variance in these variables that lies between schools for all students before controlling for individual and school-level variables which may help to explain the lower achievement of LD students (cf, , Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992). The variance that lies between schools (intraclass correlation) is 0.18 for mathematics, and 0.13 for science.3 This means that in mathematics, 18% of the variance in math achievement lies between schools, and this variance may be explained by school-level variables."}, {"section_title": "The Student Level Model", "text": "I first formed a student level HLM model, which uses student-level data as predictors of math and science achievement. The within-school, or \"student\" model is The dependent variables in these analyses are the students' scores on the math and science achievement tests. The LD/non LD differential is a predictor variable which is a dummy variable representing whether or not the student is classified as LD (value = 1) or non LD (value = 0). In the student-level model (prior to adding school-level predictors to the model), this variable should be interpreted as a standad dummy variable as used in a traditional multiple regression analysis. Thus the calculated values for this variable in the equation will represent the effect of being classified as LD or non LD on math or science achievement, after controlling for other variables."}, {"section_title": "The Full Model", "text": "The student-level model is similar to a more typical OLS regression model. However, the advantage of using HLM is that one also may add in school-level predictors and examine the ways in which these predictors influence the intercept and the slopes of various predictors. For math and science, the effects of several school-level variables on mean differences in achievement (00j) and on the LD/non LD differential (PO were modeled. This means that school-level variables are used to explain differences in math and science achievement (after controlling for characteristics of individual students) for all students, gild for achievement differences between LD and non LD students. For math, I also modeled the effects of school level variables on the slope for quality of teaching (132; (I did not model this slope for science since it was unrelated to science achievement, and thus eliminated from the model). Thus these parameters are allowed to vary between schools, while the other student-level variables are fixed in this way, they are controlled for a the student level, but not modeled as effects between schools (see Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992, for a full explanation). The between-school model examining between-school differences in math and science achievement can be expressed by the equation: = 0. + 0.1 (Attendance Rate) + 012 (School Safety) + uko where 000 = the intercept term for achievement, controlling for other school-level variables, 001= the effect of school attendance rate Within a given school on students' achievement, and 002 = the effect of the school's level of safety in a given school on students' achievement in math or science. In this model, the dependent variable is the average math or science achievement in each 'school. The independent variables are the school-level variables that are related to average achievement within a given school The between-school equation examining variation in the LD/non LD differential slope is expressed by the following equation: = + 011 (School Safety) + 012 (Transition Grade 617) + 013 (No Transition Until at Least 9th Grade) + nip where 03 = the intercept term for the LD/non LD slope, adjusted for other school variables, 011 = the effect of school safety within a given school on the relationship between the LD/non LD differential slope and achievement, On = the effect of having a school flansition in grades six or seven within a given school on the relation between the LD/noil LD slope and achievewnt, and 013= the effect of experiencing no transition until at least the ninth grade on the relation between the LD/non LD slope and achievements In this equation, the.dependent variable represents.the relationship between the LD/non LD differential and achievement in a given 'school. Recall that the major tesearch question in the present study concerns the effect of school environment during early adolescence on the math and science achievement of LD students. Thus this dependent variable is an extremely important variable in the present study. Specifically, this equation or model represents the effects of school characteristics (e.g., time of school transition, school safety, etc.) on the relationship between the LD/non LD achievement gap and overall achievement in a given school. Thus significant values for predictor variables in this model are indicative of school-level factors which are related to differences in achievement between LD and non LD students in a given school Results of the full HLM model, including student and school-level variables, are presented in Table 3. ..C01411141 Insert Table 3 About Here All variables have been standardized using z-swres, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.0; therefore, all reported coca:IA-flats are represented in terms of effect sizes. All of the fixed effects were significant predictors of math and science achievement. iligher achieving eighth grade students report higher levels of locus of control, are more Rely attend college in the &cure, are male, are of high SES backgrounds, had higher levels of prior achievement, and tend not to be members of minority grows. The advantage of using 1-11,M, as opposed to OLS techniques, is that one also can model school-level variables on the intercept (mean achievement) and the LD/non LD slope differential The gamma coefficients should be interpreted as additive effects, just as they would be interpreted in a more traditional multiple regression model. The top section of Table 3 reveals that math and science achievement is higher in schools with higher attendance rates, and is lower in schools where student safety is a problem. Recall that in the present study, rather than examining the difference between LD students' expected and actual achievement, the I-ILM model allows us to compare the differences within each school between the actual performance of LD students and non LD students. This is an important distinction. The use of HLM specifically allows us to examine the relationships between school-level variables and the differences in math and science performance between LID and non LD students. Thus the results may suggest school-level variables which are predictive of why LD students do not do as well fit math and science as non LD students. The results reveal that on average, LD students score 0.70 SD lower in math and 0.58 SD lower in science than non LD students across schools. However, in math, when the students do not experience a transition until at least the ninth grade, the difference in achievement between LD and non LD students is vltually zero (since the value of .69 SD for no transition until at least grade nine and the value of -.70 SD for the average LI) achievement difference virtually cancel each other out, since they add to -.01 SD); for science, the LD students still do not do as well as the non LI) students, but the differential on average is lower (.58 SD -.46 SD = .12 SD) Therefore, after controlling for other variables, the difference in science achievement between LD and non LD students is lowered from .58 SD to only .12 SD for students who do not make a transition until at least the ninth grade. In addition, when students do experience a transition in grades six or seven, students' perceptions of higher quality teaching are related to greater achievement in math."}, {"section_title": "Explained Variance", "text": "The present IILM models do not include an exhaustive set of variables which might account for between school variance in achievement.

By comparing variances from the unconditional HLM models (with no predictors) to the final models, I determined that the full models explained 40% of the variance that occurred between schools in math, and 30% of the variance that occurred between schools in science. By comparing variances for the LD/non LD slope, I determined that the full model for math explained 43% of the variance in the LD/non LD achievement gap between schools, and the model for science explained 50% of the variance in the science achievement gap.6"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "While research clearly has identified the tranktion from elementary to middle level schools as a tumultuous and difficult period in the lives of early adolescents (cf, Eccles & Midgley, 1989), studies have failed to examine the relationships between school-type and academic achievement for LD students during adolescence. The results of the present study demonstrate that achievement differences in math and science between LD and non LD eighth grade adolescents are much smaller in schools where students do not experience a transition until at least the ninth grade."}, {"section_title": "Why Do LD Students Do Better in Non-Transition Schools?", "text": "There are a number of reasons why LD students may do better in school when they do not experience a transition during early adolescence. Research conducted during the past decade clearly indicates that a school transition is often a troublesome time for adolescents, often having enduring negative effects on achievement, motivation, and aspirations (Anderman & Maehr, 1994;Eccles & Midgley, 1989;Simmons & Blyth, 1987). The range of psychological, social, and academic problems that LD students have to contend with during this stage of development may make them even more vulnerable to the effects of such transitions (e.g., Deci & Chandler, 1986;Swanson, 1987). Consequently, when the early adolescent has to manage both a difficult school transition and a learning disability, the student may suffer more extensive achievement decrements. In contrast, when students attend schools which do not have a transition until at least the ninth grade, LD students do not have to contend with the added pressure of this transition. As other researchers have found (e.g., Simmons & Blyth, 1987), the absence of a school transition may be tied to higher levels of motivation and achievement. Results of the present study corroborate this finding for math and science achievement. It is important to note that there is nothing magical about the time when the middle school transition occurs; rather, research has shown that schools with grades 5-7, 6-8, or 7-9 structrzes often engage in practices which are highly antithetical to the psychological needs of early adolescents (Eccles & Midgley, 1989). For example, these schools tend to have highly structured environments, to use a lot of between-class ability grouping, and to offer students few opportunities to do creative, challenging, and meaningful academic tasks (Anderman & Maehr, 1994;Eccles & Midgley, 1989). Adolescents experience these changes in school environments at a developmentally crucial period --a time when adolescents need to experience autonomy, independence, creativity, and a sense of belonging (Eccles et aL, 1993). The transition from the elementary school environment to the mole impersonal middle school is difficult for all adolescents; however, results of the present study suggest that it may be a particularly difficult period for students who also experience learning disabilities. Future studies should identify the specific school practices which lead to higher levels of achievement for LD students in school districts where there is no school transition. In addition, researchers need to identify larger samples of LD students within schools than was possiole in the present study."}, {"section_title": "Judgins the Effects", "text": "The reported effect sizes for the LD/non L13 differential in achievement are strong. By using the effect size metric, it is possible to compare the effect sizes in one study to those in another. When one examines various meta-analyses, it is evident that effect sizes of 0.69 for math and 0.46 for science (for LD students in schools with no transition until at least the ninth grade) found in the present study are quite strong. For example, Weinstein and his colleagues (Weinstein, Boulanger, & Walberg, 1982) reviewed innovative science curricula and described an overall effect size of 0.31 as a \"rnoderate\" effect. Shymansky and his colleagues (Shymansky, Kyle, & Alport, 1983) also reviewed science curricula and described an effect size of 0.43 as a \"valued\" effect. In comparisons of modem and traditional math curricula, Athappilly and colleagues (Athappilly, Smidchens, & Kofel, 1983) interpret an overall effect size of 0.24 as \"beneficial\" The Use of HELM The use of multilevel techniques such as HLM has been absent from the LD literature. Although other studies have documented the lower achievement of LD students, studies to date have not controlled for student level characteristics such as gender, grades, and SES, while simultaneously examining the effects of contextual variables on LD students' achievement. There are of course certain limitations to HLM. For example, it is difficult to use HLM with small samples of students. In addition, results of the present study do not indicate the specific mechanisms involved in producing this achievement differential Indeed, the purpose of the present study was not to specifically identify practices that may lead to higher achievement. Nevertheless, results of the present study do indicate that the \"problem\" of LD students not performing as well in math and science during adolescence may not be universal --different school experiences during early adolescence may lead to better achievement for some LD students. Note. All coefficients presented are standardized (effect sizes). For LD, 1 = LD, 0 = non LD; for gender, 1 = female, 0 = male; for minority status, 1 = minority, 0 = non minority; for plans to attend college, 1 = does plan to attend, 0 = does not plan to attend;all school-level transition variables are coded 1 = student had this transition, 0 = did not have this transition. ib "}]
