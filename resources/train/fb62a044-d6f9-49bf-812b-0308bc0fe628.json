[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The architecture of the Western Andes is remarkably constant between southern Peru and northern Chile.

Although this feature has been mentioned in several previous studies, no effort has been made yet to describe and explain this peculiar morphology of the Western Central Andean forearc.

Nevertheless, whether or not these ruptures were able to propagate through the Arica Bend has remained a matter of debate (Hayes et al., 2014 ). It appears, in fact, that the plate interface at the Arica Bend has not experienced any historical mega-thrust earthquake (Dorbath et al., 1990) and that this particular segment generally has experienced a low seismicity. Moreover, as mentioned above, the corresponding coastal area has undergone no measurable Quaternary rock uplift, in contrast to the adjacent coastal regions north and south of it (Fig.2 ).\nCrustal deformation in response to seismic cycles can be accomplished through an elastic or viscoelastic mechanism (e.g. Savage, 1983; Li et al., 2015) . These end-member scenarios have been useful for studies addressing short timescales spanning several hundreds of years, when coseismic rebound equalizes interseismic deformation, whereas at the Myrscale, re-iterated small amounts of permanent deformation need to be accommodated by long-lived brittle structures (King et al., 1988) . Throughout the manuscript we will use the term \"long-term coupling\" to refer to the fraction of convergence that is accommodated by permanent deformation within the forearc. A number of authors (Audin et al., 2008; Loveless et al., 2010; Victor et al., 2011; Binnie et al., 2016) showed that permanent deformation in response to subduction earthquakes can be observed in the Coastal Cordillera, and that the faults accommodating this deformation have most likely been active since late Neogene-Quaternary time. In addition, Melnick (2016) showed that Myr-long uplift of the Coastal Cordillera of both southern Peru and northern Chile might be linked with the occurrence of megathrust earthquakes straddling depth levels\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Accordingly, these authors seem to suggest that the deformation of the coastal range might constitute the surface expression of processes acting at the plate interface.\nIn this paper, we test the hypothesis of whether the aforementioned along-strike differences in coastal uplift and seismicity could be related to characteristics of the subduction zone or the individual plates, such as: (i) the topography of the subducting plate (Hampel, 2002; Kukowski & Oncken, 2006; Contreras-Reyes & Carrizo, 2011) , (ii) the obliquity of subduction (Liu et al., 1995; Hampel et al., 2004; Audin et al., 2008) , (iii) the curvature of the margin (Bonnardot et al., 2008; Boutelier & Oncken, 2010) , or alternatively (iv) along-strike differences in trench sedimentation and related friction at the plate interface (Lamb & Davis, 2003; von Huene & Ranero, 2003; Clift & Vannucchi, 2004; Oncken et al., 2006) . We will show (see discussion) that hypotheses (i), (ii) and (iii), which have already been discussed in the articles cited above, do not effectively explain the along-strike differences in long-term coupling and coastal uplift observed along the Arica Bend. We therefore investigate the validity of hypothesis (iv), concerning possible feedback mechanisms between trench sedimentation, seismic coupling and crustal deformation at a smaller time and spatial scale than has previously been done (Lamb & Davis, 2003) . In particular, we will illustrate that the supply of sediment to the Pacific Ocean near Arica has been larger than in the sections to the north and south for the past tens of millions of years.\nThis observation, contextualized in the growing subduction curvature, will allow us to develop a conceptual model that may explain the occurrence of a local decrease in seismic coupling ratio and, hence, the absence of crustal deformation and surface uplift in the coastal region of Arica during the past millions of years. This work, in summary, represents a first attempt to address this poorly understood problem and relies on the compilation and reinterpretation of existing stratigraphic and geodynamic data and new mapping and sedimentological data.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

West of the Coastal Cordillera of southern Peru, between 16.25\u00b0-17.15\u00b0S, an up to 500 m-thick late Oligocene to early Pliocene sedimentary suite has been referred to as the Camana formation (Alv\u00e1n & von Eynatten, 2014) (Fig.3a) . These deltaic and marine sediments, sourced mostly in the Coastal Cordillera, constitute the time-equivalent unit of the Moquegua C, Huaylillas and Moquegua D formations that are located in the Central Depression at the same latitude. South of 17.15\u00b0S, the only documented deposits west of the Coastal Cordillera are the so-called \"rasas\" (uplifted Quaternary marine terraces) (Fig.3c) (Ortlieb, 1996; Regard et al., 2010) . At the Arica Bend (18.3\u00b0S), Kober et al. (2006) postulated that the system feeding the 17-11 to possibly 8 Ma-old El Diablo conglomerates (Von Rotz et al., 2005) has been open to the ocean throughout the depositional time of this unit (Fig.3b) . This situation thus contrasts with the locations north and south of the Arica Bend, where most of the clastic suite was retained by the Coastal Cordillera (Fig.3) , as documented onlap relationships show (Schlunegger et al., 2010; Nester & Jordan, 2012) . The uplift of the Coastal Cordillera commenced at ca. 25 Ma, as inferred from the stratigraphy of its eastern flank (W\u00f6rner et al., 2002) , and continued with rates in the order of 0.2 mm/y during late Neogene-Quaternary time, as the morphology of its western flank suggests (Regard et al., 2010; Melnick, 2016) . Indeed, these authors have shown that the steep coastal scarp and perched \"rasas\" are the result of wave erosion on an actively uplifting coast, modulated by sea-level oscillations.\nAlong the entire Western Central Andean forearc, volcanoclastic sedimentation was followed by regional monoclinal warping and canyon incision, during the late Miocene uplift of the western margin of the Altiplano (W\u00f6rner et al., 2002; Far\u00edas et al., 2005; von Rotz et al., 2005; Schildgen et al., 2007; Thouret et al., 2007; Charrier et al., 2013; Jordan et al., 2014; Armiijo et al., 2015) . Whether the geodynamic process driving this event is related to\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. mantle delamination or lower crustal flow is still a matter of debate Ghosh et al., 2006; Semp\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2006; Hartley et al., 2007; Garzione et al., 2007; Garzione et al., 2008; Garzione et al., 2014) . However, it seems that this phase of monoclinal warping of the western Andean margin was rooted, and thus linked, to geodynamic processes within the domain of the Altiplano Plateau (Barnes et al., 2012; Whipple and Gasparini, 2014) , causing a widespread uplift across the Central Andes. This phase of uplift and monoclinal warping might also have initiated the incision of the modern >500-m-deep valleys (e.g. Lluta, Azapa, Camarones, Caplina, Locumba) due to steepening of the forearc (W\u00f6rner et al., 2002; Kober et al., 2006; Schlunegger et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda et al., 2011) . Channel incision might have also been favoured by a slightly wetter phase during the Pliocene through larger runoff of the Andean streams (Ehlers and Poulsen, 2009; Jordan et al., 2014; Armijo et al., 2015) . It is important to note, however, that the mentioned large-scale warping of the forearc has not been directly linked with processes operating at the interface between the oceanic Nazca plate and the continental South American plate, nor with the evolution of the Coastal Cordillera, on which this work is focused.\nFollowing monoclinal warping and canyon incision, the landscape of the Arica region was sealed by the deposition of the Lauca-Perez ignimbrite at 2.7 Ma (W\u00f6rner et al., 2000; W\u00f6rner et al., 2002; Garcia & H\u00e9rail, 2005) , which constitutes a relevant marker horizon for setting the base-level at that time. The occurrence of this unit at the bottom of the modern Lluta Valley indicates indeed that no net incision has affected this area since the time of deposition.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Garcia et al., 2011 ) document E-W compression in the northern Chilean Precordillera due to plate convergence.\nThe Central Andes underwent a total shortening of 250-300 km , which was accommodated mostly by fold and thrust deformation on the eastern flank of the orogen (Mcquarrie et al., 2002) . In contrast, the Western Central Andean forearc accommodated no more than 3 km of total shortening since Oligocene time (Victor et al., 2004) and little or no shortening after ~10 Ma (Hartley et al., 2000; Schildgen et al., 2007; Thouret et al., 2007) . Consistent with such a small amount of shortening, the margin-parallel compressive structures in the subaerial forearc are restricted to the Precordillera and limited in both extent and throw. Nevertheless, Armijo et al. (2015) collectively described these features as the West Andean Thrust and considered it as a relatively continuous feature along the entire Peru-Chile forearc.\nA number of authors have described the kinematics of portions of the Coastal Cordillera, such as (i) the Chololo Fault System near Ilo in southern Peru (Audin et al., 2008) , (ii) the Atajana and Pisagua faults between Camarones river and the city of Iquique and (iii) Salar del Carmen fault at 23\u00b0S (Loveless et al., 2010) . In these localities, faults have accommodated permanent deformation within the Coastal Cordillera throughout multiple seismic cycles, and various mechanisms such as (i) earthquake slip segmentation (Audin et al., 2008) , (ii) uplift segmentation (Ortlieb, 1996; Roperch et al., 2006) , (iii) lower plate thickening and (iv) upper plate extension in response to underplating (Hartley et al., 2000) have been proposed to explain their kinematics.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. . This methodology infers that the pediplain has constituted a gently dipping topographic ramp prior to dissection (Kober et al., 2006) , which started around 10 Ma and became regionally relevant between 9 and 6 Ma (Hoke et al., 2007; Schildgen et al., 2007; Thouret et al., 2007; Schildgen et al., 2009; Jordan et al., 2014) . This latter surface was reconstructed within a Geographic Information System environment where each cell was assigned the maximal elevation value encountered within a 7.5-km-diameter circular window.\nNote that the width of the moving window was selected in order to allow the interpolation of the surface even across the broadest canyons. We then clipped the obtained volume to 4 macro-catchments, referred here to the Tambo, Ilo, Arica Bend, and Tana sectors (Table 1) .\nEach macro-catchment represents a cluster of all the catchments that have supplied their sediments to the same along-strike segment, according to the configuration of the submarine valleys ( Fig.1) . We infer that all material that would backfill the current canyons of the forearc has been supplied to the ocean throughout the past ca. 10 Myr, and that this supply of sediment occurred at the same time north of the bend, at the Arica Bend itself and south of it.\nWe additionally acknowledge that the interpolation method might yield an overestimation of the eroded volumes. However, because the uncertainties do not vary along-strike, the interpretation, which mainly relies on the relative pattern of inferred sediment flux, will not substantially be biased by this approach. In order to estimate a relative uncertainty on these values, we also re-iterated the surface interpolation and changed the radius of the sampling window accordingly (Table 1) . We then calculated the standard deviation of all estimates in order to assess the sensitivity of the resulting pattern with respect to the sampling window size.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The E-W trending features are instead considered as reverse faults that have accommodated orocline bending (Allmendinger et al., 2005a) as mentioned above.\nThe flat topography of the 50-km-long coastal stretch immediately north of Arica (Fig.4d) shows no surface expressions of deformation, unlike the other mentioned coastal areas north and south of it.\nThe topography of the Precordillera in southern Peru shows several NW-SE oriented lineaments that parallel the strike of the orogeny (Fig.4b) . Among all these features, the Incapuquio Fault System (Jacay et al., 2002; David, 2007) has been described as an active left-lateral lithospheric-scale structure that has accommodated anti-clockwise rotation of the southern Peruvian forearc due to orocline bending since Oligocene times . We therefore consider all the analogous mapped faults to follow the same large-scale kinematics.\nThe easternmost portion of the Central Depression inland from Arica is cut by the structures of the Oxaya Anticline (W\u00f6rner et al., 2002) , and by the Ausipar and CopaquillaTignamar thrust systems (David, 2007) (Fig.4d) . These structures, which where active before ~10 Ma, accommodated a small amount of forearc shortening and steepening (Hartley et al., 2000; W\u00f6rner et al., 2002; Zeilinger et al., 2005) . In a similar structural position, but farther northwest ( Fig.4c) and south ( Fig.4g/i) , the eastern border of the Central Depression is now uplifted to elevations higher than the Coastal Cordillera and cut by several trench-parallel blind faults. We consider these features as analogous to the compressive flexures that have accommodated small amounts of shortening throughout the Miocene (Garcia et al., 2011) and that are possibly still active (Hall et al., 2012) , which is also consistent with the recent higher-than-average seismic activity in the area (Fig.4g/i) \nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nAt a smaller scale, between the Azapa and Tana Rivers, new mapping on orthophotos reveals that low-order NW-oriented intermittent channels are sharply deviated by 90\u00b0 within a few meters, or abruptly terminate, where they have been captured by NW-SE-oriented structures ( Fig.5b/d ). This pattern points to a tectonic control where the drainage network of low-order channels has been preferentially oriented and reorganized along minor faults.\nMoreover, the propagation of debris-flow fans terminates where the slope has been locally inverted in response to compressive flexuring (Fig.5c ). These commonly bivergent faults have most likely been formed through a combination of interseismic and coseismic permanent deformation, which are considered to accommodate the slip deficit (Loveless et al., 2009; Aron et al., 2013) .\nThis article is protected by copyright.

(2015) indeed suggest that the Camana formation was predominantly sourced from the Coastal Cordillera itself throughout its depositional time. An exception is represented by the uppermost late Miocene-Pliocene Camana B unit, which appears to share the source with the continental Moquegua D formation, where the material was derived from the Western Cordillera.\nIn contrast to what we observe north and south of the bend, Kober et al. (2006) suggested that the coastal segment of the Arica Bend has operated as an open drainage system at least since the beginning of the Miocene. These authors related this to the absence of a sedimentary barrier (Fig.3b) . We therefore infer that during the Miocene, larger volumes of sediments were supplied from the Arica Bend to the ocean compared to the adjacent coastal regions north and south of it.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

This pattern is linked to the concave shape of the forearc, which conveys six major channels (Sama, Caplina, Lluta, Azapa, Vitor and Camarones) and their loads towards the Arica Bend (Fig.1) Fig.6 ). The low value obtained for the Tana catchment is consistent with the remarkably shallower incision of its main channel (Tana river) in the Central Depression, which also seems to confirm the validity of our approach. Moreover, KirkLawlor et al. (2013) have shown that the Tana river system has been able to breach through the Coastal Cordillera only after 3.5 Ma. Between the Tana canyon and the mouth of the Loa river ( Fig.1) , the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile reaches its highest elevation, and the neighboring Central Depression has accumulated sediments also during the time when the other segments of the Western Central Andean forearc were affected by incision Armijo et al., 2015) .\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Based on seismic surveys within the area, Coulbourn & Moberly (1977) and Gonz\u00e1lez (1989) showed that these wedge-top basins are bound by the continental scarp and by structural highs, which locally invert the west-dipping slope, thereby forming accommodation space. According to the same authors, the thickest sediment fill of the PeruChile submarine forearc is found in the Arica Basin, where the sedimentary pile has been estimated to reach thicknesses between 1500 to 4000 m (Coulbourn & Moberly, 1977; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1989) . The age of these offshore deposits is unknown, but the presence of a sedimentary pile with large thicknesses seems to corroborate our findings that sediment supply to the Pacific Ocean at the Arica Bend has been larger during most of the time.\nAlthough the along-strike continuity of these three basins is poorly constrained, 2D\nreconstructions provided by Coulbourn & Moberly (1977) imply that the centers of both the Arequipa and Iquique Basins are characterized by topographic lows, denoting an underfilled stage, while the deposits in the Arica Basin overlap the seaward structural high, which indicates an overfilled stage. Based on these observations, we infer that the postulated pattern of along-strike sediment supply might have not been altered by the mentioned offshore forearc basins. We emphasize, however, that because the age of these forearc basins remains unknown, we cannot constrain the chronological framework of this observation nor can we confirm the rates at which this material has been supplied.\nVon Huene et al. (1999) observed that in northern Chile submarine sedimentation does not occur exclusively in the aforementioned basins. Accordingly, the material deposited between and beyond the basins would constitute an unstable surficial blanket that contributes to the occurrence of mass-wasting processes, such as turbidity currents and slumping. In this regard, the present bathymetry of the Arica Bend constrains the path of the submarine sediment transport processes (Fig.1) . As nearly all major submarine channels between Sama\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nand Camarones (Fig.1 ) converge towards the same trench segment (offshore Arica), the large majority of the material mobilized through submarine mass-wasting processes, or supplied from the onshore streams in this region, would have eventually contributed to trench sedimentation offshore of Arica. In summary, whether the sediments have been directly deposited in the trench after overfilling the offshore basin, or supplied through mass-wasting, the trench of the Arica Bend may have received significantly larger volumes of sediment relative to the adjacent segments to the north and to the south.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Schlunegger (2011) , is expected to deform either through stable sliding or tilting, excluding internal thickening through thrusting and/or plastic deformation. In such a state, the taper angle depends on the shear stresses at the plate interface, the dip angle of the d\u00e9collement horizon and the mechanical strength of the rocks within the wedge. While the dip angle of the Nazca plate does not vary between Ilo and Iquique (Cahill & Isacks, 1992; Maksymowycz, 2015) , the offshore topographic slope is >1\u00b0 steeper in northern Chile and 0.5\u00b0 steeper in southern Peru than at the Arica Bend ( Fig.2; Maksymowicz, 2015) . This implies that the basal friction needed to sustain the supercritical wedge is lower at the Arica Bend than north and south of it. In the following paragraphs we examine which processes might have induced such an anomaly of interplate friction and coastal uplift.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Besides, a very high seismic coupling is also inferred for the segment north of the Arica Bend, offshore of Ilo (e.g. Li et al., 2015) , where no seamounts are being subducted. Finally, subduction of topographic features are thought to exert only a transient effect on seismic coupling (Maksymowicz, 2015) , whereas we infer a Myr-long low-coupling anomaly.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. correspond with those inferred from the models. In particular, both models predict stress patterns within a scale at least one magnitude larger than observed there, both in space and time. Morover, as already pointed out above, the symmetry of the oceanward concavity is ca.\n150 km offset towards the south of the Arica Bend (Fig.1, 6 ), which suggests that the current stress pattern induced by the margin curvature may not be linked to today's morphology of the Arica Bend. Because we observe relative subsidence at the Arica Bend, however, we would favor the Bonnardot et al. (2008) model, although the structures that should accommodate the predicted extensional regime have not been observed yet at the surface, and no geophysical data is available to assess their occurrence below the sediments at the Arica Bend.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nIn light of these observations, we anticipate that the oceanward concavity of the margin may have exerted a significant role in initiating the tectono-geomorphic evolution of the Arica Bend, but we expect an alternative mechanism to dominate the most recent history of this feature. We justify this approach because the margin concavity of the central Andes has been migrating and changing its radius through time as a function of the shifts in convergence rate and obliquity (McQuarrie, 2002) , until it eventually reached its present setting at roughly 15 Ma (Jordan et al., 2001; McQuarrie, 2002; Roperch et al., 2006) .\nTherefore the subduction curvature constitutes a variable, rather than a constant in the longterm shaping of the Arica Bend.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We therefore consider this long-lasting trench sedimentation pattern as a good candidate to explain the observed long-term low coupling as discussed in the next section.\nWe acknowledge that estimates of the current Peru-Chile trench fill published by Schweller et al. (1981) show a pattern of trench sedimentation that contrasts with our inferences, where sediment fill is most abundant offshore the Oco\u00f1a and Camana rivers in southern Peru (16.5-17\u00b0S), decreases towards the Arica Bend and becomes negligible in northern Chile (Fig.6) . Nevertheless, the trench segment offshore the Oco\u00f1a River is also the location where the Nazca Fault Zone is in subduction ( Arequipa earthquake to confirm their initial interpretation.\nNote also that data about the current trench fill cannot be used to exclude the occurrence of high trench sedimentation during the Mio-Pliocene time. In this context, it must be considered that as result of >20 Myr-long subduction processes, all sediments deposited during Mio-Pliocene times might already have been dragged into the plate interface, and that the current trench fill may represent the material that has been deposited throughout the Quaternary only. Schweller et al. (1981) , indeed, proposed that under the current convergence rate of ~10 cm/y, the modern abundant trench fill south of 33\u00b0S in southern Chile might be younger than 1 Ma. At the Arica Bend, the minimum plateconvergence rate throughout Mio-Pliocene time has been 7 cm/y (Jordan et al., 2001) , which integrated over 20 Myr, yields a total of 1400 km northeastward motion of the Nazca plate\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nrelative to the South American plate. This motion has been partly compensated by a maximum of 300 km of total Andean shortening and a maximum of 60 km eastward margin retreat due to subduction erosion during the same time-span (Kukowski & Oncken, 2006) . The remaining ~1000 km of Mio-Pliocene plate convergence must have been accommodated by subduction of the Nazca plate below South America. With these calculations, we emphasize that the current trench-fill data might not be appropriate to extrapolate paleo-sedimentation patterns older than Quaternary time in the Peru-Chile setting.\nThe general lack of data about the residence time of trench sediments, however, hinders any further constraints on these inferences.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\ndeformation, sedimentation and paleoclimate in the Western Central Andes have been proposed (Hartley, 2005) , Lamb & Davis's idea (2003) that trench sedimentation might strongly affect seismic coupling remains valid (e.g. Contreras-Reyes & Carrizo, 2011) .\nHere, we propose that if trench sedimentation influences seismic coupling, then it must affect the deformation pattern of the Coastal Cordillera, which sits on the landward termination of the currently locked zone. Accordingly, we interpret the Coastal Cordillera to represent a trench-parallel upper-crustal wave front that expresses the degree to which the plate interface has been locked. This wave would then show a larger amplitude (higher mean elevation, Fig.6 ) where the coupling is stronger, possibly in response to sediment starvation in the trench ( Fig.7a ; Lamb & Davis, 2003) , while the opposite would be inferred where the subduction channel has been thickened and lubricated by a larger sediment supply (i.e., the Arica Bend, Fig.7b ). However, it remains unclear whether a larger sediment supply, in a relative sense, would be the cause of the low long-term coupling between the subducting and overriding plates, or the response of the low coastal uplift, which would favor the sediments reaching the ocean as discussed above. Therefore, we favor a scenario where the growing seaward concavity of the margin might have served as the initiator of what could be considered as a \"chicken and egg\" problem. In the following sections we propose a three-step temporal and mechanical model for the evolution of the Arica Bend.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In this model, the stress-pattern induced by the growing curvature would have led to the formation of a funnel-shaped forearc (which we still observe today), in which the flux of erosional products generated by the growth of the Andean orogeny would be concentrated into the subsiding Arica Bend. Bend was not closing the drainage system (Fig.7b, 8b) , and where long-lasting sediment discharge to the trench could have maintained the interplate friction at relatively-low levels, thereby decelerating, or inhibiting lower-crust shortening and coastal uplift.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

However, we do also consider that endorheic drainage south of the Arica Bend, paired with partially closed drainage north of it and an open drainage at the bend itself (Fig.8b) would have offered favorable conditions for amplifying the initiated deformational pattern.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Since at least the late Oligocene, the uplift of the Coastal Cordillera has formed accommodation space for a late Oligocene-Miocene period of continental sedimentation (Armijo et al, 2015 and references therein) . In this time volcanoclastic alluvial and fluvial fans, pyroclastic mass-flows and fluvio-lacustrine sediments sourced in the uplifting Western Cordillera were deposited in the Central Depression east of the Coastal Cordillera, burying the basement with an unconformity (Tosdal et al., 1984; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003; Armijo et al., 2015) . The surface of these deposits forms the modern pediplains, or pampas, that extend laterally over hundreds of kilometers along strike and that link the Coastal Cordillera to the Precordillera. This latter domain represents an along-strike 20-30 km-wide range mostly formed of abandoned eroded volcanic edifices.\nDespite similarities in their stratigraphic architecture, the categorization of the units in the Central Depression has been different on either side of the Arica Bend. The related units have been referred to as: Azapa (25-23 Ma), and El Diablo (17-11 Ma) formations in northern Chile, south of Arica (W\u00f6rner et al., 2002; Pinto et al., 2004; von Rotz et al., 2005; Wotzlaw et al., 2011; Jordan et al., 2014) and Moquegua C (34-25 Ma), and Moquegua D (17-11 or possibly 8 Ma) formations in southern Peru, north of Arica Decou et al., 2011; Decou et al., 2013) .\nThe continental suite is generally 1100 m thick on both sides of the bend. It reaches a maximum thickness of ca. 1800 m below the Pampa del Tamarugal in northern Chile ( Fig.1 ) (Hartley et al., 2000; Nester & Jordan, 2012) , from where it thins to a few hundreds of meters"}, {"section_title": "Structures", "text": "The modern structures of the Western Central Andean forearc are the expression of lithospheric and crustal scale long-lived processes linked to two motion regimes: (i) the bending of the Bolivian Orocline and (ii) the subduction of the Nazca beneath the South American plate. Most of the orocline bending occurred between 40-15 Ma and might still be active nowadays (Allmendinger et al., 2005b) , whereas subduction has been active since late Cretaceous time (e.g. Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000) .\nThe result of Myr-long subduction and orocline bending is the formation of a seaward-concave margin, where plates converge perpendicularly at the hinge of the concavity and obliquely north and south of it (Fig.1) . Sinistral strike-slip faulting, as is the case for the Incapuquio Fault System in the Precordillera north of 18\u00b0S (Jacay et al., 2002; David, 2007) , accommodated counterclockwise rotation of the northern limb. Clockwise rotation was instead accommodated by dextral strike-slip faulting, as has been the case for the Atacama Fault System in the Coastal Cordillera south of 22\u00b0S (e.g. Brown et al., 1983; . The segment of the forearc between ca. 18\u00b0-22\u00b0S has been ascribed to the structural inner arc of the Bolivian Orocline (Gephart, 1984; Roperch et al., 2006; and is generally characterized by dip-slip structures. Here it is important to note that the apex of the coastline bend, where Arica is located, is ~150 km offset north of the apex of the margin and of the orocline concavity (Fig.1) . The forearc structures between 18\u00b0-22\u00b0S have been shown to accommodate both N-S and E-W shortening: the Ataja\u00f1a and Pisagua faults in the Coastal Cordillera record Neogene-Quaternary N-S compression due to orocline bending.

The coastal area of southern Peru presents several NE-SW oriented faults (Fig.4a ). These features are up to 50 km long and restricted to the Coastal Cordillera, where they are homogeneously distributed. We relate them to the motion regime of the Chololo Fault System (Audin et al., 2008) because of similar extent, orientation and spatial distribution. This structure is a composite normalsinistral fault system that accommodated segmentation of uplift along the Coastal Cordillera since Oligocene time and trench-parallel extension of the upper crust in response to segmented slip at interplate depth since at least Quaternary time (Audin et al., 2008) .\nSouth of Arica, a nearly 90 km-long segment of the Coastal Cordillera has been cut by a suite of NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults (Fig.4f ). Although these features show crosscutting relationships, details regarding the relative chronologies and the slip directions cannot be precisely constrained because of multiple reactivations, causing a pattern that is difficult to decipher and has not been investigated so far.

In contrast to this picture, our estimates yield the highest value of sediment discharge at the Arica Bend, where the Coastal Cordillera is absent (Fig.6) . After changing the sampling window of the surface interpolation as a sensitivity test, we found that the calculated volumes do not change significantly for diameter sizes between 5 and 10 km (Table 1) . Indeed, although the standard deviation of the values can be up to 25%, depending on the chosen size of the sampling window, the ranking between the macro-catchments does not change.\nResults thus show that, from late Miocene onward, the largest volumes of sediment have been delivered to the Pacific Ocean at the Arica Bend, where the Coastal Cordillera is absent and no surface expression of past and/or current crustal deformation is present."}, {"section_title": "INTERPRETATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pattern of deformation in the forearc", "text": "As shown in Figure 4 , none of the deformation styles presented above seems to have perturbed the 50 km-wide flat coastal area north of Arica (Fig.4d ).

The high erodibility of this unit suggests indeed that, if the area had experienced tectonic perturbations since the time of deposition, the ignimbrite would have been removed through channel incision in case of relevant uplift, or alternatively buried by fluvial deposits in case of significant subsidence and related sedimentation. We thus consider that this particular transect has experienced neither deformation, nor uplift of regional relevance throughout the Quaternary, possibly stretching back to the Miocene, as already hypothesized by Kober et al. (2006) .\nAs also shown in Figure 4 , the portion of forearc between the coast of the Arica Bend and the trench is subject to exceptionally low seismicity, which seems to imply a lack of crustal deformation in the same forearc sector.

As introduced above, we interpret this Myr-long coastal uplift pattern as the topographic expression of the degree of long-term coupling at work along the margin. In particular, the differences in uplift and seismicity ( Fig.6 ) require a mechanism where the friction between the Nazca and South American plates is larger north and south of the Arica Bend than at the bend itself (Chlieh et al., 2011; B\u00e9jar-Pizarro et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015) . The presence of a low-friction anomaly at the Arica Bend is also consistent with the historically low seismic activity of this margin segment (Fig.4, 6 ), which has been related to a lower accumulation of stress in the corresponding segment of the plate-boundary (Chlieh et al., 2011; B\u00e9jar-Pizarro et al., 2013; M\u00e9tois et al., 2016) .

At the latitude of the Arica Bend, the Nazca plate hosts the Iquique Ridge (Fig.1, 6 ), which is a broad region with a shallow seafloor and several seamounts. The subduction of this buoyant swell is considered to have increased the friction at the plate interface along its entire extent (Contreras-Reyes & Carrizo, 2011 ) and more generally, subduction of such topographic features are commonly noted to drive increased uplift at the margin (e.g. Wipf et al., 2008) . Therefore, while the subduction of the buoyant Iquique Ridge might explain the high seismic coupling and large subduction erosion generally observed along the northernmost Chilean margin (Kukowski & Oncken, 2006) , it cannot be considered as a potential driver for the low long-term coupling that we infer at the plate interface of the Arica Bend.

The obliquity of convergence, here referred to as the angle of divergence from the margin-perpendicular, varies along the Peru-Chile trench (Fig.6) .

Offshore the area of low uplift and seismicity at the Arica Bend, obliquity is ~23\u00b0 (Fig.6) .

The thickness of the subduction channel strongly depends on sedimentation within the trench. Therefore, it is expected to be thin where sediment supply rates are low and thicker where the corresponding flux is larger. Moreover, this feature appears to have significant control on the frictional properties of the plate interface and the related seismic ruptures, as outlined by Ruff (1989) and Contreras-Reyes & Carrizo (2011) .\nAccording to these authors, a portion of a margin characterized by a relatively thick subduction channel is likely to be less locked than adjacent segments where corresponding thicknesses are low. The subduction of unconsolidated trench sediments should increase the pore-fluid pressure, inducing in turn a decrease in interplate friction (Dahlen et al., 1984) .

Most of this incision occurred roughly between 10\nMa and the Quaternary, when the trench offshore Arica received a larger volume of sediment than to the north and south, due to the funnel-shape of the forearc (Table 1 ; Fig.6, 8c ). We consider it likely that this along-strike sediment discharge pattern was able to maintain, and possibly amplify, the feedback mechanisms initiated in Late Oligocene times. As already discussed above, the area that lacks surface expressions of crustal deformation (the coast of the Arica Bend) is offset from the current point of orthogonal subduction and curvature apex of the margin (e.g. Fig.1, 6 ). This symmetry offset suggests that in recent times (i.e. Late\nNeogene-Quaternary) the stress pattern induced by the margin concavity did not affect the uplift pattern of the Coastal Cordillera, which might ultimately be the expression of the positive feedback mechanisms outlined above.\nStudies on modern trench-fill (Schweller et al., 1981; Fig.6) show that the discussed pattern of sediment supply to the trench must have changed sometimes during the Quaternary.
