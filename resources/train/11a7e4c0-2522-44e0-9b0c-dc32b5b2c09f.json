[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The resting brain dynamics self-organizes into a finite number of correlated patterns known as resting state networks (RSNs). It is well known that techniques like independent component analysis can separate the brain activity at rest to provide such RSNs, but the specific pattern of interaction between RSNs is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method to compute the information flow (IF) between different RSNs from resting state magnetic resonance imaging. After hemodynamic response function blind deconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that RSNs define regions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality in each RSN to next compute IF (estimated here in terms of Transfer Entropy) between the different RSNs by systematically increasing k (the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k = 1, this method is equivalent to computing IF using the average of all voxel activities in each RSN. For k \u2265 1 our method calculates the k-multivariate IF between the different RSNs. We find that the average IF among RSNs is dimension-dependent, increasing from k = 1 (i.e., the average voxels activity) up to a maximum occurring at k = 5 to finally decay to zero for k \u2265 10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to 5) is sufficient to describe the IF pattern between RSNs. Our method --addressing differences in IF between RSNs for any generic data --can be used for group comparison in health or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the interRSNs IF in a dataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to find that the most significant differences between AD and controls occurred for k = 2, in addition to AD showing increased IF w.r.t.\ncontrols. The spatial localization of the k = 2 component, within-RSNs, allows the characterization of IF differences between Alzheimer's and controls."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The overall brain dynamics generated at rest can be decomposed as a superposition of multiple activation patterns, the so-called Resting State Networks (RSNs) . Becoming a fundamental characteristic of brain function, RSNs are a pivotal element for understanding the dynamics and organization of the brain basal activity in health and disease [Raichle et al., 2001 , Fox et al., 2005 , Raichle and Mintum, 2006 , Raichle and Snyder, 2007 , Raichle, 2009 . RSNs emerge from the correlation in signal fluctuations across brain regions during resting state, a condition defined by the absence of goal-directed behavior or salient stimuli. Despite the simplicity of the context in which these brain activity patterns are generated, RSNs dynamics is rich and complex. Different RSNs have been associated to specific cognitive networks e.g., there are visual networks, sensory-motor networks, auditory networks, default mode networks, executive control networks, and some others (for further details see for instance [Beckmann et al., 2005] and references therein).\nCurrently, it is well-established that a number of techniques, like Region-Of-Interest approach (ROI; seed-based), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS), can decompose the resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) to provide such RSNs [Bell and Sejnowski, 1995 , Beckmann and Smith, 2003 , Beckmann et al., 2005 , McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004 , Zhang and Raichle, 2010 . Using these techniques, altered functional connectivity in specific RSNs has been described in brain pathological conditions such as in patients with deficit of consciousness after traumatic brain injury [Boveroux et al., 2010 , Noirhomme et al., 2010 , Heine et al., 2012 , Maki-Marttunen et al., 2013 , schizophrenia [Woodward et al., 2011, Karbasforoushan and Woodward, 2012] and epilepsy [Liao et al., 2010] . In the particular case of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the pathology we have addressed here, starting from the pioneer contribution showing alterations in fMRI [Li et al., 2002] , thereon it has been reported a decrease of functional connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN, a RSN related to memory function) and in the salience network at both early and advanced stages of the AD disease [Greicius et al., 2004 , Rombouts et al., 2005 , Binnewijzend et al., 2012 , Sheline and Raichle, 2013 .\nDespite this emphasis on specific networks, it is important to realize that, however, the RSNs functional-division into separate systems does not imply that the brain activity is composed of functional networks working in isolation [Damoiseaux et al., 2006] . Contrarily, the brain regions underlying the inter-RSNs relations have their independent organization and have a different function to the specific ones that each individual RSN has (for recent reviews see [Fornito et al., 2013] and [Smith et al., 2013] ). These interactions between brain regions belonging to different RSNs have been described by means of whole-brain connectivity analysis techniques like graph analysis [Sporns et al., 2004 , Ponten et al., 2007 , Stam and Reijneveld, 2007 , Bullmore and Sporns, 2009 , and more recently, where connectivity was also analyzed during different cognitive tasks conditions [McLaren et al, 2014] .\nHowever, the analysis and interpretation of information flow (IF) between the RSNs remains an open question and has given rise to two contrasting theories attempting to interpret the resting brain activity. The functional integration theory (for review, see [Zhang and Raichle, 2010] ) proposes that brain activity during resting-state requires the coordinated activity of all brain RSNs to support the reconstruction, analysis and simulation of experiences or possible scenarios to provide adaptive behavioral advantage. On the other hand, the functional segregation theory states that modality-specific mental activity (eg., image-or language-based thoughts) is related to functional disconnection between the brain networks active during rest [Delamillieure et. al., 2010] . Therefore, resting activity would be maintained by functionally segregated inner-oriented and sensory-related cognition and the respective intrinsic and extrinsic brain networks they depend on.\nThe question of how different RSNs speak to each other is particularly relevant as it has been reported the existence of disease-driven changes in functional connectivity between different brain networks [Sanz-Arigita et al., 2010 , Schoonheim et al., 2013 . Importantly, as the disease progresses responsible RSNs are in turn affected, and this gradual loss of functional connectivity within networks is accompanied by a loss of functional correlation between them [Brier et al., 2012] . This indicates that altered functional activity induced by a local dysfunction might influence the functioning of additional brain regions, leading to the spread of changes in brain activity beyond the network originally affected and in turn the whole-brain functional connectivity pattern [Sanz-Arigita et al., 2010] .\nHere we propose a new method to study RSNs inter-communication. The method is based on the inference of IF in terms of Transfer Entropy (TE) to study Directed Functional Connectivity (DFC) between RSNs 1 . We apply this method to AD (with the aim of showing one potential application, but remark that the method is general and can be applied to any other disease). The first step is to consider RSNs to function as spatial templates, i.e. masks, similar to the ones reported in [Beckmann et al., 2005] . Similar approaches, considering the RSNs masks rather the independent components per se, have been used before in previous work [Tagliazucchi et al., 2012; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Haimovici et al., 2013; Tagliazucchi et al., 2014] . Next, we extracted all the time-series of rs-fMRI activity belonging to each RSN. After hemodynamic response function (HRF) blind deconvolution of all activity signals, our method does not work out with the average of all voxel activities per RSN, rather it approximates the global RSN activity by a k-components signal obtained by Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The IF between regions is thus evaluated as the number of components k is varied, whilst the complexity of the model is controlled by statistical testing. The standard TE analysis is recovered when (i) no HRF deconvolution is made and (ii) just the first principal component is used to describe each RSN (which is equivalent to make the average over voxels within that RSN).\n1 For brain connectivity studies, there exist different approaches for DFC [Granger, 1969 , Schreiber, 2000 , Friston et al., 2003 , Penny et al., 2004 , Roebroeck et al., 2005 , Barnett et al., 2009 , Friston, 2011 , Bressler and Seth, 2011 , Friston, 2009 . One possibility for calculating DFC from fMRI time-series is Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), addressing how the activity in one brain area is affected by the activity in another area using explicit models of effective connectivity (for details see for instance [Friston et al., 2003 , Penny et al., 2004 ). Alternatively, data-driven approaches for DFC work directly with the time-series, and not any further assumption have to be taken, neither about the hemodynamic response, nor about the biophysics from individual neuron to Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) level. Two popular data-driven methods for calculating DFC are Granger causality (GC) [Granger, 1969] and transfer entropy (TE) [Schreiber, 2000] ; for the Gaussian approximation the two methods are equivalent [Barnett et al., 2009]. To show one potential application of this method, we apply it to a dataset of AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and compared the results of interRSNs communication with a group of healthy subjects. University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

We use TE to estimate IF from A to B and vice-versa; TE is equivalent to Granger Causality (GC) in the Gaussian case [Barnett et al., 2009] , which is the case considered here.

In particular, for both \u03b4=2 and \u03b4=3, we still found an increase of IF in AD w.r.t.\ncontrols, but that increment was not significant in any number of principal components (k).\nThus, only for \u03b4=1, the case we have considered here, the increment of IF occurring in AD was statistically significant (for both k=2 and k=3).\nIn order to evaluate the IF from A to B, we first calculate the IF from A to the ith-component of B, ie.,\nwhere H is the conditional Shannon entropy, evaluated over the empirical distribution of samples at hand under the assumption of gaussianity, see [Barnett et al, 2009] .

No statistically significant differences were found in the amount of variability between control and AD, indicating that the data representation in the different principal components were disease independent. Therefore, the reader should not be confused and be aware that differences in IF are not related to these is the same for control and AD: starting to increase from k = 1 up to the maximum at k = 5 to monotonically begin to decrease. Therefore we conclude that for dimensions bigger than k = 5, a higher dimension does not provide more IF. Statistically significant differences for the average IF between control and AD occurred for k = 2 and k = 3. Interestingly, the average inter-RSNs IF is higher in AD than in controls. confirmed that within all RSNs there existed an increase of the information for AD in both the outward and the inward directions.\nFinally, we performed a two-sample unpaired t-test to localize the differences between AD and control for the k = 2 component.

Table 4 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "RSNs are chiefly characterized by their universal emergence, meaning that, beyond individual subject differences, RSNs are ubiquitous in healthy brains. Whilst the emergence of RSNs in health is a well-known fact, how these RSNs speak to each other is not fully understood yet. In our approach, instead of applying ICA to each subject separately to get their specific RSNs, we used templates provided in [Beckmann et al., 2005] for all subjects. The use of the same templates for all the subjects is indeed assuming that the spatial structure of all RSNs is universal. Our main hypothesis here is that the breakdown of this assumption might differentiate healthy subjects and AD patients --but the same method can be applied to any other disease--and that searching for such differences might provide further insights about the We applied this methodology to AD datasets and compared these results to control. The interesting answer is that such assumption led --for the particular situation of AD--to differences in the information related to the second and third principal components and not to the first one (which is coincident with the average activity over all voxels per RSN). Notice that from eqs. (3) and (4) one can see that the TE is calculated univariate for the target and multivariate for the driver. Thus, when we say that AD vs. control differences are associated to k=2, we mean a multivariate driver having into account the two time series k=1 and k=2.\nTherefore, as long as the average time series of each ROI is concerned, no differences between the patterns of healthy and AD patients emerged. Performing a paired t-test to spatially localize the k = 2 component, we found the regions which were underlying those differences.\nAn important limitation of ROI analysis in MRI data is the huge number of voxels determining each brain region. In most cases, the average time series (across voxels at each time-point) or the first principal component is assumed to be the ROI representative (we verified that the average and the first principal components are equivalent on our data set); the connectivity analyses are then carried out using these regional representative signals. However, neither the average nor the 1st PCA are taking into account the predictive power of past value. Thus, relevant temporal information may be diluted when considering these signals.\nSome approaches have represented each ROI using more than one time series, either using PCA [Zhou et al., 2009] or cluster analysis [Sato et al., 2010] . The approach we are presenting here is rooted on principal component analysis and its novelty is based on two points: first, we preprocessed the time series corresponding to each individual voxel by HRF blind deconvolution and second, instead of fixing the number of components according to a prescribed fraction of the data variance, as it is usually done, we have analyzed IF as the number of components increases, including more details of the ROIs dynamics.\nUsing the RSNs spatial templates (masks) reported in [Beckmann et al., 2005] , we extracted different ROIs to approximate each RSN by a fixed multivariate dimension (k) found by PCA.\nNotice that the common approach of taking the average over all voxel activities belonging to each RSN corresponds to k = 1. Beyond-the-average interactions are captured by k \u2265 1.\nTherefore, our method can be considered as a generalization for the average activity approach.\nRecently, the point process analysis described in [Tagliazucchi et al., 2012] showed that the relevant information in resting-state fMRI can be obtained by looking into discrete events resulting in relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks. Following this idea, we have considered the preprocessed resting fMRI time-series to be spontaneous event-related and individuated point processes corresponding to signal fluctuations with a given signature, extracting a voxel-specific HRF to be used for deconvolution.\nWe want to remark that the use the HRF deconvolution, apart from being conceptually mandatory in our opinion, it is also crucial for our results. Indeed we repeated our analysis while omitting the deconvolution stage, and we found a clear different pattern of IF between RSNs. In particular, IF differences were only significant for k=1 and AD showed a decreased IF w.r.t. healthy subjects ( figure S3 ). We also verified that, in general, the use of HRF deconvolution increased the IF for all subjects in comparison to no deconvolution. Thus, if we had omitted the HRF deconvolution stage, we would have not observed the relevant role of the second and the third principal components in shaping the differences of IF in AD and controls.\nPrevious work has addressed DFC between the different RSNs; for instance, the authors in [Demirci et al., 2006] ICA-extracted the time-courses of spatially independent components and found differences in DFC between schizophrenia and control conditions. It is worth mentioning that a method for effective connectivity inference, combining PCA and GC, was proposed in [Zhou et al., 2009] . The main differences between our method (tailored to analyze the IF between RSNs) and the one developed in [Zhou et al., 2009] are the blind deconvolution with HRF and the fact that we use the number of components as a parameter to be systematically increased (up to finding statistically significant different causalities), and both driver and target ROIs are described with the same number of components. In [Zhou et al., 2009] , instead, all voxels in the activated brain regions were taken as target and the PCA analysis was applied only to the driver region and not to the target one.\nFollowing previous work extending the use of DFC to the multivariate situation [Barnett et al., 2009 , Deshpande et al., 2009 , Barrett et al., 2010 , we have applied here a multivariate DFC approach to the study of the interaction between RSNs. Specifically to AD, causal interactions among the different RSNs were addressed in [Liu et al., 2012 ] by a multivariate Granger causality. The authors found an increase in IF between RSNs in relation to the default mode network and the executive control one, which is in agreement with the increase of IF reported here, possibly suggesting compensatory processes in the brain networks underlying AD. Similarly and more recent, an increase of connectivity in the default mode network was found by other authors in [Liang et al., 2014] in amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment by using GC.\nThe main result of the present study is the finding that the AD condition had higher IF between RSNs in comparison to control. This is apparently in contradiction to a recent paper [Li et al., 2013] where a Bayesian network approach reported a general decrease in connectivity strength for AD. Moreover, the authors in [Li et al., 2013] found an increase in connectivity between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network when using the average voxels activity, that in our approach, this situation is equivalent to considering k=1. Here, if we apply the HRF deconvolution preprocessing, we find no significant differences between controls and AD at k=1; but, if no deconvolution is applied, k=1 for AD shows a significantly decreased IF w.r.t. healthy subjects, in fully agreement with [Li et al., 2013] . Moreover, for k=1 we find an increase of the interaction from the default mode network to the dorsal visual (left) network and this is also consistent with the findings in [Li et al, 2013] . It follows that the results in the paper [Li et al., 2013] are consistent with the application of our method when just one component is considered and the HRF deconvolution is omitted. Our findings suggest that in AD the second (and, to a lesser extent, the third) components of the signals within RSNs are responsible of the increased IF. Approximating each RSN by a single signal is not enough to put in evidence these phenomena.\nThe IF increase found in AD might have different causes; perhaps, due to a compensatory reorganization of brain circuits due to synaptic plasticity [Adams, 1991] , or due to the fact that AD patients might fail in ignoring irrelevant inputs when integrating information to performing particular cognitive tasks [Rodriguez et al., 1999] , or due the reduction in inhibitory modulatory influence across the whole-brain network in AD [Amieva et al., 2004 , Bentley et al., 2008 , Rytsar et al., 2011 , but the exact mechanism producing an increase of IF in AD needs for further investigation.\nThe small population size included in this study only allows for a limited interpretation of the details of connectivity changes between networks. However, a conservative approach to this analysis indicates that the IF implicated in sensory processing networks and the DMN is contrasts: in red, the figure shows the significant activity existing in AD but nonexistent in control. In blue, vice versa, differences which exist in control but not in AD. "}, {"section_title": "List of Tables:", "text": ""}]
